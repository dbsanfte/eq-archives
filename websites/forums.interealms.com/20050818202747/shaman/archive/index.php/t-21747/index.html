<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With so much discussion (much of it deservedly negative) over all the problems L65 non-raiders are encountering, I thought it would be nice to list the changes SOE has made post-Luclin that have improved the game noticeably for the L65 non-raider, whether by design or chance.<br />
<br />
First some explanations on the guidelines.  These are only changes applicable to the L65 non-raider, not lower level (e.g. LoY expansion is disqualified based on level) and they must not be changes that also benefit the raid player. For example, PoK books, while nice, did not benefit the non-raid player primarily vis a vis the raid player.  By this same token AA abilities, LDoN augs and spells wouldn't count either as they benefit both.  Only list things that made the game a more positive experience for the L65 non-raid player from which the raid player did not benefit significantly.  These are things for which SOE deserves praise and provides a blueprint of what can and should be done.  Notable non-mention: ornate armor due to the fact that its primary drop location is behind a flagged zone and raiders can (and do) make lots of plat selling it in the bazaar (i.e., they benefit from it even if they won't wear it).<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, here's what I've come up with so far:<br />
spell research:  Although only L60 and under spells, this was a huge boon to the L65 non-raid player as there are several spells of value that are difficult to get in other ways (malo, PE, AoDK come to mind).  I was skeptical at first but came to love this.<br />
The unlocking of several tier 2 and tier 3 zones in PoP.  An excellent start.<br />
LDoN hard gear: much nicer gear than is commonly available in the bazaar that can be earned by the L65 non-raid player but of little benefit to the raider who has much better.<br />
Single group quest access to Plane of Tactics: while I don't like flagged zones, at least providing an alternate means of access makes this zone closer to Howling Stones vice Sol Ro Tower for non-raider access.<br />
8th shawl: I can't remember if this was post-Luclin or not, but despite being majorly tedious this was a very nice item.  Raiders now have better so it's doubtful they would do this quest to actually wear the item.<br />
LDoN armor: again, very nice if you have the patience to slog through the points necessary to buy it.  Technically a raid player could benefit from this also but since the disparity is so great it is unlikely.<br />
<br />
What else am I missing?  Follow the guidelines and list more positive things post-Luclin specifically for the L65 non-raid player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Adding a few more &quot;8th shawl&quot; type quests would go a long way to giving non-raiders (and raiders if they wanted to) more things to do.<br />
<br />
I love the 8th shawl (and even coldain rings) concepts... but I didn't truly love the implementation... mainly the shawl... with the massive tradeskilling... plus collecting / buying drops... and possible failures and having to repeat a lot (I was truly nervous with all the combines on the 7th shawl... and after all the hours I spent on biles in GD for the 5th... I made them on the first time...  but I probably would have quit on a failure :)<br />
<br />
Put in a nice sword quest... as in really nice sword.    Put in an awesome shield quest.     Just a few more items... that start off really aweful... and work up to something finally that is really awesome.<br />
<br />
I think the Iksar quests were a step in the right direction... the cudgel quest is great for shamans... put in a race / class independant quest (like the shawl) that results in a great weapon... useful effect... etc...  <br />
<br />
Multiple Steps... Minimal Frustration... long time TOTAL... GREAT reward... there's a key to keeping casual questers happy.<br />
<br />
And choice is fine... there are better stat wise items out there than the 8th shawl... both from casual, raiding, and LDON encounters... but the combination of &quot;okay stats... FT 3... 20% buff focus&quot; is awesome for those who can't get a better &quot;package&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While I can appreciate the sentiment and the effort Izmaill, I dont think that this is going to be a very fruitfull discussion.  Why?<br />
<br />
Changes to the non raid game benefit everyone.  Spell research helped the raider and the non raider equally.  I have a cleric friend that is in a raid guild (5 to 6 days a week. 4+ hours at a time) that did not have RGC untill after it was made availible via research because her guild had quit hitting Ssra.  LDoN gives raiders something to do between raids and gives them more hp/effects to add to their already impressive collection, just as it helps beef up armors/stats of non raiders.<br />
<br />
I cant think of anything right now that has helped me ( as a non raider ) that has not helped or been usefull to my friends in raiding guilds.  And while I can think of changes to raiding content that doesn't help me, thats not what the thread is about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well for me it was all about the time sinks of travel that were addressed.  That opened the ability for the solo player or group to zip here and there for playing variety and to get crack and virtue.  Also the horses/lizzys maps, etc. Woot!<br />
<br />
Purdy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Changes to the non raid game benefit everyone.<br />
This is very true, and there is a reason for that. The reason is, there is very little content designed SOLELY for the non-raiding player. EQ is a game made up of different styles, events, components, things-to-do, whatever name you wish to call it. Raiding players take advantage of a larger portion of this &quot;game&quot; than non-raiding players. <br />
<br />
That being said, I would also disagree slightly that LoY shouldnt count as helping the L65 non-raider. There is a TON of great stuff in those zones, its not hard to farm, there are named &quot;mini-raids&quot; that drop GOOD stuff for the non-raider, especially in Nadox and Togrin Mines. Maybe its not the BEST stuff, but the events are really fun. But, time vs. reward, risk vs. reward, XP vs. reward, these are the things that tend to get in the way, for everyone, from the most hardcore 12-hour a day guys to the most casual 2 hours a week guys. <br />
<br />
One other thing Iz. I think this thread is a solid idea, but how about ADDING a positive to it, and SUGGEST new ways that SOE could help the non-raider. I will even get it started:<br />
<br />
1. Open up Sol Ro now, and the EPs eventually. Make them accesible with difficult (yet one-groupable) quests. Make those quests timesinks, maybe not on the same scale as a whoile guild backflagging a whole run, but similar. When OoW ships, BoT is gonna be empty except for folks farming loot. The XP will not hold up in the run from 65 to 70. EPs have MUCH better one-groupable XP, and gear that would be VERY nice for non-raiders that is also one-groupable. Time to let them in.<br />
<br />
2. Multiple paths to new spells. I don't care if its quests, AAs, research, vendor purchases (wanna pull some pp out of the game? Make the new spells buyable, but cost prohibitive, like 25K per. At least a person who doesnt go to the Raid zones where the spells drop has the option of farming pp to get them) whatever. But everyone has a right to MOST of his classes spells. Ancients should ONLY be slightly better versions of existing spells, not RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING like the new Canni (from what I hear, I dont have it)<br />
<br />
3. Re-itemization of older content to reflect the newer &quot;trends&quot; in the game. FBSS is totally worthless now. Why not put an AC 5, +5 all stats and resists, 28% haste belt in its place? Why not give the Ghoul Lord a better choice than SSoY and the King a better 2H than Mith? Lets spread folks out. Loot worth going after in MORE zones, so the folks with less time can actually go to some NEW places instead of the same old BoT or LDoN cause thats all they have time for and its just not worth it anywhere else. Droga was a good start, a great start actually, but you picked one of THE CRAPPIEST zones there is. Any zone you cannot get to Zone Out on a suicide run isnt going to attract people unless the loot and XP are AMAZINGLY better than anything else available (like Sol Ro would be, if opened).<br />
<br />
4. More progressive-quest gear. Sariss mentioned it earlier in this thread and he is 100% right. These types of quests would actually provide a fairly FUN way to consume time, knowing the end result is worth the effort. Even if you make the FINAL stage a Raid level war of some kind like the Coldain Ring and Shawl, make the step BEFORE that, the step the non-raider can get too, worthwhile. This would probably greatly reducce the gap, as well. 100 hps vs 150. FT3 vs FT5. +20 attack vs +40. But make the earlier stage accessible to one-group non-raiders, with the option of taking it to the next stage if they wanted. <br />
<br />
There are a lot more things. LDoN needs some work. The current aug system isnt going to hold up when OoW ships, and the camps will become ghost towns. There is going to need to be SOME form of buy-back or Recycle system put into effect, with new, bigger gear offered on the merchants. Gates is still a struggle. At LEAST put a Abysmal Sea book in PoK. Or even Natimbi. And make SOME spells drop outside the trials. Some people cannot get a full group together during their &quot;play-window&quot; and would like at least a CHANCE at a new spell off content doable by smaller groups of 4 or 5. Another idea is to stick more &quot;lesser&quot; augs all over the world. People MIGHT spread out more if they knew that +10/10 hp/mana augs were dropping someplace, or +10 to 2 resists, or something. Stop herding people into a single cattle-run with poor itemization. <br />
<br />
Who knows, like I said before, maybe SOE will read this stuff and think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At LEAST put a Abysmal Sea book in PoK. Or even Natimbi.<br />
<br />
That's already been done.  You can port to Abysmal by hailing the Magus in Nedaria.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The unlocking of several tier 2 and tier 3 zones in PoP. An excellent start.An excellent start? What else can you unlock in PoP without ruining any sense of accomplishment for raiding guilds?<br />
<br />
We have a coalition on 7th who got into the elementals, and it's already a nightmare. Now you don't dare go get a soda while zoning into PoE for fear that a group or some moron trained the zonein and there's something waiting for you. Same goes for Solusek Ro's tower. At least they usually stay the hell out of PoWater so I can solo/duo there in peace.<br />
<br />
Can you imagine the quantity of griefing that could occur if anyone who dinged 65 could just stroll into the elementals? having 50 people doing Exp in PoFire and trying to run the Fennin Script, but the group at Castle 2 petitions you because you're pulling the script and interrupting thier exp. How about in PoEarth, where you can accidentally trigger a ring? I can just see it now, &quot;****, A dusty warder to zone!&quot; Oh the joy.<br />
<br />
I'm happy the &quot;casual&quot; gamer has been thrown a bone with 1 groupable content/gear progression, but the street goes both ways (hi, need a weaponmaster-esque raid to substitute for vxed/tipt please).<br />
<br />
If you want to access zones, you have the same opportunity to do it as everyone else. it's your choice to not join a raiding guild and get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just wanted to add... You can't compare POP to velious at all. Sure, in velious you could enter ToV at any level without keys or anything. But just getting there involved some serious work, not clicking a stone. When you got there, you couldn't start any **** on your own, there are guards who hit for 350 and see invis the second you step through the door, unless you've actually worked on your faction with CoV. The zone is set up very well like that, quite unlike PoFire where any bone head can invis to anywhere in the zone. And there are no graveyards in ToV, and getting a res means running all the way back and getting a corpse summon, not waiting in PoTranq for 30 minutes so your corpse pops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One note on the progressive quests - the Officer's Cloak of Service (soloable at 65, and a great cloak as a result, but is Vah Shir only) and the Medallion of the Hero of Shar Vahl (great range item, all/all too) is one-groupable (both end in Grimling)<br />
<br />
It's a lot of tradeskilling to a point, but it's more, for the cloak, trying to hunt down the other Vah Shir classes that have finished their part of the sonic wolf bane weapon and are willing to do a trade. Which is really the worst part of it, but I managed to pull off the bard section without making/finding a bard (though the sonic wolf pups/wolflings were a pain in the neck to find).<br />
<br />
Getting the various pieces out of Hollowshade is really the worst part of it (rare drops, sucks), but aside from that, you can progress at your own pace and end up with something real nice at the end of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The only things in the list that were actually changed were the dropping of flagging requirements for some of the pop zones and the advent of researcheable kunark/velious spells.<br />
<br />
Tactics allways had the alternative route of entry that was relatively easy, if tedious, to do, so that wasnt a change. The shawl quests were in velious since inception, they just weren't all fully implemented until later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just a quick note- I'm not going to get into the raider vs. non-raider debate here, that's not why I started the thread.  It's merely to provide some positive feedback and show what has helped the non-raid player.  I will be happy to continue the raider vs. non-raider debate in one of the myriad other threads here on the subject.<br />
<br />
Good ideas btw, Blazz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think this is proving that there hasn't been a whole heck of a lot to help the non-raiders. [EDIT: I racked my brain and couldn't think of one, myself hehe ;)]<br />
<br />
As for Thorizon's point... yeah, the changes Iz mentioned can help a raider too, but in most cases, they have other things to do, other means to do them that they will probably choose (i.e., they will raid to achieve them - better gear, spell drops, etc.).  Your friend that researched RGC at least is in a guild that is capable of getting her a copy (it's quite easy to take out Rhags actually with a few normally geared groups), they just chose not to go back and do it.  A non-raider had no choice.<br />
<br />
Mach</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Looking at the general state of the game as we know it, knowing that raiding is pretty much the only way to advance, I fail to understand why there are so many people who think that raiding is beyond their capacity. I understand the time constraint issue, because I lived with them for years. Long ago I was one of the people saying &quot;I don't have time for that&quot; or &quot;I'm never going to spend 6 hours online for a stupid raid.&quot; Back then it took that long or longer to accomplish anything during a raid.<br />
<br />
The reality today is most raids are finished in less than 3-4 hours (not counting the few raids involving a set timer). I don't know about you all, but when I log in on non-raid nights I play about the same amount of time. It's just 3-4 hours spent AAing or doing LDoN instead of raiding.<br />
<br />
I belong to a guild that raids three nights a week. If you are online during the raid time you are expected to attend. If you aren't online then you miss the raid, no big deal. Right now I only need Bert and MM to be flagged for EP.<br />
<br />
Beyond time problems, again keeping in mind that we know EQ requires large numbers of people to advance, why would you choose not to join a guild and then complain because you can't get anywhere? I know guild politics suck, I've been a leader before and I won't ever do it again. I know that some guilds require certain flags/AA's/play time, but there are just as many out there that don't. They're not any worse than the ones that do, they just operate at a more sedate pace. I know I'm not going to be in Time in 6 months, probably not even in a year. Maybe I'll never set foot in Time, but it doesn't matter. I'm still having fun with it and I'm not feeling ripped off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like some of Blazz's ideas. Especially about being able to quest for newer spells and higher power gear. Although I am in a semi-raiding guild it would still be nice to be able to get some upgrading done with a small group or even solo. Just for the love of god don't make me do tradeskills to get them done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just wanted to add... You can't compare POP to velious at all.

<br />
ToV was also not a single group xp zone.  I think that the underlying issue is that in PoP the best single-group xp/loot zones require raid flags to get to.  That seriously reamed non-raiders, especially considering that PoP raised the level cap and fiddled with the xp curve in a way that rendered just about every pre-PoP xp zone worthless.  The only pre-PoP zone that I can think of that was ever an apex xp zone that required a flag/key to access is Sebilis, and the key was trivial to get in a single group during Sebilis' reign as an apex xp zone.<br />
<br />
In original EQ, if you wanted to experience the highest single group content (e.g. Lower Guk, Sol B), you could do so in a single group.<br />
<br />
In Kunark, if you wanted to experience the highest single group content (e.g. Sebilis, Chardok), you could do so in a single group.<br />
<br />
In Velious, if you wanted to experience the highest single group content (e.g. Velks, CS), you could do so in a single group.<br />
<br />
In Luclin, if you wanted to experience the highest single group content (e.g. Akheva, ME, that mine zone), you could do so in a single group. <br />
<br />
In PoP, if you wanted to experience the highest single group content (e.g. Elementals, Sol Ro), you gotta raid kill rally z, solusek ro, etc.<br />
<br />
Almost all of those pre-PoP zones had raid content too.  You are right that some of the elemental scripts can be messed up by xp'ers, but that is the result of nothing other than stone-cold idiotic game design.<br />
<br />
As for <br />
What else can you unlock in PoP without ruining any sense of accomplishment for raiding guilds?<br />
<br />
I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.  When my guild killed Trakanon, the fact that there was an xp group at chef/bar/arm didn't ruin any sense of accomplishment. When my guild killed Velk, the fact that there was an xp group at lower dogs didn't ruin any sense of accomplishment.  Shei, ditto.  Seru, ditto.  Grummus, ditto.  Agnarr, ditto. etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
When we killed Fennin, there was an xp group at C1.  If their guildtags had been (non raiding guild) instead of (hardcore raiding guild), it would not have ruined any sense of accomplishment I felt.</div></div><hr />

They're never going to open them. They gave you half a dozen new zones to xp in when they released GoD (natimbi, barindu, qinimi, riwwi, ferubi, all the sewers, vxed and tipt).  Use those zones if you're bored with BoT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plane of Mischief revamp - More good xp and some very good loot drops - all no drop and most of it not terribly useful to the hardcore raid type.<br />
<br />
Chardok B - Easier sarnak faction, good drops - earrings, ft2 neck, sleeves.  Korocust is doable by one group of 65s and his drop table is quite nice.<br />
<br />
LoY - not the most popular expansion, and decidedly unfinished in parts, but you can do the Wrank or Ngrub events in Torgiran or the Broodmother event in Nadox and get good stuff with a single group - The caster shoes and the all/all ring off Wrank being notably good for the difficulty.<br />
Hates Fury has some reasonable drops as well.<br />
<br />
Solstice earring - this is just about everyone's first piece of FT, and it came out at a time when FT was almost solely the provinence of high end guilds.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule revamp - excellent single groupable xp and drops, though the xp was visibly turned down when PoP was released.<br />

Re-expanding the blue-con range after PoP.  Turned a lot of greened out zones back into xp zones.<br />

<br />
You only need 10 or so items to get into Veeshan's Peak.  You only need 10 or so items to get to Vex Thal.  Therefore, the Lake of Ill Omen and Fungus Grove are no place for casual gamers.  Or something.<br />

[quote]Opening the EPs to the public would trivialize the flagging process in general.<br />
<br />
Removing the 40% xp penalty trivialized the levelling process for hybrids.  Removing the spellbook from meditation trivializied the meditation process for sub-35 characters.  Adding ctrl-click and alt-click inventory management trivialized the tradeskill process.  Thank God for that because, just like the flagging process, each one of those processes were steaming piles of crap. <br />

This has already been gimped to all heck thanks to the 85% rule.  I was browsing cleric magelos the other day and ran into one that was wearing thurgadin quest armor - and hadn't done any flags past a PoJ trial -  but he had his time flag and his one piece of t1 loot.</div></div><hr />

I constantly hear about the great xp that raiders get in Sol Ro and above.<br />
<br />
I xp'd in those new GoD zones when they came out... some of them weren't too bad... but the &quot;easier&quot; ones were pretty crap xp compared to BoT, with much higher difficulty.    That's not to say that the early GoD zones were &quot;hard&quot;... but I wouldn't exactly call them prime XP grounds.<br />
<br />
They've recently said they upped the xp in some of those zones, so it could be much much better now. <br />
<br />
And the problem is also... BoT is one of the zones where loot, xp, and ease (relative to some places) of getting a group come together to form an &quot;uberzone&quot;.<br />
<br />
Like Seb, Guk, Velks (post changes), before it... BoT is the zone to get xp... because you can get a group... and you can have a chance at loot... which is both useable and sellable.<br />
<br />
Raiders essentially &quot;get it all&quot;.   They can do anything casuals can... but better due to more gear, experience, and levels/AAs... they get access to raid zones / loot ... and they get access to the best xp zones in the game.<br />
<br />
The rich keep getting richer.<br />
<br />
I've never been past Tactics, or the first Sewer adventure... maybe I'm wrong...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but I do not and will not ever agree with this.  90 percent of the EQ population won't spread out.

<br />
How about the list Trevurg gave us:<br />
<br />
Droga revamp<br />
<br />
Went there last night, 9 people in zone, 6 of em where my group (4 king placeholders).<br />
<br />
Plane of Mischief revamp - More good xp and some very good loot drops - all no drop and most of it not terribly useful to the hardcore raid type.<br />
<br />
Spend all day sunday there, never heard a word.  I think some other people zoned in.  Had fun crawling the castle.<br />
<br />
Chardok B - Easier sarnak faction, good drops - earrings, ft2 neck, sleeves. Korocust is doable by one group of 65s and his drop table is quite nice.<br />
<br />
I'll have to visit.<br />
<br />
LoY - not the most popular expansion, and decidedly unfinished in parts, but you can do the Wrank or Ngrub events in Torgiran or the Broodmother event in Nadox and get good stuff with a single group - The caster shoes and the all/all ring off Wrank being notably good for the difficulty.<br />
Hates Fury has some reasonable drops as well.<br />
<br />
I've spent a lot of time here, hardly ever see anyone here.  Except for when they made it a hotspot.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule revamp - excellent single groupable xp and drops, though the xp was visibly turned down when PoP was released.<br />
<br />
Did 4 AA here over the course of a week off and on.  Saw a druid fail to solo there and 2 groups (well, one bot squad and some hangers on) tried the gnome walk.<br />
<br />
Throw in my personal Favorite zone Veksar : empty except for the necro camping the soulscream belt.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile everyone is squabbling over spawns in BoT because it's the &quot;best&quot; exp (except for the ones under 62 who are squabbling over the caves in Valor since that's the &quot;best&quot; exp for 55-62).<br />

I love all of the zones you and Trevurg named - but at this point in the game, besides the haste belts in Droga/Veksar and maybe a couple other pieces, the level of the loot dropping just isn't all that great.  <br />

Hey! Quit poking holes in my arguments! hehe  True, but it was just an example building on his prior example :).  Insert name of another fairly hard to get spell that can now be researched.  I researched Torpor and Malo (I know about the rarity of those and stuff, and how it is 1-groupable these days, but it wasn't at first, so probably not a good example either ;)), but they were something I'd never have gotten before as a non-raider.</div></div><hr />

Offers multiple augments and armor drops that are one-groupable by non-Time/EP folks that are better than what is bought out of LDoN.  One good night in GoD saves me two weeks of LDoN drudgery.<br />

Opinions obviously vary a bit on PoM because of the emotional attachment older PoM fans have to the zone - I use a few PoM v2 drops and have used more in the past, and I have upgraded quite a few friends with PoM v2 drops.<br />
<br />
It's also a nice quiet zone for xp grinding - the level 65 halflings and monkeys back in AiW are decent xp, if not up to PoP standards.  <br />

Nothing RC cant handle, and that is easy for a non raider to get, allthought tedious because it is a rare drop. And, as I said, RGC can be bought in LDoN anyway, along with a few other remove curse type spells (there is a baby version and another one similar to RC).</div></div><hr />

The very entry level requirement for PoP (level 46+ to access planes) is the requirement for the highest level content in original EQ.  PoP, by design, restricts content available to players.</div></div><hr />

I've derailed enough threads here trying to raise awareness on the raider/non-raider issue that I certainly deserve some of my own medicine. :)  Carry on.<br />
<br />
Also, no idea how I missed Solstice Earring in my original post- I don't know a single non-raider who isn't wearing one.  That was a pretty sad oversight on my part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Jaiden, I may be understanding you, but I don't think that it is a matter of an expansion starting high level.  Velious started sort of high level for the time (I may be wrong, but I don't remember many sub 30 people being there at the time?)  It's just that you never had to raid to get to the best single group content.  You could get to the best single group content without ever being in an encounter larger than a single group from the birth of EQ until the opening of PoP.  That's a massive gameplay shift, and one that I think people have a right to be pissed about.  It's like logging into EQ tomorrow and finding that every server is PvP only.  Some people would love it.  I'd quit.  After bitching up a storm first, of course :)</div></div><hr />

You could do Vulak with a single group when Velious was released?  Can you do AoW in Kael with a single group even with todays top-end gear?  (Triton took two groups to do it last night.)  You could get in to Vex Thal with a single group when Luclin was released?  You could get in to Sleeper's Tomb with a single group when Veious was released?  You could get in to Veeshan's Peak with a single group when Kunark was released?<br />
<br />
I will agree that the numbers required to kill the PoP bosses for the first time are probably higher than the numbers required to kill the earlier boss mobs for the first time.  I would be interested in finding out how many people where on the first raid to kill Avatar of War and how many people where on the first raid to kill Rallos Zek.  The numbers on AoW may have been lower, but it was definitely not six.<br />
<br />
The very entry level requirement for PoP (level 46+ to access planes) is the requirement for the highest level content in original EQ.  PoP, by design, restricts content available to players.<br />
<br />
Velious was designed for content for players 30+.  Other than the snow bunnies, there are nothing in Velious that a low level player can kill.  When Velious was release, level 30 was a much more significant acheivement than it is today.  While a player could get to Iceclad at level 1, I doubt they would make it much further than the docks (remember, when released, the Velious portals required you to walk there and pick up a key).  The zones, other than ToV, may not have been level locked like they are in PoP, but they may as well have been.<br />
<br />
On the subject of non-raid vs. raid content, I have two comments.  First, raid gear is going to be designed to survive raid content.  Secondly, non-raid content needs to give a reward for completing it just like raid content does so that it allows the players to have a sense of accomplishment.<br />
<br />
The gear you need to survive an end-game raid type encounter is going to be very different than the gear that a casual player NEEDS to survive the average single or small groupable content.  Unfortunately, the gear that a raider accumulates allows him to survive those single group encounters better than the person who does not raid.  Compare two warriors in BoT, for example, if one was in a top end GoD guild and the other is in LDoN or Ornate gear.  The lower end gear will work acceptably, but the GoD/Plane of Time gear will allow the raider to do the experience grind more efficiently.  Ideally, the gear that is required to survive single group content would be different than the gear needed to survive end-game content.  The raider's gear would not give him an advantage in single-group content over the person who doesn't raid, for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
Based on my (somewhat limited) experience, it appears that the average person in a raid guild gets a peice of good loot every two to four weeks, if they raid on a regular basis.  It's not like being in a raiding guild gets you loot like you are in a candy store.    Small group content needs to provide a similar level of return.  Somoene who plays a similar amount of time needs to be able to be able to get rewards at about the same level.  LDoN points can buy you new gear at about that level.  Quests like the velious shawl and ring quests (other than the 10th Ring War) or the Luclin Earring of Veracity quests (at least up to Signet Earring can be single grouped) can get a person who can gather a couple of groups together (e.g. &quot;family&quot; guild) reasonable rewards for the time spent.  <br />
<br />
I would like to see more quests implemented that allow small groups to progress.  LDoN missions could provide progressive quests for single group players.  In addition to getting points, you could also have to do a series of tasks in the dungeons as set forth by the quest givers, similar how you have to collect items for the shawl quests.  These quests could give a reason to do assasinate and escort missions.  The assasinate victim would drop a quest item or the person escorted could give a reward that is part of a progressive quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Just my opinion but I hate exping in all the elemental planes save water.  They are all Dreadlands type environment and whoever wants em can have em.  I'll take a good dungeon crawl any  day of the week.<br />
<br />
As for adding more content and items via quests, I am all for that.  Droga has several really nice quests, ala free the slaves.  HoT Dozeker quests rock and I still use items from that.  I havent done the marsinger quest but it looks nice but I haven't done it yet.  Opening up hate more might be nice just to make it easier to get there.  I would love more along those lines.<br />
<br />
Also for the non-raiders I think raising the level cap to 70 will be huge.  Should open up several encounters in Ssra to one group stuff and trivialize alot of stuff that previously had been raid targets elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I think the only real difference in content accessable other then time and elementals between raiders and non-raiders is time.  Raiders get better gear faster by and large so they access more content.  This should not be all that suprising as a larger group (as long as it is well organized) will generally do things quicker and more efficiently then a small one.  This is not always true but is generally the way it is, both in eq and RL.  The only way around this is to limit encounter size.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I forgot about these quests when I made my earlier post.   I love these quests, and would fully support more quests of this type, and reward level.<br />
<br />
I have one complaint about the quests... for priests... the 8th Shawl is an exceptional item.    True... it's a lot of work that perhaps many people may not want to do.   However I thought the awesome priest reward from Droga being a shawl with slightly better stats and FT 2 was a bit of a disappointment.     Since I had the 8th shawl... the quest was worthless to me. <br />
<br />
And what I mean exactly there... is I had a non-raid, fairly awesome item (8th shawl), and here's another non-raid, fairly awesome item... priest only... that goes into the same slot.     Given the number of quest, non-raid items... you really think they could have put it in another slot.<br />
<br />
But anyhow... I'm also pro-choice... and love the concept of the quests... more decent xp zones with these types of quests would rock.</div></div><hr />

Your example is you soloing in natimbi... Im also ~6400 raid buffed, my very first trip to GoD was a small 4 person group to riwwi that went very well until we had to leave for a raid, our tank was the weakest equiped of the lot. We poked around with the sewer trials but never finished them, because we finally made EP and Ive hardly been back to GoD since cept to do tipt a couple times.  Mainly because Ive been working my aid gimil quest now, and backflagged and exping in EP.<br />
<br />
Ive had my shawl a long time and plan on getting my signet in the near future, so yes the non-hardcore raiders do have things to do they just need the brains to go find it... I think Ive been to BoT 5 or 6 times since LDoN and dont plan to ever set foot in there again now.</div></div><hr />

spell research for kunark spells... can't say it isn't good but utility is kind of retarded isn't it?  even for crappy players that play today the jaunt from 60 to 65 is less than one day /play even AFK in BOT.  although i suppose if you're one of those complex people who cant to pay 30 bucks for PoP but can paradoxical continue to pay 13 bucks a month there's utility there.  I suppose as a small counterpoint of logic I could point out that the yield rates for many spells from eth, spec  and runes is fubar.  does it make sense that you have to do 10 turn ins to get your last spell at each level<br />
<br />

Yeah, casual players can do just fine in Q and Riwwi, and I imagine in a few others as well. My shaman is less well equiped than yours and can heal my warrior with no downtime at all in Q/R. B is a little tougher, but Q and R are just easy, if I can duo there I'm sure a casual group would have no problems. You can solo pull most stuff in those two zones as well. B is a little more difficult to pull since a fair number of the mobs are in static groups of 2-3, but, there are still plenty that can be single pulled. Prior to the GoD nerfing they were still pretty tough, but they seem much easier now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually don't like soloing in Qinimi.  I find it harder than in Riwwi, to be honest, the rare-drop loot is poor, and the rares have bad loot table and are out-of-scale challenges.  That said, its easy to get to and easy to zone out of, so its worth considering to practice against GoD mobs.  Some things tend to be more resistant than others.  The Qinimi nocs are sometimes stubborn, in particular.  I pull them with Malos with a dog out.  Then, I'll send the dog to attack - Malos is low enough aggro that the noc will &quot;stick&quot; to the dog, letting me land a slow, and then hopefully a root.  If all goes well, I can even /pet hold the dog off before he dies (obviously, he's well buffed before attempting this).  It helps a lot, and its a useful skill to learn whenever you're dealing with hard-hitting rootable mobs that don't summon.  As long as you keep them slowed, they aren't too bad - even a 6k shaman should be able to channel a re-root after break without feeling in too much danger unless you have a particularly bad series of resists/interrupts/procs.<br />
<br />
Barindu *is* more challenging, and pulling there is something of an art rather than a science, although there are a few safe (or nearly so) spots to set up a group in.  As far as soloing Barindu goes, I set up at the Barindu/Riwwi zoneline (its less used, so you won't train raid guild members on the way to Vxed/Tipt if you screw up), and pull the first half-dozen or so mobs to root/rot.  Here the pet is nearly essential - these mobs do hit hard enough for things to get nasty fast.  Just remember there's a zoneline right there, and don't be afraid to use it.  Unless you're well-geared, used to shaman-kiting, and a little stupid, don't pull Barindu nocs - they are immune to root.<br />
<br />
Riwwi, on the other hand, is actually a much easier zone than Barindu, despite its admittedly mob-swarm appearance.  There are a few very nice places to set up in Riwwi to farm, and the rewards are worth the time.  It helps to remember that every rare I've encountered is root/rottable (except the raid mob Taskmistress Krisz, and I've never seen the named Ra'Tuk Yadda Yadda to know for certain about him).  In fact, many of the rares hit hard enough that root/rotting is really the only way to solo them.  But, hey, if dogdog can die for the cause getting them slowed and rooted, that's 80% of the battle.  While some mob types resist the useful dots more than others, nothing seems totally immune to any of the spell lines, and a Malos will often take care of any lingering resistance issues.<br />
<br />
I won't talk about strategies for soloing Ferubi, Sewers or Vxed mobs here.  Since this is directed to a 6k-6500 shaman, the goal should probably be more gear before trying to solo for a Chanting Stone Mask, for example.  Still, Riwwi provides a really solid BP and a lot of nice drops off the rares (Gargantuan Armplates are the one that comes first to mind even though I'm very tired atm - there are lots more), and Barindu provides what is frankly at least a VT-level ring as a random rare drop (probably 1:300 or so, your mileage with the random number generator may vary, spend a couple hours here per day of playtime if you're serious about it, and you'll likely see it in a week or 2 - sounds long, but its 100/100 FT2 and worth the time).<br />
<br />
With a ranger, druid, or necro partner, all this becomes largely trivial.  Snare is simply a shaman's best friend in GoD, and I duo and group with snare classes at every opportunity.  If you've got a solid mana pool and some healing improvements (focus and/or aa) you might try tank/shaman duo also, especially in Riwwi.  The old shaman/monk pairing doesn't hold up as well, sadly.  The ATK of these mobs tends to be set up to make the mitigation of plate classes more important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">8th COLDAIN shawl.  from THURG.  that should give you a clue.  Now if i can only find south america relative to north america on the map<br />
<br />
Hahaha.  And of course SoE releases all content right away.  Wait, no, they don't.<br />
<br />
8th shawl was added to game after Luclin.  I'm pretty sure if it was before PoP, it wasn't by much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">This is very true, and there is a reason for that. The reason is, there is very little content designed SOLELY for the non-raiding player. EQ is a game made up of different styles, events, components, things-to-do, whatever name you wish to call it. Raiding players take advantage of a larger portion of this &quot;game&quot; than non-raiding players. <br />
<br />
That being said, I would also disagree slightly that LoY shouldnt count as helping the L65 non-raider. There is a TON of great stuff in those zones, its not hard to farm, there are named &quot;mini-raids&quot; that drop GOOD stuff for the non-raider, especially in Nadox and Togrin Mines. Maybe its not the BEST stuff, but the events are really fun. But, time vs. reward, risk vs. reward, XP vs. reward, these are the things that tend to get in the way, for everyone, from the most hardcore 12-hour a day guys to the most casual 2 hours a week guys. <br />
<br />
One other thing Iz. I think this thread is a solid idea, but how about ADDING a positive to it, and SUGGEST new ways that SOE could help the non-raider. I will even get it started:<br />
<br />
1. Open up Sol Ro now, and the EPs eventually. Make them accesible with difficult (yet one-groupable) quests. Make those quests timesinks, maybe not on the same scale as a whoile guild backflagging a whole run, but similar. When OoW ships, BoT is gonna be empty except for folks farming loot. The XP will not hold up in the run from 65 to 70. EPs have MUCH better one-groupable XP, and gear that would be VERY nice for non-raiders that is also one-groupable. Time to let them in.<br />
<br />
2. Multiple paths to new spells. I don't care if its quests, AAs, research, vendor purchases (wanna pull some pp out of the game? Make the new spells buyable, but cost prohibitive, like 25K per. At least a person who doesnt go to the Raid zones where the spells drop has the option of farming pp to get them) whatever. But everyone has a right to MOST of his classes spells. Ancients should ONLY be slightly better versions of existing spells, not RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING like the new Canni (from what I hear, I dont have it)<br />
<br />
3. Re-itemization of older content to reflect the newer &quot;trends&quot; in the game. FBSS is totally worthless now. Why not put an AC 5, +5 all stats and resists, 28% haste belt in its place? Why not give the Ghoul Lord a better choice than SSoY and the King a better 2H than Mith? Lets spread folks out. Loot worth going after in MORE zones, so the folks with less time can actually go to some NEW places instead of the same old BoT or LDoN cause thats all they have time for and its just not worth it anywhere else. Droga was a good start, a great start actually, but you picked one of THE CRAPPIEST zones there is. Any zone you cannot get to Zone Out on a suicide run isnt going to attract people unless the loot and XP are AMAZINGLY better than anything else available (like Sol Ro would be, if opened).<br />
<br />
4. More progressive-quest gear. Sariss mentioned it earlier in this thread and he is 100% right. These types of quests would actually provide a fairly FUN way to consume time, knowing the end result is worth the effort. Even if you make the FINAL stage a Raid level war of some kind like the Coldain Ring and Shawl, make the step BEFORE that, the step the non-raider can get too, worthwhile. This would probably greatly reducce the gap, as well. 100 hps vs 150. FT3 vs FT5. +20 attack vs +40. But make the earlier stage accessible to one-group non-raiders, with the option of taking it to the next stage if they wanted. <br />
<br />
There are a lot more things. LDoN needs some work. The current aug system isnt going to hold up when OoW ships, and the camps will become ghost towns. There is going to need to be SOME form of buy-back or Recycle system put into effect, with new, bigger gear offered on the merchants. Gates is still a struggle. At LEAST put a Abysmal Sea book in PoK. Or even Natimbi. And make SOME spells drop outside the trials. Some people cannot get a full group together during their &quot;play-window&quot; and would like at least a CHANCE at a new spell off content doable by smaller groups of 4 or 5. Another idea is to stick more &quot;lesser&quot; augs all over the world. People MIGHT spread out more if they knew that +10/10 hp/mana augs were dropping someplace, or +10 to 2 resists, or something. Stop herding people into a single cattle-run with poor itemization. <br />
<br />
Who knows, like I said before, maybe SOE will read this stuff and think about it.<br />

Whoa, back the horse trailer up.  Now, I agree, soloing in Qinimi would be a bitz . . . however . . . myself, a 61 SK and a 56 Ranger were able to survive Noc's in Qinimi with me buffing, slowing, healing and tossing on an occasional DoT . . . and I'm still just a 62 Shaman with a paltry 18 AA's.<br />
<br />
A full group could *easily*, and I do mean *easily*, use Qinimi as an EXP zone . . . well, assuming of course that the Exp there was worth having . . . which it isn't.</div></div><hr />

this expansion was made for lvl 70, and for the raiders, nothing less short of that.<br />
<br />
so please, when you say they have more zones to exp in, make sure they can actually kill and survive the mobs.<br />
<br />
Have you been back to GoD since revamp?  I have less hitpoints than you do and I can solo-tank the noks in Qinimi.  Shamans can even solo by the zone-in of Barindu- we just root/rot the mobs.  As far as grouping goes- we can group in mutiple GoD zones.  Pre-revamp GoD was a nightmare, now its &quot;challenging&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry I should have phrased my statements more specifically.  I was responding to Uggok talking about single group experience areas but ended up generalizing in my words.<br />
<br />
Obviously the &quot;highest areas&quot; of expansions aren't single groupable right from the beginning, but the best experience areas were as Uggok mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I don't know why, but it's nearly impossible to get people to spread out.<br />
<br />
Of course it's hard to get people to spread out when there are blatantly better zones in any given level range.  If you have 20 possible zones to visit in any given level range and only ONE zone has both ridiculous xp and uber loot guess where players will be.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that due to items never decaying, farming being a way of life, the maturity of the game (few new players, most lower level characters are insanely twinked) and mudflation, nobody cares about loot or gear until very high levels - so the only thing that matters is ease of accumulating tons of xp in a hurry until higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">/agree everyone has always gone where the best exp is, since pop is the best and safest noone will move from it and especially since pop mobs have the least hp. They should perhaps scale exp to hp,  would make things more logical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Flags.  well since flags didn't even exist PRE-SoL it's pretty odd to say alternate access to tactics/ tier 2/3 is an improvement.  they screw you with a terrible, retard-designed flagging system and you cheer when they lube you before they insert?<br />
<br />
Despite your deplorable imagery I'll respond. The reason I listed alternate access to Tactics as a boon was that it was similar in effort and scope to gaining access to say, Howling Stones.  This was a much better solution than just making viable exp zones like SRT off limits to the L65 non-raider (or PoV/PoS/BoT/HoH at PoP launch).  Tedious, yes, but not impossible, esp. since it could be MQ'd and would flag the entire group instead of each person having to go to Kaesora, LOIO, SoNH, etc...<br />
<br />
Anyone who's ever read my posts knows that I, uh, do not &quot;cheer&quot; the flagging system. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">The alt access quests flagging the entire group was, in itself, a beneficial change made for non-raiders.  Originally they flagged one person at a time.</div></div><hr />

I think they should balance the XP a bit more, make more zones VERY close to the same exact XP per hour, make the loot dropping VERY similar in nature, and make them equally accessible. I see so many people that just want something ELSE to do that is actually worth the time and loot and XP oppertunity available somewhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">It really comes down to 3 things... Danger, Loot, and XP.     BoT pretty much has everything....<br />
<br />
- Low Danger<br />
- Great Loot<br />
- Great XP<br />
<br />
There's your formula if you want people in any given zone.   <br />
<br />
Variations on this don't work well.    For example, lets say you add to the danger of a zone... it's riskier... it's more of a challenge... sounds good... but then if the loot isn't better than BoT... or the XP is lower... people won't go... oh sure, a couple times to check it out... but won't stay.<br />
<br />
Any zone with less XP than BoT pretty much has to have better loot... and Ornate is near the top of the food chain for a lot of non raiders... it's valuble to sell... and has effects that almost everyone can use.<br />
<br />
Droga was a great upgrade.   The quests provided valuble upgrades for many... the risk was very low... but the xp was just &quot;good&quot;.    So people get their quest stuff and leave except for the farmers and a rare group.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind... people like zones where things aren't &quot;required&quot; as such.<br />
<br />
Again looking at Droga... you don't need a chanter/bard at all.   You really don't even need a slower.    My shaman could have tanked if I wanted... point being that you don't NEED a 10k warrior to go there.<br />
<br />
It's an excellent... &quot;I have a random group of friends and we wanna go xp somewhere without worrying about our classes&quot;.<br />
<br />
BoT is &quot;almost&quot; like that.    You don't really .... &quot;need&quot; any class... but a more &quot;ideal looking&quot; group will do much better... but since BoT is the center of pickup group activity... you can almost always find someone to fill your needs.<br />
<br />
It's actually very easy for SoE to spread people out if they wanted to.    They just have to keep those things in mind.</div></div><hr />
