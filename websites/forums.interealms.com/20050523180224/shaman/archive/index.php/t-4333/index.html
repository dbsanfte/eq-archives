<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the fastest to 40 route with a rogue?<br />
<br />
I am 2 boxing my 57 shaman and currently 33 rogue.  Right now we are at the shroom temple in DSP and that is insane exp.  I did all of 31, 32, and 25% of 33 last night in no time at all (maybe 2 hours of casual killing).<br />
<br />
Where is the next hot spot after 33 to zip him through?  Once at 40 it is cake to let him leech exp during solo times to get him up a little higher.<br />
<br />
I guess those huge backstabs from the guild rogues made me want to create a meat grinder for casual &quot;press A to attack&quot; play :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you zone out of NL and walk out into the open, turn to the right.  From behind the rock head straight out until you reach the small body of water.  I would setup camp there and have the rogue pull zelniaks and wolves.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did 30-50 in CoM, temple to the right, then in the back outside the reaver keep, if I recall correctly, I think I was getting 2 levels/evening (5 hrs approx) in the 40s.  Did 25-30 in Kaesora.</div></div><hr />
