<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wudlaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive just recently came upon a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang and replaced my Spine Chill Spear with it. The damage output and proc are amazing compared to what I was using before but I've noticed my stamina decreases quickly. My stamina buffed is 175 at LVL 45. Is this decrease because of the speed of the weapon? If so, is there anything I can do to keep my stamina up? Also, I always have alacricity up. Thanks in advance<br />

Add haste and your yellow will poof quickly.  If you see a higher shaman around, as for Acumen..or a chanter for one of their Augmentation line.. (forget the higher level names..someone will know )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Selkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's 1H pierce, right?  If your stamina is over 100, you should not get any ill effects from loss of vigor (yellow bar) while using a 1H weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>baazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah...I made the same upgrade as you     Wudlaorm, at about the same level. <br />
<br />
REIF + Aclerity + Silver Chitin Handwraps = bye bye STA.<br />
<br />
Selkie is right though. Kepp your STA above 100 and you should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wudlaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the replies from all of you. I did mention that my stamina was buffed at 175. Is there another STA stat that I am missing? Kilorn, Ill try your tactic with the augmentation buffs. <br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you Stamina stat is over 100, the yellow bar becomes irrelevant. It will still drop, but your attack rate doesn't change even when it's empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only downside to an empty stamina bar (if your Sta is over 100) is that you can't jump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">so you're saying if my barb has 105 staminca while naked and unbuffed I will never ever have to worry about stamina unless I want to use 2H weapons or Jump alot?</div></div><hr />
