<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RedFusion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanna get a JBB and it cost about 30k what i have heard, so i need to get some plat... where would i hunt for best plat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">tried killing HGs in RM?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Geos in cc are good exp and plat, can make a couple k a night if ya have decent ac/hp gear and I met a monk that got his run 3 at 51 on them, so not horrible exp till you get your clicky bracer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HG's in Rathe is still the best source for chedda IMO. I've been smashing them for a while but, I got bored and now I'm manhandling the Ulthorks in EW. Rathe or Gornit in OOT, I still say Rathe is best. <br />
I'll go back at 44 when I have my new mojo, and hand them another serious beatdown. Bazaar broke me but I now have 900+ buffed AC with all my new toys !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lots and lots of hill giants.  Kill them until you are sick of killing them, and then kill somemore.  Take a break from it ocassionally by going to lower guk or something.  But then go back and kill a ton more.  You will get the jbb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buying and selling (especially now) will make you more money then hunting will... and you might get lucky and find a cheap JBB while &quot;pp grinding&quot;.</div></div><hr />

i been htinking that too<br />
<br />
i bought a Ikky for 6500 . im trying to sell it for 7.5 . if i can get 7k for it , thats 500 pp i made . ill keep doing it if this works out :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you want exp to go with the plat, Geos in Crystal Caverns was a great place.(noted above, I know - but I loved it there) <br />
<br />
<br />
No copper drops there, and a steady diet of plat spiced by chipped jewels (sell like regular but not any use to a tradeskiller) up to diamonds was very profitable.  bank in the zone.  as a troll, I could not sell there, but I could gate to Thrg and run back easily enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I found soloing RM to be too slow to be worth it.<br />
<br />
If you have a melee to partner with it may be better.<br />
<br />
If your melee partner is 49+ or so and you are very lucky, or start at a non-peak time, you can grab two of the static Ice Giant spawns in Everfrost. They drop more platinum than the RM hill giants, and drop FS/gems/research parts most of the time.<br />
<br />
And don't underestimate the income value of SoW potions. Once your Alchemy skill is up to 54 or better you have a 95% chance of success; 10 10-dose potions usually cost me about 600pp to make. The key is to find the right zone to sell in. DL is one of the best, as people are about the right level to (a) still need it because they don't have AA run yet, and (b) have enough pp to shell out. On a good day I can make 500pp in pure profit for zero work while I'm hunting for exp or pp. Most days it's more like 200pp, but still definitely worth running to the nearest friendly alchemy shop every couple days.</div></div><hr />
