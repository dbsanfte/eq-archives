<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heard from a guildie that his friend used a UI and got his account hacked because of it.  I told him that I didn't think that they got it from the login screen as the UI is loaded LONG after that's done.  However, I was wondering if it's possible for a UI to pull this from the IE cookies off the Station site.  Anyone have any idea how this would be possible?  If this IS possible, we have to raise a flag immediately to Sony, so that they can mod the edit checks for UI's and see if it's for any Email or FTP code in it.<br />
<br />
Your thoughts?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The UI can have a trojan inside and it can send keypresses to the person who is controling it therefor capturing your friend typing in the password.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How is the UI going to capture something that happens BEFORE IT'S LOADED?  That's what's stumping me here.....  The only answer that makes sense to me is cookies in IE, but I'm not sure if that's what happened, or if he just blamed a hack on the UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Trojan loads the first time you load the UI, stays resident til the next time you log in maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My understanding of XML (as limited as it may be) is that it's nothing more than a method to present/display data, nothing more. It's not like JavaScript, VB Script, or any other &quot;language&quot; that can stay resident in memory/running in the background. There's no &quot;execution&quot; code/method in XML as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Me thinks this is all much to do about nothing.<br />
<br />
However, I will concede....just because you're paranoid doesn't mean there's not a conspiracy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As I said, I leave the possiblity open for this being a case of his hack being blamed on the UI unfairly, I don't know the victim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If the UI came in a self extracting exe and you ran it to install the skin, it could have then installed a trojan or keystroke logger on the system.  It has happened with one of the skin installers so far that I have heard of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">tarnil is right.<br />
<br />
The skin it's self can't have a trojan horse of keystroke logger or anything like that in it. It's just pure data files, text and maybe graphics files. If the skin came with some sort of installed that could be infected by something or could install a trojan or key logger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You guys didnt read my message awhile back?<br />
<br />
its called bkdr_getpass.23<br />
<br />
<br />
here is my post....<br />
<br />
Here is the name and what it does. <br />
<br />
BKDR_GETPASS.23 <br />
then it renames itself to another file name &quot;This backdoor malware has been renamed to TROJ_GETPASS.23.&quot; to copy all your keystrokes. I emailed SOE about this in hopes they understand alittle more clearly whats going around EQ sites. <br />
<br />
Xp users can CTRL+SHIFT+F3 and check there process'es windows to see if the file name is running in the background. Also there is an easier way to stop this from happening. <br />
<br />
Install one of the known antivirus programs available such as my favorite &quot;PC-CILLIN 2002&quot; nortons, or the others. <br />
<br />
Here is a link to this type of virus floating around. <br />
<br />

<br />
Here is a link to the type of virus and how to rid of its existance. <br />
<br />
http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/virusencyclo/default5.asp?VName=TROJ_GETPASS.23 <br />
<br />
Since i have installed &quot;PC_CILLIN 2002&quot; and run the firewall, i have been NETBIOS searched, PINGATTACKED, CLOAKED from many of the same IP's... Much of it is on the Cable network, and other USA IP's. I have never had the popup again since i protect myself more now then before.... I can say i am virus safe ATM.... <br />
<br />
Good luck hope this info helps, honest players... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">btw guys the zip file contains the virus..... i emailed SOE about it awhile back and spammed known sites about the UI being downloaded from Trebars and the main UI sites... I just havent spent the time to locate which zip files... I do know it maybe placed in the best known UI's for shamans....<br />
<br />
