<br />
I can't seem to find Arbogast and Miller ever up. Right now there are two Arbogast's up on Trib, both holding a shimmering mace. I've been looking for these two for the last three days with no luck. Anyone know if they're spawning correctly and I'm just unlucky, or if they're bugged? Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go to Katta after the patch. Best way to find them up I think. There was a long thread about the Cloak of Truth -quest at the Safehouse, you might want to do some searches there.<br />
<br />
 Word of warning about the quest, just in case you didnt already know this:<br />
 Do not help anyone completing his Cloak quest if you still want to work on yours. <br />
 Aborgast and Miller are on &quot;the truth&quot; -faction, and completing the quest involves killing them both. When you kill Aborgast you take a negative &quot;the truth&quot; faction hit, and another as soon as Miller bites it. (Of course you can go around this with mem blur or /q) Those 2 hits will lower your faction enough to get your turn in items eaten, or enough so that the quest givers wont talk to you anymore, at least without sneak. <br />
 I helped a guildmate to complete his quest while I had the whole cloak done all the way to final turn in, which I never was able to do. My items got eaten and the GM's told this is done on purpose to prevent farming the quest...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lynnara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's bugged.  It sux... been holding onto that &quot;black wrapped item&quot; for over a month.  *sigh*<br />
<br />
My guildie went up to Katta a couple days ago and there were 6 Arbogasts up and no Miller.  Arbo was in the bank rather than the inn.  <br />
<br />
There were GMs in the zone who wiped all the Arbo's and repopped him, and he promptly said &quot;let's get going Miller&quot; and went to the bank.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think I saw somewhere that if you want to be able to do the quest more than once you should raise your Truth faction by doing the first part several times before continuing. Anyone know if that is doable?</div></div><hr />
