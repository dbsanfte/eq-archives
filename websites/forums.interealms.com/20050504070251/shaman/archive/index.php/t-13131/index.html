<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is reaching the stage now where HoT is becoming trivial, Vindi is killed with 18-24 people flawlessly, and we found on our first attempt that we can kill Dozekar with only one cleric. Now I know we're not uber and these aren't huge accomplishments, but to us they are a big step :)<br />
<br />
Whilst we would like to move into NToV soon, we are still equipping people with SS gear and aren't quite ready to trash our CoV faction. One thing we are looking at though is moving into Sleepers Tomb, via keys from Vindi/Statue and Velketors. They seem to be very rare drops so far, unless we've just been unlucky, so we  may move on to killing Zlandicar/Klandicar for keys too, and use Vindi to reset faction with CoV.<br />
<br />
Anyways... I'm wondering how worthwhile it is to get access to ST nowadays. The main attraction for our melees is the prismatic weapons that proc avatar... but we now have 3 shaman in the guild, 2 with avatar, and myself looking to ding 65 which I'm sure I will do before we get enough people keyed to do ST. <br />
<br />
Given that Ferine Avatar is a 40% upgrade to avatar, and has a 30 second (?? - Lucy says 60 seconds) recast time with no reagent cost, how worthwhile is Sleepers Tomb? I ask this in terms of:<br />
<br />
1. Prismatic Weapons, bearing in mind the ratios are worse than many PoP items so they're really just for the proc.<br />
2. Time taken to get keys<br />
3. Other loot<br />
4. Raid practice in a different zone.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts from people who have been there? Or from guilds who skipped ST, did you think you missed the items you could have got there, or was your time better spent elsewhere?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any info, opinions or whatever :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is a 60 second recast time on FA.   And in reality, keeping it up on all your melee is not at all likely.   Rogues and rangers (monks if you got few enough of the other 2), you will probably keep FA on them.   The warriors, SKs, and Pallies however aren't likely to get Avatar on raids, so Prismatic for them is a good deal.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Is it worth the timesink of getting in there though?   Well, your guild has to decide on that one themselves.   For my guild we decided we want to go into ST before heading for North, but while working on keys we are also doing West ToV named, so our CoV is totally trashed now :(<br />
<br />
<br />
   We did get a LONG ways into ST with a 5 person group though.   None of the ancients were up at the time, but we made it to a library area where we could have spawned out a Prismatic dropper.   It was late at night and we knew little about his stats so we decided to leave him for another day though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">slight hijack here....<br />
Does anyone know the spawn time on the named in ST? My guild has just started farming prismatics and with  a tracker camped there for 3 days now we can't find a named up.  Maybe the tracker just isnt in the right place, but knowing a time table would sure help.  I havent been able to find a good guide to ST either so if anyone has a link I am not opposed to having my fun  (CR's)  spoiled by reading someone else tips and hints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spawn time on stuff in ST is 7 days as far as I know. It is worth it to get melee keyed for the avatar weapons but the rest of the stuff that drops is marginal at best. Your Shamans may have ferine avatar or whatever but they may not have time to keep tons of people avatared on a raid. I know I don't but we don't have tons of Shaman on any raid either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Caanus.  Good thing you didnt spawn Milas with 5 people, you wouldve been in for a nasty shock.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Plain and simple, you'll find NToV, Ssra and tier 3+ a LOT harder without those primals.  It's worth the time you'll spend in there, and several items drop that are NToV-level armor pieces.  You won't enjoy the fights though and there's nill for content in ST....  It was a challenging dungeon for 60- but a raid of 65's can blow through it without too much of a challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>golumm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Having Avatar on all melees give  +15 or 20% to a raid DPS for a long fight , so ST IS worth it . You can't keep ALL melees with ferine on when you're on a 40+ raid ( what is needed for PoP bosses ) , you'll have more important things to do with the mana  ;)  .<br />
<br />
I think ST was on a 5 days repop when the Sleeper was still sleeping , in ST 2 I dunno  :confused:  .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We did NToV many times with no primals and no Ferine Avatar.  No problems, really, but we did have 60+ on most of the raids.<br />
<br />
We are now doing ST regularly and getting the Ancient Prismatics, and I'd say it is well worth it.  The melee are VERY happy with the procs, and Primal Avatar also drops, which is nice.<br />
<br />
On the first real ST trip 18 of us took down all the Ancients, btw.  It doesn't require huge numbers of people any more as long as they are pushing 65 and reasonably well-equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Caanus.  Good thing you didnt spawn Milas with 5 people, you wouldve been in for a nasty shock.   :D<br />

Whoa. Wierd. That my last name IRL. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Farming the ST keys of the three &quot;easy&quot; dragons, Zlandi, Klandi and LtK does not have to trash your CoV faction.  Zlandi give +CoV, and the hit from Klandi and LtK is about one level. Since Vinid is up 9 times for every spawn cycle of the dragons you can easily fix the faction (or at least keep it above kos, very important, once you have to start fighting into WToV you'll trash faction fast).<br />
Primal is still something of a status symbol for the mellee dummies, so I guess you will have to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Vindi drops shard very very rarely, statue normally drops it, as does tormax which I assume you will be able to take soon.<br />
Once you finish your SS quest item farming days, then the ST keys are worth it, Yeli is a fairly common target to be up.<br />
I got myself a toy spear from ST as well as a decent mask and neck in just a few trips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sleepers is well worth it.<br />
<br />
For one thing its a fun zone to hunt.  There are some decent drops there beyond prismatic.<br />
<br />
The main reason to go is to equip melee with prismatic weapons, and to get primal avatar for shaman to stop wasting emeralds :)<br />
<br />
One of my guilds rangers tells me that on a named mob where he uses trueshot, the difference between having avatar and not is about 10k for him alone.<br />
<br />
Thats more than most of your melee will increase their dps, but the difference is definately visible.  Mobs die faster.  Fights that were close become comfortable.<br />
<br />
On the other hand it takes a while to get 2-3 groups keyed up to start hitting sleepers.  I think its worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks to everyone who posted above, there's some very interesting and useful information :) I'm looking forward to seeing a new zone, although it'll probably be a few months before we get enough people keyed for it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My biggest problem with ST is it's boring, very very boring. <br />
<br />
Basically the mobs have very low damage output, and lots of hp.  So what you end up with is long fights that are not exciting in anyway.  I can't speak for the 4 warders, cause I haven't seen them yet, but thats my experience with the boss golems and the yard trash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">st is borring but still fun.  im still waiting for a 2hb argh 1 hasnt dropped in a month :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For you personally, ST is a joke. You won't get anything decent there. It is nice to see it, but it also gets old. Try and demuur any future ST keypiece to another shammy, let him deal with the headache.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As has been said, ST is 100 percent worth it. Even if you have better weapons, use prysmatics until they proc then bag them. Every monk, rogue and ranger should have one (rangers 2). Especially in longer fights where repops are an issue (read: ssra), 10-20% extra dps is huge. <br />
<br />
Plus, the quests are OK, as are some of the secondary drops. <br />
<br />
And if you get a click stick, it's not slow and boring at all. Well worth 10 charges to kill the 4 ancients 10 times, the farm motg-prog as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Without access to ST you will never finish your Franklin Mint Collectable Avatar Set, complete with 3 versions you will never ever cast once you get Ferine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">LOL valka, but true yes.  <br />
<br />
I say it's worth it to get ST keys, but you need to stop worrying about trashing your CoV faction and just GO FOR IT.  If you are capable of downing Yelinak (doubtful) you should be doing him too for some decent loot and a ST key.  You need to be doing Zland and Kland as well as Vindy and Statue.  You probably won't win vs. Tormax until you get more primals and have a pretty solid CH rotation and a good MA with plenty hps, but he also drops a key every dam time.  <br />
<br />
Basically the &quot;next step&quot;(TM) is NToV, in which you will find a loot candyland, but in which you will completely hose your CoV faction beyond reasonable repair.  So you, as a guild, need to decide if you are ready to take the next step and start pharming ST keys and then ST for prismatics.  If so, you need to just go for it and deal with faction hits as they come.  Keep after Vindy and you'll keep faction decent.  This step takes a while tho folks, but it's necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Valka continues to make me laugh. And he's right ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Afterthought:<br />
<br />
Land, you of all people should know well that it is far more than possible to pass up 99% of the velious experience if you just go from Kunark Dragons to Luclin. Or Skip Lucy and go Velious - PoP. No one expansion is nesessary to advance. <br />
<br />
But is sure a hell of alot more fun.<br />
<br />
Frankly, there is something about watching a dragon die that STILL cranks my tractor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have still never seen regular or primal avitar drop, getting a rune and ending up with ferine is more common than either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The ancients drop nice loot other than just primals.  We're doing ST now, it's really improving our guild to get the primals and other stuff.  If you learn how to do Sontalak you can get keys pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I dont think primals are neccesary for NToV or Tormaxx or to progress past them, but its still a nice dps boost if every melee on your raids is procing primals. <br />
<br />
Shaman wont be able to keel FA up on all the melees in a raid, there are usually a)too few of us arond and b)too many melees. I suppose if your guild is bursting at the seams with shaman with FA scribed then hell.. good for you.. least you can add some dps to a raid that way,  since you wont do it any other way on most mobs =p.<br />
<br />
I think ST and primals are worth it.. its just too fn trivial once you are keyed to really uber up some melees.. specially if you park a magebot down there to CoH you down. gank 3 warders and get out again.. like a 2 hour max event to make alot of melees really happy and boost their overall dps significantly. If your server isnt full of dicks that woke up the sleeper there are other things like SoD's, monk robes, gnome masks, salindrite daggers. Heh.. I have a primal warhammer.. wish I could mq it to my bst =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">do ntov until your mt has all items not replaceable from killing statue/aow<br />
<br />
kill statue/aow move on to ssra<br />
<br />
kill ssra until you're in vt, give mt a bunch of itams and all ft to wizards clerics druids<br />
<br />
repeat in PoP<br />

You've beat EverQuest!</div></div><hr />
