Was posted on mage boards but, looks like alot of people don't have a clue what their class is supposed to be anymore, including the Devs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ogru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">...including the Devs  <br />
<br />
This should have the word &quot;obvious&quot; in great big letters surrounding every side.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seems that it would be pretty hard to develop something without knowing exactly what it is you are developing.  Almost seems like a Dilbert comic strip...  This is my guess as to why every expansion with new spells is just a rehash +10% of the old spell line.<br />
<br />
This is what I imagined in my head when I saw the new druid DD slated for OOW:<br />
<br />
Dev1: Hey, I am making this really great new druid spell.  I figure they already have some cold direct damage spells, so I don't see the harm of adding a new one but increasing the damage by 10%.<br />
<br />
Dev2: Sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
Dev3: What's a shaman?<br />
<br />
Dev1: Anyone have a name for a really cold ball of water??</div></div><hr />
