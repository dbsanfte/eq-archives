<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I highly recommand anyone hasn't invested in this ability get it asap.<br />
<br />
From my experience:<br />
1) The cast time is about 3 seconds. Recast time is 2 minutes.<br />
2) It roots the mob for 1 min at level one.<br />
3) It is NOT unresistable!<br />
3) It is NOT unbreakable!<br />
<br />
Sounds like crap doesn't it? So why get it?<br />
<br />
Because it roots and knocks your target a few steps away from you and somehow get rid of agro in the same time.<br />
<br />
When u r in a group, u slow too fast, dots too much and get the mob super mad at u, cast VP, viola, agro gone.<br />
<br />
Let me know if anyone have different experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's a useful and FUN AA  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've not noticed it clearing any aggro, but its certainly a very useful AA. I often don't mem root now because I have this, although it is, as you say, resistable.<br />
<br />
The knockback effect is a big big bonus. Considering its only 3AA (or is it 2?) I recommend it to everyone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's ALWAYS entertaining to see the look on the rogue's face when the mob he was just backstabbing backstabs HIM.  (hey, with all the grouping, ya gotta have some fun SOMEHOW)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've noticed an aggro reducer with VP.  Try it using a mob that has a large attack range, so that even with the knockback you're still in melee range.  What I've found is that after VP, the mob switched to dogdog even though I was still in melee range.  It's extremely helpful for when grinding with a warrior and you slow a little too quickly.  Mob comes to you, you VP it back into place and it's back on the MT.  I like VP more and more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye to all that has been said.  VP is an effective way to root a mob for a short period of time.  I don't think it puts you lower on the hate list, it just places the mob in the vicinity of someone else who should get the hate.  Since it is fairly easily broken, it usually doesn't cause too much problems with aggro management.  Its resistance is disease based, however, so don't use it in PoD or CoD, it will be resisted almost every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the tip, Gardeltron - just got my CoD key, that'll be good to know.  ;)<br />
<br />
Another HUGE bonus I find with this ability is that I'll often find myself very much needing a root, to realize that I took it down for some reason.  Now, as much fun as it is to sit down and swap out spells (IN TEH FACE) in this situation, it's just kinda slick to push him back and park him beforehand.</div></div><hr />

Er... I dont think its an agro reducer. I think, because its root, the rooted mob attacks the closest player. The thing about the pet is puzzling though. If the mob has a huge melee range it should still attack you over pet if knockbacked and still in range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Root is 100% proximity aggro. Doesn't matter who is highest on the hate list. With the knockback, the pet ends up closer because he auto-tracks to it.<br />
<br />
I have root on my pants, so I never bothered with VP AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is also useful for moving a mob, either for positioning reasons or to stop one about to gate. A little trick, say you have a mob that is stuck in a corner and no one seems to be able to pull him out. Position yourself in front of the mob facing AWAY from him (looking in the direction you want him to be moved to) cast VP on him and he will be &quot;knocked back&quot; in the direction you are facing.. out of the corner. The knockback effect uses Your position when it moves the mob.. it pushes the mob away from you in the direction you are facing not necesarrily knocking the mob backwards.<br />
<br />
VP uses a disease check for resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Me and another shaman in the guild use it for mob placement. Great for jammin mobs in a corner or bringing them out of wall since its directional.  Face away from the mob and you can pull a mob toward you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't confusing at all.  If the mob attacked you, your pet will go after it (unless you call him off).  If you VP him, the pet will run to his root position and attack.  Rooted aggro is whomever is closest.  Therefore, your pet will always be closest while attacking (he attacks with his mouth, so he's even closer than other pets, and far closer than tanks).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wish the cast time were a little faster.<br />
<br />
It's a decent AA, worth picking up along the way, and it is nice having a root up when you don't have the spell loaded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have root on my ring, but it's not as good as VP in any way.  VP is DISEASE RESIST which in some zones against some mobs will make it worse, but in other zones against mobs that are highly MR, it's a good opening strategy.  I use it along with Malicious Decay to controll a difficult mob from the beginning.  I stand a ways away and zap first with fast casting MD, then (no 2.5 recast time on AAs) immediately hit my VP button and if I can get 3 seconds before the mob reaches me it will be rooted and I'll be safe for a while.  I use the spell to split things too, as it often lands reliably without any debuffing in places where magic based roots bounce repeatedly.  <br />
Example, the Shadowmaster Hendin ogres and the like are easily rooted with VP, but resist magic pretty bad before Malo is in.  It's funny on a guild raid to see two incoming, choose one, and root it before it gets to the raid, so it stands there looking all dumb while its buddy gets smooshed by 50 lvl 65s players.  Magic based root can't do that.  <br />
<br />
It's the single most valuable PoP skill I have.  Second most valuable would be Radiant Cure, which I trained to level 2 since it was so nifty.  Spiritcall is something I often forget to use . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">it's  good  for  place a mob,  or  root quick a rushing mob  :)</div></div><hr />

Flargly is correct.  VP is NOT an aggro reducer.  It just simply pushes the mob and roots it away from you and then those PCs or NPC in proximity are smacked around instead of you.  But I have found that its 2-3 min. refresh is too long when it comes to a bad tank (in a chain group) that doesn't hold aggro properly even with waiting a bit before slowing.  Still a neat toy for soloing.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for explaining that, I guess I had always assumed that I would retain aggro over dogdog if in melee range, but the explanation that &quot;mob goes for closest target when rooted&quot; explains the aggro change to dogdog after VP.<br />
<br />
Now I know, and knowing is half the battle.  Yoooo Joe!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Hail,<br />
<br />
I have found VP very useful in certain situations.  I was extremely happy with it initially.  Now I still enjoy it, but it isn't as wonderful as I first thought.<br />
<br />
In Valor/Storms, it is extremely effective to root park an add without having to waste a gemslot on Greater Immobilize or Petrifying Earth.  If the puller has problems bringing back multiple (more than two) mobs, you still have to keep a root spell memorized for safety in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I have found VP to be of limited use in HoH, BoT, and Tactics.  Many of the times VP will get resisted, or the mobs are immune to snare/root.  I may then actually be worse off if I don't have a root spell memorized &amp; I was counting on VP for cc.<br />
<br />
I think VP is an excellent investment in AA's early if you are grouping or soloing in Tier2 or below.  I don't begrudge the points spent in it (rather late in my AA progression), but I'm using it less now in Tier3 than I thought I would be.  The knockback effect is fun to use though, especially with a Warrior MA grouped to push the mob off of yourself and right back where the warrior is standing.  <br />
<br />
It is a good ability to have, and doesn't cost much to get.  Nice tool to add to the belt.  If you have scaled Avatar legs though, it is probably not worth the points unless you are finding GI bouncing alot.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hehe,<br />
<br />
Yep, fun ...<br />
<br />
I recite words from the Cha cha slide song while using this in groups  :p <br />
<br />
Tekno tells the group &quot;Slide to the right&quot;<br />
SK sighs.<br />
Rogues starts steaming.<br />
Cleric laughs.<br />
Enchanter looks boggled.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
2 mins later<br />
.<br />
.<br />
Tekno tells the group &quot;Slide to the left&quot;<br />
.<br />
.<br />
Tekno tells the group &quot;2 hops this time, 2 hops this time&quot;<br />
<br />
