I don't normally link to posts in our forums (actually I don't think I ever did this).  Moreover, I have made it a point to try to stay officially neutral in most of the debates that have raged about the game over the years, and instead have tried to provide a forum where people could debate free of influence or censorship and provide plain game information for those who prefer to just stay out of the debates altogether.  So this is a double whammy.  Some of you may know from other forum posts that I have consistently turned down offers from certain platinum for cash sites for large and lucrative ad deals and even for the actual purchase of the site.  Why?  I believe that, while the sale of plat and items for cash on a small scale is fairly harmless, these large conglomerates have far too much power over the game to be tolerated or to be allowed to enter the mainstream of our community, and I have not wanted to give even the limited stamp of approval an ad on our site might provide (not to mention that our wonderful premium members give me the business flexibility to turn down their offer and still pay our bills).  This post, which was actually a repost of something posted on the Safehouse, seemed to sum up my thoughts on the matter pretty well (and I will note that even if the program this poster describes does not exist, it is possible to do what he describes totally by hand, which has always been my concern), so I decided to link to it and say I support the jist of what it is saying.  I believe this is one of the most serious issues to be faced not only by Everquest but by the whole MMORPG community in years.  Here's the post.  <br />

now, lets make this plain.  i don't know if this thread had made it's way here, i looked; but didn't see it.<br />
<br />
second, i don't actually care.  i don't have any pony in this horse race and am still at the low end of gear so i am not affected.<br />
<br />
others might find it of interest.  it is for that purpose i posted it.</div></div><hr />
