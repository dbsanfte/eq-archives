<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, it really does.  Seems like half of the people in it are 10 year olds.  And then they go and talk smack about druids... well I've played a druid and a monk to 60, a pally to 52, rogue, ench, necro, and a few others to 30+, and NO serverwide class channel in all of EQ is as intolerable as this one.  Granted there are a few who make it 10x worse than it would be, most notably those from the legends server (figures that the biggest idiots in channel are the same idiots who pay sony 3x normal price for the same sh*t eh?).  Ignore only goes so far, when there are but a precious few 30 spaces in that list.  Lastly, please - if you're a normal person in the channel, don't respond to Lenine, Redspeed, Ocatopa, Tikoko, or any of the other idiots - They've earned a spot in my ignore list for a reason, and I don't want to think about them.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, this topic was discussed a few days ago.  For the most part the people on the board agree it isn't a true representation of what goes on here.  There is a simple solution to fix your problem with the channel channel over ignore, just don't join. <br />
 I have found that with all the other stuff I do I am to busy at times to join the channel.   I have visited other channels and no they typically aren't any better.  The same &quot;ten year olds&quot; are in all of them, ever been to the sk channel? What about the rogue channel?   This is a game where there are a large variety of people that range in ages.  Its just easiest to ignore rather than coming onto a message board and making yourself look like a ten year old as you put it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Whats the crucible channel name?<br />
<br />
And don't worry... I'm well past the age of ten.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ITS A shaman channel.not the crucible channel.they are only related in that shaman go on both. if you remember this you wont be as dissapointed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">;join serverwide.crucible:crucible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you haven't been in the wizard channel then I take it..<br />
<br />
<br />
heh, some true druid haters in there. :)  But I agree, near all chat channels are going to **** now. Just a bunch of idiots spamming to get attention, and to try and make people mad at them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I joined the channel for all of 2 minutes a few months ago. I quickly left and have never gone back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ignore function works wonders.  You can make almost any channel go from a spamfest to a place where some intelligence may be found</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">god if you have a problem with it dont join the ****ing channel, ok?<br />
<br />
also, /ignore stormhammer.redspeed - and give me your name and server too, because im pretty sure you have nothing interesting to contribute to the chat either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">lolz<br />
<br />
<br />
This has already been posted, reposting it to look high and mighty and make yourself look cool / get attention??<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, Please update your magelo red, I want to see your new stufff... yuo told me you had more HP than me jsut want to see how.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i lied lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think someone else is trying to get attention. Perhaps they didn't get enough from their parents? :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Silvergun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Originally posted by Fozy <br />
Yes, this topic was discussed a few days ago.  For the most part the people on the board agree it isn't a true representation of what goes on here...<br />
<br />
This is true.  The previous several posts, however, ARE a good representation of the posturing on the channel lately, so make your own decision. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Quackers01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think what would improve the serverwide.crucible channel alot would be to ban some shaman, quellious.gurck from it, his useless blather is unnecessary and a friend of mine from quell told me hes only like 40... seriously ****</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When it comes down to it...the crucible channel has been very helpful for me for the most part, but there are those times that it gets out of hand with the constant dumbasses flaming people at every opportunity.  There are two people that I know off hand that have answered every question that I have ever asked if they know the answer, and also are willing to sit down and /tell me the correct solution or give helpful advice if asked.  Those two names are Glorianna and Arrianna.  I apologize if I mispelled your names.  There are a few others in the channel that I know help whenever needed, but unfortunetly I cannot remember your names at this time.<br />
<br />
So, like what was said, there are a few select individuals out there that are really dumb..but for the most part I can get the answers that I request fairly quickly if I need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">All these &quot;serverwide.crucible suxor !&quot; threads make me want to put it back on my autojoin and do my part to (try to) increase its quality.<br />
<br />
Of course, that means enduring 100 cha jokes a minute...but I guess I can try.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Crucible is funny, you guys suck for whining about it, if you're too rigid to find humor in their goofyness then we don't want your lame ass in our chat channel -- ps. Legitimate shaman information is still discussed constantly.</div></div><hr />
