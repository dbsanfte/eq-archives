<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hayrab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
     I have a RL friend who wants to start playing EQ with me and he started a Iksar Shaman. I have about 20,000 plat to twink him with and want to get him some stuff that will do him good at low level like +mana so he can fly through those levels and get his own stuff at high level ( I might help him with that later too). Since I play a rogue I really have no idea what to twink him with other than +mana (not sure the best items/price on these). So I was just hoping you guys could give some good insight on what some kickass gear would be to twink a shaman with for 20kpp.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">regen &gt; any mana 1-40<br />
<br />
Iksar regen bp, ac/hp rings, a decent spear, some seb scale gear, bone mask, chardok shoulders, monkey idol, sbs, any ear will do, though the mana/ac ears are prime, and any ole headpiece. <br />
<br />
Well below 20k in gear unless you're rushed, and a nice setup for the scaly little fella that will last him for quite some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">step 1. give 10k to me.<br />
<br />
step 2. for a shaman, hp=mana from canni. so regen hp and +hp are the best things you can get.<br />
<br />
you can't afford a fungi so a iksar regen bp would be nice, 6/65 rings, JB gear except for BP/legs. for legs i think seb scale is the twinkage of choice. nice ac on it. for a weapon try a jade prod, or if you wanna be expensive, try a rune etched icewurm fang. i'd suggest a clay guardian shield for secondary.<br />
<br />
for earrings, 25hp/35 mana are good. black sappire i think?<br />
<br />
hope that helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman don't need very much at the low levels, I decked out my real life friend in a set of banded, slimey harpoon and a CGS, she flew up to 14 in one day (which is good PLing for me, I rarely do it!)<br />
<br />
* haste<br />
* iksar regen bp (since you can't afford a fungi)<br />
* fast piercer like rune etched ice wurm fang<br />
* since he's an iksar, sebilite scale from OS would be nice and not too pricey (arms, legs)<br />
* spider belt from VL<br />
* artic wyvern mask/enshrouded veil/bone mask of the jarsath<br />
* pair of velium fire opal rings<br />
* clay guardian shield (dirty cheap)<br />
* goranga idol/howling harpoon for range (is the new pottery CT range item any good?)<br />
* electrum black sapphire earrings<br />
* ivory collar from chardok<br />
* tattered mantle or obulus death shroud (very nice item now with the focus effect)<br />
* dragon skin bracers from WW (worked, heavy, whatever)<br />
* I never have any good cloaks to recommend, I wore a mammoth til I get a lodi, are there decent Luclin cloaks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&gt;&gt;is the new pottery CT range item any good?<br />
<br />
AC 5, STR 7, WIS 5, INT 5, mana 30<br />
<br />
The str is nice for a race that's often encumbered at low levels, but then you can get some nice str plus hp from some Sarnak Prayer Beads for that slot.</div></div><hr />

What Glori said.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">prolly better to get a velium black sapphire necklace  instead of ivory collar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Might as well put him on the path to AC/hitpoint shaman godhood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Talista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">pfft Jent get off the shaman boards you DRUID!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For what everyone recommended, you should come in well under 20k.<br />
<br />
Use the extra to buy him an iksar beserker club and a drakkel icegrinder.  The IBC starts proccing at level 10 a very nice spell that adds to defense and offense, making you temporarily much harder to hit, which is a nice way to get out of trouble; plus it's just a good weapon at 7/18; the fast ratio will get his 1hb up very fast and it puts out a lot more damage than you would think because of its speed.  They're less than 1k on my server.<br />
<br />
The drakkel icegrinder 2hb is nice and fast for a non-uber 2hb and proc's a DD I think starting at level 1, and quite often.  I've gotten it to proc 5 times a fight; the DD hits for 30, if I remember.<br />
<br />
Shamans can do very well with ALL their weapons, so it's wise to build them all up, and pretty inexpensive.  The rune etched icewurm fang is pretty expensive and it doesn't proc at low levels, but at 12/19 it will last your shaman up until he gets his epic.  Goes for around 4-8k on my server -- prices fluctuate wildly.  Don't overpay, but get it sometime.<br />
<br />
Remember that shamans melee very well in early levels(heck, mine meleed with only 120 wisdom all the way to level 52), so don't hesitate to encourage your friend to get in there and mix it up physically.  That will raise his defense too, which the standard shaman powerleveling ruins.  He will have a terrible time soloing and a rough time playing in general if his defense gets too far behind.</div></div><hr />
