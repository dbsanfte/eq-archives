<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Biizz Buuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've found a great solo spot(although you can still partner with a melee for great exp)!Its in gd, and you kill drakkel dire wolves.Head down the river from thurgadin a little bit until you see a weird hut thing take a left and go straight and you should see some weird artifact thing. Behind you is a hill, up there is a safe spot to pull to, in front of you is where all the wolves wander!The exp here at 29 is great, all wolves are even-yellow, they hardly resist(Less than the dwarves in OOT which are blue) and its not a spawn timer, they're almost always one up to pull when you want to.<br />
I just pull with malise, run to the safe spot, root, Poison, Disease, apply root and poison when needed, maybe nuke near the end.Remember to build your defense skill also!<br />
Great things:<br />
Good exp, mobs always up, very easy kills(although take a while), merchants one zone away, build faction. And my favorite.<br />
A BANK ONE ZONE AWAY!(Being an iksar banks are usally far and few)</div></div><hr />

I am a bit of a newb when it comes to Velious...is travel to this spot dangerous? Also, what is Kael faction? I looked on Allakhazam's for this faction and couldn't find it. I am a barbarian, with allegiance to The Tribunal. Would you recommend this spot for me??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jestice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pay the plat for a port, Velious is imho the best expanision to the game.  <br />

Get to the Great Divide and you can either hunt the wolves as the above post or start on the Tizmarks.  There is a bank, and almost full services only a short distance away, and the possiblility of getting a group exists - though they are few and far between.  My suggestion is to get a friend - I perfer rangers or paladins - and kill Tizmaks 'til about 33 or 34.  Then move to the Eastern Wastes (with the same friend) and there you can fight Ulthorks and Wulrus's.  Or maybe even venture into the Crystal Caverns.  On the whole the Tizmarks and the Ulthorks drop pretty decent loot (Velium Wepons) and a good group in CC is awesome.  Wolves are about the same xp - but only reward you with faction - which a few good nites in the Giant City of Kael can easily be attained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gamanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Isn't there a Nexus spire in GD now, not far from the spot you mention? I haven't used it myself, so I don't know for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EQShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes. just go to the nexus and land on GD<br />
<br />
(spire is same as Odus. it just altern destination odus/velius)</div></div><hr />

I gotta agree on this. Drakkel Dire Wolves may be soloable at 29 but probably not mana efficient, hence not the best exp. Tizzies are good lvl 30+. At 34 I'm killing Dire Wolves and am making good experience on them. Plenty to pull and that nice little ridge near the obelisk to pull to. Most are dark blue to me with the occasional white con. You could probably do them earlier but the pet makes things much easier :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
May I ask why its not mana efficient?  (I'm not trying to argue, just asking because I don't know)<br />
<br />
Also, if i'm getting powerlevelled by a 56 cleric (good heals and can nuke them to death once they're below 50%) would this be a good choice?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fortay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I must say this is an excellent spot for exp. The kael wolves run very slow, hardly resist spells and I can even solo reds and yellows with about three blues of mana left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well...as I said..the pet makes it easier...like a free DoT. Also the 34 DoT and Buffs are gonna help, and obviously less resists. Not saying you cant take these at 29.....just saying it isn't necessarily mana efficient compared to other camps.<br />
<br />
That aside....with a 56 Cleric you got no problems...go camp Sea Furies ;)</div></div><hr />
