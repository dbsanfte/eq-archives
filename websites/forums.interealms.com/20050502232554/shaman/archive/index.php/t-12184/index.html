<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I never had any problems with landing slow in PoN (from 49-52) <br />
but since i dinged 53 this weekend I am having major problems landing a slow on a mob (about 70-80% off the time resist)<br />
<br />
has there been any changes to resists? or did the Random Number Generator cause me bad luck yesterday?<br />
<br />
when the mage (lvl60) in the group started to mala every incomming mob, slow landed without problem</div></div><hr />

At 59 I'm still casting malosini on every mob before trying to slow.  If it's resisted, I go ahead and cast slow while it's refreshing but I've found that debuffing prior to slow is mandatory in the planes if you want it to stick.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In PoN on saturday my slows were landing 2/3 of the time at level 48.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gotta say its the RNG, and I think its fubar'd.  Somehow the mid 50's I think I was getting more resists in places than early 50's and 60-61.<br />
<br />
I have a guildy who has a shaman bot, he's been slowing no problem in poi at 47-50.</div></div><hr />

Bad luck.  I had the same problems with PoZ's in Kael the other night, who I slowed without a problem 10 levels ago.<br />

It's really not necessary for every mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree I never debuff any of the mobs in general when hutning tier 1. Only with a wizzy or other nuker around do I do that. Never had a problem landing a slow really either although occasionally you get a mob thats resistant but very rarely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yellow mobs have a HUGE increased resistance factor, check to see if the mobs have turned yellow instead of red from turning 53.  When I was much lower I was noticing the same thing in UP, I could slow the reds with total ease, first cast everytime, but I couldn't land a slow on a yellow to save my life.  I personally think its a bug in the coding, but its prolly working as intended.<br />

*edit,  not just UP,  same in KC, CoM, Planes, you name it, its not unique to UP zone</div></div><hr />
