<br />
Make no sense to me why the level spread is so great, how annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pox at 59 is useful...<br />
<br />
You'll want to stack pox and bane a lot I think.<br />
<br />
Then at 63, tears is a nice, nice rain spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yah I was kinda cheesed about the spread too, but nothing really to be done about it except head to 64-65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's not a math contest to calculate the exact same number of levels between upgrades.  They were giving us a new poison and a new disease dot that will carry us through the back half of the game, when we are going to be lvl 65 the WHOLE TIME.  So naturally the dots are powerful, and therefore they are higher level.<br />
<br />
If they gave them to us at 61, they wouldn't be as good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Through the history of shamans, we've been given our new DOT spells sparsely. Why would it be any different at the higher levels? <br />
<br />
Tainted breath 9<br />
Envenomed Breath 24<br />
Venom of the Snake 39<br />
Envenomed Bolt 49<br />
Bane of Nife 56<br />
Blood of Saryrn (?) 65<br />
<br />
Sicken 9<br />
Affliction 19<br />
Scourge 34<br />
Plague 49<br />
Pox 59<br />
Breath of Ulthor 64<br />
<br />
It seems like quite a consistent level spread to me. Bane and Pox seem good enough to carry me to 65/65, for the limited amount I solo. The fact is that I (with a KEI buff) I solo for exp FAR faster than I get group exp, usually - root rott'ing in PoP with our dot's. So they must not suck too badly. I'd much rather get powerful dot's at 64/65 than weaker ones at 61/62. They gave us nukes and a new pet at the lower levels, and dot's at the highest levels, as they're our strongest attacks. If they gave us dot's 61/62 and nukes at 64/65, then our nukes would have to end up our strongest attack spells - which doesn't fit the shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Minor detail - Sicken is a level 5 spell. :)<br />
<br />
We do get Scourge of Nife at 60, which does roughly 300 more points of damage over Bane of Nife. But I guess the the number of Shaman that have that spell is too low for it to be used in a balance discussion. That said, if it you're really bothered about not having a DoT upgrade for that long, you *do* have the option of working for SoN.<br />
