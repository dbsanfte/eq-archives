<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How cool would it be to have an AE knockback AA?  <br />
<br />
Any thoughts I would think with crowd control etc shaman should get some sort of AE root knockback.  It wouldn't be mez by any means, but it would put us back in the game as a good crowd control means.  With AE slow and than and AA AE knockback I was thinking it would make the game interesting.  Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>starkje</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">would be nice for those enormous overpulls sometimes :) (both on raids as well as groups LoL)</div></div><hr />

Imagine the aggro.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zyzygy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">pbae knockback root anyone?<br />
<br />
that would be funny.  all the mobs just fly back in a circular pattern.  like an expanding circle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">that would be incredibly useful.  Probably too useful actually.  It would make a shaman one of the premier CC classes in one blow.  VP being DR resist just isn't resisted that much on live mobs.  And Malicious Decay ensures its 2 minute duration (with full AA's) on almost everything that doesn't fully resist disease.  So using that proposed AE VP ability, I'd be able to knock back up to 4 mobs, then slap MD on them one after another until each was firmly rooted for 2 minutes.  Then using regular VP to re-root anything that broke root.  Would be an incredible means of doing ghetto CC.  <br />
I would definitely be in favor of such an ability, but I frankly doubt we'd get it.  Too powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd be much more in favor of an PBAE AA slow.<br />
<br />
Class AA:  Disease based, 8 minute refresh timer, 3 levels, 3/6/9 cost structure.<br />
<br />
AE slow1:  30% slow, duration 2 minutes<br />
AE slow2:  40% slow, duration 3 minutes<br />
AE slow3:  50% slow, duration 4 minutes<br />
<br />
These would let a shaman take the edge off the mobs long enough to hit them with a REAL slow...that, or get aggro off untagged mobs and die, but die leaving them all slowed.  ;)<br />
<br />
Given that slow is our primary weapon, and BL's have clicky slow, it's only fair to give us an AE slow AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In defense of it being to powerful don't you think we should get it.  I mean really think about it.  Shaman get the AE ability to slow.  Granted it is resisted how much aggro do we get.  It is almost instant death.  IF we get an ability to do what it is we were intended to do it would be great.  I mean think about I doubt that it would land 100 percent of the time.  Even VP3 lands probably half the time dependent on what zone and mobs you are fighting.  I wouldn't think it would be overpowering at all.  In fact I think it would help bring us back into the balance of things.  If you do get resisted on it you will probably die.  So as I see it it wouldn't be used to over power the game.  If you could use it and than get slow landed it would be in emergencies anyways.  I doubt people would risk it unless needed.  If you used it once and than you died, there really isn't a means of saying it is to powerful. Or you could just have a really long recast time on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That would be way way way too much fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That would be cool but I would be happy with &quot;just&quot; an AE malxxx. I have wanted that forever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PB AE Malos, PB AE slow, and PB AE knockback root all have two things in common.<br />
<br />
They are all incredibly useful, and the chance of them being implimented is inversely proportional to their usefulness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">AE knockback/root and an AE malos would ROCK!!<br />
Therefore I doubt we'll ever get them. I'm sure it would upset the delicate balance between the classes.<br />
<br />
Our AE slow spell is ok...it has its uses and also includes an agro reducer. But that is on another thread.</div></div><hr />
