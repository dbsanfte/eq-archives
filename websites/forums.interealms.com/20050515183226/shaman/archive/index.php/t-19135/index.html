<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its crap.  Don't waste your points.<br />
<br />
It lasts five minutes unfocused and is usable every two hours without Hastened Rabidity which knocks id down twelve minutes every level.  I think you can BARELY outdamage your buffed, armed pet with Rabid Bear and a good weapon, if you don't have a good weapon, well ... the odes of sadness to this AA are legendary.</div></div><hr />

This post sums up my thoughts on Rabid Bear (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19061)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With a good weapon, FA and haste, you will do pretty much the same damage as Rabid Bear, minus the Tainted Bite which does such minor damage, and is resisted by a lot of mobs to begin with.  I got Rabid Bear cause I thought it would be fun to be able to melee some, don't waste your AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">its ok as a toy, you get like double attack. But its only for 5 mins and even with a decent weapon its notoriously bad. Plus Ferine Avatar don't stack with it pff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It really sucks, but it's fun anyways.  Running up to stuff and yelling &quot;ROAR&quot; and pulling aggro off the MA on gods because that stupid proc adds disease counters is always a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You know, it's kinda really sucky, but I still don't regret having it + hastened rabidity.<br />
<br />
There are times when five easy blue mobs are on you and you really can't afford to cast much-- so you break out your boneshod greatstaff, click your shrunken goblin skull earring, and rabid bear to kill them off.<br />
<br />
It's not bad at all for cases like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have no intentions of getting it ever..  I'm at like 170+ aa's now and simply can't envision wasting points on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got it back when luclin was out.. I think I got it right after qb3(which was after canni)<br />
<br />
It blows. Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I bought Rabid Bear for duelling and messing about. I should have really bought some pet aa with the points, but I just HAD to see how bad it was ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if you guys want it to get looked at feedback it  <br />
<br />
propose to them that we want 250 skill mods in 1hb 2hb and peirceing <br />
<br />
that increses our proc rate o weapons Plus your base hit / miss have themn throw out the useless + cold resist and put that in!!!!!! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and tell them to lower the reuse tiem and MABY it will be worthwhile <br />
<br />
if any of you want it to be looked at keep feedbacking thats the only way you will get any voice into actually getting what you want</div></div><hr />
