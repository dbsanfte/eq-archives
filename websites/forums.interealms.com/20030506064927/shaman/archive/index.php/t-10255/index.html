<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I hit 65 a while ago, and Ive been bored ever since ... don't feel like XPing anymore so Ive been thinking what I can do for fun. The other day I went and pharmed Efreeti lord in solb for a bit but that got old soon.<br />
<br />
Any of you guys have any ideas of new/old world places to pharm some nice things so I can get some PP going. Or in general just fun camps to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sebilis wouldn't be bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What in sebilis tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dive right in , the water is fine. Swim around and see what you see</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Excidium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">only  thin g i usually try for in Seb is NG  but it always  seems to be  camped   =(    PoG  is good for cash also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">PoG Is Nice <br />
<br />
Plus you can get your very own flame on the server message boards too =)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
And what flame would that be.<br />
<br />
I'd love to solo seb but im worried about gaters n **** like that.<br />
<br />
what about HS? Anything soloable there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Flame would be people whining about PoG being reserved for raids, and there are always a batch of people the get po'ed when anyone solos there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Basically anywhere in Sebilis but the best spots would be NG/Pyramid (which is rarely open, it seems) and Crypt/Emperor (but you need a rogue to pick the lock to get down there).<br />
<br />
PoG is more difficult than Sebilis but far better for cash drops.  It's not something that is booked on my server, so that's not a problem.<br />
<br />
Find a friend or two, with one of you on giant faction, and you can farm dragon's heads in Western Wastes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So what if you solo a few mobs jeez thats just lame.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I try sebilis sometime then.<br />
<br />
And locked doors is not a problem to me ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mazirus Slaymaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">PoG flames = if you solo you will be making mobs pop up near ozne once there like on other side of tunare tree and it pisses people off :).. i think im gonna do pog next time i have some raid buffs and lfg.. i did some soloing on tunar raid once, wasnt too hard and i was 60 as well.. should be np specially with c5 and virtue :)</div></div><hr />

pffft don't go spreading these lies.  Duoing every dragon in WW w/ an AM3 ranger is an absolutely terrible idea and no one should ever try it.  ever.  especially on solusek ro.</div></div><hr />
