<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PabstScrapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You can argue which is better till the end of time.<br />
With a little Magelo/EQmaps research, this is what I found.<br />
<br />
You may be suprised, what I did was equipted a cloth shirt (4ac) and calculated my base HP/Mana AC and resists.<br />
<br />
Here are the results (of course this may vary with your total STA/WIS/AGI)<br />
<br />
Chestplate of Vindication:<br />
HP's (boosts) +114<br />
Mana (boosts) +0<br />
AC (boosts) +64<br />
Resists (boosts) +15 to all<br />
Effect: +2 hp a tick for a long duration and 10attack<br />
<br />
Wolf Caller's Breastplate:<br />
HP's (boosts) +64<br />
Mana (boosts) +265<br />
AC (boosts) +62<br />
Resists (boosts) +4 to all<br />
Effect: +50 to stamina (mana free) <br />
(I didn't factor in the hp bonus for this, because a shaman can cast it while wearing Vindi BP)<br />
<br />
Purdy interesting stuff.<br />
<br />
I personally wouldn't mind having the Vindi BP for it's looks, and Aura of Battle is nice... but I'm pretty content with the Wolf Caller's after my research.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I prefer Vindi.<br />
Even if you totally ignore the look (purely aesthetic) and the resists (situational), I would still rather have the HPs on Vindi.<br />
With C4, C5, and horse I'd much rather have the HPs to keep my mana regen up than boost my mana pool itself.<br />
To be fair I do carry a thurga BP for the stam click (sorry mages, you just aren't worth the mana for Boar on raids :p) so if it was completely an either-or situation I guess it would be a little closer.</div></div><hr />
