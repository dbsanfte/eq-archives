<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, grinding a bit, and looking for xp. Flys in PoD are about to the point of nil... aka 7 to 12 per 1% xp. I'm not doing aa. I wanna hit 65 someday. As per grouping, when I can but work doesn't allow me to all the time. I have to be able to gate, log, and leave, and can't afford getting a bad rep for doing that in group. I miss the guards in Katta. Charisis has become either lb or too many, as east is the only thing giving decent xp now... which I seriously recommend for 59-60 btw.. and now I am looking for something for steady decent solo xp from 61 and up. I dont yet have skyshrine key, I do have charisis, seb, BoT, PoV/PoS, and CoD flags. As per equipment, haven't got my epic yet, nor my final cudgel (need to replace my blackened iksar bones, first attempt was a fail =(.. anyway, no Pox, limited to Bane and Plague so far. I do have my jbb. Something like PoD flies, or Katta bank guards would be nice, boring, but steady. Preferably halfway decent xp. Something I can let dogdog chew on, jbb, and stoic if needed. If it helps, been soloing (ie no kei or virtue or anyone else's buffs) the cliff golems outside the OT outpost. Something hidden in LoY I've missed? Somewhere in Kunark or Velious? A lesser used zone on Luclin? Ah well, presented my case, lets see what my fellow alchemists can come up with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do the Mushrooms in Fungus Grove.  I am 62 and get 1% to 2% AA per kill.  Very Easy.  Pull with Slow.  Get Single.  Let dog grab agro.  Apply Epic, Bane of Nife and another dot.  They die fast.  Never need to heal pet just have Regen and FoS on him.  Make sure he is Alpha Pup.  KEI is nice to help keep mana up but not necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gaolers in PoJ.  Go in and explore, they are the 2nd level of guards (Sentries should be light blue to you).<br />
<br />
I also kill prisoners in the same area.  There are 2 factions (Creatures and Prisoners) and you can juggle the factions so that you are non-kos to at least one side of the dungeon.  Pull a guard into a room with friendly prisoners and they (the prisoners) wont aggro.  Kill the guard, kill the prisoners, move to next room.<br />
<br />
Loot is very rare, but occasional Diamonds and some decent (1k) items for the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slavage909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Griegs(sp?) end.  If you fight at the Scarlet desert zone in the mobs are all blue and pretty easy.  Only once did I get two mobs and even then they died without much trouble.  Maloxxx is nice else they tend to resist a dot or two once every 2-3 mobs and sometimes resist slow.  If you kill the zombie looking things they drop gems..Bd/diamonds black sapphires and such.  Self buffed I was at one yellow aaxp in 35 mins.  I bind at zone in SD and click my portstone back to halas to sell everyonce in awhile.<br />
<br />
Slavage 62 shaman povar 300++++ aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're going to do the FG thing, make sure you can pull from 2 patches and always keep at least 1, preferably 3 in camp and engaged at all times.  At that rate the exp is OK and the cash loot is acceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have your epic you should pull as many shrooms as possible and utilize the mana free dot as much as you can, heck, I would do as many shrooms as possible so long as you can get torpor off and epic off.<br />
<br />
If you don't have your epic (like me) then I don't see any reason to fight more than 2 at one time. I've done 4 at a time but it just means that you have to take more of a beating from other shrooms which is unnecessary.<br />
<br />
I don't normally need to heal the dog when he has replenishment up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anyone try pulling 4 shrooms at a time and just raining the crap out of yourself? Maybe I will try this later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sigh, gave the fungus grove thing a shot, and it's slow. Fast pace, lotsa staying on toes, but slow xp. I'm trying to get 65 asap, and wish i could group more... Alas I can't, and was hoping to find better than 4% in an hour at a rate of 3 at a time. I dont have torpor, but just 3 days ago I DID get my epic. =) Got lucky, had time for a group, and a PoFear raid was forming, a wizzy needed a piece. OMG has anyone else been on a raid of 60 as the only shammy? I renamed my tell window to Spam. Anyway, got the tear, got out of there (raid was over), called a few friends, 5 65's (druid, mage, cleric, 2 sk's) and me, 61 shammy, and it was severe overkill, though they are &quot;uber&quot; , as Lord Rak fell in 1 minute. =) Got my epic, and now, STILL looking for viable solo options. =/ No Pox, no torpor, no grants (tnarg's), no greater immobilize, just a fairly well equipped spellbook (do have malo), a jbb, my epic =), and know a lot of clerics for rez's when things go wrong.</div></div><hr />

Ha! Edarb bubbled out FG and we all went nuts on a tangent like we were guest stars on 'The View!' FG is just an AA spot, not and exp spot really. Sorry for the confusion comrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">At 61 I did PoDisease goos until I hit 62 - they were still blue<br />
<br />
At 62 I did PoValor Golems solo in the wasteland, pulling to the wall with Malo, root and rot.  Stack Disease, Epic and Poison and go to town on them.  Get a KEI and an Virtue.  Med on horse for mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tried soloing in tier 1 pop? With malo and epic, grab a kei and some mage toys if possible. You should be able to handle PoI zone in when its not busy being trained (leave the archaics though), PoN yard trash, PoD goos perhaps. For a bigger challenge (and more xp) go across the river in PoN and fight the alligator like mobs but they might be a bit tough without torpor.<br />
<br />
If you can find a wizzy to port you up you could try PoHate, fight in a bit deeper and the mobs get higher in level (more xp but tougher)<br />
<br />
Chardok B is also worth a go if you have good chardok faction. Some nice loot can drop there, including torpor, and all mobs are dark blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've been root, rotting in PoN and it's pretty good experience.  Yard trash (trees, ravens, spiders) yield about 1% regular exp in lvl 60.  Malo em from afar, root, DoT, reapply root as needed.  It's pretty easy.  <br />
<br />
For a real challenge, try the gargolyes at the far side of PoN.  Get a levitate up, and hover across the river over near the hobgoblin area (careful - they see invis).  Hug the zone wall past the hedge and be careful of the Foreboding Guardians.  You'll come to a big stone fort which has gargoyles on the walls.  Set up camp on the zone wall beside the fort.  There's a big space there where you can have plenty of room to root, run, etc.  Gargoyles hit a bit harder than yard trash but yield 1.5% to 2% regular exp in lvl 60 (about 5% AA each).  They aren't much harder to kill.  Don't bother with the pet.  Just root/rot em and keep your distance.  Malo really helps here.  It's safe from any possibilty of trains and you can even camp there - it's 100% safe.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pesonally I like Inner Acrylica Caverns. Granted you have to kill 3-4 per 1% unless you get a named. But the loot you get is awesome. I can make about 1k in runes and weapons and about 1500pp in acrylica if you sell in the bazaar. Best place to set up is in the jail. The only time you will get two is the two mobs outside the jail. The are pretty easy to split. I just root one then run back to the other side of jail and sick pet and dot. I dont have pox, epic or jbb. You might want to have virtue and kei and also resist buff yourself. There are three named with in close vicinity of the jail that spawn. Arch Sage which spawns in the jail. Check this thread for more info:<br />
