<br />
Thank you to all who did it before and posted on your successes and failures. Believe me, I read and re-read them all countless times before we went in this morning to give it our best shot. Thank you to Cradossk for the awesome walk-throughs on &quot;that other site&quot;. I am a quest-a-holic but even I got stuck in a few spots and was to my breaking point and looked to see what I was supposed to do next instead of beating my head against the wall. (how in the world anyone would know to look for Vagnar in Dalnir is beyond me....had to use the cheat sheet for that part as I looked for him for well over 2 days before I caved in and went to the well.)<br />
<br />
As far as how we succeeded....here was our strategy. <br />
The Assault Squad: One Group <br />
60-monk, 60-druid, 60-enchanter, 60-Paladin, 60-Rogue and me 59-Shaman.<br />
We worked our way down to the invis corrider and killed all the mobs in and around it and set up camp inside the tunnel about half way through so no one would agro the Iksar Apparition. Puller was an Iksar Monk so he was indifferent to the apparition and managed to clear all wanderers and mobs. Monk feigned death near the end of the corrider closest to the stage and I went and handed in the relics and made tracks back to the group. Vauris Sathir goes and does his thing. The whole &quot;scene&quot; of the fight between Rile and Venril Sathir lasted 12 minutes almost to the second and Sathir became targetable. Respawns had occured but had not gone into the tunnel where we were set up so we decided to pull Venril rather than rush out. Great Idea.<br />
At that point our Paladin prepped himself with DIVINE AURA (20 second invulnerability) and ran up to VS and pulled him back to our group. <br />
We only got 2 of the gaurds of his to add which our enchnter mezzed along with 2-3 adds of wandering mobs. The other two guards stayed right by the stage. Once he was Tash'd, I slowed, Malosini'd and Criplled Venril with little effort and even gave him an epic DoT for good measure. We had a lot of damage output so he went down VERY quick (30 seconds at most). The enchanter came out of the tunnel and mezzed the other two guards and I looted the Skull and made my way to Rile. Since no one had posted how long he stayed spawned I was over anxious to get this traded in before he poofed so I can say this...he stays around for at least 3 and a hlaf minutes or at least he did for us. <br />
At this point we were getting back spawn adds and adds seemlingly coming from everywhere. At one point I counted seven in the little tunnel. We had a GREAT enchanter with us.....he kept them all under control.<br />
Trade In and Rile presented me with my new Cudgel. I honestly welled up with tears. I love questing for this exact reason. 15 second of sheer, unadulterated JOY that no amount of LOOT in the game can match. <br />
I can however say we tested CARNAGE and it's stacking capabilities and we found that it stacked with FOCUS, all regular shaman buffs and even Yaulp. It does however overwrite Spirit of Bih'Li do to the attack buff it adds. I didn't get to check on it's stacking with HoS but I will give it a go tomorrow after the NFL is complete for the day. I don't know how to post pictures, but if anyone can give a little breakdown on how to post them I have a good shot of the Cudgel's graphic. <br />
I am not sure if that is the reason our cudgel was broken but every other post I read about Carnage said it would not stack with FOCUS. It does now so I guess the 3 month fix it program was well worth it. Good Luck to all you other shaman who attempt this. The reward in this case well outweighs the risk. Any other questions regarding this quest or other shaman type stuff I am always willing to help out the Shamans of EQ. <br />
;tell rathe.tossen<br />
or just leave a message on the boards....I will respond. <br />
<br />
 Thank You Vortigern, Sulpicious, Ballum and Dagrinch. Our 4 horseman approach is what keeps me playing night after night. Thanks for keeping my fire burning. We did it guys.....together as we always do. I couldn't have asked for a better crew to fight VS with. PREPARE YOURSELF FOR CARNAGE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah the effect was &quot;fixed&quot; this last patch, or set of patches I guess.  Not sure it's going to stay fixed or not, there are some stacking issues with focus right now, and it may be re-broken.  Until then, all my non-primal friends are loving it.</div></div><hr />
