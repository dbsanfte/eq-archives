<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dethlok_Thelush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am level 55 and have a horse, JBB, and a regen tunic (not fungi though).  Where would be the best places to solo and earn xp?  I figure it would have to be an outdoor zone to make use of the horse/jbb combo.  <br />
Unfortunately the secret of High Hold Keep has gotten out on my server and is hard to get camp.  Where else might I find some great xp?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hail,<br />
<br />
Seafuries in OOT will almost all be light blue to you.  Wouldn't recommend it at 55.  48-53 yes, but it really slows at 54, and is downright an excruciating snail speed at 55.<br />
<br />
I've recently found the Burning Woods Giant fort at loc pos1000, pos1000 or so to be decent solo exp, along the lines of a blue or more an hour if you don't have to share it much.<br />
<br />
Double haste and regrowth dogdog, self-buff regrowth, Kragg, Shroud, Health, *nimble if you have Fungi.  Park pet on the border where the grass changes colors off to either side of the ramp a ways.  <br />
<br />
Go up ramp, single pull with Turgur's.  Run down ramp, head straight out until the ground turns colors, then make a right or left until you pass dogdog.  /pet attack.  Epic, ebolt, vots.  I then give him my best root and go get another, parking him parallel to the mob doggie is chewing but closer to the fort.<br />
<br />
Watch for the 2 spawns at the base of the ramp.  If you are pulling the fort when they both pop (after a wizard/druid/bard quad, they might pop at same time), you'll have 3 on you, which might get hairy if your dog is already engaged.  If at any time things start to go south, RUN yourself out of aggro range and regroup.  You'll still be on their hate list though, so be careful on re-approach if you don't camp out.  (I usually don't as I hate having to waste mana summoning a new pet.   If the dog isn't dead, I summon companion and lick our wounds before trying again.)<br />
<br />
I also recommend picking up a KEI in bazaar beforehand to make things even easier, and then taking the Kunark spires down if you aren't paying for a port to Skyfire.  By the time the KEI has run out, it is time for me to sell loot anyway.  (Usually a 60 ench &lt;likely ebayed&gt; that is whoring out c3 for cash in Nexus on my server.)  I made about 800pp in 3 hours there today.  Not too shabby for getting 3 and a half blues at the same time.<br />
<br />
The whole zone is decent for exp if you don't mind killing sarnaks and skeletons.  But I don't like them much as they are all very social.  I need to repair my Chardok faction, not ruin it any worse than it already is. :p  <br />
<br />
This spot in the zone is getting more and more popular as the word gets out.  Often times there will be 3-4 people soloing it, all fighting for spawns.  If that happens, I recommend two options.<br />
<br />
1.  Leave and come back during off-peak hours.  Skyfire and Chardok entrance are nearby and also offer good exp.<br />
<br />
2.  Find a mage for a partner.  I was duoed with a 56 mage today for several hours.  We had been competing against a druid and a bard that would pull 3 or 4 at a whack, and it was getting really annoying.  After we grouped, we moved up INSIDE the fort.  Kept it clear for almost two hours, until a series of ancients overwhelmed us and the mage dropped after mod-rodding too far while I was engaged with 3.  Low HP-aggro is a PITA.  If we had played it a little smarter, we could have kept the camp indefinitely.  (We got careless because it was so easy.)  Once we moved inside, we kept all the spawns (w/o having to share) inside the fort cleared, and had time for the 2 ramp mobs most of the time.<br />
<br />
The ancients and the named giants can drop spells, and one named (can't remember which) can drop a Treeweave.<br />
<br />
Sorry this was so long, but I hope you try it and reply with whether it worked for you.  I was competing with a 58 shaman at one point, so it seems to be a spot you could grow with too.<br />
<br />
One other point.  Forest Giant arbors will be green to you.  Epic and dogdog (maybe an ebolt or icestrike just for fast kill) are all they require.  Verdants are light blue.  Ancients and named all dark blue.  Rapid respawn though make this a good spot in spite of the green pops.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gorgul Paclok drops the Treeweave but with the bazaar the bottom has fallen out of the price at least on my server, about 700p I've seen and it seems a rare drop. I got one many moons ago the third time I killed him but a Druid I know did him many, many times without a drop.<br />
<br />
Did him partnered with a Shadow Knight (fear kite) and later with a fungi equiped Warrior, was a tough fight at 50 to 53 but haven't done him after that. He did resist a lot at times. He is a variable level spawn like Gullerback (named monkey) who is in that zone and drops the Tattered Mantle but never had one that summoned like some Gullerbacks will.<br />
<br />
If you see a lot of guildies and hear the name Ixiblat, beat it for awhile. Go to SF zone and watch the action. He's usually pulled right across the giant fort and killed in me in a couple of shots at 53. Guild pulling did rez those that died. He is an epic spawn huge Fire elemental.</div></div><hr />
