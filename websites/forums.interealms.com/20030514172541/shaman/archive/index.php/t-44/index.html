<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sargurin Dammim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I completed my Test of Patience the other night and I went to West Karana to start my Test of Wisdom.  I hailed the wandering spirit, got its attention and handed it the small gem.  Instead of giving me the information I need for the next part, it said &quot;whatever&quot; and left!!!!  ARGH!  I hailed it again and asked about the Shield and it did reply that I have not proven myself yet.  Is this broken or am I still good to go?  Hope not, did not like sitting at the bottom of the sea waiting on them spirits.  Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It sounds like you don't have enough Truespirit faction yet, for some reason.  Here's what you do to fix that.<br />
1.  Go to Rathe Mountains and kill the bandit and then get the gem from the spirit.<br />
2.  If the paladin or shadowknight are up, then nab them and take their woe and envy and shield for turn in again for more faction.<br />
3.  Go to Freeport and turn in the gem to the barbarian.  Bind yourself here.<br />
4.  Go to step 1 until you have a better faction level.<br />
5.  Go back to the wandering spirit and try talking to him now.  If you say &quot;shield of falsehood&quot; he should give you a shield if you have enough faction.  If he doesn't give it up, go back to step 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you sure you gave the gem to the spirit?<br />
<br />
A guy posted a while back he gave the gem to dogdog instead of the spirit, and didn't realise until he clicked trade.<br />
<br />
You have two choices either start the test of patience again (goto freeport and tell the drunk he can buy booze to re-start from there) or do as Juujuu suggests. I would follow Juujuu's advice as the test of patience can really try your patience if you get attacked by the sharks :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sargurin Dammim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well I found out what I did wrong.  I had a semi nice range item which I gave to the wandering spirit!  I left my &quot;small gem&quot; at the bank by accident!  Doh!  Glad I did not buy what I gave away.  They both looked the same.  I am now the proud owner of my atari shield.  (woot!)  Looking forward to gathering several of my buddies and beating up the puppy in Mistmoore now!</div></div><hr />
