Newbiean Rhapsody <br />
To the tune of Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen <br />
written by Aedar of Erollisi Marr<br />
<br />
<br />
This is my real life <br />
It ain't just fantasy <br />
I'm not going back to <br />
That place called Reality <br />
Open my eyes, look up to my screen and see... <br />
I'm just a newbie <br />
Please give me your money... <br />
Because I'm not too good, level low <br />
Please can you spare some dough? <br />
Anywhere this char goes doesn't really matter to me... <br />
To me... <br />
<br />
Hey all, just killed a bat <br />
Smacked it with my club upside its head <br />
Cast my Strike spell, now it's dead <br />
Hey all, life had just begun <br />
So who told me to target a guard and press A? <br />
Hey all, ooh ooh oooh oooh! <br />
Didn't mean to make you /cry <br />
If my corpse isn't found by tomorrow <br />
Carry on, carry on, 'cause nothing really matters <br />
<br />
Too late, my corpse is gone <br />
It's hard to find my way <br />
In this place called Greater Fay <br />
Good-bye, everybody, I've got to go <br />
Gonna leave this place behind and visit the next zone <br />
Hey all, ooh ooh oooh oooh! (Where this char goes!) <br />
I don't want to die <br />
But we all know that it's going to happen...<br />
(During the guitar solo you can hear sounds of monsters killing the newbie)<br />
<br />
I found the corpse of a high-elf paladin! <br />
Big deal! Who cares! <br />
Where the heck is my own corpse?! <br />
Thunderbolt and lightning <br />
Makes it very hard to see! <br />
What's the /loc of, (what's the /loc of), what's the /loc of, (what's the /loc of) <br />
What's the /loc of the next zone? <br />
I want to know! <br />
I'm just a newbie, somebody help me! <br />
He's just a newbie, he doesn't know anything <br />
Spare him some gold so he stops spamming me! <br />
Easy come, easy go, will you give me SoW? <br />
Bismillah! No! We will not give you SoW! <br />
Give me SoW! Bismillah! We will not give you SoW! <br />
Give me SoW! Bismillah! We will not give you SoW! <br />
Give me SoW! Will not give you SoW! Give me SoW! Will not give you SoW! <br />
Oh gimme SoW! No, no, no, no, no, NO, NO!!! <br />
O kind shaman! O kind druid! Will you please give me SoW? <br />
I need a SoW for my corpse recovery...so please...help me! <br />
<br />
So you think you can /ignore me in front of my eyes? <br />
I'm going to train something to you and watch you die! <br />
Yeah, duel me, I don't care if you duel me <br />
I'm just gonna zone out, just gonna zone right out of here! <br />
<br />
Nothing really matters, <br />
I don't lose exp <br />
Nothing really matters, <br />
Nothing really matters... <br />
To newbies...<br />
<br />
<br />
