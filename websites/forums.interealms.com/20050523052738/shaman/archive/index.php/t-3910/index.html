<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, <br />
<br />
I've seen about four hints that pets can somehow greatly aid a raid force that's up against an ubermob that rampages.<br />
<br />
Here's one hint: <br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://fohguild.org/news/Empgayed.jpg&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
Here's another hint: <br />
http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthebattlefield.showMessage?topicID=1088.topic<br />
<br />
Can anyone elaborate on this? My guess is that somehow you build the rampage list by layering in the MT followed by pets... am I close at all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nah, I'm pretty sure that's just some necro who used their nuke that turns the mob into a skellie - no tactics to be found here, other than ticking off the melee who suddenly have a smaller human hitbox to swing at :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No -- I really don't think that's the emperor's corpse in skelly form. Look at the direction the people are facing -- seems the target is off to the left. <br />
<br />
When going against the Burrower Parasite ignite bones is definitely an aid to killing... but I think we're looking at a screenshot of a pet here.</div></div><hr />

Then think about what happens with a pet when its owner goes LD<br />
Next think what happens to that same pet if you agro it while owner is LD<br />
<br />
Combine info you now have.<br />
<br />
Walk to Gfay and run a few tests with orcs.<br />
Upgrade to Newbie guards<br />
Leave Gfay and try the technique in WW on some dragons.<br />
<br />
By now you should know the trick and realise its true potential.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah - dont post stuff like this without saying what it does when I am stuck at work for another 6 hours and cant test it!!!<br />
<br />
I am now exceptionally curious as to what the hell happens to pets when you are LD and what happens when they are aggro'd.  Can you PM me if you dont wanna post it here?</div></div><hr />

no way will they keep that in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would have little to do with the screenshot tho, nor emporer specific if you're going where I think you're going. Hmm. Easy enough to test on Vindi I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">why all the secrecy?<br />
<br />
many of us read these boards to learn... hushed hints like these are only of use to people who should already have been able to figure the answer out.<br />
<br />
are you afraid if you clarify the trick that VI will take it out of the game? if so... worry not, we all know they don't read the crucible, only druid's grove.<br />
<br />
btw... what's rampage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hrendra An'ei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmmm...was grouped with a 54 necro the other day, a friend who went linkdead. <br />
<br />
Another friend dared me to hit his pet, still standing there. I said &quot;it won't do anything&quot;, but he said &quot;Yes it will&quot;, so I thought, ok, let's see...<br />
<br />
I attacked his pet and it proceeded to beat me down pretty damn quickly (it was still blue to me, but hit as hard as any mob we were fighting), and I had to Feign as I was low on HP to begin with. <br />
<br />
The only thing I can wonder is whether or not I actually did any damage to it. I can't remember, but I didn't have hitsmode then and was too much in shock to scroll up. ;)  <br />
<br />
Hmmmm...I wish I knew whether I had hit it in return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Rampage is when the mob gets really mad and decides to lash out at a bunch of people at once... generally the people it hates the most. Luclin mobs seem kind of screwed in that they just lash out at whatever they saw first or something like that. I'm too wussy to hit Luclin ubers yet. :( Not even death seems to clear the lists. You get on the rampage list then die and get rezzed... you're still on the list. At least that's my understanding.<br />
<br />
Then think about what happens with a pet when its owner goes LD<br />
It just sort of stands there until something attacks it. Mob seems to be indifferent to all. Sometimes they assist me for no apparent reason.<br />
<br />
Next think what happens to that same pet if you agro it while owner is LD<br />
It attacks me?<br />
<br />
NPC pets are kinda fun in that way. When you have a monk FD off a pet sometimes it'll just stand there and do nothing. However! Sometimes they seem to assist PCs. First time I noticed it was in LOIO killing random mobs while waiting on the Chancellor. Killed a Sarnak Necro and FDed the pet off. It stood around and the next mob that attacked me, the pet assisted. Oddest thing I'd ever seen. Next time I really noticed it after that was in Lake Rathe. Killed a Gnoll Necro for the skull and FDed the pet off (habit). Some other gnoll attacked me, skeleton assisted... then half the gnolls assisted the skeleton and the other half assisted the gnoll. All out civil war until only three gnolls were left in the whole camp.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of is because Luclin mobs have a screwed up rampage if you send in Goner00 he's on the rampage list. If he dies, he's still on the list. Maybe the mob doesn't rampage on anyone else because the targets on it's &quot;list&quot; are dead. So when it rampages nothing happens? Yes? No? Wouldn't work in Vindi and such because they aren't borked.<br />
<br />
That AE thread annoyed me to no end. Three pages of posts before the idea came out all to preserve the secret so other shaman could take advantage of the spots that most everyone else uses for StunAE anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">... and yes its true pets can eat Rampage on Luclin uber mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">To explain how pets tank Rampage, we first must know how Rampage works.<br />
<br />
Rampage is a single target based attack in ADDITION to the normal single target attack of a mob. How does one get Rampaged you ask? Well, it's very simple. The second person to aggro Rampaging_mob01 gets added to the &quot;Rampage List&quot;. Rampaging mobs have 2 aggro type lists. One is normal &quot;aggro list&quot;, and the second is the &quot;rampage list&quot;. If you are the second person to aggro the rampaging mob, your name gets added to the &quot;Rampage list&quot; forever (unless the mob dies).<br />
<br />
Let's give an example: High Priest of Ssraeshza is a rampaging mob. The first person to attack (or cast on) the high priest is immediately added to the aggro list. Now, the next person that aggros him will be put on the &quot;rampage list&quot;. When in melee range, the high priest will attack the first person on his &quot;aggro list&quot;. In addition to the single target attack, when you see the message &quot;High Priest of Ssraeshza goes on a RAMPAGE!&quot;, the first person on the &quot;rampage list&quot; is being attacked. *Note: if the person on the &quot;Rampage list&quot; is out of melee range, the high priest will attack the next person who is in range on the &quot;rampage list&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Phew. Now that Rampage is explained, I'll explain how pets relate to this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once people found out how Rampage worked, they begin to use pets to &quot;absorb&quot; this extra damage output from rampaging mobs. Specifically, Beastlord pets work best to absorb rampage damage because the pet always has the same name and will stay atop the rampage list if it was second to aggro the rampaging mob. Remember, Beastlord warders are named &quot;(Player name)`s warder&quot;, so once the Beastlord's pet's name is on the rampage list, he's there for good and will be rampaged by the rampaging mob (if in melee range of the rampaging mob. See above).<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully this 100% clears up the &quot;Rampage List&quot; mystery.<br />
<br />
I decided to explain this because the Shaman's Crucible used to be a message board where people could come for Spawn info, Playing strategies, etc. Nowadays, it's just a place for shamen to ask &quot;ac vs hps?&quot; or &quot;equipment help&quot; type questions.<br />
<br />
Let's bring the good info back to Shaman's Crucible!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Cool, that's what I thought. Got it in one. :)<br />
<br />
My understanding was that only Luclin mobs did that though because their rampage wasn't quite &quot;working as intended.&quot; I seem to remember someone at the Fan Fair asking &quot;What's with Rampage in Luclin?!&quot; and a VI guy saying &quot;It's broken.&quot; Hence never ever EVER being able to get off the list.<br />
<br />
Unless they fixed it and I missed it, it you see &quot;Vindi goes on a RAMPAGE&quot; you won't be protected in the same way because you're in Velious right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ok Gresgoth lets put the info out in the open then.<br />
<br />
About the pets.<br />
<br />
There is a maximum number of mobs that can attack you at any 1 time.<br />
If you agro a mob above that number, while you are attacked by the mobs, that mob will stand still (more or less)<br />
Now the trick is to get a low level mob agro on you so that you are &quot;protected&quot; by it attacking you.<br />
Pets are a great tool for this as the pet class can walk with you and cast a pet on demand. (Pure melee pets rock for this)<br />
<br />
Now remember this is at best borderline material and at worsed An exploit.<br />
<br />
This works even for the uber mobs, costs a lot of time but when every raid member has his &quot;shield&quot; with low level pets attacking him the target will do nothing.<br />
(expect a fix for this soon)<br />
<br />
Edit: I asumed this is known to everyone but to make sure:<br />
When a pet owner goes LD his pet becomes a normal, non agro mob for the duration of him being LD in the world. This &quot;mob&quot; can be agro'd and will stay after it is agro'd even when the original caster poofs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zixor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Gresgoth, thanks for the explanation of rampage, its been something I hadn't quite been clear on.  My question is, does your explanation apply to all rampaging mobs or only Luclin mobs?<br />

<br />
Good question.<br />
<br />
From my experience, rampage works the same on all rampaging mobs (even in velious; Tormax, Vindi, etc). Just have the rampage tank engage/aggro the rampaging velious mob, and he'll take rampge for the entire fight.<br />
<br />
I'll ask around to make sure this is 100% correct.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I understand now - using the pets of linkdead people to keep you from being attacked by the mob you're fighting.<br />

Clever, but like you say, probably an exploit.<br />
