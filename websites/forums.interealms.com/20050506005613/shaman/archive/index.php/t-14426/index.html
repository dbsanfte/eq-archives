<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rebutle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all<br />
<br />
Just started a shaman and I'm wondering what are some levels/spells that make us shine. I used to play a cleric and from what I remember it was 39 or something when we got our first 50% rez. So is there anything like that for a shaman?<br />
<br />
I haven't played eq in over a year so I'm sorta out of it.  :o <br />
<br />
Nice site btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">level 24 you get cannibalize.  With it you can turn HP in to mana.   After that, your life as a shaman will never be the same.  After a hard pull other castes are at 30 ro 40 mana, you are at 60 health but FM.  heh...<br />
<br />
At 51 you get turgurs insects, which is the spell that everyone thinks of when they think SLOW.  At 60 it slows mobs by 75%. <br />
<br />
At 60 Torpor makes its appearance.  You can heal yourself after canning very rapidly with this spell.<br />
<br />
Those are the spells I think of when I think really good spells.  True, we get some great buffs and regens.  Heals are substandard with what you had as a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">also at 34 you get your 1st pet spell. its a god send if your gonna solo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rebutle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the feedback.<br />
<br />
This'll give me some milestones to work towards (but I plan to enjoy the ride on my way of course!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also...<br />
<br />
At 24, you get Regeneration. Combined with Canni, it will really change the way you play.<br />
<br />
At 29, you get Quickness (your first haste), Targar (not your first slow, but the first real one with a whorthwile effect for the level) and your first Bearform<br />
<br />
At 34, you get your first pet and your first direct HP buffs.<br />
<br />
At 39, you get Togor, the first slow that will make the tanks and the healers go &quot;Damn!&quot;.<br />
<br />
At 44, you get a mini-torpor called Stoicism.<br />
<br />
Shamans get one of the most satisfying spell progression in the pre-50 game, really :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>HarpuaKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since you played a cleric you probably understand the aggro that support classes can bring on themselves, and shamans are no exceptions.  <br />
<br />
HP&gt;AC&gt;WIS&gt;STA IMO are the most important.  <br />
<br />
Also, at 39 I believe, you're able to give your pet two 1handed weapons and he'll duel wield and you'll notice a drastic improvement on his DPS.<br />
<br />
Hope that helped sir.<br />

Stoicism at 44...say it with me now...<br />
<br />
I am so in love with that spell. Between Stoicism and a cheap mount, KEI is an afterthought. If it's being cast while I am in PoK, great...I sure as heck aint looking for it or waiting around for it unless I know I'm heading for a dungeon...and even then I'm not going to spend too long.<br />
<br />
Now if I would just get off my lazy arse and go do the Canni II quest...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">HarpuaKB is close but not quite right.<br />
<br />
Focus Items &gt; Regen &gt; AC &gt; HP &gt; .....  before PoP and / or torpor<br />
<br />
When you get to PoP and the mobs have high attack ratings then AC no longer mitigates damage and HP becomes more important.<br />
<br />
When you get torpor, or at a minimum stoicism, then the importance of regen items is significantly reduced.<br />
<br />
Another milestone is lvl 45 when Jaundiced bone armor start to work.  The Jaundiced Bone Bracer with a clicky DD spell is a god leveling tool from 45 to late 50s.<br />
<br />
Don't join the HP is God crowd in your early levels.  Having some HP is nice but if you concentrate on AC instead of HP until about level 50 or 55 you will be much more efficient on the way up.</div></div><hr />
