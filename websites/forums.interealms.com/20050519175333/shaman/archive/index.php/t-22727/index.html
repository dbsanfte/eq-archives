<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">remove the retarded restrictions from this spell and shaman will shut up about an upgrade to sow.<br />
I dont need levi with my sow, I dont need see invis, ultra vision or any of that foo foo stuff, I would really really like to see a DURATION increase upgrade to sow however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My sow lasts an hr.  Im fine with that.</div></div><hr />

I think Scale was something that was a lot more important pre-PoK.<br />
<br />
Remember the Freeport - Qeynos run?</div></div><hr />

Heh, enjoy the 45 seconds when you can kee up with them with Spirit of Cheetah perhaps? :)  Granted it's a 10 minute refresh, but I alternate Cheetah and Scale if i'm going places out in the boonies (Acrylia caverns, Skyshrine, etc.) Since it's generally too much hassle to buy a port in PoK, I just hoof it. Persnally though, I hate running to skyshrine (gd &gt; ww &gt; kael &gt; wl &gt; ss). Although there are worse runs... say... from halas to the commonlands... without going thru HHP/Kith.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone knows that Billy without the recast time would be too overpowering.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still want a real upgrade to SoB`L, 65% speed, with a larger +atk bonus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heck, I just click my boots.  Even without a main inventory, it's easy with a separate macro page with the bag that opens up with the boots right next to the macro'd foot slot to do a quick refresh.<br />
<br />
It's nice to have had an item so long and still get constant use out of it.  I do the click as an afterthought, so the duration does not bug me... also, it is affected by my extensions, and lasts about an hour.<br />
<br />
I hate Spirit of Eagle, and click off every ninja cast I receive.  Levitation makes me sick.  55 percent run speed is just fine for me... only problem is, with run5 being 50 percent, there's little point in casting SoW, as you're taking up a valuable buff slot for that extra 5 percent total added mod to run speed.  <br />
<br />
Granted I haven't PURCHASED &quot;Swift Journey&quot; skills yet, as I figure hey, I'll just click my boots until I have all the OTHER AA's I want.<br />
<br />
I'd see the upgrade coming in the form of a new spell.  Druids get scale too, and this would sort of defeat the purpose of Eagles, to an extent.  You could say, &quot;but hey, you don't get levitation or ultravision with it,&quot; and I'll respond with, GOOD, I hate bobbing up and down until I vomit... and I keep up acumen all the time when I have the space for it anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">dog dog could use the extra duration for starters, I could use the extra duration when hunting indoors, its assinine that the first class to get sow never gets an upgrade. and Scale is possibly the least used spell in the game (it certainly makes the top 10) the only times I ever used Scale was when I had the earring clicky and my sow boots, the spell is that useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">and I keep up acumen all the time when I have the space for it anyhow.<br />
<br />
Lol...and I thought I was the only one who did that too. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I HATE druids that cast SoE on me.  Especially when I'm playing my paladin and I just got a Bihli.  I'm also among the &quot;levitation makes me sick&quot; crowd and I find all the bobbing up and down annoying.  Hilly terrain?  Who cares?  I'll take the meager damage.  Water?  I'll swim, I need to max that anyway.<br />
<br />
Make an upgrade to Bih'li.  Have it last an hour and add 100 attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For traveling any appreciable distance I dont mind SoE.  Im not a fan of the bobbing though it doesnt make me sick; I find it to be distracting.  If I'm only worried about me, its bootclicks.  If Im keeping the group sowed I'll fight the god awful recast time on Bih'li.  <br />
<br />
Ive wanted an upgrade to bih'li since soe first made it live.  Call it jealousy, call it envy, call it whatever; its our spell line and druids get the speed upgrade.  I call it our spell line because we get it 5 levels before the druids and 21 levels before rangers and yet both get an upgrade in speed.<br />
<br />
If Scale were upgraded tosow status, Id want about 2 days notice so I could get a scale earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'll admit it, I'm the guy who uses scale (group and single)<br />
Getting the guild to places to hunt, I wingless lev them, and group scale and we make a quick dash.  SoW when we get there and go in.<br />
<br />
Would love and upgrade to both SoW and scale (yea I'm that one vote)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bopes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd rather lose the recast time on Billy. Someone asks for Billy, you mem it, and then wait freaking FOREVER for the spell gem to refresh. What's up with that?<br />
<br />
Totally agree.  I use Bih'li most of the time and the recast is retarded.  Why put a recast time on that spell?  Wouldn't want me chain casting a group buff, now would we!?  That Would be unbalancing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">yeah the recast timers on buffs tend to get on my nerves in general, like our AC line, the recast is so long you cant keep it up in the same spot if you wait til it starts to fade...because you know chain ac buffing saves so many more lives than silly stuff like heals do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What is the difference between Scale and SoW?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">about 10% runspeed, Scale also drops when you get hurt/attack/cast (like invis)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">about 10% runspeed, Scale also drops when you get hurt/attack/cast (like invis)<br />
<br />
You can get hit and it wont drop.  They changed that about three years back.  Can't cast or attack though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I haven't clicked my sow boots in over a month since I got Run Speed 5.  There's essentially no difference.  I only use sow boots when dueling for an extra junk buff.  Run Speed 5 has killed any usefulness from our epic quest now.  I have the spear in the bank and the boots in a bag.  Let's hope the new epics will be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">now ppl want upgrades for SoW? <br />
<br />
i'm speechless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm speechless.<br />
<br />
Eh?  Expansions used to average 10 spells per class.  Upgraded SoW busts your chi how?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">well, because SoW doesn't need an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">what about upgraded Spirit of Bih`Li haruuq? does that make you speechless?</div></div><hr />
