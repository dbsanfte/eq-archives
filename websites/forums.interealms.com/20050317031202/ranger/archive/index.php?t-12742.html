<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skack</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 04:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 32 you can fear kite snow cougars in EW and Iceclad.  At around 34 or 35 the best exp you can possibly get is fear kiting hte zelniaks in DS, which have the added benefit of being non-social.  I did this until 41.  Unfortunately, there is no animal mob between these levels that will yield results like mammoth tusks.  You can however, get pelts off the cats that you can sell in the bazaar, and rarely, they will drop cougar claw earrings which are a nice upgrade for most people at that level if you don't already have them.</div></div><hr />
