<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PabstScrapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am hearing nothing but good things about Soloing Katta Guards at level 59-60. Most were evil races though.<br />
<br />
What are the major drawbacks of being a Barbarian Shaman with bad Katta faction? Should I kill the faction for some EZ grinding?<br />
<br />
Also, anyone know how to fix Katta faction?<br />

Bad=can't do Katta quests (some good quests there, enduring breath item, sweet sheild, etc.)<br />
<br />
Faction can be fixed but lots of work,  try Naythens guards if you dont want to kill your faction here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can kill guards in Katta and build faction there at the same time.<br />

3. Nathyn Illuminous - Nathyn's house is just to the left if you enter Katta from Tenebrous (upper Katta). <br />
His faction is the second easiest to get, since he seems to hate vampyres alot, but he doesn't seem to like the town he lives in, and gives bad faction if you help the other factions in town directly. Killing Coterie Vampyres seems to fix it quite fast though.<br />
<br />
The best part is the other guards do not help. You can pull them to the long wall that would be at your left heading to the grave yard. They don't hit hard, are easily slowed and drop around 5pp. There are 6 spawns, I think, I wasn't pulling. You should be able to single pull at 59.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />
