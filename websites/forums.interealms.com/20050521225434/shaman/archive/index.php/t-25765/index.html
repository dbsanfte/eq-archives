<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Missing like 1 70 rune, and all but 1 of my 69 spells.  I'm aware I *could* get them from RS named, however 1) I don't do rs much, and out of the 30 somenamed i HAVE killed there, I have seen *1* rune drop.. pally got for his pally virtue.<br />
<br />
Looking for places/named I could in theory solo for my 69/70 runes. XP/cash/etc doesnt bug me, just someplace I can finish those spells, as my guild currently does not really do much for farming the 69 spell droppers (ie: Velkitorkin, Pyrique, Bridgekeeper, etc.) We do occasionally whack Tioprat in rcod or Velk in wos for a chanter for mez or some such, but our 69's are fairly low priority IMO for raid to go fetch, so I figured I'd do them on my own.<br />
<br />
I heard some folks whack Granitesmash or the named Ikaav in rcod.. matter of fact im camping the granite guy now.  Suggestions much welcomed and aprpeciated =)  Magelo is in signature, conv/wunshi/fort/eternal ward puts me around 9khp, an 1700ac roughly..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually no.  Did granitesmash earlier tonight.  Wasn't sure of the aggro range on him, but I'm surprised with the ease of the fight.  I just stood on the hill, slow pulled (yeah, I don't malos first, I gotta be different), malosed, rooted, stepped aside, and dotted the PH's silly.<br />
<br />
Granitesmash popped, slow pulled, bounced, but he was casting, got lucky. Reslowed, malosed, he slapped me stupid a couple times, rooted, backed off, tried to land cripple, but it said it wouldn't take hold. /shrug.<br />
<br />
hit myself with serenity, throw BoWunshi, BoYoppa, BoSaryrn, bane on him, and rid the fight out. just kept serenity up and straight out tanked him.  Tried to back up out of melee range and cast, but I couldn't get serenity (3 sec with p4 arms) off between summons, so I gave up and tanked, refreshed dots as needed, hit PM if I needed, never touched cani5. Blew epic and Ancestral if it looked like I may get low, and patched myself. overall, a really easy fight compared to what I expected. used dog pack also to buy me time to redot him heavily.. til i cought aggro and he summoned again heh.  First kill, 1 68 rune, 10ac aug (nodrop, type7), brought my twink pally in for the aug. he then spawned AGAIN, only coughed up the earring that time.<br />
<br />
Thinking I'll farm this guy for awhile in off times and see if I can get me some 69/70 spells solo...or other runes for the guildies who don't have yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not quite on topic, but if your guild doesn't already, they should start killing Chailak/Feratha in RS, Zun`Muram and Battlemaster in RCoD and Hulcror in WoS for some easy 70 runes (they always drop two each, with Battlemaster rarely dropping an ancient aswell). <br />
<br />
You may also be capable of King and Queen in RS, we've done them with as little as 45~ people (Time flagged for a little over a month and recently Qvic flagged guild).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, we do Feratha and Chailak fairly often... was doing Hulcror/RCoD, but haven't lately, generally either been doing god progression (inktu'ta), or Rhorious/Volklana/Hulcror are not up, which is more often than not the case.  Another rival guild on the server (almost into anguish, and in txevu) tends to tag rcod stuff before we get to it. /shrug<br />
<br />
I'm not worried about 70 spells so much as 69's.Only missing vindictive spirit for 70's.. but dammit, I want curse of sisslak soo bad =\<br />
<br />
As for King/Queen.... we're working on them..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>pugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ive killed granitesmash and the dragorn laborer 100's of times....many many days of hydrain the two and got lots of 66 - 68 but not one 69 or 70 off the hosers. My hydra is a druid so hed bind there and turn in all the loot for tribute or guild tribute and would pass along runes to friends or my other chars or just sell em after a while. Anyway, point is if your hopeing for 69 runes of these guys....its not very efficient. Yeah once in a blue moon one might drop off em but they also drop once in a while off named in wos and mpg. <br />
<br />
If you dont group rs id say your best bet is mpg since they seem to drop at a few of the camps in there more often then I hear about em dropping in wos, or get a solid group....maybe a group and a half to 2 groups and go smack down the easy named in NC. Or one group in rcod can smack down mushroom head (forget his name...we always call him mushroom head...the huge guy that randomly spawns and runs around the zone and blinds). Theres several fairly easy mobs to hit with a group or group and a half and since they always drop 2 69's then with low ppl accomplishing the task then voila 2 out of the 8 or 9 are happy per kill. Or group in mpg and every 2 hours go do a new trial. Ive gotten 2 of my 69's through those suckers. Anyway, just my 2 cents...good luck.</div></div><hr />
