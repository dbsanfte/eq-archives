<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The bazaar's been open for a few days now, and on Antonius Bayle most people seem to be using the new /trader functions. The auction chat channel seems to have dropped in numbers now, and I presume that EC will be a lot quieter.<br />
<br />
So where do you Sell your items?<br />
<br />
Me, I love the new /trader function, even with the bugs and glitches it's great. I've managed to spend all my savings buying spells that I've been looking for for months! I've also sold a lot of stuff that I would have normally sold to a merchant for change. very nice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I love the new bazaar - I have been able to shift a load of low end stuff that I could never be bothered to even try and sell before</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's great.  :)  There have been a couple times already this weekend where I've been one step from rolling up a twink just because of the steals I can get on mid-level twink gear.  :)<br />
<br />
It ws a little sad seeing a staff of the observers for 15 pp, though.  I remember when I dreamed of that thing.  I bought it just to spare it the humiliation of being up for that cheap.  :)</div></div><hr />
