<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Etain Dragonsfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had the great opportunity of getting these legs about a week ago, and it raised a question in my mind, so I thought I'd bring it here.  On Veeshan, where I play, FoH apparently awards Chain Legs to one of the melee classes for the Aura of Valor effect.  As such, based on the rarity of the chain legs drops (3 to 5 on Veeshan that I'm aware of total), I think I may be the only Shaman to have them.<br />
<br />
My questions are these.  Do guilds on other servers tend towards awarding these legs to the Rangers and Rogues?  How many chain legs have dropped on your server?  How many awarded to Shammies?<br />
<br />
Are most Shamans destined to have to wait (in most cases) for the melee to be equipped before getting our legs?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We use DKP.  Havent got any legs drop yet (only just got into the elementals), but when we do it will be a case of bid if you want them.<br />
<br />
There are only 2 items that are awarded.  BoC's when we were doing AoW, and BoW's from RZ.  All else goes to DKP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DKP allows full freedom.<br />
<br />
We got 3 chain legs sofar. 1 Ranger, 2 Shamans</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">we not using DKP.<br />
We got 4 leg drop so far, 2 shaman and 2 rogues.<br />
We didn't get any chain leg until our 22th fennin.<br />
Fennin 22 dropped my legs, Fennin 23 dropped chain legs, and last 2 coirnav dropped chain legs too.. Last 4 legs were chain legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I personally believe that they legs should go to melee classes that wear chain first, but we are on DKP. I just know that I'm not going to ask for them until the chain melee classes get them first.<br />

*EDIT*<br />
<br />
After seeing the link to some legs for chain classes from PoTime I changed my mind on elemental legs.<br />
<br />
I came here to change my post but it seems lame asses just can't wait to jump all over someone for a perfectly legitimate comment.<br />
<br />
Too bad people have some intelligence and can change their decisions, and end up being flames for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guild uses DKP too, we've gotton 5 pairs I think, mostly rangers.  They havent been a priority to me since i got a pair of the scaled avatar legs, the clicky root has proved to be very useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We have gotten about 8 pairs of chain legs in my guild alone, 4 went to shamans, we use dkp.  Know at least one more pair of chain legs went to a shm from a diff guild on my server too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my guild isn't dkp, and i receive the 1rst chain legs</div></div><hr />

Wow! 5 minutes after I get the legs and Etain comes here to post a flame on me... I came here to change my post based on some facts only to see this.<br />
<br />
I saw the link to some legs from PoTime that would be much better for chain melee classes, so I re-evaluated my decision to not take them ifd they dropped. I'm sure the chain classes in our guild figured the same.<br />
<br />
Leave it up to your lame ass to turn your own thread into a thread for arguments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Etain Dragonsfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, my post was not really a flame per se, just my way of commenting on the irony of the situation.  Even you must admit that by grabbing the first chain legs that came along, a day after posting that you had no interest in doing so, is very ironic.  By jumping to the conclusion that I was flaming you, however, you've just proved yourself the fool.  <br />
<br />
I see you've edited both of your posts now and managed to call me a lame ass in both of them.  If I cared for a microsecond about your opinion of me I might be upset by that.  I thought we had come to terms in game over this, but it doesn't appear as such from your edits.<br />
<br />
As I said in game, with all sincerity, congrats on your new legs...and congrats to all of you out there who have received this great piece of armor.<br />

Grabbing the first pair? Sorry, I'm not on faux DKP and don't get equipment because I am ummm... politically connected. Heck, with as much as you have a death grip on a certain mob because others are nice enough to not roll over you, I would think you would have more legs than any guild on the server.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I edited out was some of the comments after talking to you in game. I didn't add in anything else.<br />
<br />
If it's what you really want I will put them back in.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the grats on the legs tho...</div></div><hr />

Hardly ironic considering that for the first time the night before the following legs dropped in Time, and will most likely be the only other legs available for chain classes in Time:<br />
<br />
Leggings of Furious Might <br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />
Slot: LEGS<br />
AC: 54<br />
DEX: +25 STA: +30 CHA: +10 WIS: +22 INT: +22 HP: +200 MANA: +185<br />
SV FIRE: +15 SV DISEASE: +15 SV COLD: +15 SV MAGIC: +15 SV POISON: +15<br />
Shielding: +2%<br />
Avoidance: +10<br />
Required level of 65.<br />
WT: 4.0 Size: TINY<br />
Class: RNG ROG SHM<br />
Race: ALL <br />
<br />
I personally didn't see those legs until after reading this post either, so its very reasonable to think that others didn't either.  Those legs are by far better for Rangers and Rogues than Elemental Chain legs considering most Rangers and Rogues in Elemental/Time are nearly maxed out on ATK if not so already.<br />
<br />
As for me personally, I have Leggings of Judgement so I won't be looting any legs from Time for a good while, I have other slots that need upgrading first.  Should Elemental Chain Legs reach a point where they are about to Rot then I'll probably loot them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thank you Jaradis, I am glad someone else understands how good those are for the melee chain classes. Seeing those in a link were the sole reason for me changing my mind on the Elemental legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We have had 8 or 10 chain legs drop and since i had leggings of fiery might i waited (about 5-6 months) for all other shaman and rogues (we have no rangers) to get theirs. We dont use DKP .</div></div><hr />
