<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not sure how many have done it before me, but at level 58 zero AA's, no fungi, no epic, no JBB and medicore equipment I soloed Yeldema.  <br />
<br />
Some of you may not consider it soloing because I had outside buffs, but at 58 it's still a challenge.<br />
<br />
This was my first attempt at him, except for a duo with a DC druid.  I gave my pet gnoll hide lariats, which hardly proced, but when they did it was helpful because I could med between attacks (sometimes two ticks).<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested I can tell my story more indepth.  I am also unaware if this has been done alot before, so be gentle if this is not an accomplishment <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Landing malosini and slow is a problem.  I landed slow finally at 60% mana and alittle later malosini landed.  I think I got lucky with slow landing.  If your pre-60 and no malo, possibly try using journeyman's walking stick for the tashani.</div></div><hr />
