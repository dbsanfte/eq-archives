<p class="largefont">Click here for full thread: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21662">The new EQ 2 trailer</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tickmunki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is something for all you EQ2 people just open and watch the trailer, its nice to me at least, then again am just a Monkey in a Ape world.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice to watch, but does that trailer have anything to do with how the game will actually look and play? The animation was too jerky to be considered good movie quality, yet way too amazing to look usable for actual gameplay. You could actually see into the distance rather than the constant fog that is EQ I. Oh and it has no plot, just like EQ I.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grammaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, that trailer was pretty cool.  Actual game shots though..nopers.  Its more like the opening movie that the original box came with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh...and I want the spell haste focus the charaters are using.  Seriously.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Some things I learned from watching that clip.<br />
<br />
1) There will still be many folks trying to be Aragorn/Strider<br />
<br />
2) All evil folks will be ugly, dark colored, or have a visible scar.<br />
<br />
3) Druids crappy bear pet will be replaced with a crappy hawk pet.<br />
<br />
4) The Vah Shir still make no sense.<br />
<br />
5) Necromancers will still have all the cool spell effects.<br />
<br />
6) Social MoBs will not actually aggro, they will just do synchronized hissing.<br />
<br />
7) Trolls will be broken at launch, and will be easily defeated in PvP no matter how overwhelming thier numbers are. (/bird)<br />
<br />
And the big Truth of EQ2:<br />
<br />
Scantily clad females will once again control the destinies of men.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope.  I think that trailer, while cool to watch I guess, is completely useless.  I would much prefer that they direct their energies towards developing content and finishing the game rather than making movies and doing voice acting cheese.<br />
<br />
http://media.pc.ign.com/media/481/481244/vids_1.html is a much better indicator of what EQ2 game play will look like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wouldnt it be cool to see future games with those same graphics as in that trailer.  It would be like creating your own (never ending) movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From what I saw this is pretty much a rip off of a LoTR movie trailor.  Lady sounds like, or could be, the elf queen.  No real game play was shown.  Huge let down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My only concern is what will iksar look like.  And from what ive seen like featherless birds and totally ugly.  Forget that~<br />
Adding: Female iksar omg whats wrong with their head... erudite look like darkelves or something, the dwarves have nice tans *** and the high elves look chinese.  Dont even get me started on how rediculous the armor looks.  The video above armor looks fine but in the screenshots they might as well be wearing mirrors.  All i can say atm is Meh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I enjoyed the trailer thanks for posting a link to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Played and watched others play EQ2 at E3....wasn't impressed at all.  <br />
<br />
Was just simply dull.<br />
<br />
You're mileage may vary.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Srab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok I downloaded and watched the video, but now I can't delete the stupid file.  Is anybody else having this problem?  Also I did redownload it to make sure it wasn't corrupted or anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok I downloaded and watched the video, but now I can't delete the stupid file.  Is anybody else having this problem?  Also I did redownload it to make sure it wasn't corrupted or anything.<br />
<br />
Try deleteing the file from the command prompt.</div></div><hr />

I gotta say, that looks pretty damn good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is just that, a movie. Game itself wont be anything like that. If SOE would ever manage to create a game like this, then it would be cool and I'd even try it, ignoring the crap they've done before, but, this aint the game. A nice movie to show on demonstrations.<br />
<br />
And, the starting quote: &quot;Millions have experienced..&quot; or some such. Yeah, right, millions. Keep dreaming, SOE.</div></div><hr />
