<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">help! When i started DLing the new patch via the normal EQ patcer it froze up and said sumthing about establishing a connection but i was connected to the internet so i close it reconnected and it didn't even do anything, then did the above again and it said DLing patch with estimating time thing but again, it froze up and said establish an interenet connection or sumthin, so wot do i do???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Patch server probably having difficulties, that's what my experience has been.   &lt;shrug&gt; wait a bit?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok, thnx! btw, nuff peeps r surfin the boards now, guessing the servers aren't up yet either then :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I suspect the patch servers may be swamped with the massive number of people trying to DL the new patch.  I had to try like 6 or 7 times before the graphical patcher window even came up, got &quot;connection failed&quot; on all the other attempts.<br />
<br />
Edit: and then the graphical patcher failed with &quot;Internet Send Request timed out.  The Patch Servers may be busy.  Please reattempt to download.&quot;  Two failures so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am having the same trouble, came home for lunch to DL, but unable to connect, GRRRR.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well, at least I'm not the only one...   I guess ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">VERY large and amibtious patch. Perhaps a better method would be to auto-download the required portions of the patch (eqgame) and allow for the new GUI and other portions to be selectively downloaded at a later time.<br />
<br />
Yes I am having the same problem. 28.8 MODEM blows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hey, it started the download this time!   next month i'll be back on the network at school   /rude 56k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've been online for 2 or 3 hours, trying to connect to everquest to patch. the little box comes up that says &quot;Connecting...&quot;. Stays up for about 4 minutes, then it goes to the patcher, and says &quot;Checking for updated files,please wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Been waiting for hours now. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I got connected, played for about 15min, got disconnected and I am having patcher probs again :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Woot. Got the patcher working :D<br />
<br />
Only took 3 hours hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mines patching but VERY slow, and im on a cable modem.<br />
<br />
Might wait for late tonight and try to patch then after it has died down some</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Mine is patching slow to(Cable as well) But I'm stickin through it because I reeeeally wanna play =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i can get it on the graphics one for a while and DL some files b4 it stops hehe, won't be long (15 mins patch on 512k adsl :) ). btw my adsl is from pipex.net, europe only, cheap. <br />
PS any mistakes its cuz im eating grapes and typing with my small finger so the keys dont get sticky :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Mine is downloading as well now, but really slow, on 56k estimated time is around an hour atm...but it may be because of the size of the patch.  No matter what, when I finish I'm gonna go get EQW so I can bypass trying to connect to patch again.  Also, it seems to freeze sometimes while patching...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">finished!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">:( Mine wont even start to DL anymore.  Thinking maybe go get EQW, keep trying til it gets eqgame downloaded, then next time it stops see if EQW will let me log in and play anyway hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bah. It stopped patching about halfway :(<br />
<br />
Retried it and the little &quot;connecting...&quot; Thing was up...just got a pop up saying it couldn't establish a connection.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Woohoo finally finished patching :D<br />
<br />
Now..I have to select optional files or something in advanced right? It didn't do anything so right now I'm doing the &quot;thorough file check&quot;.<br />
<br />
Good luck to anyone out there still trying to patch :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>grumpeehead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">all you people with dial up wait till 2am to download, please! we'll tell you about it till then!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Uhhh..gee, lets see - 200,000+ people trying to download a 10+ meg file (just a guess on the file size)<br />
<br />
Its going to be slow. Period. This happens everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Man, what's going on here.
