<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Woo, first try, and then I got to zone into VT afterwards. Let's see, 10 shards times about 18 months... that's 180 shard-months of bank space I get back!<br />
<br />
Melee/Hybrid ring, Monk/Bst 2hb, and Priest/Caster FT slippers (lost roll). Was lots of fun, I look forward to farming him and getting my bridle!<br />
<br />
Just starting a new loot system, too, where you bid DKP for a range of numbers on a /random roll, so even infrequent players get a (lesser) chance at good loot. Should avoid &quot;I have no dkp, so I can't get loot, so I won't raid&quot; syndrome. For example, the 2hb went to the Monk who bid 12 (for 12), and not the Beast who bid 50 (so no charge).<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is old news to most of you, but as you can tell, not to me. <br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

If you want an ornate chain horse, you're much better off doing Lord Inquisitor Seru. Find a cleric, a bard, and a warrior friend, then a few ranged DPS (Necros own, he's even mind wrackable). I think the clear up is harder than he is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't waste DKP on anything but the Torque(one of the best items in game to this day) and *maybe* the Shawl(I'd try to get ahold of a Belt of Efficiency instead as its effect is superior).<br />
<br />
Congrats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Congrats, Samanna! Good luck to you on that bridle!  :cool: <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Congrats on taking him down!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">gratz, one of my favorite encounters!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Congratulations on the kill and your VT key!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grats on emp!  He is one of the true milestone encounters for guilds in the game.  Now you can go on to play with rocks and robes and 4-arms oh my! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Grats on the Emp kill  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd definitely go for the bridle - super fast horses don't drop outside of Luclin and I missed my shot at one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grats!<br />
<br />
The Gryphons sure have come a long way from when I remember them back about 3 years ago.<br />
<br />
Oh, and last time Remi killed Emp, we had 3 horses and no other drops, lol.<br />
<br />
G'luck and have some fun in VT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would go on a Emp run anytime still since A) its a fun fight and B) I want a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's not a fun fight when you're the only Shaman there, curing the offtanks, healing the offtanks, slowing Emp and all adds, keeping them all siniaed, and offtanking a mezz mob because the Chanter died :P<br />
<br />
Congrats again, Sam. I could tell how excited you were when I got the tells last night. (Sinadil is a friend of mine, too.)<br />
<br />
That's a huge accomplishment!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>claxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gratz im on mith marr also i thought the Gryphons disbanded though=/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Nope.<br />

All classes open, no Level or AA requirements. Currently Two Level 70 Shamans (Cullain and I) at almost all raids; a L66 shows up for about half of them. Usually in Ssra I'm Offtank Group Nursemaid, and I like it.<br />
<br />
Thursday raids are manditory if you are in-game; other raids totally optional. Raids are generally evening Euro time (7:30 pm GMT, 2:30 pm US Eastern).<br />
<br />
Please excuse the appearance, the main admin is futzing with the modules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Grats, Emp kill is a very nice milestone for any guild out there.<br />
<br />
And definately try to get the bridle, I like mine :) From all the items in Ssra back then, I wanted 2 - bridle and the shield from HP. And, one day, I got lucky as both dropped the items I wanted. I spent half of my left points on each and was at 0 by the end of the day, but what the heck, I was happy as those items were really something (for me anyway at that time). I still have the shield in one of the bags in the bank and am using the bridle daily :)<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />
