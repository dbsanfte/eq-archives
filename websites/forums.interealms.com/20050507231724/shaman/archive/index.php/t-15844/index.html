<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi!<br />
<br />
I am a fairly young shaman player (in EQ days, one week now, if not in RL years, 27) and would love to hear the words of the wise, old shamans. I have read a lot of the posts here and have discerned some valuable facts, but I would love if you could contribute on some of the questions I still have.<br />
<br />
New shamans read this first: General tips from the shaman community: LOTS OF VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION! (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13787) <br />
<br />
1) The Canni dance - Its like the great, white whale; I have heard a lot of stuff about it, I have the tools to hunt it, but just can't seem to find it. Could somebody please give a detailed way of doing it (not just :Sit, stand, cast, rinse &amp; repeat) But does'nt it come down to timing? What do you time? mana or health? how do you time it ? Or do you just mash the hotbutton?<br />
<br />
2) Mid level quests / high level quests: Which are fun to do ? Which should you do ? And which are rewarding enough to do ?<br />
(Advice to other young shamans, -if you are not a twink: -Look into the newbie armor quests. -No matter: If you worship CT or Innouruuk, look into the necklace quests)<br />
<br />
3) Does bearform work as wolfform ? Druids seem to enjoy a freedom of movement due to being &quot;invis&quot; in wolform (indifferent to most). Does the same rule apply to a shaman in bearform? As a evil, evil troll this would be good news.<br />
<br />
4) I know all my dots stack, but if I cooperate with an other shaman, will both our dots stack ?<br />
<br />
5) Equipement: Do we really just focus on AC/HP (or HP/AC?) or is the path of enlightenment (WIS) the way to go ?<br />
<br />
6) Pet, the furry dot with low hp, can it dual wield ? How do you get it too ? <br />
<br />
7) Does the Malos line decrease disease resists too? or: Why not? (and how does this affect our slowing?)<br />
<br />
8) 1hb / 2hb or piercing / all of them ? Or doesnt it matter?<br />
<br />
9) Epic, worth it? Since it is faction based: Did you personally do it through or did you do faction + tear ? And when to start ? I know the first part is kill a level 20. (The walkthrough can be found here: www.eqshaman.com : Epic (http://www.eqshaman.com/shaman/epic/index.html)) Did you enjoy it?<br />
<br />
10) I am in no rush to gain levels, but I have reached 29 quite fast (as I almost read as much as I play to get good advice) Question is, is there more joy to be had higher up: Do you enjoy yourselves at the higher levels ?<br />
<br />
Sincere thanks to everybody that contributes,<br />
Aere, 29 level Troll Shaman. First time Eq-player, with good friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of those questions have been asked and answered before on these boards, I ll try to answer a couple of them anyways.<br />
<br />
&gt;1) The Canni dance - Its like the great, white whale; I have heard<br />
&gt;a lot of stuff about it, I have the tools to hunt it, but just can't ...<br />
It s not much else but -Stand- -Cast- -Sit- /repeat<br />
Mana and health regeneration happens once every 6 secs, called a tick because it does not happen continously but all at once. If you sit at the time the tick happens you gain sitting mana/hp regeneration. When the tick happens your class symbol will spin and your mana and hp grow a bit. Right after you see your bars move, stand up, cast Canni, sit down. If your connection is not too laggy you will get the sitting regenaration then.<br />
<br />
If you want to make a hotkey for it it looks about like this<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 6 (number of spellslot you have Canni in)<br />
/pause 12 (depends on lag)<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
I seem to remember a change to sitting regeneration that you don t gain it if you stood up between ticks, someone may clarify. The hotkey is still usefull to save ticks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;2) Mid level quests / high level quests: Which are fun to do ? Which<br />
&gt; should you do ? And which are rewarding enough to do ?<br />
Most Shamans around 30 did do the Totemic Armor quest. The reward isn t worth it anymore though. I as an iksar did the iksar armor quests, rewards a bit better better but not much. Vah Shir have their Tradeskill quests. You can also start with your epic at level 29 (invis).<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;3) Does bearform work as wolfform ? Druids seem to enjoy a<br />
&gt;freedom of movement due to being &quot;invis&quot; in wolform (indifferent to<br />
&gt;most). Does the same rule apply to a shaman in bearform? As a<br />
&gt;evil, evil troll this would be good news.<br />
No. bearform has no effect on faction whatsoever.<br />
<br />
&gt;4) I know all my dots stack, but if I cooperate with an other<br />
&gt;shaman, will both our dots stack ?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
&gt;5) Equipement: Do we really just focus on AC/HP (or HP/AC?) or is<br />
&gt;the path of enlightenment (WIS) the way to go ?<br />
If your Wis is around 150 you are golden.<br />
AC/HP till mid 50, than HP all the way, the other stats come by themself because almost everything decent will have WIS on it as well.<br />
<br />
&gt;6) Pet, the furry dot with low hp, can it dual wield ? How do you<br />
&gt;get it too ?<br />
give dog two 1hand weapons. May depend on pet level. You can test this easiely if you give him one piercer and one blunt and check for the piercing/crushing messages.<br />
<br />
<br />
7) Does the Malos line decrease disease resists too? or: Why not? (and how does this affect our slowing?)<br />
Lucy is your friend<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spelllist.htm...SHM&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
We have the decay line to debuff disease, none of the Malox line does.<br />
<br />
&gt;8) 1hb / 2hb or piercing / all of them ? Or doesnt it matter?<br />
Epic is piercing, many nice 1hb out there too. 2hb rather situational, as a wimpy Iksar I never got up to maxing it.<br />
<br />
&gt;9) Epic, worth it? Since it is faction based: Did you personally do it<br />
&gt;through or did you do faction + tear ? And when to start ? I know<br />
&gt;the first part is kill a level 20. (The walkthrough can be found here:<br />
&gt;http://www.eqshaman.com : Epic) Did you enjoy it?<br />
Yes, it s still worth it. Do it the right way, it s a very fun quest, I loved doing it. You can start it by yourself at lvl 29, if you have good freeport faction even earlier.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;10) I am in no rush to gain levels, but I have reached 29 quite fast<br />
&gt;(as I almost read as much as I play to get good advice) Question<br />
&gt;is, is there more joy to be had higher up: Do you enjoy yourselves<br />
&gt;at the higher levels ?<br />
For me the fun increased with higher levels and I m enjoying myself tremendously at level 65. There are some rough spots inbetween, but nothing you can t grind through in a couple days.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have fun,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Welcome to our world,<br />
<br />
1) The canni dance comes down to a simple trick:<br />
Can, Sit and wait till the tick has passed, stand, can, Sit, etc.<br />
This way you get maximum hp/mana regen from sitting.<br />
<br />
2) Most are fairly funny to do, I myself enjoyed the epic quest (and yes you can start with it at your level you just can not finish it (yet)), I also liked the Velious quests a lot (ring quest, shawl quest)<br />
<br />
3) Unfortunatly it does not. All you get is some stats from bearform. <br />
<br />
4) Yes, till a maximum of 30 debuffs/dots per mob<br />
<br />
5) Welcome to a hot debate, At your level you need a certain amount of wisdom and a certain amount of HP. But much more important are focus effects, as they will truly make your spells work better/cost less/etc<br />
<br />
6) Higher level pets (nicknamed project Alpha) will dual wield, all you need to do is give it 2 warrior weapons. And talking about pets, your pet will equip armor when you hand it to him (again it has to be warrior usable)<br />
<br />
7) No malos does not include a Disease resist modifier, we have a seperate debuff for that.<br />
<br />
7a) Slowing uses the Magic resist check so malos will work fine for it<br />
<br />
8) Does not really matter. Pick a weapon you like as.<br />
<br />
9) Epic is very worth it, while a low amount of damage to todays standards, it is still free damage.<br />
Not to mention that one of the best shaman items in the game is a side result of it (the insta click sow boots).<br />
I myself did it the long way and I found it a very fun quest to do.<br />
<br />
10) No there is not more joy at the higher levels, there is the same joy at different places.<br />
The major difference is that at higher level you can start to enter some zones designed for raids.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you and enjoy the shaman</div></div><hr />

I have read a lot of the posts here and have discerned some valuable facts, but I would love if you could contribute on some of the questions I still have.<br />
<br />
Hi I guess I'll try some :)<br />
<br />
<br />
1) The Canni dance - Its like the great, white whale; I have heard a lot of stuff about it, I have the tools to hunt it, but just can't seem to find it. Could somebody please give a detailed way of doing it (not just :Sit, stand, cast, rinse &amp; repeat) But does'nt it come down to timing? What do you time? mana or health? how do you time it ? Or do you just mash the hotbutton?<br />
<br />
Basically every 6 seconds (a tic) the computer gives you mana for the last 6 seconds which have passed.. so if you are sitting when the computer calculates the last 6 seconds, you get sit down mana regen, else you get regular mana regen. What you do is sit until the mana bar moves a tic, then stand up canni all you can and sit before a tic goes off again.. <br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=15595&amp;highlight=canni<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Mid level quests / high level quests: Which are fun to do ? Which should you do ? And which are rewarding enough to do ?<br />
<br />
1 - THE most important quest you can do: PURE BLOOD!!<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=11716<br />
<br />
2 - VT key was not fun!<br />
3 - VP Key was not fun!<br />
4 - Emperor key = awesome<br />
<br />
That's all I really know of quest wise :)<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Does bearform work as wolfform ? Druids seem to enjoy a freedom of movement due to being &quot;invis&quot; in wolform (indifferent to most). Does the same rule apply to a shaman in bearform? As a evil, evil troll this would be good news.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen any evidence that it effects any kind of faction, it's more for +wis +regen.. btw iksar = sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
4) I know all my dots stack, but if I cooperate with an other shaman, will both our dots stack ?<br />
<br />
Yeah it's awesome :)<br />
<br />
5) Equipement: Do we really just focus on AC/HP (or HP/AC?) or is the path of enlightenment (WIS) the way to go ?<br />
<br />
HP/AC/WIS is the general rule.. right now I have 280 wis maxed and I am going for nd3 (hps) &gt; ie. (my gear will let me have 295 wis but I don't have the aa to take the cap higher right now).. this rule applies early mid and late game.. <br />
<br />
6) Pet, the furry dot with low hp, can it dual wield ? How do you get it too ? <br />
<br />
Give it any 2 of any kinds of weapons (war equipable only I believe) and he will duel wield (rusty works too).. level 55 or maybe just 61 pet also procs if you give him a procing weapon (usually mage summoned).. also the 61 pet can hit from behind and stun (if mob is running).<br />
<br />
<br />
7) Does the Malos line decrease disease resists too? or: Why not? (and how does this affect our slowing?)<br />
<br />
Nope doesn't.. we have debuffers specifically for disease if we wanted that.. our main slow turgurs insects is magic based so for the most part we need a magic debuff which the malos line gives us.. We have disease based slows which are good to use against highly magic resistant mobs with low disease resists, but that's special case, I've never used it :)<br />
<br />
8) 1hb / 2hb or piercing / all of them ? Or doesnt it matter? It's cool to do but doesn't matter.. you really only melee in non pop zones because our melee is useless in pop.. I'm talking at the high end game anyway, of course our damage is decent in the lower levels.. Be SURE to max out defense as soon as you can :) cap is at 200.<br />
<br />
9) Epic, worth it? Since it is faction based: Did you personally do it through or did you do faction + tear ? And when to start ? I know the first part is kill a level 20. (The walkthrough can be found here: www.eqshaman.com : Epic (http://www.eqshaman.com/shaman/epic/index.html)) Did you enjoy it?<br />
<br />
Epic is waaay worth it.. some people say that it's easily replaced and it's not.. been to vt 25/25 mace is decent.. in pofire the club is decent I'm sure there might be some (very few) better things but not many and all super hard to get.. I did the whole thing myself about 2 months ago.. very fun to do... know 2 peeps who did the faction way about 1 month ago so that still works, and they loooover their epics.. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
10) I am in no rush to gain levels, but I have reached 29 quite fast (as I almost read as much as I play to get good advice) Question is, is there more joy to be had higher up: Do you enjoy yourselves at the higher levels ?<br />
<br />
Sadly the truth is the fun is there at lower levels but there is no one to do it with.. and usually it's fun crawling through a dungeon to get something cool but with the bazaar the way it is, until you're higher level you won't upgrade much or anything by doing dungeons etc.. I hit 65 got some aa and now I don't xp at all and just do dungeons quests and it's super fun, but others just grind aa to the 450s+, &quot;Cause I can&quot;.. so fun is very individual.. but at higher levels you kick butt more so imo it's more fun =][/QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Hope that helps you bud, my views might be hella level 65 skewed..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When you want to do canni dance regularly and stay a while on mid levels (on higher levels it looses a lot of importance in my opinion) consider getting a UI, that shows your health with percentage values (UI section should have some).<br />
<br />
Then you can easily:<br />
- wait for value to change<br />
- press hotkey (including pause dependant a bit on your lag)<br />
- repeat.<br />
<br />
My advice for levelling would be don't rush through levels. There is a lot to see and learn (and maybe even more, that i've missed  :D ), so take your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just to clarify (being picky) get a UI that shows your MANA as a percentage - that's the tick that matters. My health ticks at a different time to my mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One clarification to your point Khozik, dogdog can use more than just warrior usuable stuff, Serrated bone dirks (Rog only) for example when you need a snare but havent got a snare proc of your own.  NPCs handle weapons very very differently from players and are exempt from a lot of rules.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Quests:<br />
<br />
Talisman of Benevolence (need CoV faction)<br />
Amulet of the Grey Wastes (EB item)<br />

Crown of Deception (Woodelf illusion crown)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On the epic, I think the tear from Fear is no-drop so you won't be<br />
able to do that part until at least level 46 (47?) due to the zone<br />
level restriction. I'd recomend doing up to the dire wolf to get the<br />
boots, then forget about it until you're high enough to do Fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">here's another tidbit on the canni dance.<br />
<br />
As posted above you *need* to get a gui that shows your mana as a percentage. Once you have that and a working canni dance macro all you are doing is sitting and waiting for you mana to go up 1 percent. Ass soon as you see it tick up 1% then hit your macro button. You will be sitting back down before the next med tick. As soon as it ticks up 1% again canni. And so on and so forth until we get canni5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Here is me words. I think they are wise but not only the young can be deluded in what they speak.<br />
<br />
A shaman is a spirit caller. A ghost walker. A bridge between the real and the spirit world. We have brother wolf and sister bear to aid us on our Journy.<br />
<br />
I myself follow Justice. So I will speak of what I know. The followers of Fear or war or of the spirits that bind all things may speak of thier own path.<br />
<br />
I come from a family of combatants. Adventurers we all are. I have a hammer in my name and it is the spear of fate that I weild. I stand in the thick of battles, while the warriors who are my brothers charge forward. Any that stand before those warriors I lay low with curses and insects to weaken them. <br />
<br />
The spirits I have called walk with the warriors and Knights and thier support holds us fast, they make them stronger and sometimes faster, they heal thier wounds slowly or sometimes in a rush of power. Other spirits I can call. Filled with poisen or disease, these I lay upon my enemies to kill them from withen. I can also use a spear of poisen to thrust into the side of a foe, or a blast of cold from the feilds of ice that I call home, while not as powerful as the great magics of a wizard, they can change the tide of a battle one slow cast at a time. <br />
<br />
In the younger years I strived to be at the front of the battle. Laying about me with the hammer of my namesake healing when I could and yet always calling upon the insects to harry my foes. Now with my advancing age and the power of the enemies I do not stand in the face of my foes as much. Except of course when I am angry. Then damn the wounds that they may cause. Damn the whimpering of the clerics and thier cries of &quot;What are you doing!&quot; Damn the warriors with thier puny swords and the knights of legend striking with there greatswords and axes. When the rage of the bear is on me I will attack and while I may not have the force of trained warrior, all of the abilities that the spirits grant me come to the edge of a fearsome spears point. <br />
<br />
People will tell you many things in the journys ahead. They will tell you what you are not. You will hear you are not a warrior, you are not a puller, you are not a scout. You will hear time and time again you are not a cleric, nor a druid, and certainly not an enchanter. What they do not understand is you are a shaman, the sum of all things. No one thing you do will shake the heavens, but where you walk is inexorably changed and when you exert your will wonderous things can happen. <br />
<br />
They will shout at you as you charge forward to engadge with the warriors, &quot;stand back and meditate and let them do as they must&quot;... I have never paid them any mind for I do what justice requires of me. I stand in the front armed in spirit and clothed in the torpor of sister bear, I stand with my brothers the warriors and break the back of the beast. <br />
<br />
Because I am a shaman, and all the spirits of the dead heros walk with me.<br />

i use<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 8<br />
/cast 8<br />
/cast 8<br />
/cast 8<br />
<br />
this eliminates those lost cannis due to fizzles<br />
now it is a lot of spam but then thats what canning is all about<br />
spam<br />
<br />
the way i use this is i have 2 hotkeys<br />
one is the system sit/stand macro<br />
i press 6 to sit<br />
wait for mana bar to move<br />
press 8 to activate my canni macro<br />
6 to sit and repeat<br />
<br />
works great too cuz i hit same macro to canni during fights<br />
no accidentally making myself sit so i get clobbered :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thank you all for answering my questions, makes a coldhearted bear all fuzzy inside :)<br />
<br />
I really appreciate that you took time to answer my questions instead of saying: Search the forum. Sometimes nuggets of gold is hard to find!<br />
<br />
I like this board, not a lot of flames (tho shaman seems a little protective of their class, but then again I am new here, and have no idea how other classes are).<br />
<br />
Edit: I love this board, it is full of useful information, and has made being a new shaman a pleasureable experience. Let there be no doubt about that. I enjoy the way the shaman community is helping each other out.<br />
<br />
I am currently making my Magelo, and I am going to post it in the equipment thread when it is ready. I am aiming to get a lot of different focus items, but some of them seems hard to get. I have golden efreeti boots and the +9 agi Guk-bracer now. Question is: Are melee-haste items any good for a young shaman (while we still melee a bit?). <br />
<br />
<br />
Aere,<br />
SpiritAdvocate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">just about the alpha pet, your weapon doesn t need to be war wearable ( I mean giving Monk/beast fists will work too )<br />
And the pet starts dual wielding with our pet spell 49<br />
<br />
To answer your last question, I think you get more fun when you get your slow 51, at this point, you will really feel yourself usefull. The hardest part for a shaman is being 30's cause groups will prefer a druid to a shaman ( same heal but DS )<br />
At 40 and then it is going better, shamans are welcomed in groups ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There are a number of decent quests in PoK for your level, too.   Check out the Diamond Inlayed Mask (I think the name is, Spell Haste 2 focus item).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Your need for a haste item will decrease as you level, and definately will be almost nil when grouping in PoP. At 29 though, it is a very nice bonus, as any worn haste effect will stack with your quickness buff. The &quot;entry level&quot; haste item is the Flowing Black Silk Sash from Lower Guk. If you can though, hold out for Silver Chitin Hand Wraps. They are only 1% more haste, but also have very decent stats on them, and that will free up your waist slot for a belt with some nice AC/HP/stats as well, since the FBSS only has 5 AC and no stats. On Povar server, the Hand Wraps are about 50% more (2000pp-FBSS vs. 3000pp for SCHW)<br />
<br />
As someone else said above, once your wis is 150ish, you're good. When you gain more seasoning and reap the fruits of your labors as far as new equipment goes, you will be amazed at how wisdom will take care of itself. I went from 852AC and 160ish wis at level 55, to 972 AC and 191 wis at level 58, while concentrating on increasing AC and HP unbuffed. The wisdom just sort of came without even looking at it.<br />

A word of caution......Never tell anyone you wear Golden Effreeti Boots. Dye them if you must....*LOL*  Sorry, I was brain-washed by the anti-GEB lobby here at the Crucible at about your age and never owned a pair. Many Shaman will tell you they love theirs, I never felt I missed anything, and I got to laugh at my friend the Dwarf Cleric in his. <br />

The spirits will guide you, enjoy the journey</div></div><hr />
