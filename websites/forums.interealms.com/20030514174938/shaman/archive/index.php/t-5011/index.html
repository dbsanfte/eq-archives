The problem is everyone wants to to try and hit different epic mobs, this is what kills your chances at making it to your mob.  If you can get two decent groups together it would not be that hard to go down and get your piece, make itu potions for everyone and sneak into room in the castle.  Id say within and hour or maybe an hour and a half you will get kirn and get your piece, much easier than having to kill them bums over and over again.</div></div><hr />
