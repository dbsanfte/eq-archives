<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bobcats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First things first -- please do not turn this into a flame thread against the holder of the Bobcats account.<br />
<br />
I am the original Bobcats...some of you know the story, some of you do not.  I have been gone from the internet community (ie no connection, no nothing) for about 13 months give or take.   During this time, I told Rizz and others that if Bobcats was needed, he could be used.  When that time came, the guild powers tried to contact me, not knowing that I had no connection to email, and after multiple attempts at contact failed, the reins of the Bobcats account were handed over to another.<br />
<br />
I reinserted myself into this community again yesterday, and was surprised to find out what had transpired.  I had long talks with several people, including the Bobcats, after activating a set of account keys I had been holding in reserve until I was able to get a second computer.<br />
<br />
Please know that the person who now plays Bobcats would have never taken over the account if he had any idea that I would be coming back, but even if you had asked me up until 2 months ago, I probably would not have known.  Some see him as a bad guy, but he really is not, he only has a slightly different view of the game than some of us (again, no flames please).<br />
<br />
After a lengthy discussion, an agreement was made.  And know, all of you, this was MY choice, so please respect it as such.  <br />
<br />
I will not be retaking the Bobcats account, and this will be my last post as Bobcats.<br />
<br />
Instead I will be starting a new rogue, already named Venamyan and up to level 5, and Bobcats will be helping gear him and power him up to an appropriate level.<br />
<br />
Thats all there is to be said I think, If anyone has any questions, feel free to send me a tell in-game (Venamyan, not Bobcats)  I will be playing late evenings usually (1am - 6am EST).<br />
<br />
Venamyan,<br />
