<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was just bored and broke down my guild by race. Imagine my dismay when I found there are just as many hobbits in my guild as there are barbarians. That's just wrong.  :(  My lone solace is there is one warrior alt who's race I dont know, so I'm hoping she is a barbarian to tip the scales.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So many humans and wood elves.  Need some more kitties in there.<br />
<br />
I would be curious as to the class breakup of that group.  So many wood elves = rangers/druids?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of them, yes. Interestingly, we have 2 vah shir and 2 beastlords, but neither of the vah shir are a beastlord. They are a bard and a rogue. The beastlords are a barbarian and a troll. This is how we breakdown by class:<br />
<br />
Warrior: 13<br />
Cleric: 11<br />
Druid: 10<br />
Monk: 7<br />
Wizard: 7<br />
Enchanter: 6<br />
Ranger: 6<br />
Rogue: 6<br />
Necromancer: 4<br />
Shaman: 4<br />
Bard: 3<br />
Magician: 3<br />
Paladin: 3<br />
Beastlord: 2<br />
Shadow Knight: 1<br />
<br />
EDIT: The wood elves breakdown like this, Bailie: 2 bards, 2 warriors, 3 rangers, and 5 druids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Check that out - we're not freaks. Rorgg's guild has the same top 2 races, and the exact same top 3 classes.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>kagrobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hmmm you are all pecks to ogahs ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">BTW, when /who * count used to be a valid command, every once in a while I'd just do a /who all barbarian shaman count, /who all ogre shaman count, etc etc for every R/C combo as well as totals for the races and classes, on a couple different servers.<br />
<br />
Now mind you this was a ways back, but at the time consistently there were a TON of humans, with various elves behind.  Always.  Ogres and Trolls on the bottom.  Always.<br />
<br />
There were always a ton of Warriors, and a lot of druids.  Shamans tended to be in the middle.  The least played class was consistently rogue, with SK and then IIRC bard right behind.<br />
<br />
Apart from having more clerics around, today's guild stats pretty much match up to what I recall being the norm for servers as a whiole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think all guilds that do any kind of raiding at all are going to have warriors and clerics at the top of their list.  Almost all guilds also have a lot of druids too, because, well... there are a fockton of druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Its odd that ogres and trolls are always at the bottom.. even with the obvious advantages to them (regen, slam, high str, so on and so on) there are very few warriors and other classes made from those races.  Ill never forget the first time i saw an ogre beastlord with that little bear following him around.  I had to take a second look, To this day I have only ever seen one.<br />
<br />
Is it entirely a looks thing? Or are the exp penalities that fierce?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kagrobb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yes the exp mod hurts ogre and troll a bit, making them a bit duanting to start and back when there were real hell levels it was outright painful to play at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">15 Ench thats just insane heh.<br />
