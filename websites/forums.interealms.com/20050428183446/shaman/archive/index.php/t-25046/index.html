<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Played some at lunch on stormreaver, got two toons to 5 dual boxin, went home after work at 5:00 and cable modem had problems, three hours later a 1 hour wait in queue, gah.<br />
<br />
Made it untill 4:00 in morning smoothly when lag hit, up again at 6:00 and played some more, mage and rogue level 10, 3 13's and misc in guild.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think they failed to take into account how many peeps were gonna play, and the loot lag isn't fixed yet, although it was better, but for the scope of this project, I think pretty well.<br />
<br />
I am tired, I am seeing things. Thank god it is a 4 day weekend.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pretty smooth launch...although there were a million billion people in the newbie areas. <br />
<br />
Played a Dark Elf Druid, and since I spent my Beta time playing Horde it was truly a new experience.<br />
<br />
Had a friend who went extended afk and the game kicked him out, he had a 20 min wait to get back in. <br />
<br />
Other than that it was fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pvp servers at least in central were pretty overloaded, they need more pvp servers, people overestimated how many people wanted carebear vs pvp.<br />
<br />
Two boxing is so much slower than leveling alone!! hehe. But then again I get off dueling myself and turning my rogue into a sheep, somehow seems very Vermontish.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No problems here.  I logged in to a RP server (friends on it...would have preferred PvE :p ) at 6 EST and played for an hour as a Tauren.  I had item lag a couple times, but nothing over about 10 seconds - and the rest of the time I didn't have any lag.<br />
<br />
So far it's far smoother than EQ1 was a launch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyone else having trouble with email in the game?  Every time I try to send a message I receive a message like &quot;Unable to find that recipient&quot; in the middle of my screen.  This even happens with folks already registered on my friends list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Things went well for me. I  had a 10 minute wait the first time I logged into my server. I noticed a small bit of looting lag but it was a huge improvement over beta. <br />
<br />
There was an issue with mob spawns. A mob would span but it would just stand there and could not be killed. There was alot of compitition for named mobs. At one time we had 4 or 5 groups competing for the kill. Insane..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Weird krup, never heard of that one, mail has worked flawlessly so far for all of my crew. Have you checked the tech support boards and such? I have never even heard of this, and I usually even listen to the retarded general chat most of the time. Just you or anyone else you know?<br />
<br />
Just did a search on tech support forum, somone with same problem, blue guy posted to call a GM in game :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A lot of people in my guild were having the same issues with mail, Krup.  They received the same &quot;unable to find XXXX&quot; message as you did.  So I don't think it's an isolated incident.<br />
<br />
One suggestion that seemed to work was putting the intended recipient on your Friends List and then selecting them for mail.  A few people reported that that was one &quot;work around.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think this launch was the smoothest of any MMORPG in history.  The open beta/stress test got them ready for it.  <br />
<br />
I got home from work at 5pm cst, logged on using my existing open beta client and didn't even have to patch.  I played until about midnight cst and had only a couple times where inventory lag took about 5 seconds to go through (as opposed to 2 minutes in beta).  I play on a central time normal server (Alleria I think, can't remember hehe).  Tauren newbie area was surprisingly vacant.  <br />
<br />
I think the problem was that people were still not clear on the implications of picking a time zone.  ANd they assumed they had to play in the time zone they are in, which is clearly wrong.  I would have picked a mountain zone server myself, but my wife had already started playing when I got home.<br />
<br />
Overall, I had zero problems and I bow down to Blizzard for the launch and the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Smoothest I would say was DAOC, of course the game is nowhere near as good. But waiting 1-3 hours to login kind of blows, other than that WoW did well.<br />
<br />
What is funny is I picked one of 5 servers that had the login queue issues and was overpopulated, grrrr. Doesn't seem bad at all once you are in though, weird.<br />
<br />
Boy loot lag got bad at around 4:00 AM and this morning for a bit, like 5 minute + lag. Kind of funny because at one point, since I two box, one of my guys was on follow and his legs wouldn't move, I was dragging him around like a south park character for an hour, and he was still able to fight, but then he turned invisible! hehe.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, DAoC was very smooth, true.  But indeed, I don't think it saw the same load that WoW is seeing.<br />
<br />
Interesting that they are still using the queue system.  I was hoping that was just being used in Beta.  Being told to wait cuz your server is full would not sit well with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Was mentioned in chat that Blizzard is lowering the max # of players and using the queue to encourage people to move to another server to balance the load.  They will raise the population cap later.<br />
<br />
Doesn't make a difference if you want to join your 20 friends, but hopefully it will encourage people who just pick a server at random to go to an emptier server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The server side lag issues they've been having since OB are back, which makes sense since they were never really addressed.  I'd kill to see their server architecture.  I love the game so far but I still can't believe they spent all that time and money adding crap like durability, durability loss on death, reagents and other tedium to the game in the last month instead of concentrating on making the infrastructure bulletproof.<br />
<br />
Hint: when you get 500K in OB and have a performance issue, you need to address it, not launch and THEN address it.<br />
<br />
Are the people that were saying &quot;don't worry, it's beta, it'll be fixed in retail&quot; still sticking to their guns? Software and server architecture, like Rome, are not built in a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Here's what I don't get.  You have servers that are succeptible to high load problems, right?  Why in the heck would you organize them by time zones?  This just ensures that you will have most of your server population trying to log in and play at the same time.   EQ was smarter there, you had more even time zone distribution on the servers and therefore more evenly distributed loading.   <br />
<br />
Latency, you say?  Well, 1) latency difference from NY to LA is what 80ms? and 2) Are their servers even physically located in the time zones they quote?  I bet they are all in the SF bay area.  (Edit: lost this bet)<br />
<br />
Seems like an engineering mistake to me.  The reason time zones sucked in EQ was the rare spawn mob issue.  Wow does not seem to have that - so far anyway.</div></div><hr />

Around midnight, blackrock just went to crap so I logged off to play this morning, but the the loot lag is still there.

Created a char on silvermoon, after first looting, lag was so f...ing bad could not attack anythin, couls not even camp?  Wish i could return my CDs on principal.  Seems either marketing did not talk or listen to the tech folks or that the techs are total morons.  Server load should not be that difficult to calculate.  Probablly need top assume that management just got greedy as usual and planned the hardware for two months down the line.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">First day seemed pretty good.  Got my copy at midnight'ish, played for 3 hours.  Home from work 6 pm, online no problems till about 1 am.  A bit laggy later in the night, but nothing that was ongoing for very long periods of time.<br />
<br />
Second day, not so well.  Popped on for a few minutes at lunch with no problems, but got home 6:30 pm and many servers were down ... and still are.<br />
<br />
Hopefully by day 4 it'll be a bit clearer - I think the possibly reduced crowds tomorrow for the holiday will give them a nice chance to catch up on some problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">And for those yelling about the server load, that is not the current problem.  The lag issue is due to the database architecture and how the loot table is accessed.  That is why all servers, regardless of load are having the same lag when looting a corpse.

Sadly, also yes.<br />

EDIT: In response to Bubba's comments - this is why Blizzard has egg on their face. Not because the SAME issue(s) came up during OB - but because they didn't FIX them.</div></div><hr />

That is why I do not think this will be a quick fix.  I would imagine that Thanksgiving for the WoW team may be sandwhiches as they try to unscrew this mess.  <br />

Well, they claimed 500,000 users during the open beta and looting was working fine, right? I wasn't in beta, so I wouldn't know, but I thought that was the timeline.<br />
<br />
So, um, what exactly did they do to make it work in open beta but not in release if the problem is seen across servers regardless of server population?<br />
<br />
/em scratches his head<br />
<br />
Did they put the item database on a separate shared server, which promptly assumed the fetal position? That would be as insane as  sacrificing all virgins on the Live team to Cthulhu in order to ensure a successful launch. Cthulhu would be pleased, but there would be nobody left to run the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is to encourage people to choose another server. Yes sounds harsh but servers can only hold so many people reliably. So if LEET SERVER NAME is a popular server because of its name and 10 million ppl are trying to connect you get problems. This is their way of saying you really don't have to wait just pick another server.<br />

Negative on FINE. I would say 60% of the open beta time was unplayable time because either a: Horrible lag or b: at the end patch and also LAG. <br />

Open beta was NOT fine. Open beta was supposed to be a red flag for Blizzard. Guess they are colourblind<br />

Whatever they did when they took the servers down last night seems to have effectively addressed the issues with load and lag.  No lag at all in the last 3 hours of play, killing, looting, etc.  Hope this marks the end of the &quot;beta&quot; and the beginning of a true stable environment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Sounds like this game was released with well know issues since the looting lag problem was seen in open beta.  To my mind that makes Blizzard a bunch of unethical frauds.  If I didn't want to play the game I would wish that they has just doomed WoW to failure.  But since several hundred thousand of us spent the $49 for the CD's ( $10 million retail ) I guess enough will stay around that the jerks can smile all the way to the bank.   F... Blizzard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">My guess is that the release date was set well before the final stress test began. They probably didnt have time to fix the issue before launch. <br />
<br />
Typically databases are the most important system in the environment. Typically slowness is more accepted than loss or corruption of data. Performance bottlenecks are not always easy to find and can take some time to discover. With my company I have seen issues relating to performance that has taken months to fix.<br />
<br />
Wows gameplay is the funnest I have had since EQ 4 years ago. I am not going to let a few days of lag to push me away from the game. The performance stuff will get ironed out and if it doesnt then EQ2 or a newer game will get my monthly subscription.</div></div><hr />

I was in open BETA on a heavy load server, it was fine.  There were a few lock ups, especially when looting and a lot of the issues with lag were resolved when they got their numbers for load balancing down.  Open BETA was smoother for me than EQ was sometimes (especially raids).  There was one really bad night for me in BETA, but aside from that, it was very playable.</div></div><hr />

neg<br />
<br />
daoc was smoothest by far.  that was 2001<br />
<br />
this one is not very good actually<br />
<br />
the first stress test for me was pretty smooth.  i was on noz and it was the last server down and the first up every time.  it was one of the 6 that never got taken down<br />
<br />
stress test had the same issues as this on a smaller scale... hardware failure on a number of server sets and constant downtime.  fewer issues on other server sets<br />
<br />
actually having queues for paying customers?  that's really basis for someone getting fired after launch.  but i reckon it's vivendi who's actually running the servers.  blizzard itself is class during beta, a hurricane took out the server center on the atlantic seaboard.  blizzard AIRLIFTED its team out there to get the servers backonline and assess hardware damage.  they projected 4 days to get it back.  they did it in 2<br />
<br />
all the testers rightfully claim that blizzard really ****ed up the end of beta testing and there are issues that ppl gonna see when they get 55+ and into brd+ but in my book blizzard is doing okay</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not saying it wasn't a welcome break from EQ - but some folks I met at Mythic (about 4 miles from my house - 2 miles from my work) felt they (Vivendi) released the game about 6 months before the content was ready.  That became obvious at launch.</div></div><hr />

No.  There ARE some issues but by and large the game is playable.  Certainly this launch is better than {PICK ONE} expansion that Verant / Sony put out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Playable would imply that the servers are up.  They are not.  They stated scheduled maintenance 4:00 - 5:00 AM EST.  It started at 5:30 AM instead.  It's also lasting longer than an hour.  They managed to blow their schedule one day into it- and what's with daily server maintenance anyways?  How godawful is your architecture that your servers require daily updates? Good grief that's pitiful.<br />
<br />
I love the game to death when it's up, which is apparently rare with my luck.  The rollbacks last night were macho.  Somebody email me their architecture, I want to review it, laugh and then use it to teach younger devs how NOT to design a system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Iz, SOE has done this as well, when SWG launched they instituted the &quot;daily maintenance&quot; policy as well.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I guess I managed to dodge some issues last Wed, but I have never to this day had a problem logging on to Silver Hand when I want to and playing lag free.  Doesn't sound like the problems are universal to me.  Played about 6 hours last night again after about 4 10-hour days over the holidays.</div></div><hr />

 :eek:  :confused:  :confused: <br />
<br />
Sorry about that Faern - my original post wasn't very clear.  Snapdragn already said it - I was referring to DAoC.<br />
<br />
As for WoW - when I joined the beta last June, I must have had low expectations (probably set by the SWG release a year earlier) because I couldn't understand why WoW wasn't already released it was so playable already. :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I am on the same server as Iz, and yes it is getting annoying.  What drives me nuts are the population numbers which apparently have little to no basis in reality.  Either their pop ratings are complete fabrications or servers are crashing and malfunctioning truly randomly - regardless of load.    <br />
<br />
If they would stop being so protective of their precious &quot;intellectual property&quot; and post the actual population numbers, people would KNOW which servers not to start characters on.   As it is, low-med-high all seem to mean &quot;between 50 and 10,000 users, thx.&quot;<br />
<br />
My Server-down-alt on Shadow Moon is now level 11 with solid tradeskill starts :P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">never understood why EQ and games since stoppped showing numbers. Pretty stupid I think.<br />
<br />
PvP is going to be unreal on stormreaver with the numbers we have there. I am happy so far, rogue kicks some serious ass and is pretty survivable, woot.<br />

The less Blizzard uses SWG as a model for server architecture and maintenance the better. :)<br />

Cool, didn't realize anyone I recognized from the Crucible was on the same server.  If you're Alliance drop me a tell sometime- main char is Mordred (paladin). Ah, the Arthurian irony...</div></div><hr />

Amen!<br />

ROFL!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Heh,<br />
Main (for now) is Vito - Dwarf hunter.  No other alts on Duro - it's not up enough to get one going :).</div></div><hr />

It's a large amount of marketting research done by a competitive company merely by spending $40? or whatever for an account.<br />
You can track how your competition is doing on a day by day basis.<br />
You can see what kind of impact your competitive software is doing on the other company's business by monitoring the typical server capacity, and watching for variances in it when you give certain offers, or release expansions or whatnot.</div></div><hr />

Cool, I'll look for ya in game sometime.  I don't know if you're going the guild route but if you need any tradeskills my crew has pretty much everything but engineering covered- drop me a line if you need some combines done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">1. What Iz said about Blizzard not patterning jack and squat after Sony.<br />
<br />
2. What Juujuu said about numbers. <br />
<br />
3.  Dude made level 39 in 8 days on Euro Beta? Wow. <br />
<br />
Right now I'm not complaining. On a West Coast server (Silverhand) the SD is during the working day. <br />
<br />
If your snarflies are in a bind, view it like this:<br />
<br />
You paid $52.99 for a RPG which in a month you will have to pay $15.00 to go MMO.  Basically you bought Warcraft 4 for your PC.<br />
<br />
Oh and Gnome emotes are hillarious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Here's what I don't get.  You have servers that are succeptible to high load problems, right?  Why in the heck would you organize them by time zones?  This just ensures that you will have most of your server population trying to log in and play at the same time. <br />
