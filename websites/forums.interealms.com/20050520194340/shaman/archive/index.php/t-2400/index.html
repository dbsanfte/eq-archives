<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Then sell Torpor to get enough money to buy 2 pair of those booties. Then you can trade one pair for another Torpor :)<br />
<br />
Seriously, I was thinking of doing the same thing when I get to level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you just need to cast it on a few of em in downtime and watch them laugh out the other side of their heads<br />
<br />
I am not 60 yet but I know this spell works nicely for regenning health <br />
<br />
A lvl 60 shammy is nothing to laugh at. <br />
<br />
I know one that was laughed at in the arena by a war and a pally. when he walked out with 65% health and they had to be rezzed they started being a bit more careful who they laughed at.</div></div><hr />
