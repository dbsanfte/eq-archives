<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
So - here is my situation - I would really appreciate your advice!<br />
<br />
I'm a 60 shaman - recently back to eq. My dilema is this - Now that I have reached 60 - what do I do?  Level up more?  Farm cash items? Do AA?<br />
<br />
I have a 65 monk I can 2 box.  My wife plays a 55 necro - and I'd like to be able to group with her.  I am NOT in a guild.  I only have 3k to my name.  I have scribed malo and torpor.  <br />
<br />
For my monk I always though leveling &gt;&gt; aa.  But my situation was different.  I was in a top tier guild then.  Now I can't afford all of my 59 and 60 spells - and only have a few 61/62 spells.  I do have a fungi tunic I suppose I could sell to afford a few more spells - but I doubt that would even fund all my spells up to 65.  Plus - I don't really want to sell the fungi.  So - I don't have cash to buy spells - I wonder if it is really a good idea to level up?  <br />
<br />
I wonder if I should stay at 60 and AA up to at least Canni.  Then I wouldn't outlevel my spells, or my wife, or my cash.  Is there a good spot that a 60 shaman / 65 monk team could farm good AAexp AND good cash or saleable items?  Also - staying at 60 - I wouldn't outlevel zones I can group with my wife in.<br />
<br />
OR - I should I go on to 70 - and wind up be level 70 - but a bit short on gear, spells, and AA?  I assume that as long as I can slow the mobs - and ideally am up do date on heal spells - ill be good enough for most groups.  (IE i am not going to get booted from a group provided that I can keep up with the slowing and heals when needed).  The logic would be level 70 would open up the best exp zones and the best loots.  Plus - 70 would make me guild eligible.  Idea would be it would be easier to get spells and AA's at 70.  Plus - I would think at 70 I could still do a good job of helping my wife level outside her group.<br />
<br />
So .... what to do .... I have always been about levels ... but now at 60 I am concerned about outleveling my cash, gear, spells, wife, etc.<br />
<br />
What should I do?  If I stay at 60 and AA - what would be a good spot for loot and AA with a 65 monk?<br />
<br />
I appreciate the advice.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, I would say get can 5, it's pretty earth shaking. Some other AAs worth buying on the road to 70 (sometimes you just gotta take a break from the exp grind):<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure - first level is only 2 AAs and gets rid of annoying stuff like tash.<br />
<br />
Virulent Paralysis - pushing a mob off you and out of melee range can be absolutely invaluable<br />
<br />
Spirit Call - your own personal offtank<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid - (not until 67) hello, a group heal! how nice<br />
<br />
Mnemonic Retention - oooh, extra spell slot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you and wife can do Natimbi just fine, just park monk nearby to help tank named. Do the restless souls camp, I just have my necro(54) aggro kite them around with both pets beating on them.  Up to you on doing  exp for shaman or AA, but I get .5 % exp for necro and can easily clear camp, then just clear the animals nearby.<br />
You have a chance at very-rare neck items from ANY mob in zone (FT1 or regen 1).  named restless soul can drop HP aug.  Most other named drops are tribute fodder.  Few quest items in zone, search Alla.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">general consensus in the community typically is:<br />
<br />
lvl to 62-65, stop for canni5, then push to 70.<br />
<br />
as you get into higher levels (post-65) money will start to become less of an object, as you'll start getting large upgrades from normal group mobs, if you just push for groups in the right zones.<br />
<br />
when I entered OoW, I was a 65 bazaar geared shaman. by the time I hit 70, almost all of my slots were no-drop gear that were much better than what you could buy in the bazaar. shortly after, I joined a raiding guild, and my gear improvements since have been phenomenal.<br />
<br />
getting to 70 is worth the effort by itself. there are several examples here on the boards. lvl is still greater than all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>notch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It is really what you want out of the game.<br />
Do you want uber gear? if so.. then you better grind to at least 65 (if not 70) because most raiding guilds want that as first priority.<br />
Do you want to hang arround the same lvl as your wife? if so.. try and stay 7 lvls with in her. (that way the kills will give both ok xp)<br />
<br />
As a necro though.. if she really wanted to.. she could solo and catch up (maybe even pass you in lvls within two weeks)<br />
<br />
as far as cash.. most spells 61-62 are pretty darn cheap. (if you even need to buy them at all) you and your monk can farm them easily. As far as 63-64. lots of ppl have spectrals sitting in thier banks.. just do an ooc in pok saying that you would love to buy mqs for them.  Some folks wont even charge you if they know you are going to use them.  If you do pay.. I wouldnt pay more then 500 plat per. <br />
<br />
If you do want to lvl up you will need to buy Q.. on my server it is still 20-30k (if it is even for sale)<br />
There are several places you can farm cash using your monk.  there are several threads about places you can go.  Lots of places will give you ok xp along with the cash.<br />
<br />
I dinged 62 then got cani5 then went on to 65 and got a bunch more aa. Now I am 66.5 with 72 aa.  I have most of the cool aas and can solo pretty well.  I have decided to lvl at least untill 68. I can already tell the xp is alot slower though.. grats to all that made it to 70!<br />
<br />
 I KNOW a Lot of folks say grind to 70 no matter what..  Just keep in mind that they arent in front of your monitor.  For them it made sense.. for you.. it may not. Look at why YOU play the game. then go from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ethereal Parchment (level 61 &amp; 62) spells are like 50p on nearly every server.  If they're not, you can farm them yourself given a little time.  Definately level to 62.  From 62 you either get CanniV, and then level to 70, or just level to 70 :)<br />
<br />
I'd say take your mnk/shm/nec trio down to Noble's Causeway, and see what you can do.  If you can't do named there with Kragg's Mending, level to 62 and try it with Tnarg's.  If that doesn't work yet, get canniV and try it again :)  <br />
<br />
When you pass the point where you and your wife can do NC named, you're set till you pass the point of Crucible advice, basically!  You'll end up with all the faction and junk that you need to make OoW armor with focus effects on it.  You'll be able to sell 66 &amp; 67 spell runes to afford your level 65 spells, besides getting all your own spells.  Next step? Taking over the world.</div></div><hr />
