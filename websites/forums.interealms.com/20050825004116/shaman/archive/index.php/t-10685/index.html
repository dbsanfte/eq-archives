<br />
Anyway, it seems to me making changes for the sake of making changes isn't a viable strategy for a game designer.  So, persumably there's a purpose behind the recent focus item change.  <br />
<br />
Removing all spells but dots from the scope of these focus items must lead to this question:  Were shaman and classes who used these items unbalanced because they used them?<br />
<br />
If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, then what is the purpose of the change?  Furthermore, balance would presumably require them, so well, you need them.<br />
<br />
If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, then it gets to the title of the thread.  Did these focus items permit us to do too much, making shaman overpowered with the benefit of the focus effects of these items?  And not just shaman of course, but since this is a shaman board and that's what I play, that's what I call it.  <br />
<br />
I don't think shaman were overpowered with the benefit of these items, so I am puzzled at this decision.  Lord knows Affliction Haste items are totally useless.<br />
<br />
But others and Sony apparently disagree.  If so, in what way do you think shaman were overpowered because of these focus effects - that is now corrected by their removal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No I don't think they were unbalancing.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, you are assuming too much when you question Sony's 'decision'.  From what we've been told there was NO 'decision'. In fixing something else, a programmer noticed an error that meant these items weren't behaving as intended, so he 'fixed' them.<br />
<br />
Apparently, major changes to the way expensive, difficult to acquire items, behave (and have been behaving for 9 months) can be made without any need to consider the impact to the player base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probablly not, none of em allowed us to do anything we couldn't do before, it just allowed us to do it faster and more efficiently. However some have suggested the change was aimed at charm and we just got caught in the crossfire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, we weren't unbalanced but the savings in mana was very nice.  I think alot of people are upset over it because of two things.<br />
<br />
1.  It wasn't announced until after the fact.  A week's forewarning would of been even better.<br />
<br />
2.  A lot of people have been shelving out lots of pp to buy the pottery made items with Focus effects which are now only good for dots instead of multiple spell lines.  Those folks and the ones making money off them now feel cheated.<br />
<br />
They changed it to what they wanted it to be folks.  Let's move on because they are not going to change it back nor should they.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the problem is that Sony introduced focus items as a small perk, claiming it was to compensate us for the lack of melee-type items such as haste, high-ratio weapons, etc.  They never intended for them to actually be of great use to anyone, to the point where it would make a significant impact on your game.<br />
<br />
With these, there was a significant impact.  Not unbalancing, but the effects made our difficult jobs a lot easier.  Casting times on our key debuffs were reduced to reasonable, useful lengths, allowing us to properly slow the hard-hitting mobs in PoP and still be able to toss in a heal afterwards.  Durations were increased, so we don't have to spend extra mana to refresh a slow because the last one was just a little too short, and you had an add.  Mana savings were also introduced, but I was never able to get hold of a decent efficiency item that worked for me, so I don't have any experience here.<br />
<br />
No, they were not unbalancing.  I never heard a single person complain that we got our slows off 30% quicker, or that it lasted longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Affliction haste is game-changing for one spell: Command of Druzzil.  Normally a 5 second cast, it was hasted down to 3.4 seconds - fast enough to be cast in between summons when charm breaks on that uber mob.<br />
<br />
It also made a huge difference on the 8 second cast druid charm.<br />
<br />
I can think of no other affliction than charm which is so time critical (and still over 3 seconds casting)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anwariad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dev guy 1: Hmm why are charmers kicking hiney in PoP?<br />
Dev guy 2: Well we did but that negative modifier on their charm and it appears that affliction focus items are affecting charm.  <br />
Dev guy 1: I guess we should nerf that negative resistant check.<br />
Dev guy 2: Ooo people don't like nerfs.<br />
Dev guy 1: Well affliction focus affecting charm is a bug.  We could finally address that and that would indirectly nerf charm.<br />
Dev guy 2: Yep no one can complain about a &quot;bug&quot; fix lets do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did it make a shaman unbalanced?  No.  I could achieve almost the same effect anyway with other gear (which I don't have at this point in time) and  use an extra spell slot to load Torgor to recast slow faster.  Just made my life easier and when I am casting Malo and Turgur almost a lot in a raid made mana usage drop so I didn't have to Cann as much which is also nice.  It freed up a spell slot for buffing or whatever as well.  <br />
<br />
They were nice things and nice things make my game experience better.  Now they are in my bags for when I solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just wanted to get my 100th post up here....Woot!  And to do it on a Gart thread is even better.  /wave Gart!<br />
<br />
In keeping with the good Barbi's request:  No I dont think Shaman were over powered with the old Foci effects.  In fact, I believe those effects reduced the amount of tweeking which normally would have gone along with an expansion such as PoP.   If it wasnt intended, then its an huge funky smelling coincidence.  Because the Foci Effects made encounters in PoP hard yet not out of reach. of the average Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think so, although it did make an entire line of focus effects obsolete due to the 33% modifier, that being Spell Haste.  I just think 33% is excessive for the easily accessible AH3 items.  I could see the same modifer for maybe AH4 items, or in higher tiered planes(not tier one or two).<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think shaman were overpowered with the benefit of these items, so I am puzzled at this decision.  Lord knows Affliction Haste items are totally useless.<br />
<br />
I agree on AH being not very useful now, maybe useless.  <br />
<br />
I'd like to take the opportunty of this fresh thread to clarify my stance.<br />
<br />
I don't like the change, I was enjoying 2 second turgur's 2.5 second immobilize etc. but I knew it would happen and don't think the drama I've seen the past two days is truely warranted.<br />
<br />
I feel that if the high % of Affliction foci is due to there being a problem with our dots being substandard then they should be upgraded.<br />
<br />
Focus items are not intended to make up for problems in the spell lines, but to enhance those that are already there.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd like to see a recasting Focus, as that is the main problem with our non damaging detrimentals currently.<br />
<br />

Thanks Gart :)</div></div><hr />
