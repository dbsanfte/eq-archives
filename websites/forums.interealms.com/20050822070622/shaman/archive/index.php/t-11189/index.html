<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dothimgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With the forthcoming release of EQ2 and SWG.. what are your views on what will happen to EQ ?<br />
<br />
Do you think EQ will be &quot;put down&quot; silently by SoE, thus forcing everyong to start on EQ2 or SWG or other games ? Will most people start over at EQ2 ?<br />
<br />
Having spent alot of time on EQ building my char over the past year and a half, and now lately beginning to have major fun (I had fun from day 1, but now i really feel ive started to know the game mechanics, and really get to know my class, etc) - I feel a bit concerned with the fact that EQ may die....... any comforting thoughts about this ? :)<br />
<br />
 I know for sure i do NOT wanna start over in EQ2, not even with char transfer, unless I keep my shaman 100 % as he is now. Ive heard they make equipment go splat over time so you have to renew your gear from time to time etc.. sounds sucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">they're making tons of money off of EQ now. They wont force anyone into anything as long as they can make a profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I doubt it, I just redid my billing and they now have a 24-month subscription, so I doubt they see it going down in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ultima Online is still going. Heck, isn't Meridian59 still around ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">EQ2 seems a lot smaller in both scope and scale than the current EQ.  SWG might still be a flop, and beyond that, it's a whole different genre of MMORPG!  <br />
EQ is going nowhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">EQ isn't going anywhere for a long time.  Currently, I believe they are gaining more customers than they are losing.  With the new time of MMORPG's coming, very gradually, people will stop playing and move on to other games.  They'll start merging and shutting down servers, and one day, probably a decade from now, there will only be one server left.  Then, once they are making so little money that it becomes cheaper to shut down the last server than to keep it running, then MIGHT turn it off for good.<br />
<br />
That is in the distant future, though.  EQ is going to be around for a damn long time still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">EQ's seen competetion since its release and it's still going, it won't be gone for ears to come and i think SoE made a statement that they won't close EQ when EQ2 is out. Anyone know if EQ is ahead of DAoC again? or is that sucky game still more popular?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ill be playing SWG in a second, but ya, EQ is fine. For every me out there there seems to be 2 new players to EQ.<br />

Incredible staying power.<br />

Worst case is I think will see a drop in population right when SWG launches, people will wanna check it out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm not worried about EQ going anywhere in the near future, but I am worried that SOE will stop focusing on it and it will stagnate.<br />
<br />
There's so much content that that won't be a problem for a while, though.  Even with no new expansions and no extensions, there's years worth of content for me to explore at my play rate.<br />
<br />
SWG is not tempting to me but I might take a look at EQ2.  From a game design standpoint, EQ2 is a whole new game, and I don't think SOE has any better chance of getting their new game right than AC2, DAoC, or AO did, so I'm not optimistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I plan on going to eq2....<br />
<br />
I will never reach the &quot;end&quot; game reguardless of what game it is because I just cant put up the same kind of play hours as a lot of people with less going on in RL.   So EQ to me is just an adventure, and the next aventure can take pace in EQ2 :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think that SWG will flop, and EQ2 will flop.  Hopefully, after that happens, Sony will consider genuinely developing the gameplay side of EQ: instead of simply adding more of the same (with ever more lag-inducing eye-candy).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">DAoC has never been ahead of EQ, not even 1/2 of EQs number of accounts.  I heard for a while that DAoC had passed up UO, but the last stats I saw had UO slightly ahead (EQ in the mid 400k's and UO and DAoC in the low 200k's).  The other games were all much lower (except Lineage, which is over 1 million, but that is a very different subscription system).<br />
<br />
I think EQ will be around a long long time, but I do see population decline in the not-too-distant future.  I think that EQ2 and SWG will be the first games to actually start gnawing away at EQs population.  Unless EQ adds another expansion quickly that has a lot of things for lvl 65 non-raiders to do, they will lose a fair number of gamers to boredom.  Of course, they will most likely &quot;lose&quot; them to other Verant games, so it's all good for Big V =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">SWG has as many beta applications as EQ has active accounts. It will not flop, no way are they going to release a crappy game, not only does sony have alot of money at stake, but lucasarts has a rep at stake.<br />

I do think EQ2 will flop, whats the point?<br />

LoL...  I consider EQ to be mostly broken at this time anyway.  It reminds me of a D &amp; D game that has gone on so long that everthings is out of wack and it has become cartoonishly overpowered.<br />
<br />
What I expect SOE to do is to experiment quite a bit on EQ to find out what kinds of things work and what kind of things where just good ideas that stink.  You can't realy solve some of the fundamental problems that EQ has with how crazy equiment / characters have become without a major restructing of the game and server wipes to get rid of all the old characters.  The chalange in extending the longevity in EQ is in making the tremendously overpowered seam reasonable. <br />
<br />
Hummm....  after 4 years that means all the 12 year old are now 16 and all the eight year olds are now 12 and... perhaps EQ can survive for a long time.  *grins*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Akhasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">DAOC was never anywhere near EQ as far as popularity.  I'd wager that 90% of the people that ran to daoc from EQ are back playing EQ today.<br />
<br />
SW:G is not great.  It's different, and though beautiful, really not alot of fun.  I'm hoping for good things from EQ2, but I'm thinking we won't see a real threat to EQ until WoW...so far it seems to be the real killer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">EQ2 - we'll get to watch SOE screw up balancing skill trees instead of classes.  <br />
<br />
The interesting thing about the Sony games - development budget.  Last I saw - EQ was 5 mil, SWG was 10 mil, and EQ2 was 15 mil.  Since EQ2 has 3 times the development budget of the original EQ, can we expect 3 times the fun or 3 times the original content?  We already know Sony is stripping several key features from the SWG release due to &quot;last minute&quot;, unforseen problems in the programming schedule.<br />
<br />
Guess we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">pre-pop I felt SoE had realy balanced the classes well, post pop they screwed up big time. The whole uber guild oriented expantion was retarded. The guild I'm in was about 4th or 5th guild on my server and I still only have the option of PoV for exp. True partly cause I just cant play much anymore but still thats just gay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Do people understand that SWG isnt even in final beta yet? How can you say it sucks?<br />
<br />
<br />
You all remember EQ in beta? I do, and compared to EQ today, guess what, it sucked.<br />
<br />
<br />
Online games evolve, no game is real great untill release at minimum. I have been waiting my whole damn life to play something deep in the Star Wars universe, as alot of others have, and not just kids, Star Wars was what, 27 years ago now?<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ sucked in beta, comparatively as well, rememebr that, and the launch had alot of problems too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Daoc, smooth launch, fun for a while, but no deep content.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;Do people understand that SWG isnt even in final beta yet? How can you say it sucks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;EQ sucked in beta, comparatively as well, rememebr that, and the launch had alot of problems too.&quot;<br />
<br />
You contradicted yourself there mill... a little bit.  EQ could have been considered beta for months after its release.  They didnt even have the spells filled in for all the classes etc etc.  What makes you think they wont do that again.<br />
<br />
True MMPOGs do evolve.  So why is it wrong to say SWG will suck when it is released? (ie features at release being narrowed) From what I have read on it the only real initial pull will be the universe liscense. So it could very well suck for awhile... I am sure your statement on evolving will work with SWG because well... its Star Wars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Akhasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I didn't go so far as to say SW:G sucked, but I'm not far from that point.  I'm familiar with beta, and I can separate the game from the glitches, and to me, the game just isn't all that much fun.  Its not the bugs or content that I'm not liking, its the game play, mechanics, and basic engine.  Thats not to say its a bad game; its just not my bag, baby.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Also SWG will be limited because the designs and developments will have to go through more &quot;red tape&quot;.  I doubt Lucas or whatever group that is in charge of Star Wars will allow freedom for the game to evolve without restraints.   I'm sure everything has to be overseen or checked for the Lucas vision of Star Wars.<br />
<br />
The last thing I want to see is some stuck up MAC designer Star Wars nerd making up his own characters and races which have nothing to do with the story's history.<br />
<br />
Since the game must meet some requirements of Lucas and company, the game will be mostly or all CG with low budget crappy NPC actors.   I can hardly wait.  I'm peeing my pants!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">i think i'll be going to EQ2.<br />
depending on how things develop by the time EQ2 comes out i may or may not keep my EQ1 account to play as well.<br />
<br />
like everyone else said..eq1 is staying for a long time to come, it's making money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">SWG will kick huge arse as far as bringing in the money -- it almost won't matter how good or bad it is, at least initially.  Partly because it's drawing from a potential audience that is huge compared to the one for EQ.  Star Wars is a worldwide phenomenon for what, 25 years or something?  People grew up playing with the toys, eating the Happy Meals, wearing the t-shirts and halloween costumes -- and then they went and had kids who are doing the same thing!  EQ is known to ... uh, well I know I myself definitely heard about it.<br />
<br />
And Uggok I think is correct in implying that EQ will lose more people than others would guess -- and maintain a continuing exit rate higher than it used to have -- if a new expansion doesn't come out very soon that has content for post-60 players who will not or cannot be in hard core raiding guilds or who have trouble going through the multiple flags, each one dependent on completing the one before it, that PoP requires.  PoP remains a paradise for some, and a great disappointment for a very significant proportion of other players -- I've seen a number vanish already, personally, and others whose interest has turned from almost rabid to indifferent at best.  I count myself among the latter.<br />
<br />
EQ will probably be &quot;fixed&quot; before it guts itself too severely with its own mistakes, but if not for the influx of cash from LoY, I think some people at Sony would have a lot of explaining to do about the bottom line this particular year.  LoY should help to paper over some of it, and give them some breathing time to get their act in order.</div></div><hr />
