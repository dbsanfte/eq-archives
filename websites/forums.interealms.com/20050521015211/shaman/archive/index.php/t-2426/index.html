<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">like the title says, when i have Luc models turned on no velious armor shows up ie..rygorr, quest armors.<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nothing. Thats not a bug it's they way they have stated things will work. The new models require lots of memory to use and so do the luclin graphics. Can't currently have both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya can. I have some luclin models on alongside old models and velious textures, theres an option in the ini file.<br />
<br />
It causes some horrific graphic bugs for me though. Gamil, you may find you have to take your visable armour off, zone and then re-equip before you can see yourself in velious textures again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Luclin engine was designed to overwrite Velious. You have to turn off all the velious stuff to make the Luclin stuff work (or so i have bin told)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In the client.ini file.<br />
<br />
It is either<br />
<br />
Showarmor#21 to OFF<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
Showarmor#23 to OFF.<br />
<br />
I forgot which one exactly.<br />
<br />
One of those has fixed many peoples problems with the armor graphics Velious/Luclin thing.<br />
<br />
This should put you on the right track.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />
