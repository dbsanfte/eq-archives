<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">played a 7 day trial of this and I prefer eq before this because of:<br />
EQ has a risk / reward system. The harder the mob the better the lewt. HZ has no risk and no reward. Everyone can do everything single up to his own level for no loot - except coins and kewl stuff like hides, stones and wood. <br />
There are bossmobs but these are for quests (ok, some of them give good rewards like unique spells). <br />
There are lots of dragons but they are all players and you can not kill them.<br />
There are huge towns but noone lives in em.<br />
There are huge areas and even less live like in the towns.<br />
GFX of the terrain is nice but the boobs suck. :(<br />
<br />
The game is probably not the best programmed (I am no programmer so its just what I think). Slim Coding is not known at Artifact. I wanted to see the game in high details and HZ used up to 1 GB virtual Mem additional to my 1GB Ram. <br />
<br />
Overall it was a nice game for some hours, a picknick outside of Norrath but i miss the challenge in that game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">sounds like it more of a proper rpg<br />
<br />
not just a hack n slash fest based of a mediocre rpg called D and D.<br />
<br />
perhaps noone lives in town yet, as until thers moreplayers, ther noone to populate the houses ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm actually playing Horizon in my few free time and i think it can be a nice evolution of the mmorpg. <br />
Yes, no loot, then no camping, no ppl uba-dressed.<br />
After a kill you got coins and maibe a crafting item.<br />
You can choose 2 separate type of grow, the adventure one and the crafter one.<br />
Any time you can change with the help of a trainer your class and you can save some of your &quot;powers&quot; you got with you r previous classes. Some have pre requisit some not.<br />
You want a new spell ? or you buy it from a player or you forage some sandstone slab, trasform with a machine in sandstone brick, trasform it in a spell shard and write the formula of the spell on the shard. Then you can write it on your spell book. <br />
Easy ^__^<br />
Any mounth or so there is a new event that need the work of a lot of ppl to do a compless quest or a costruction, so the event are done not only by the big guilds.<br />
The evil boss are not up atm, they shall update half of the world soon and add a lot of stuffs.<br />
I personally visited a big castle with no mob inside... hope to go back soon to kill something inside it. <br />
Any question?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm enjoying Horizons.  <br />
It's geared yes, toward the less obsessed gamer.  Most classes can solo pretty well, so you're not forced to group unless you want to.<br />
The tradeskill system is more advanced than EQ, and you know exactly what you have to combine, to get an item.<br />
Experience in trading and adventuring is explicitly stated - there are no hidden exp bonuses/penalties for one class vs another.<br />
You can tailor your character by multiclassing, if you want.<br />
Most of the best gear is made by players, in a player driven economy.  If you don't want to buy it from another person, the tradeskill system is easy to learn and advance in, IMHO.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's got bugs and stuff it has to work out, but EQ had more than their share in their first year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can still remember how in EQ you had entire zones with the building walls made of character model faces and GMs that had to come respawn mobs, merchants all the time, and merchants that were uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But the real question is..... How are the archers? are they EQ rangers? or real archers....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Played it most of Jan and Feb before I closed my account to go back to EQ.  Aside from buggy code, the problem is that they did not develop a community.  <br />
<br />
My first main was scrapped after it was locked out of the game for over a week because the support was so lousy - I identified the problem right after it happened and asked for the fix (delete what files to fix?).  It took over a week for the support staff to figure out what I was looking for.   It took me 5 mins to fix after they told me which files I needed to delete.<br />
<br />
My second main (the one I developed while my original was locked out) made a total of 52 adv levels solo.  When I quit it was a shaman, but to become a shaman they needed 36 levels of lesser classes like druids.<br />
<br />
There is little reason to group up in the game - all chars can pretty well do any skills they are willing to train.  So finding folks to group with can be a problem.<br />
<br />
The craft system is fun - for the first 20 levels in most classes. Buying a lot (when you can find one available - most of em are tied up by peopl who quit the game) is interesting - until you start to build.  Buildings take tons of heavy resources and your toon has limited capacity.  Once you have trained to the point where you can create those resources, it becomes a series of FedEx tasks to gather a ton of resources - the good ones are a ways away from any transportation - trudge them to the appropriate shed, create the materials, trudge the materials to the plot, spend a couple seconds installing them on the plot.  Do this a few hundred or a few thousand times and you have a house or silo with no functionality - Congratz!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">so Wilcas, you not so happy of HZ adventuring and HZ crafting?</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL that pretty well covers it - except for adventureing and crafting and grouping and building, it is a fine game.  Oh and mobs - there is not much variety.  And gear - all the toons wear the same gear so they all look the same.<br />
<br />
It did keep me busy for 2 months though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think that is a good start for a game, i traveled a lot till the end of the world (really, i passed the barrier for the east continent and till end of the terrains) and i visited a really nice castle. I'm sure i want to go back soon after they put the WA on (named) <br />
Atm the named mob you can find are for quest. <br />
No camp, no silly argue for &quot;that's my mob!! i wait 6 hours for it!! Orc camp is mine!!&quot;<br />
Not easy to do camparation to a 4 years game and a new one.<br />
Im really proud about the impact of the european ppl, always in the first to finish the world events!!<br />
<br />
.... but a greate shadow is coming up ..... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like the crafting system in Horizons.<br />
<br />
1)  You get experience and hence levels for everything you do so progression does not depend on infrequent random skill ups - with all the frustration that goes with it.<br />
<br />
2) The interface for crafting is second to none.<br />
<br />
3) When creating stuff by crafting, you can choose to produce decent gear or else take the time to buy or farm the extra components needed to create top of the range gear - literally the best gear in the game.  This is a refreshing contrast to EQ where dedicating huge amounts of time and pp results in you being able to produce nothing better than 'the suit of the gimp' when compared to the gear obtainable by raiding.<br />
<br />
The housing (plots) idea, on the other hand, is a total waste.  Not enough of it reproduces some of the worst camping squabbles found in EQ.  Luckily housing isn't necessary so its best left to the kiddies to fight over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">EQ has a risk / reward system. The harder the mob the better the lewt. HZ has no risk and no reward.<br />
<br />
And if the lewt is at all worthwhile then the leet dudes in the leet guilds pharm it and the majority of the playerbase never get to see the mobs at all.<br />
<br />
I agree that having the mobs without decent loot is bad.  But its far better than just having empty spawn spots because the mobs are never up.  As it stands you can go up against the top mobs in Horizons if you want the challenge, because the leet players leave them alone.<br />
<br />
Hopefully leet mobs and leet drops will come to Horizons when they implement the correct place for these - instanced dungeons.</div></div><hr />

True enough about the interface.  But after about 150 levels in the various crafts (I like crafting) I found that most of my time was spent running to remote locations collecting resources.  Making high-end items never paid enough to justify - they did not sell at enough of a premium over the regular items to cover the cost of the parts.  I only made them for personal use and for friends.</div></div><hr />

Fair point.  Worse still, money itself becomes no motivation because at the moment its not hard to get more money than there are things to spend it on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm listening friends that are doing Tier3 items that have this problems to get components. Lot of search, not much buyer.<br />
Probably the only positive way is that guilds have access to those Spells (for exemple) easy and you help your friends. <br />
Sure not to get money.<br />
I got few money from selling Tier 1 spells, not a big deal.</div></div><hr />
