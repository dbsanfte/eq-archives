<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>StormCrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A while back there was a post here with a really good parse of AC.<br />
Was done in nadox i believe, showed several pasres with different AC up to about 1200 proving anything over 1000 wasn't that much of a difference.<br />
<br />
Does anybody know where that post is? i have searched for it but didnt find anything<br />
I have over 1000 AC now so I know im fine there but I started a new shaman on a PvP server also, so now im digging up old info to do things different this time that i didnt know before. <br />
<br />
I know a shaman isnt the best choice anymore on a normal server much less a PvP but as much as I think we're getting screwed I like my shaman and made another one. Wont be a main character anyway, just something new to do and something a little different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Further tests seem to indicate that greater AC is in fact effective as the ATK rating of the mobs faced scales up.<br />
<br />
Basically, against a mob with an ATK of 800, there isn't much difference between 1000 AC and 1200 AC . . . but against a mob with an ATK of 1400, there is a noticeable difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember that post as well and yeah, AC is totally dependent on what you are fighting.<br />
<br />
GoD is even more overamped than PoP was and I see 2.2K AC knights get mowed down like they were naked.  AC on a shaman with a 200 defensive max is a pretty low priority IMO, but you can gain a certain level of immunity from old content with high AC.  I suppose it is all about where you spend your time. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, as has been pointed out the value of AC is determined by the mob's ATK. In Nadox I doubt it's over 1000, and judging by my mitigation in PoJ I'd say the enforcers and punishers have an ATK around 1200, my current unbuffed AC. <br />
<br />
PoV mobs hit for max a little more often, suggesting say 1300 or 1400, whereas in GoD... well, the triple 1050 I received yesterday for getting too close to a pooka suggests their ATK is likely 1500 or up. <br />
<br />
I do intend to do more parsing at some stage, as with an upgraded Q and a fair chunk of extra HPs since March, more targets become available.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, my rough guide for AC and content (I used to parse a lot of data, these days I just aim for max HP/AC/resists) ...<br />
<br />
Original EQ content, AC ~ 800 for sweet spot<br />
Kunuk / Velious content, AC ~ 1000-1200 sweet spot<br />
PoP content, AC ~ 1400 - 1600 sweet spot<br />
GoD content, AC ~ 1800 sweet spot (since the knight tanking patch, pre patch I couldn't find a sweet spot for AC).<br />
<br />
I currently sit on AC 1978 buffed, and I can tell you, it makes a difference on GoD mobs now (whereas before the knight tanking patch, I was still getting mowed down fast) ...<br />
<br />
Have now got a collection of screenshots similar to this from all over GoD ...<br />
