<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Culgar</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two days ago, after my long break from EQ, I finally got the AA points nessissary for AM3 and my title of Hunter (also big thanks to those reimbursed innate regeneration points hehe)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I carry a War Bow of Rallos Zek, and use Blessed Champion arrows. With 255 (I'm not 61 YET) Dex and Str, arround 1400ish atk, the majority of my shots are in the 500 range.  Lows in 300s and high non crits being in 1001-1013. Slap SOS and focus ontop of that and my dmg raises another 100 or 200 on average.<br />
<br />
Before people start thinking this is a bragging post - I have (and most of you out there) always been under the belief that Rogues where the highest source of non-mana based dmg. I am confident beyond a doubt I can out damage most Rogues* but I want to know if any other Warders or Forest Stalkers agree with me on this? or should I change my path and return to building up my hp, and take my Claw of Vyzh`dra out of my glove slot and put it back into my primary?<br />
<br />
(* the Warder writing this is very well aware that there are some freak rogues out there that can do some insane stuff giving the right environment.)</div></div><hr />

You want your dmg to go up even more get a primal =D  I hit for 500 a lot with the primal, with about the same stats as you, aside from 265 dex..  I have Warbow as well, but I have found that my primal outdamages it.. dmg range is usually in the 400's to 600's.  <br />

With a Warbow you can crit for over 2000 using Trueshot.<br />
<br />
It's a shame they gave people the option to turn critical hits off, those constant strings of crits for 500 and 600 are one of the best advertisements rangers could ever want.</div></div><hr />

The more people see it, the more people will whine. The more people whine, the quicker it gets nerfed. I like it this way :)<br />

<br />
During our minute of glory (Trueshot) we certainly can. Generally I have to admit Rogues are still by far the kings of (non magic) damage.<br />
<br />
Even with EQ/AM3 and a great bow, melee will remain a very if not the most important ability we have.<br />

By the way, Nice tiltle for a post, Prince/TAFKAP could make a nice song out of it. He is more the bird type tho.</div></div><hr />

I see I have received my bonkage, someone noticed =D  I have been a glade stalker for at least 2 years and Have been a ranger all my EQ life which has been since the start of the Quellious server..  My first post has been made now tho..<br />

Been doing a lot of pick up groups lately.  Have started getting lots and lots of invites to groups now.  I think groups seeing me Crticial for 1150 (at 63 with AOW bow) has a lot to do with getting more group offers now.<br />
<br />
Except the Giants in Pof Storm, everything seems to have pretty low AC/Mitigation allowing for some nice archery useage.  Didnt fight too many giants in Storm so maybe just  a bad string from the random number generator.<br />
<br />
BTW anyone know what to do with the Stormgiants Head from Valor? mine was eaten when I turn it in to one of the NPCs in the cave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 03:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've hunted pretty often with a max-archery AAed Ranger using Primal and presumably the top-notch arrows.  I'm presently a 63 Rogue and she is a 64 Ranger (well, likely 65 by the next time I see her).<br />
<br />
In PoV fighting in nice LoS-friendly environments she can certainly put up some nice numbers and with a /disc can just plain destroy some things.  Assuming she stops shooting the mezzed targets it is good fun for all involved and I always like having a Ranger for the buffs =)<br />
<br />
I do still parse out in the lead for overall damage though and by a margin that makes me comfortable.  It certainly doesn't mean I am doing so on every single target but there we are.  Don't get into the whole critical hit business though, that is hardly an indication of dps.  I know I perk up when I make a nice string of critical backstabs but it is the spam of 60-100s that make up the bulk of my output in any fight.<br />
<br />
Parse out your archery damage versus your melee damage sometime though and see what you find.  I certainly suspect that the archery is superior with the requisite AAs but I still can't say that it appears to be outdamaging Rogues at this point.  Do remember that Rogues now have some damage increasing AAs as well ;)<br />
<br />
Caveat:  This may well skew more as the spells become more common.  A Ranger with the top self-buffs will be performing better than ever of course.  Heck I notice the differance in the wolf AA already.  Still, the gap is large enough yet that I won't feel like I am completely out of a job for some time to come.<br />

I am confident beyond a doubt I can out damage most Rogues <br />
<br />
Well lets take a look at some parses posted in the general forum:<br />
<br />
Relv: Some parsing in Valor with a bard... <br />
65 ROG with bloodbath/bonechiller: 200 DPS <br />
65 RNG (me) with AM3 primal bow: 175 DPS <br />
65 RNG (me) with AHB/vyzh`dra claw: 125 DPS <br />
<br />
So archery doesn't scale as much as leveling and rogues certainly do outdamage us at the end, which is fine<br />
<br />
This is how it should be; Rangers will probably outdamage Rogues with their disciplin (which is cool), and Rogues slightly outdamage rangers overall. Archery as it is now is pretty balanced Imo, and don't need a nerf.  <br />
But for crying out loud... grow up will ya?? &quot;when rogues cry&quot; toss some less fuel on the fire and stop kicking the dead horse already!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulvian Stormweaver</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally only issue I have right now with Ranger damage, is our pure meele being a little lacking compared to non damage dealer meeles.<br />
<br />
And the fact Archery suffers so greatly in encounters which can not give good LoS, that its as good as useless there.<br />
<br />
Someone posted that a Paladin with Golden Rod Vs Ranger using Swiftwind/Strands of Corrupted mana is a<br />
Paladin: 82 dps with 40% haste<br />
Ranger: 84 dps with 40 % haste<br />
<br />
Somehow, that strikes me as um, retarded? Paladins are better tanks than all of the damage dealer classes (since monks got nerfed) therefore I do not see that they should be infering on the damage output of one of those classes. <br />
Now true that Goldenrod is much harder to obtain than Strands of mana, but its not a ground breaking mob encounter difficulty increase.<br />
Comparing the Braids to Claw of Vyz, its only a 10% primary hand output increase. So based on the popular belief that main hand = 70 percent of your damage, and offhand is about 30%, the weapon upgrade from Strands, to Claw would only yield a 7% total Dps increase. <br />
in that instance<br />
Paladin: 82<br />
Ranger: 90.<br />
within 10% damage of each other.<br />
Im not asking for Paladins to get nerfslapped, but I am certainly asking for Rangers to recieve an improved damage table for meele, and maybe triple attack, via AA, or other means.<br />
<br />
Just wishful thinking maybe though.<br />
<br />
My view on things:<br />
assuming all primal, epics where appropriate (Rng/Monk/Rog)<br />
Dps from meele (assuming maxed out offensive meele AA's) 100% haste, and no disciplines ran<br />
should be @<br />
<br />
Monk: 190<br />
Rogue: 210<br />
Ranger: 165 (meele) 190 (archery- Keep in mind that this one costs a jackload of AA, invloves maxing the hardest combat skill, and also the most broken combat skill)<br />
Warrior: 140<br />
Paladin: 110<br />
Shadowknight: 115-120<br />
<br />
This puts Rangers roughly 20% behind monks, and roughy 30% behind rogues, while 20% ahead of warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rangers tank nowhere near as good as Warriors, or Knights. Therefore our damage output should be noticeably higher, not just with an extremely hard to use skill which also happens to be broken to all hell.</div></div><hr />

Those extra 10 dam 3 levels earlier means 400 more damage ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ulvian Stormweaver</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 03:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, someone parsed out that increasing your arrows from 1 dmg to 10 dmg = 70% raw damage increase.<br />
<br />
Technically EQ would boost bow damage higher than AM1, and even rival AM1+2 with the right arrows used.</div></div><hr />
