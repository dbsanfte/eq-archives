<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I saw the pet focus item and thought it would be nifty. Then I learned it was Nec,Mag,Bst only. Well, I figured that if they get something like that there is bound to be something for us. Is there?<br />
<br />
I might be comparing apples and oranges here<br />
Pet classes get pet focus<br />
Melee get vengance and procs.<br />
What do the rest of us get that helps us with what we do daily? Is there nothing or is there stuff that I have not heard of or didn't pay attention to. Note that I do not count hp/mana/regen and FT as those benefit all more or less the same. Should I?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a burning affliction 3 augment, but I haven't seen a BA4 one yet =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry, nothing for us to that magnitude.  You should know by now our class will never get anything that will improve us at all.  Its been this way since Kunark.  <br />
<br />
Accept it, enjoy it, and forget it  =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the super nice item we got was the spell turgurs back in 99 or 2000</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lets see...<br />
There is the Spore-Covered Pebble of Warding : AC 4, Type 1. Err, wait.. that sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have you noticed that several WIS- and INT-caster usable items have only INT OR WIS? What is up with that?<br />
<br />
One would think, after a few years they knew how to itemize an expansion (who am i kidding after looking at some PoP loot tables, hehe).<br />
<br />
Maybe it is too difficult?<br />
WIS-caster usable: add WIS<br />
INT-caster usable: add INT.<br />
<br />
And don't forget to throw in +20 CHA for good. /sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Grumpy early morning rambling aside, i really hope they come up with some serious tweaking of several LDoN-topics. Overall it is a very nice expansion so far.<br />
<br />
Medium adventure difficulty please - thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And don't forget to throw in +20 CHA for good. /sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Yes, I've noticed this too. I guess it was just too hard to raise charisma, so they had to balance that with this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Some warriors have been complaining about the inability to get their CHA up to help with DI.  I think I remember seeing posts about that on the Steel Warrior and FoH boards.<br />
<br />
Interesting to see warriors suggesting to rerolls and new players wanting to be raid tanks someday &quot;race doesn't matter, but make sure to put all your starting points into CHA!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">actually i investigated this myself when i noticed the mag/bst/nec one, and i found a spell effect on lucy that seems to be a possibility for shm pet focus...<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4406&amp;source=Live<br />
... its the same effect as the mag/bst/nec one but under a different name. this effect isnt on any merchant items my guess is it from a raid drop probably or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its also not on any known drop. :/</div></div><hr />
