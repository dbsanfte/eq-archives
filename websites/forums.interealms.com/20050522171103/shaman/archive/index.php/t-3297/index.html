<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seethor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Silly Question, but...<br />
<br />
Just scribed Group Focus. I really never used HoS as I preferred to give Kragg and the Tali line of group buffs… so my question.<br />
<br />
When you are grouped with Int casters, do they like to get hit with Group Focus? Is it similar to Kragg/Tuna in that it overwrites their own personal buffs? Do you just cast it and hit everyone in your group with it, and if not, do you just tell them to go around a corner or far away so they don't?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only people that *really* seem to dislike it are clerics (because it overwrites their Blessed Armor of the Risen spell). If I'm group lead I'll control-D the cleric (disbanding him) right before I cast the spell. If I'm not I'll just warn him that I'm over-writing his BAotR spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, I have been scolded a time or two by clerics.  This is yet another retarded stacking issue.  Why would a group buff from person X overwrite a self only buff on person Y?  The effects of the two spells are not the same.  <br />
<br />
It should be a &quot;Your spell did not take hold&quot;  situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mairi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have noticed with HoS that it will overwrite any of the shielding line of spell. Not sure which line of cleric buffs it overwrites, but I know it will. I was told by a guild wizzie that he has a new shield spell that gives him mana regen, and HoS overwrites it, so will I please just give him a dex buff now instead of  HoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">f that, just tell themn to click it off and they can recast their own buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm with Wildaar.<br />
<br />
I tell 'em it's a group buff and click it off if they don't want it.  I get amazed at the people who bitch when I junk buff the group with Talisman of Jacinth and Shadoo, &quot;but I got my own junks - I don't need yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
You have become better at coping! (47)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You just have to educate your friends and guildies a little. It's a pretty long cast so if you announce it they usually have plenty of time to get out of range, no need to disband. If they can't at that time, they should send a tell right away so you can abort. When they get used to it it's pretty funny. I'd say like &quot;/gu ae FoS inc in 24 secs&quot; and you'd usually see some melees and druids hugging you while most clerics and some wizards were running around a corner lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Generally Int casters seem to prefer it over their shielding line as long as they don't need the magic resist that shielding gives.<br />
<br />
As for clerics, I just cast it and let them worry about it. If they complain, I threaten to recast it on them in the middle of a big fight. That usually does the trick.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Level 59 shaman buffed me with HoS.  Problem was that I already had level 60 Khuras focusing and the level 59 HoS overwrote it.  Definately some bugs happening with HoS.  Perhaps they can fix it in time.  Whos to say how much time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think it's the most ridiculous thing when clerics or any int caster that bitches when their so precious self buff gets over-written.<br />
I can spend over one minute, wasting 2500 mana for the five that need it (including myself), or less than half in time,  for 1250 mana.   Same applies for MGB.  Casters just gotta cope and understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Clerical and Fingerwaggler oppression is good.  I enjoy casting GFoS on groups  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ninja focus is even more fun, nothing riles up clerics than having Focus on for the past 30 min without realizing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Casters asides from Clerics don't like either, as it overwrites their Shield of the Magi... (mana regen shield)<br />
<br />
Most Casters (wizards) especially don't want it, but if buffing up for a raid, say for sontalak or klandicar, they can just click off and recast Shield Imho... hehe<br />
<br />
We buff for the good of the group, if the casters start whining... I say... ****!!! And Click it off and recast haha<br />
<br />
Anyways, best wishes and regards,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shield of the Magi DOES NOT have mana regen.  I think yer casters are BS'ing you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/cheer Boinshar!<br />
<br />
You get bonus points if you can get grp focus on 2 clerics and have both not notice.<br />
<br />
SCORE!<br />
<br />
anyways, I find that most casters I am around prefer focus over shielding in most situations.  Certainly other HP conscious classes like Necros and Enchanters.</div></div><hr />
