<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sartog1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I took part in the final SK epic fight - killing Lhranc in CoM and got that. I'm upto the part with Kirn in the Hole and am wondering if I've got to do one step again in that lost faction - any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd  try to redo Ghiosk's books.  Allegedly, if you don't receive faction increases for that step, you're beyond the &quot;appropriate range&quot; and should be OK for the next step.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bordainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I lost my tear to Rak because i was not ally to him from doing part of epic out of order.  I than killed the mob and did turn  in i skiped, Rak became ally and this time he agro and i finished epic.  Also Rak would not speak to me even at ally but he did drop the sacled i needed when he was ally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shandy do you have any proof of this appropriate range thing you speak of? I'm max ally and i haven't gone past the com books...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bordainn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Who did u con to get ally? Cuase i am walking proff shaman epic is faction based. Lost my loot from fear cause of it.  I would take your problem serious Shandy and ask around cause i almost died when i lost my tear from epic.  But as far as killing kirn in hole, who cares all u can loose is a scale u find on the ground, maybe take the chance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can repeatedly do the drunk shaman quest over and over to increase faction. No need for items just back and forth in the same zone, then destroy the gem you receive after each time.<br />
Once you given him the gem can just say &quot;You can drink booze&quot; and he will spawn the spirit. <br />
<br />
In fact just do this till you get max faction and get the tear MQ'd and you can have a level 1 epic shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What's the faction hit like on the drunk shaman part? I've done the woe/envy part to wandering spirit 3 or 4 times. I think I'm at kindly. Just have Kirn and Neh/Rak left. Would really like to just do the faction and turn in my tear. Have done COM/Hole raids for shamans more times than I can remember so I've had the &quot;pain and sufferign&quot; of shaman epic.. <br />
<br />
I got tired of waiting on the wandering spirit every few hours and I'm not realy patient as it is, so I keep putting epic on the back burner (even though I shouldn't)<br />
<br />
This drunken part might be my solution.. (Is it possible to get ally in one night is my question I suppose)<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would think the faction hits for the drunken shaman is very small. Anyone bored enough to see how many trips it takes to go up a faction level? :) <br />
<br />
BTW, I didn't realize the SK TS faction goes down, not up. My SK friend swears it goes up (and is reset upon completion). And I would think that only the quester gets the faction hits (up or down). Otherwise, it seems possible to super twink a shaman through the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SK epic has +hits all the way along. The final turn in puts them  from ally down to dubious usually.<br />
<br />
I don't remember ever actually taking a hit for killing the final mob though...just know the SK takes a hit on turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">who did I con? well let's see, just about every npc involved in the shaman epic will tell your True Spirit faction :P</div></div><hr />
