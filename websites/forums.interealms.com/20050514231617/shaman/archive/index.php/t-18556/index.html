<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">awesome and while on the topic of necros, anyone have just a quick suggestion of fairly short duration camps for necro equip. hard isnt the question, im a 65 shaman, but if its a 30 hour camp ill skip it.<br />
<br />
I made a necro and he is now 21 and is mostly naked, so i just wanna toss a few things on him.<br />
<br />
Thnx, ill let this thread die after this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The same guy that gives out the harvester also offer robe, gloves and boots that about the same quality as the harverster.<br />
<br />
Boots and gloves are no drop but the turn in items are not if I remember correctly.  The clothing is all solid black in color.<br />
<br />
Honestly, 3 - 4k dropped in the bazaar will net you far better items for less of a price.  Follow the same rule of thumb as you do when equipping your shaman and look for mana and HP items (AC isn't a priority in this case).  They'll go the farthest in today's EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your far better off camping some cash items and buying what you want in bazaar, their are tons of nice no rec level gear out there that are really cheap to really expensive.<br />
My necro experience is limited to approx 30 levels and grouping with a friends dad (yeah I am cool like that) but in general from what I have seen if you gear them like you would a shaman, hit point/stamina gear and then worry about mana/int then your going to do better than an all Int cast junk one is.<br />
In fact I know several necros (of similar level and gear that I wear) that have as many or nearly as many hit points as I do...and I know several high end necros that have WAY more than me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ok thnx for the input everyone. he is just a fun alt, so i didnt wanna drop a few k, but maybe if i farm up a lil bit of money, it wont hurt so bad ;)<br />
<br />
I think im also going to look for 30ish necros and ask them what they got on for ideas on gear.<br />
<br />
Thnx again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Id farm PP with your Shaman and then go to the bazar and by player made gear. All the LoY Robes have usefull effects on them and are super cheap to make. Basically just takes a rune to make and runes are easy to come by these days. All the loy robes dont have a lvl limit on them either.<br />
<br />
I seen nothing other than the coldain wrist and focus quest from WL that I would even bother with personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>graul_maul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">be careful here.  I started out the same as you, created a necro alt for some fun.......<br />
<br />
My necro is now level 63, 20% from the next level.  I can't tell you when the last time I played my shaman was, other then to fill in a group spot if I decide to group with my necro that day, and then I only switch to him for a slow, or to Q the tank, cast a buff here and there.  The rest of the time I am on the necro. <br />
<br />
Can't say it will affect you like it did me, but this could be the retirement of your shaman if you are not careful, heh.<br />
<br />
Played my shaman since 1999, and now before 2003 comes to an end, he is finally being put to rest.  BTW, this necro is the only other character I have played.  I know most of you have several characters above 60 or even at 65, but I myself could not get a single alt past level 5 in all those years.  Shaman was just to fun, that is until I played a necromancer.<br />
<br />
They should put a warning label on them or something.<br />
<br />
For gear, I think the norm is to get your INT to 200.  Or as close as you can get it to 200.  After that, work on HPS/MANA gear.  It is extremely easy and cheap to hit the 200 INT range from Bazaar.  Really cheap.  Now, trying to switch out gear to keep that 200 INT pool, yet add HPS/MANA gear, well that gets a bit more expensive, but until you reach level 50+ you won't need to worry about it.  I myself kept that harvester equiped until I was like level 61 heh.  And I still did great with my necro.<br />
<br />
Also, be on the look out for an item, Pre-nurf CoS.  Circlet of Shadow.  These don't drop any longer, but they give the necromancer insta-click invis.  Trust me in this, it is the greatest thing since sliced bread for a necro.  Now, normally these can run anywhere from 50k to 250k depending on your server.  Now before you go no way, I can't spend that kind of cash remember this.  I said the same thing.  But, I kept on the search, and after a few months, I found a necromancer that had switched servers.  He had however kept his old Pre-nurfed CoS on the server I live on.  I told him I was broke as could be, which was true, I had about 10k saved up at that time with my shaman.  He sold me the CoS for 4k......You read right, 4k, for probably one of the single best items a necromancer can have.  So always keep an eye open for this item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Balls to 200int, buy as much cheap focus gear as ya can (level2/3 stuff affliction haste, BA, mana pres etc) then blow the rest on HP wherever possible.<br />
<br />
Doing this should set you back well under 10k, and you won't worry for upgrades until the 50's.</div></div><hr />

MP2 can be had at level 1 via an easy quest in PoK - get 4 items in the Bazaar for 50pp (total) and you are all set. The ring adds HP too, so it's a double win for the Necro :) I have done this quest for all my &lt;50 casters, even my 41 BST who uses it when setting up, which is when he spends most of his mana.</div></div><hr />

Yea i stumbled across that while looking through allahk and omg what a easy quest for such a nice low level item. took me all of 10 min, but it did cost like 200ish pp for me cause the price of high quality cougar skins were through the roof on my server. but its all good, its a nice item that took very lil time.<br />
<br />
Now i need some regen items i can camp or have made easy and ill be set :)</div></div><hr />
