<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why didn't shaman get a dire charm?  (Animals only of course)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Because druids would have pitched a fit if we had.<br />
<br />
Plus I dont think the charm animal line was ever something we were intended to use heavily. I stopped charming animals when I was in my mid-30s.<br />
<br />
Would be fun if Verant included a new mob type falling under the 'spirit' category (sort of a broad collection of mobs, akin to animals, undead, summoned, etc) with Planes of Power, and gave shamen a 'Dire Charm - Spirit' AA ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spirit Charm sounds like fun.  However, I think that shamans would be just a bit overpowered if we could dire charm ANYTHING.  Our pet is already a huge boon to our soloing ability (he helps a lot when he tanks every third mob for you), and our pet is a complete puss.  The idea of dire charming a level 45 mob is just sick.  Haste it, slow other mobs, give it a heal when need be.  Endless exp for no effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i hope there are as many useful spirits for you guys as there are &quot;animals&quot; for druids.<br />
<br />
then you'll see how useless charm really is. only chanter dire charm is worth it, and maybe necro if they solo grey a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I heard the worms in the grey can be druid DC'd ... anyone confirm?<br />
<br />
That's a nice pet to have for sure... hehe ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">am fairly sure they can be charmed but too high for DC. i may be wrong tho. if so grey and chardok would be the 2 possible use zones for DC<br />
<br />
<br />
remember this tho, we can't heal our pets worth ****, and without someone to slow, they really get torn up :P<br />
<br />
if a shaman could slow a mob for their DCed pet....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe 'cause that would make us overpowered? Shaman class is very powerfull and versatile as it is (that meaning that we are not pet class). /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Corwil Delyonhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">they took FULL charm away from Shaman back in Beta. <br />
<br />
A guy can dream though ... and of course cry in my morning tea over the current state of charm animal spell we have. Back in Cazic before they changed it - shaman were gods in their 30s in the sewers. Used to solo there a ton... Charm a gator and go nuts. <br />
<br />
It's just too bad that everything changes - I sure wish today's shaman could experience that. It was FUN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maiden's Eye, Jentriken.<br />
<br />
I see druids go there, Dire Charm themselves a wolf and make mass XP slaughtering monkey-men.<br />
<br />
God, druids are such whiners.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was charming animals all the way to 50 in Kedge Keep before they nerfed us. Yes it was a nerf. We were charming things for over a year before they decided to modify our charm animal line.<br />
Also was useable in Fear. Boy the good ole' days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Druids can probably dire charm in SG as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vandulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Forget when we could still use Charm animal to some use in KK<br />
<br />
I remember when I have the spell Charm, that's right the Enchanter spell Charm.<br />
<br />
The only other class that has been nerfed more and compensated less I would say is the Necro.<br />
<br />
When Verant (And when i say that, I mean the crack smoking monkies) decided that we were not a &quot;Melee&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot; class and our only ability was to slow, why did we get a dot on the epic?<br />
<br />
Our &quot;Dire Charm&quot; should have been an unresistable Slow spell that you get every 72 minutes.  Imagine whole guilds asking you on a raid to slow CT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree Vandulus<br />
<br />
Shaman could realy use a Lure Slow that could land on just about anything.  Perhaps 50% instead of 75% and a long reuse time.  This would help shaman stacking on raids also.  AAXP would be a great way to implament dis.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That's a really good idea</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bah, I do enuf slowing as it is, I wanna do DMG!!!!<br />
<br />
Ok get this.  A non-dire-charm druid friend of mine and I were grouped under the bridge in chardok last night.  Nice place to camp that one, safety and a little space to maneuver.  I was pulling, and on a whim I Maloed a Chokidai Mangler and brought it back for the druid to charm.  He did so, and we figured out how to keep it safely charmed.  Basically he kept it snared, rooted it when it broke and wasn't snared, resnared, put Malo back on etc, and recharmed.  Glamour of Tunare was also used.  <br />
<br />
Now for the results.  This &quot;pet&quot; of his outdamaged any two melees, killing the BK in under a minute (druid hasted 40%) and the named Captain in even less time.  Me, him, and a 56 beastlord held all of BK and capt and most of lev tunnel for over 3 hours.  I was flabberghasted at the wrongness of it all.  <br />
Animal charm has it's uses no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">wow the BK has alot of hp also...awesome exp camping right there. I've gotta find a druid that knows how to do more than port and kite lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;I've gotta find a druid that knows how to do more than port and kite lol.&quot;<br />
<br />
g'luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I also am sick of so many shamans being satisfied as a buff/debuff hoe.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>TetrianBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Charm for druids is nice, downside is that its pretty much only usable in chardok and WW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">CT is immune to slow, no matter what.<br />
<br />
lure slow would be nice though, 72 mins reuse time. but not unresistable, would completely trivialize mobs that are not immune to slow but just very MR:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">oh i agree. chardok and WW are the only places i charm for exp.<br />
<br />
i group with a 60 monk and others in chardok (well, till the damn monk went and chanter factions, /smack weab i know you read this<br />
<br />
<br />
charming is great, it's wonderful. it sometimes creates emergencies when monk pulled 3 and charm breaks :D<br />
<br />
charm is great and useful, but you can't base it's usefulness on the 2 zones it's actually decent in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It is pretty simple. A shaman that could dire charm would be obscenely powerful. The combination of being able to buff the pet, heal the pet, and slow the mob has the potential for insanity. The classes that can currently dire charm cannot do all of those things by themselves. The enchanter can slow and buff their pet, but they cannot heal themself or pet. Druid can heal and buff the pet, but cannot slow the mobs. Necro, pretty much same as druid. <br />
<br />
Dire charm in the hands of a shaman, while extremely fun, would be an overpowering skill, even if it is in just a few places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Necro, pretty much same as druid<br />
Have you ever watched a DC necromancer in the grey, slaughtering undead? Granted it's undead only, and 50% only, but they can slow the mob, haste the pet, and heal the pet, and themselves...<br />
Necromancers are the best class for DireCharm IMO because of this. Only problem is - you are limited to very few zones.<br />
<br />
Hmm wonder what happened if a chanter would DC a cleric mob and haste/C3 him :D<br />
the pet wouldn't heal the master though, right? now that would be a kickass team :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Saying a shaman would be overpowered doesn't make sense to me when you look at a necro.  Necros can solo the crypt easy with DC.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah... which probably means they're slightly over powered? You think? :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
A Shaman with DC could do the same as a Necro does now but better and faster in any zone with an Animal... not just The Grey<br />
<br />
Lure slow is stupid too. You raid and there's really only a few mobs that you have REAL trouble sticking slow on and they're spawn times are long enough for the slow to re-cycle anyway. It's not going to increase how useful you are raiding. It might actually DECREASE it because three shaman on a raid with Lure slow would be enough insurance for most anything you come across.<br />
<br />
Damage stacks on raids. That's it. You wanna stack... shoot for DoT stacking and/or a better nuke. The classes you bring more of are the classes that do damage. Rogues, Monks, Rangers, Wizards, etc.<br />
<br />
Personally I want an 800pt disease nuke and I really don't care how much mana it uses. Hardly like you're ever going to run out of it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Personally, I don't think we should 'spread' our abilities out so much.  We're already the Jacks of all Trades (and Master of None apparently).  I'd rather have some new debuffs that effect different things and/or buffs that make a difference.  DoT stackign is somethign they're working on, that'll be nice too.</div></div><hr />
