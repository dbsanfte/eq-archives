<br />
<br />
<br />
According to the Everquest Trilogy manual, and I quote:<br />
<br />
&quot;Cazic-THule, Lord of Fear, was drawn to the swamps and jungles of Norrath and there created the green-skinned Trolls  and the reptilian Iksar of Kunark.&quot;<br />
<br />
The answer to the second question:  I dont believe you can.  I think chat handle is determined when you create your account.  Of course, I could be wrong, and I've never tried to change it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fateholder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lol i just put like 'kkkk' for my chat handle cause everything else kept saying was already used. its only used for that chat thing right before character select i think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To change your chat handle you have to be in chat and type #rename oldname newname.  This will boot you from chat, and upon logging back in you'll have your new chat handle.  It's used if you post on the official boards at www.everquest.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Laman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unless they changed it recently, you can change your chat handle in chat.  I can't remember how right now, and I can't log in from here.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I remember those questions.  Those are from the test to become a guide(something like that...part of guide application process anyway).  Friend of mine was asking me them while she tryed to figure them out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, glad I wasn't the only one to notice that.  Hehe.  'RPG side'.<br />
<br />
I think this should do it..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Constan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To rename your chat handle I believe the command is #rename old name new name. If you click the help button at the bottom of the window it will show you all the chat commands. I play on Test so I see way to much time in chat.</div></div><hr />
