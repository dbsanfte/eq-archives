<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, Im more of a solo'er then group'er so Ive done some experimment with my DoT's.  BoK for some odd reason dosent seem to break root as quick as EB and PoX and Plague seem to work reasonably well...I keep hear of these spells that wont break root, but unless Im hunting really cheesy low blues  almost all of my dots break root and Im stuck doing the re root and sit dance all over again..If you have any help Id be appreciative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">level 65 dots wont break root</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Breath of Ultor, Blood of Saryrn, Epic Dot, Bane, and Anathema do not break root because there is no initial DD component.  That makes them superior for root rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, it's the DD component in the spells that break root.  Meaning, the second that the dot lands, it has a chance to break root, but will not break it once the dot is on (mobs get a chance to break root every so many seconds, so it's not the dot running on him that breaks it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well technicaly every tick has a chance of breaking root,  but yea, those listed above have no DD component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I get bored waiting and decide to use dots that have an initial DD component, I generally try using the disease dots because since they last longer, their DD component occurs less often :-)<br />
<br />
If I'm VP-rooting I wait until VP is going to break anyway, then cast a dot right before it refreshes.  It's great that you can get a countdown timer by clicking on the VP button when VP is not available yet.</div></div><hr />
