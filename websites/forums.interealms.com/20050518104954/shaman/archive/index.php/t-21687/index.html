I  have quit everquest but I enjoy coming back here to see the latest news with a half hearted view to coming back sometime. It is a great game, although it has a fair few problems, which as Everquest players as a whole would most likely want to see improve.<br />
<br />
Everquest players as someone posted recently are not only the ones playing but the ones who post in Everquest communities who SoE ideally would wish to recapture. These players still have an urge to play but are possibly unhappy with particular aspects which in time could very well be fixed if it affects a lot of players.<br />
<br />
So I feel I am perfectly within my right to continue posting and unless one day Interrealms decide to only let active shaman players post then I have no shame about continuing to post. As it is a priviledge to me, it will also be a priviledge to active eq players that may also quit eq, due to dislike of an aspect or in view of a possible return one day, that they also have this right. If that makes sense.<br />
<br />
I do agree its possibly disheartening to see people make criticisms of the game you love, however, you have to take it with a pinch of salt. In regard to my own posts, I don't think I am condescending or critical towards the game, however, I do think a lot of improvements could be made and freely post them. However, i cannot speak for other quitters, but from what I have seen I don't really think any of them are out of order or necessarily bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, it is hard for me to not flame you but let me try.<br />
<br />
You said<br />
Seriously. Why all the bitching, and why post on eq related boards after you quit eq?<br />
Why all the bitching? Well, I would wager that in most cases people complain (if you were wondering, that word has a similar meaning to &quot;bitching&quot;) because they are unhappy with a part of the game. They do it either for sympathy or because they hope to get that part changed to their liking with enough complaining.<br />
Why post on EQ-related boards after you quit? For the same reason I still occassionaly visit my old volleyball team's matches. I dedicated a large part of my life to that game and I made some friends I sitll like to talk to. Judging by this post the &quot;friends&quot; part may be hard to understand for you though.<br />
<br />
You also claimed that<br />
We didn't care too much about your opinions before, and even less after you leave the game, so why bother posting?<br />
Well, as you are certainly not speaking for a majority or even statistically significant part of this message board's posters I can only assume that &quot;we&quot; applies to some other group of people. Please tell us what group that is so we can adequately reply to your question.<br />
<br />
Further down you told us<br />
I see this phenom on every board I read. People that have quit for years still post. Of course its never anything useful or constructive, just jawjacking whining. &quot;I got tired of raiding, and ep quality gear didnt rain down on me while I was sitting in velks, so I quit&quot; That pretty much sums up the essence of of all these posts.<br />
Let me tell you this: blanket statements are bad. Of course some people do post why the quit. Some of them even repeatedly do this. On the other hand a lot of them are just here to chat, discuss things completely irrelevant to the storyline or heavens forbid, to inquire about the latest expansion, some of them no doubt hoping to find reasons to play again.<br />
<br />
That aside, does that &quot;jawjacking whining&quot; negatively impact you in any way? Or, more accurately, does it impact you further then wasting a bit of your life? (much like this post wasted a bit of my life)<br />
<br />
If it didn't, what are you complaining about? That people dare have a differing opinion from your's? That people dare post on a message board they have posted on for years? That EQ is a hard game to break away from? I am truly intrigued by your possible reasons for your whining. (that is what you like to call negative posts, right?) Please tell us the reasoning behind the above paragraph.<br />
<br />
You finished your post with this eloquent paragraph.<br />
Please find other outlets of communication. Call Mom and cry about how tough raiding was, how you stubbed your finger on the mouse and it hurt or something.<br />
Is there anything to be gained from these sentences other then &quot;I hate how people complain, I think I will go complain too, so that people can hate how I complain?&quot; Anything? I did not think so.<br />
<br />
If you do not like people who have contributed a hundredfold more to this community then you posting after they have quit you might want to actually post something different then &quot;waaah, I hate you, go away&quot;. You might even want to reply to their posts and tell us your reasons (go ahead and look this word up) for not liking what they have to say. Of course that would require you to actually find a valid reason.<br />
<br />
So<br />
- Shut up.<br />
- Look up every word in this thread you were not able to understand.<br />
- Meditate upon the wisdom you received. Take your time to let it sink in.<br />
- If your feelings still have not changed formulate your reasons for them.<br />
- Come back and post them again.<br />
<br />
Sincerely</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Odull, I need some clarification here:<br />
<br />
1. If I log on my shaman to buff another toon, am I still actively playing my shaman? Does he need to be logged in a minimum amount of time to remain active?<br />
<br />
2. If I don't log on my shaman but play other toons am I still allowed to visit these boards as, technically, I am still playing EQ, even though, technically, I am not playing my shaman?<br />
<br />
3. If I am only allowed to post to these boards when actively playing my shaman, does that mean I can only make half-posts if I am 2-boxing with shaman and another toon ... since, technically, I am only playing the shaman half the time?<br />
<br />
4. If I totally retire and continue to post to these boards but never-ever-never bitch or whine or make a negative comment about the class or game am I then allowed, with both your consent and approval, to do so?<br />
<br />
5. If I play my shaman 100% of the time for very long hours that prevent my coming to these boards to post either positively or negatively due to the amount of time actually playing EQ am I then doing something wrong by neglecting to contribute solid, meaningful posts to this site as you have?<br />
<br />
6. If I have cancelled my account but continue to play until the billing cycle ends am I retired or active?<br />
<br />
Don't listen to these others justify why they do it - just answer my questions. I need to know what the exact confines of my box are. Fill me in and let me live my life as you see best. It is, afterall, what we are all here for ... you!</div></div><hr />

     I think there is a difference between constructive criticism and bitching.  I have no problem with retired players voicing concerns over issues they saw when they left or making comments on current now, but when I see &quot;OMGZERS! Shamans are doomed! quit now !!11!1!&quot;  I think Troll, and will disregard anything typed further as wasted energy.

     Obviously the author of this thread completely missed the mark if he was attempting to voice a concern and not trolling the boards.

This is very true.BUT ive yet to see anyone who has been a damn fine contributor to this board (eg Ceno,Litgruv etc) actually comeback and bitch.Complain yes bitch no.<br />
Most of the bitching comes from Shaman who have yet to really discover how crippled shaman are high end (must admit im guilty of this sometimes myself) and they discovered their shaman is not the uber dps machine they thought.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Since I began to think about returning to EQ I swung by here and asked a simple question; &quot;Is it worth returning to?&quot;. At least 50% of the responses were negative, and a similiar amount were positive. The ironic thing about that is 3 yrs ago it was pretty much the same thing. Half the people seemed to hate EQ and tried to discourage new people from playing it (or is it that they just wanted all the loot for themselves?) while the other half said Great Game, you'll love it, even with some of the problems it has!<br />
<br />
Now that I have moved into town and have access to internet speeds that will allow me to know when i'm being attacked WHILE it's happening instead of after I have already been killed I really began to watch this and other boards to see what was being said. My watching has educated rather well.<br />
<br />
You see three years ago I left EQ because I got married and decided that my family was more important to me than an online game. Now that I no longer need to worry myself about that, curtesy of that wonderful institution called Divorce, I have decided that not only WILL I return to EQ, but that i'm going to do it with the same dedication and fervor I had when I left.<br />
<br />
All the negative posts and back-biting and whining and OMG EQ sux aside, when I played EQ I had fun. Thats ultimatly what the game really is about.... having FUN. if it's no longer fun to you, and your so wrapped up in what you dislike about the game rather than what you like about the game, then maybe you should seriously consider parking your toon somewhere and camping out for the last time, Close your account, and call it quits.<br />
<br />
Constructive critique of the game, it's problems and possible fixes are one thing. Out-right bashing it and telling people go to WOW or some other online game is not a good thing. Really, if you dislike the game so much.. why are you still playing it? If you have such a problem with the toon your running because you feel it's under-powered, has lost it's edge, has been passed over by the devs etc ad-naseum, then camp your toon and start a new one for a while. <br />
<br />
Yeah maybe the Dev's have overlooked some aspects and areas of the game, and yeah maybe if you scream loud enough they might fix it, but then again, their fix may NOT be a good thing. I remember some complaints about toons a long time ago and the next thing the players new, they were nerfed hard. <br />
<br />
Has the Shaman class been left behind? Outclassed by other classes? Maybe. But telling people to go play something else, or that their CONSTRUCTIVE critique and suggestions for fixing the problems are lame and they need to shut up really is wrong.<br />
<br />
As I said before, if the game is no longer fun for you; then perhaps it is time you left the game.<br />
<br />
I'm am coming back. I'm going to play a Shaman. I'm going to kick ass and take names while doing it. And if that bothers you that I intend to play a Shaman because you think the class has been left behind, well... then I guess it's just going to have to bother you cause I don't care. If it bothers you that after three years I am coming back to the game I had so much fun playing, to bad. It's just going to have to bother you. And last but not least, if it bothers you that regardless of the problems the Shaman class has, I still feel that it's the best damn class there is in the entire game... then go play a druid and leave me alone, cause I don't want to hear the complaints.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Mysticrhythms64: Go ahead and do just that. Even if the loudest complainers are absolutely right about every little issue they have you will enjoy your shaman at least well into PoP. And if you take your time with a little luck most of these issues might just be resloved until then.<br />
<br />
Noone says you should not have fun. But then you did not come out of hibernation just to tell us that everyone who stops playing their shaman loses their right to complain or post at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Naw, I don't care if someone has parked their shaman and ended billing, heck... they still know a lot and have a lot they can offer. I just have a problem with people telling others to go to some other game cause EQ is dying etc. If they have such a problem with the game, then they should just go away. not try to drive others off with them. <br />
<br />
I hear constant critisism of the Shaman at higher levels but very little actuall constructive advice on how to fix it. REALISTIC constructive advice that is. Personally I solo'd my Shammy most of the time. Only grouping now and again for the fun of wacking mobs much larger than I could have handled alone at that level, for  example, being on Spectre Island and buffing as a back up for a group of peeps very much higher than me. I got no XP from it, but the fun was not in the XP for me, it was in saying my little 15 shammy was actually ON spectre island and LIVED!!!!! When she got bigger I went up against bigger mobs, just to be able to test her limits. I got killed a lot. But it was a blast anyway.<br />
<br />
I played the game back then to have FUN. And I'll play it again now to have FUN. Thats what it really is all about. When it's no longer fun, I'll either end billing, or create a different Toon and try something new. But to complain and complain and try hard to get others to go to a different game etc just seems like such a waste of time and otherwise valuable energy that could be spent much better at whacking some Mob somewhere or maybe even helping someone out Altrustically. Never telling them who you are, and never seeing them again.<br />
<br />
Guess thats just me though. but I for one don't like being told that I should not come back to EQ, that I should wait and go to a different game. That if I have been &quot;clean&quot; for 3 yrs I shouldn't come back etc etc.<br />

Amen brother. <br />
<br />
This is the way that I feel too.  Personally, I can see some issues that our class is having, but I don't feel the need to scream and shout about every little aspect of the game.  I'll continue playing my shaman because I love playing him and because he is fun to me.  Wouldn't have it any other way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hrm, it's hard to play EQ fervently and have anything of a social life.

The dedicated folks who have quit jobs, abandoned studies, and play religiously until they drop of exhaustion every night mostly just masturbate furiously whenever the urge strikes.  <br />
Not that there's anything wrong with masturbation.  It's safe, clean, and effective.  But it's LONELY . . . <br />
On that note, I broke up with my latest gf couple weeks ago and am debating a return to active status . . . and obviously trying to talk myself out of it.  Perhaps I'll just play for a while and that will cure me.  That's one big reason I never have and never will Ebay.</div></div><hr />

I played the game back then to have FUN. And I'll play it again now to have FUN. Thats what it really is all about. When it's no longer fun, I'll either end billing, or create a different Toon and try something new. But to complain and complain and try hard to get others to go to a different game etc just seems like such a waste of time and otherwise valuable energy that could be spent much better at whacking some Mob somewhere or maybe even helping someone out Altrustically. Never telling them who you are, and never seeing them again.<br />
<br />
Guess thats just me though. but I for one don't like being told that I should not come back to EQ, that I should wait and go to a different game. That if I have been &quot;clean&quot; for 3 yrs I shouldn't come back etc etc.<br />

there is no doubt that up to atleast 60 eq is fun. there is also no doubt that eq still has fun parts or as you suggested everyone would have left.<br />
however, the amount of fun to be had has decreased alot. the only bit i really like is raiding now and thats more to do with the guild i am in.<br />
i dont like exp grinding just for mindless exp/aa, and alot of the quest and trade skills arnt to my liking either.<br />
<br />
but the fun of playing a shaman at high level and not being able to do much more than slow and buff reduces the fun considerablily, and alot have left. once you get to 65 solo is a very slow process. and if enough leave groups are gonna be harder to fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Seriously.  Why all the bitching, and why post on eq related boards after you quit eq?  We didn't care too much about your opinions before, and even less after you leave the game, so why bother posting?<br />
<br />
I see this phenom on every board I read.  People that have quit for years still post.  Of course its never anything useful or constructive, just jawjacking whining. &quot;I got tired of raiding, and ep quality gear didnt rain down on me while I was sitting in velks, so I quit&quot;  That pretty much sums up the essence of of all these posts.<br />
<br />
Please find other outlets of communication.  Call Mom and cry about how tough raiding was, how you stubbed your finger on the mouse and it hurt or something.<br />

Seriously, are we playing lets see who can get the worst rep? When you say we do you mean you and yourself? You might not care what they have to say but the majority of us do i believe. But who knows, look at all the positive posts under your thread agreeing with you... :rolleyes:  If people enjoy reading topics and posting on here (regardless if they play EQ or not) they can and some do. A lot of the people that don't play anymore but post here are very helpful and usually have a lot of knowledge about the game even now that they don't play anymore. This is by far the worst post i ever seen here. Congratz  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">&quot;Constructive critique of the game, it's problems and possible fixes are one thing. Out-right bashing it and telling people go to WOW or some other online game is not a good thing. &quot;<br />
<br />
You make the more common than not mistake of implying that people who agree with you are constructive, and that those who do not are non-constructive, perhaps even &quot;bashers&quot; who should even go away from the boards and not come back.<br />
<br />
Not wise.<br />
<br />
Being constructive can lie just as easily in the opposite of boosterism as in the embracing of it.  Being constructive can have absolutely nothing to do with saying everything's great at all; quite the opposite sometimes.<br />
<br />
You also make the mistake of speaking as if community discussion forums were a place for only one type of thinking, and that a place for people to speak shouldn't have them, well...speaking.<br />
<br />
If people wanted to shut up, they would have done so without anyone's bidding, not come here to do it.  And if they did shut up, this would be a lifeless board -- and there would really be no need for discussion if everyone simply agreed.<br />
<br />
Gotta respect the right of people to disagree with your viewpoint, and to express it too.  Or else stop reading internet forums, or even stop even trying to communicate at all, because you're going to run into difficulties on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">bwahaha, just as I thought, Mr. Anon Flamer tried to give me a negative rep hit and it didn't count :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">&quot;On that note, I broke up with my latest gf couple weeks ago and am debating a return to active status . . . and obviously trying to talk myself out of it. Perhaps I'll just play for a while and that will cure me. That's one big reason I never have and never will Ebay.&quot;<br />
<br />
A return to active masturbation status, Lando?  Well, you can try to talk yourself out of it, but that doesn't usually last too long.  And just &quot;playing for a while&quot; sure as heck won't cure you of it!  Heck, it'll just make it worse!  I learned that from the time I was a teenager.<br />
<br />
Well, it definitely does fit in with an EQ &quot;lifestyle&quot; at least, like you note.  <br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />
