I really like the idea of minotaur characters and all, but it is gonna be bad. Instead of like in EQ where you can choose to be or not be with the idiots that seem to flock to pvp servers (you are not all idiots just because you play there, but the biggest idiots seem to be attracted there as well as you) every single server will be loaded with those idiots. I think I will have to pass on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;Seems like pointless chest beating to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
LoL! Pointless chest beating about virtual prowess inside a computer game. Reading this makes me want to hide my EQ hobby from the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Christ on a cracker. Talk about sound and fury signifying nothing. <br />
<br />
I seriously couldn't imagine a worse enviroment than an EQ free-for-all: pre-pubescent attititudes + total class inequity in PvP settings. <br />
<br />
On the bright side, I hear you get a free tub of butter each time you create a new non-wizzy on the PvP servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A couple of red server players came over to our blue server guild, great guys, some of the best players I've seen.  Best thing is when you know they've got the sound turned up during a raid or exp grouping (preferably when they are LOM or LOH) and you run at em full speed and try to cast a spell, scares the frigging hell outta em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What sense does it make to remove the link the topic is about but leave the thread open???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well, Coltrane removed the link, but I doubt he has the power to delete the thread.<br />
<br />
Personally, I found the link more confusing than anything else.  I couldn't keep track of who was who, who was mad at who, who was owning who....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm so glad Verant put red servers in, otherwise those people would be someplace else....<br />
<br />
(sarcasm)Cause there are no l33t d3wds on blue servers, there are no jackasses or griefers there.. nooo not at all. Noone on blue servers talks smack on message boards either! In fact.. blue servers are a utopian paradise where everyone is rewarded for their effort, everyone shares and everyone is friends!(/sarcasm)<br />
<br />
Cmon.. you can find threads like this on any serverboard at one time or another, cept instead of a rile about pvp it will be about killstealing or training someone out of a plane.<br />
<br />
 saw the red server uber guilds at tot3...they all lost<br />
Hehe, apparently too much ganking, too little prepared pvp.<br />
<br />
Pvp for most classes is heavily reliant on gear.(and soon also AA).<br />
<br />
Joe 2000hps and 950ac the oracle will have an extreme disadvantage vs Ted Uber 3500hps 1300ac. Thats just  the way it is.<br />
<br />
Likewise Tom 60th warrior with 3khps  and 1200 ac in his best gear and maybe a SoZ and Hsagra horn doesnt really stand a chance vs John Uber 6000hps and 1600ac with primals.<br />
<br />
Its not skill that decides between these 2 examples.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">pdm, rz, and vz all did good in tot3. kamzan from tz in warrior botb got to semifinals using crafted/indo and a wurmslayer fighting people in full cobalt with uber weapons and gimp skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Life on a PvP server is a bit tougher to get the Uber gear that the blue servers tend to somewhat take for granted.  I haven't attended a raid yet as I have only just hit 45 (no JBB yet dammit) and have heard tales of the uber raids becoming a PK match as the big guilds from the different teams fight over who gets to kill the big bad dragon.  It's less politics on who scheduled to kill the dragon first, but who has the meaner force to take the dragon ;)<br />
<br />
I like being on a PvP server personally, and it's not the big huge gankfest most people tend to think it is.  You have your griefers of course, but the majority of people I have run across on different teams, do wait on you to finish a mob before attacking, or even wait for you to get some health and mana back before commencing the battle.  We're not all bad guys :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
