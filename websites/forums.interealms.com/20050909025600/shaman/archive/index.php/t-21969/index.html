<br />
I have a tech question and any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
I have only logged into eq maybe 5 times in the past 4 months but as of late, Im getting pretty bad lag and &quot;choppy&quot; framerates.  The game is still playable but very annoying.<br />
<br />
My system specs are the following:<br />
<br />
Sony Vaio 2.8 ghz<br />
Windows xp<br />
512 ram<br />
Nvidia geforce 5200 fx<br />
<br />
Dsl<br />
<br />
<br />
I've disabled all start up programs so nothing is running in the back......also checked for spyware.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that I only have 7% available space left on Drive C and occaisonnally, at random times out of game Ill get a black box/screen (like the type you get when you do a tracer) that flashes....&quot;program to big to fit in memory&quot;<br />
<br />
However, I have full disk space on drive d.<br />
<br />
Anyone know if too little disk space left is causing lag?  Can I take my eq fiels out of drive c easilly and put them in drive d.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure the problem is with my system because my backup comp runs the game fine.<br />

<br />
My old Battalion Commander never, and I mean NEVER deleted an email.  Sent or received.  Well needless to say eventually his HD was some 95% full.  His email (Outlook iirc) was having a dickens of a time opening and his entire system ran a bit laggy.<br />
<br />
Now we, as the Signal people, * recommended * that he delete an email or two, but no.  In his infinite wisdom, HIS idea was to....<br />
<br />
Yes you guessed it - get a bigger HD.<br />
<br />
Well we transferred ALL of his old email messages over, and of course in a month or so (luckily I was leaving the unit) he began having similar problems.<br />
<br />
See if you can't delete some old files, TEMP, program et al.  My system is nowhere near as nice as yours and I run ok (when I don't lock up zoning).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your page file is probably on drive c:.  It windows it set up manage it automatically, it will grow or shrink if necessary (I think).  With so little space on drive c:, it probably doesn't have room to grow if it needs to. <br />
<br />
Definitely move eq over to drive d: if that's not a problem.  That should free up quite a bit of space on c: :-)<br />
<br />
Also look for other programs that you don't need anymore in your add/remove programs area and get rid of em :-)<br />
<br />
After you do that, then defrag and you should see some improvement!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I usually move the swap file onto the d: drive, helps greatly with defragging (since the system doesn't restart the defrag everytime it writes to the sway file). If you don't have a d: drive, have at least 150% of your max swap file size empty on your c: drive (I think standard is 4 gb, so 6 gb would be desired).</div></div><hr />
