<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orball</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sup all.<br />
Im new to this guild thing...in fact, Im kinda new to EQ (only a month!)  I have few simple question on guild thing.  I greatly appreciate if you can help me on these.  <br />
<br />
1.  To Join a guild, I know you have to get invited by officers but what happen when you want to leave a guild?  How do you quit a guild?<br />
2.  The guild with more members is better than the guild with less members?<br />
3.  What will be the good time to join a guild?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
Peace</div></div><hr />

1. I know that with LoY leaving your guild is as simple as pressing the &quot;disband&quot; button. It works just like joining and leaving a group. I also know that there's a /command for quitting your guild, I just forget it at the moment for some reason.<br />
<br />
2. I dont always agree with this phrase but without a doubt in the case of guilds, Quality is of far greater importance than quantity. The uberest of uber guilds usually have less than 100 players, yet all the players are high level, experienced, and play often for long periods of time and with extreme devotion. These players are billions of times more useful to a guild than an unreliable, selfish, and inexperienced player.<br />
<br />
3 As far as when to join a guild, only you know. I would suggest that you find a realistic guild online, and then work towards any requirements they may ask of you. any respectable guild wont just say &quot;okay, you're in!&quot; after your first time asking. So do some research, and do what it takes to get into that guild. You should look at it like applying to a college I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it is /guildremove   having yourself targetted.<br />
<br />
as to which guild to join, what do you want out of the game? do you know yet? do you just want to have fun? do you want to be the most uber player in the game? do you want to be GM tradeskiller? there are all kinds of guilds, there are a high number of them that are all about the raids, but there are a good number for other casual types of gamers as well. it is all up to what you want out of the game.<br />
<br />
I would seriously suggest spending more time making a good name for yourself on the server, spend time getting to know people, and most of all, spend time leveling up to a respectable level to be in a guild. not many guilds are going to have room for someone who is 40 levels lower than they, and they don't want to twink you either.<br />
<br />
in addition to you wanting something, you need to have something for them in return.<br />
<br />
that is probably the biggest reason to wait before you get in a guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">guild numbers are not the only thign that affects how good a guild is. It's the uberness of those.<br />
<br />
See if there is a small guild of 20 ppl and they uber it might be a fun guild but realistically u can't kill much even with 20 willing ppl.<br />
<br />
Tray to aim for higher end guild those with 55+ level restrictions or even 60+ they get the nice lewts :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My personal opinion is that quality is far superior than quantity, but it is very possible to have both and that's what I would look for in a Guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Target yourself and type /guildremove, or now with LoY, you can press Alt+G, and hit the DISBAND button.<br />
<br />
2. Quality &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Quantity. Zerging is gay and not even remotely effective in most situations. Raid with the guild you are considering applying to. See if you can get in on a month's worth of raids. It not only gives you a chance to suss them out, but also vice versa.<br />
Most guilds will require this anyhow, depending on your level and their progress.<br />
<br />
XP grouping is another great way to see what the members are like, and it also again gives them a chance to see if you will fit into their family.<br />
<br />
Don't forget too in regards to #2, with the right mix of levels/classes/experience, you'd be surprised how much high-end content you can do with just 1 or 2 groups. We do it all the time. :)<br />
<br />
3. Good time? I don't know if you can really answer that, as it depends primarily on you and where you aim on heading in the game. Don't think that you HAVE to be in a guild, it's nice and can help you see alot of bigger things in the game, but is by no means a necessity :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps if not at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Galnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Next time you are on, do some /whos of people around your level, note what guilds they are in, do this for about a week seeing how often people of your level range are on, and what they are doing at the time to see if you would be able to hunt/raid with your new guildmates, get a few guilds in mind that you might want to join.  <br />
<br />
Send a tell to a member of one of the guilds, ask if an officer is online and available to speak with you a few moments, let them know that you might be interested in joining, ask them some questions about thier guild, ie, how often they raid, what types of rules they have in thier guild, what times they raid approx, what targets they go after, ect <br />
<br />
once you get a feel for a few guilds that you might want to join, ask if you could hunt with them to get an idea of how well they work together as a team, if they have any amount of skill, ect... use this info to base your opinion of if you would fit in that guild or not.<br />
<br />
Another source of possible guilds would be of course to look at the guildnames of people you are hunting with and in downtime situations ask them a few questions about thier guild.<br />
<br />
oh, and just one of those personal things I adhere to... never consider a guild that does open membership such as shouting to a zone to /tell them to join thier new uber guild... *shiver*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you're new, you probably don't recognize most of the terms being tossed around.<br />
<br />
Best way to join a guild?  Group with lots of people.  Find the ones who's company you enjoy, the ones you have fun with.  If they're in a guild, talk to them about it.<br />
<br />
Some people want different things out of the game, and define &quot;fun&quot; in different ways.  Some want to explore the world.  Some want to race up in levels.  Some want to be on the cutting edge, killing the things that challenge them the most.  Some want only lots of shiny toys.  The guild that's best for you is the one that matches with what you want out of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I really like Cush’s response.  Joining my first guild was a really big decision for me.  And that’s basically what I did.  I ended up grouping with some of the same people several times and I really enjoyed their company.  So I asked about their guild and ended up joining it.  It was the best thing to happen to me in game.  My guild was small, so we didn’t do much raiding, but we were a family and that added a whole new dimension to the game.  Unfortunately, due to leadership burnout, our guild disbanded.  But I’ve kept in touch with my friends and I still group with many of them.  And some day I’ll try to find another family.<br />
<br />
Something to keep in mind when joining a guild is to try to find one with several members close to your level.  Due to game mechanics, you can only group with other players of a certain level and still get experience.  So if you’re the only level 15 character is a guild of 55+ characters you won’t be able to group with them.  Also ask if they have a web page. Many groups will list their rules and what the guild stands for on their web page, along with general chat areas.  Visiting their web site is one way of getting to know the guild a little better.<br />
<br />
So take your time and look around.  There’s no need to rush into joining a guild.  But should you join a guild and find that its not the right one for you, please don’t just quit out of the blue.  Try to be polite about it.  Let them know your leaving before you remove yourself from the guild.  And if you can, try to let them know the reason your leaving.  As a former guild officer I can tell you it’s frustrating to have a guild member just up and leave without a word.  The officers and others you’ve gotten to know are left wondering if there might have been something they could have done to make you feel more at home.  <br />
<br />
Ack, I’m babbling again.  <br />
<br />
I wish you the best of luck in finding a guild that’s right for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Didn't have a guild until lvl 40 I think, stayed there till 61, then moved on because they wanted to get big, and I'm more of a &quot;less is more&quot; kinda person.<br />
<br />
Guild with people you want to group with.  One of the top 5 reasons to be in a guild is that these are the people you have FUN with.  Screw &quot;shaman LFG&quot; -- a well-chosen guild will provide most of your hunting partners.<br />
<br />
Also to consider, some shamans like the limelight - they want to be #1 bear with the witty slow &amp; malo hotkeys on raids.  Others can't stand being top bear in their guild, because they get all of the nagging for buffs.  Find out which you are.  If you've gotta be top bear (I'll admit to this, myself) don't join a guild with 3 shamans who play a lot that are higher than you in level.  You'll feel less worthwhile than a beastlord in PoA.</div></div><hr />
