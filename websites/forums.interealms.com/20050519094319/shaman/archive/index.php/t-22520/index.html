<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else have the feeling that some mob hp might have been tuned down ?<br />
With all those change that were not intended in last patch, I m starting to become paranoid hehe.<br />
<br />
Maybe tuning down hp mob seems to be a good idea, but for me that just means faster fight and for slow / dots / nuke that's not good.<br />
Today's raid were very fast. Mobs were dropping faster than usual with a small raid /shrug<br />
<br />
It can be because we had more dps than usual, but after 10ish clearing of inktu'ta, it's hard to believe we were able to do that run in half the time we used to in a 54 raid. <br />
Faster raid is nice tho. <br />
<br />
Or maybe I m getting a bit too much paranoid /shrug<br />
<br />
ps : cold resist and poison resist were not tuned down, and sow wasn't nerfed  :p</div></div><hr />
