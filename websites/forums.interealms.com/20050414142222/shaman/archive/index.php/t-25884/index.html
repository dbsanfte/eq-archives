<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ApemanShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i finally tried one mission, graphics are good and concept is great and mobs looks sweet. But only one thing disturbs me, the missions have a 6 hour timer on them ? Is that how roughly the mission will take ? <br />
<br />
I went in there with a group and we did pretty well until 2 members were called for a raid and we could not finish it.  PLUS: the exp was not great at all, I have it set to 100% AA exp and I got maybe 1 1/2 yellow bar of exp in 1 1/2 hours. <br />
<br />
They need to fix it I think. <br />
<br />
If anyone can add info on DoN, Links, tips and strategies it will be much appreciated .<br />
<br />
Thank you in Advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have only exp'd in Lavaspinners so far but I thought the AA exp at 66 was pretty good.  I got about a blue every 2 mobs and the mobs were very easy.  Max I was hit for was about 280 ( at least thats as high as I noticed) and the mobs don't have very many hp. I think I used Saryn twice, Bane of Nife x2 and Ulthor once on every mob.  My melee and pet did the rest of the dmg.  For those of us with avg equipment and a few holes in our spell books, this zone is pretty damn easy to get some decent AA exp in.  Seemed to mainly static spawns, but there are a few wanderers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually did one with a group of 70's last night.  Was lavaspinners.  Mobs hit for 600's.  It was tons easier than RCoD or MPG.  We finished a collect 15 in about 2-1/2 hours.  Got 2 full aa's and 33 crystals.  <br />
<br />
I think I'm gonna like this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I also did a collect 15 in around 1 and a half hours and got 2 AAs worth of exp. I get about 4% exp per kill there AA exp which is pretty good, specially compared to LDoN. Missions have been great so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think that the exp all depends on what mission you go on.  We did a nice easy one where you had to go in and find the rose at the dragon isle.  It prob took about 40 min to complete, and that was without knowing what to do at all, also gained almost 2 full AAs in that time.  Was a lot of fun really.<br />
<br />
I really do think that each mission has a different difficulty with it.  I did another one last night that seemed easier, mobs didn't hit as hard and the exp wasn't as good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Haven't done a mission yet. Did some XPing in Thundercrest Isles with 69 cleric, 67 ranger, 70 ranger, and a maybe 68 mage. XP was nothing special, mobs were dark blue and mitigated slightly. Was kind of boring, so we invised up and ran around to find the way to the named on track. When we made our way through the center area to the second bridge, WOW. Mobs past the door after the second bridge have big agro areas. I guess I got too close to the door (I did try to click it), and we had one mob, then two, then three... last person to go down said they saw five.<br />
<br />
I think the mobs were blue still - &quot;quite formidable&quot; is the con message for dark blue, right? Anyway...<br />

Thats sort of the point, to sell what you have.   But if you really want to see what people are looking for....   in the search box type just a single letter like A or E or even a space.  Then it will pull up every item people want to buy with just an A in the name, or an E, etc.   By doing A E I O and U you can quickly see every item that is being looked for.</div></div><hr />

did a mission that the BST got, in Thundercrest. Mobs con yellow to me and I couldn't lull them(might have been too high) hit me and BST both for 700 max, we wiped twice then you have to deal with the fact that the portal to the instanced zone is surrounded by blues that aggro, and assist. group wiped again outside (/hug FD). quit both of the missions we tried and left the group after 2 hours with +1% exp for one death and one kill.<br />
I assume the missions are based off the level of the person that got the mission, NOT avg level of group, similiar to OoW expeditions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Tell you what, these solo/side missions are great fun.  Just like what Samanna posted, once you do a few of them and are able to work the faction up a bit, you can talk to the actual recruiters on each side and they send you out on a little bit harder mission.  Once you finish that mission, you receive two AAs and a +10 bonus to the max of all stats (not resists).  I'm positive that as you continue on in the missions, you receive a lot more stuff just like that, including the extra buff slots.  Just a lot of fun.  I stayed up last night till 6am just running around doing stuff like that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Zyam Spiritmonger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">DoN:Sony does something right. <br />
<br />
Bazaar- A bit funky at first but easy to get used to. I think the size of the zone and ability to spread traders out reduced lag a lot. <br />
<br />
Barter Zone- This zone should probably be combined with the bazaar. Many times buyers are also sellers and it would make sense to have them both in the same zone. VS buying in one zone (with 7 people using it) and selling in another (with 300+)<br />
<br />
DoN Missions- The first roadblock is ran into was the inability to get a mission right off. You must complete a miniquest to get an initial faction hit and gain access to the missions. (you may still be in a party to recieve them but can't GET them if you havent done the mini task) <br />
I first chose to gather 7 bloods of some sort from lavaspinners layer. This dungeon had what it seemed was mid 60's mobs and were hitting for about a 400's I fell through an invisible floor and was forced to CoH myself out. I gave up and decided to get another task. I chose a task that sent me to stillmoon temple. This zone is very well designed and with the placement of caster mobs implements a new form of difficulty. Cleric mobs that CH and Many casters that gate. in this case it can quickly make this zone (where mobs hit for about BoT Calibur) as difficult as MPG. My task was to kill 20 (stillmoon) creatures. I was in a raid with about 3 groups of guildmates who all banded to just pull trains to get as many as possible credit for kills. All who were in raid got credit for kills if that was their assigned task. <br />
<br />
EXP- WOW. For the difficulty of the mobs the exp is insane. (stillmoon temple instanced mission) I was getting 2-3% or more aa per kill. The mobs were hitting my warrior alt. (11.2k hp and about 1950 ac) for mid 400's. It was a total joke. <br />
<br />
Time spent vs reward- There are clearly some missions you will encounte that will take a LONG time. Then there are some you will lable (farm status) I found one that I consistantly complete in about 30 minutes or less and recieve 38 crystals. I find myself often completeing it before the lockout timer is up to get another.<br />
<br />
Guild friends did some of the Norrathians keepers tasks and upon completion Were awarded 3 aa and + 10 to their Stat cap. It appears these tasks progress to a point of mini raids etc. Im hoping to get them done soon and anxious to see what will be of the mini raid porgression. <br />
<br />
Merchant Items.- well I have only seen a few. The merchants were removed due to exploits (which I can understand but im anxious to see more) I saw 55 hp augs and Honestly.. Thats about what id expect for non raidable aquirable gear. +15 or so better than the previous hp augs. an individual in a consistant raiding guild will usualy only be upgrading 35-40 hp per set of content anyway. ex. VT-100 hp items Elementals-135/145 hp items Time-165-195 Hp items Gates-200-235 hp items. It makes sense. <br />
<br />
All in all I think so far this is a good expansion. I like the zones. Its fresh. Instanced always = a + to me. The guild hall portal is awsome. Corpse altar is ingenious and the healing pool is nice too (needs an upgrade Id say another 25%) This expansions looks wellplanned and by the hasty reaction to the dupe bug etc It appears They intend to keep it true. <br />

<br />
That has been in the game for quite a while now. It isn't new with DoN :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yeah, Aruman is correct in pointing out that the 'find trader' feature has been around for quite some time.  Honestly, I don't care at all for the 'new' bazaar.  I can't understand why there was a need to make such drastic changes, not to mention having the /buyer and /trader in completly different areas.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
While I like the look of the 'new' bazaar, it will take some time to get used to as well as getting past the lack of practicality in the layout.  Lag was no longer an issue after I found the 'hide traders' button, then using find or selecting an item in the /bazaar window would make that trader visible until I closed the window or selected another trader.<br />
<br />
I like the other features of this expansion, but am left with a sour taste in my mouth as this expansion is tossed out there with a handfull of 'must have' features and a few zones mixed in.... at least this is like LoY &amp; LDoN combined instead of seperate so I don't feel quite so ripped off purchasing it.  So far, DoN is good, but I wonder if it will have staying power unlike LDoN and LoY did.<br />
<br />
So far the plusses outwiegh the minuses, but not by a large margin like OoW did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either put in a parial search or nothing and hit search.  So far on Zeb not enough people to cap out the search feature.  But works similar to the search in the Bazaar.  Will be a nice place to trade for the OoW runes instead of shouting for trades in zones.<br />
<br />
Also the banker is in the center hub once you take that porter to the barter merchants.  Same place basically as the new bazaar</div></div><hr />

Took me quite awhile to find the bankers, until I accidentally ported myself to one of the hubs (heh, I lagged and somehow stepped on the thing), came out of the portal room, and turned the corner. I think the new bazaar is really great ... a lot less lag, and a neat new look ... but the barter zone just seems pointless. I haven't seen more than 10 people in the barter area on Karana at any given point in time.</div></div><hr />
