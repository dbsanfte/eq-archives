<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Attuned Discord Earring (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68636) is a very nice earring which drops off trash in Yxxta. Over the last few weeks whenever i've been lfg or had little time to group and concentrate on EQ, I've been gonig to Yxxta to solo in an attempt to get it<br />
<br />
If you zone into Yxxta using the west enterance from KT you'll be faced with 2 mobs at the zone in, either 'a wary hynid' or a  'A Ravenous Cragbeast'. Both of the mobs are rootable, slowable and don't summon. They both are single pullable. Usually after using mali decay or putrid decay VP holds for full duration on the hynids, but I always keep normal root up for the occasional early break. For the crags you need to use normal root and refresh every 30% or so. Basic strat is to pull with a debuff (malos for crag, DR debuff for the hynids) and root them using VP or a root spell depending on the mob type. From there on its just a usual root rot technique. If things go wrong the zone out out is less than 10 seconds away.<br />
<br />
Also, every few minutes 'a noc swiftblade' will roam up between where the two mobs are that can drop the earring. The noc is the same as them, slowable, rootable, doesn't summon (root works better than VP). It has a chance of dropping this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68635) ring, personally its not a big upgrade and I'm hoping to get a different ring from elsewhere so I never bothered with him so I have no idea on the drop rate.<br />
<br />
For me it took about 2, 2 hour sessions and 1, 3 hour session to eventually get the earring while afk inbetween spawns (20 mins) doing stuff irl. The exp is fairly nice, 7-9% AA each kill at level 70 but as you only kill 2 mobs/20 mins its not a good place if you want to solo out some fast AAs. Hope this helps people towards getting what I think is a great earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thank you I will have to check this out. Anyone else able to comment on the drop rate of this earring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info Telosk....<br />
<br />
Both the earring and the ring are HUGE upgrades for me (check my Maghetto if you dare).<br />
<br />
I'm affraid to ask - is it soloable for a 65 without VP and my gear?<br />
<br />
I never purchased GoD, but might be willing to spend the $12 just for these :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The ring is pretty rare, but not discouragingly so. If you can get a group and clear down the first steps there, there are many more mobs available to increase your chances...and if you have a good puller you can also clear the golems at the ent to Uqua (theres a rare that spawns there that can drop a hp/mana aug.) Otherwise, like Telosk mentioned, you will have a fair bit of downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aiko, its np to solo even with your gear, as long as you have enough mana to kill 1 mob without going oom, it'll be fine. Definitely think about getting VP, its great (not just for doing this) otherwise just use root and refresh more often.<br />

Problem is, Yxxta/KT are locked zones, you require 4 sewer expeditions and 2 mountain expeditions to gain access, the sewers can be replaced with a flag from Smith Rondo (a raid mob). You can piggy into KT/Yxxta though if you're grouped with 5 flagged people.</div></div><hr />

This has changed.<br />
<br />
The only thing required for KT/Yxxta access is the Tipt trial.  Vxed/Sewers/Rondo are no longer needed.</div></div><hr />

Since when ?  I can't believe this is true.  We're raiding Ikkinz all the time and always have to piggy people into KT.</div></div><hr />

It has not been changed. I am told the zone is bugged since the patch that added alternate flagging access was implemented.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm pretty sure KT is bugged.  We pushed in a ranger who had Vxed and Tipt, but was missing a couple of the sewer trials.  She was not able to exit the zone by clicking, she had to petition a GM to move her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm dying, that's hysterical...Maghetto bahahah!<br />
<br />
Er..anyway!<br />
This little camp is easy to pull off if you're flagged for the zone. I used to do it all the time before I had access and could solo in Qvic.  The tricky part is actually getting that spot...it's pretty popular so lots of times you get all the way over and someone's already squatting the area.<br />
<br />
I made notes somewhere on which mobs are rootable and don't summon there, found by trial and error.  It's been a while so I don't remember off hand, but it's worth giving the stuff beyond the two zone in spawns a try if you are bored and beating respawn. The only thing that sucks about that is those will eventually respawn as something not root/rotable.<br />
<br />
Use the close zoneline to your advantage.  Bad pull? Just haul ass to the zone line.  Opps! Got two? Root one close to your camp and zone out (go go ghetto single pulls).  It's usually pretty quiet there unless a raid is happening, so there won't be anyone to complain about your trains  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">mastruqs don't root, don't slow iirc. Theres 2 behind the first 2 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">well, writing this for a second time..lol...but ok.<br />
<br />
the actual strategy I use for killing the mobs in Yxtta are as follows.<br />
<br />
head to the Uqua side of Yxtta, there are 2 spawns you'll be killing regularly, they are &quot;A Wary Hynid&quot; and &quot;A Ravenous Cragbeast&quot; (most commonly Hynids, but they are the only types of mobs that spawn in these two locations), behind them, are two more mobs that are randomly Nocs, Matruq, and Ukun. there is also a rotation of mobs that wander up the middle and stands in between the two mobs. they WILL add if you pull while they are standing there, and will add if you root the mobs a little too close to their path. Cragbeats, Hynids and Nocs are all soloable by a shaman, Mastruqs and Ukun are not, don't even think about the Kyvs..<br />
<br />
I like to have all the spells I'll be using memmed already, I don't like to switch spellsets at this camp when I have engaged a mob, as it isn't hard for root to break, and you don't want to be sitting if and when it does.<br />
<br />
load up your debuffs, malos, MD (PD if you have it), DoTs, canni and root. load slow if you want a little extra security.<br />
<br />
VP3 is HIGHLY recommended for this camp. it is possible to do it with only spell root, but expect root to break frequently, and to do a few more CRs.<br />
<br />
any extended range item really makes this work. stand at MAX casting range and pull with debuff, PD if you have VP, and Malos if you intend to use spell root. start spamming root/VP right before the debuff goes off, I have attempted before to pull farther from spawn location before and ended up dying more often than not, as it uses up valuable casting time to pull closer to Zone In (Hynids and Nocs run fast, but not quite at SoW speed, and Crags appear much slower)<br />
<br />
if the mob does not resist, he will be rooted out of melee range. if he does, you should have just enough time to run to zone without taking more than one hit.<br />
<br />
immediately apply the other other debuff you memmed and back to max casting range. if using magic root, reapply it and do so frequently. start loading DoTs onto the mob. the mobs themselves do not have much HP, but do hit very hard, they can one-round lower end shaman, and 2-3 round higher end ones.<br />
<br />
if you are using VP, occasionly press the hotkey to get a readout of how much time you have left. VP reuse timer will usuallly pop before VP wears, so be prepared to reuse VP when the timer gets close.<br />
<br />
the mobs will start running at 18ish percent health. so it is safer to approach closer to mobs once they reach this life range, but don't be stupid, stay well outside of Melee range. keep it rooted, because they don't have to walk far to get help.<br />
<br />
hopefully you'll have more luck with this camp than I have, I'm still at it after a good number of hours. just remember, Crags, Hynids, and Nocs only. the EXP in this camp is VERY good on a per kill basis, but only average over time because you have to wait for wanderers and spawns.<br />
<br />
I'll provide info on primal caves if I ever get brave enough to venture that deeply in without a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is a nice, easy, quiet camp. Though I've been running here every other day for a few months and no ring or earring yet.<br />
<br />
Nice write up by the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ryoken0367</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for this info!  I just got KT/Yxtta access tonight, and am wanting to try this camp.  I get a couple hours after work when there is almost no one on, so should have no problem getting this spot to try it out.<br />
<br />
My question is... is there a safeish way to get through KT?  I just tried it, and noticed a LOT of see invis mobs.  I made it to a point where you're going down a corridor type thing with lots of little buildings (I think this was nearish the 2 Yxtta zones).  I got beat up REAL quick through there, hehe.  Any advice would be helpful, thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">See invis mobs otw to Yxtta:<br />
<br />
1) wandering Ukuns. There are two, one in the first canyon heading south from zone in, and one pathing the East-West between the Yxtta entrances.  For the first, the east wall has plenty of room to pass by.  For the second, the south wall.<br />
<br />
2) undead. specifically, the trusik ghosts in the area called Martyr's Passage.  That's the canyon with little buildings.  High on the west wall is safe from these fellows.<br />
<br />
3) basically everything in the small temple at north end of Martyr's Passage.  You can cross the middle of the passage safely to get to the west wall.<br />
<br />
Always the same mobs, no variation.  Pay just a lil' attention to that last wandering ukun, you should be perfectly safe crossing Kod'Taz whenever you like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's what I do when I'm using VP to root-rot: Bring up the AA window (default is the &quot;V&quot; key), select the tab for the page that VP is on, then select the Virulent Paralysis line. You will either see &quot;READY&quot; in the lower-righthand corner of the window or a countdown timer until VP is ready again. Then hit &quot;V&quot; again to close the window. The window stays like you left it so you can hit &quot;V&quot; any time to see the counter, or just move the window to the top of the screen so only the timer is showing. The &quot;V&quot; key always seems to work, even while you're casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">yeah, but I hate having the window in the way, you can just tap the hotkey and get a readout, and it only goes into chat window</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Yesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I never like tapping it to see how much time is left. I am normally very good at just guessing the time, so when I click on it VP starts to cast. Now I have to do the &quot;Oh crap, not ready to do that yet&quot; interrupt cast and all that good stuff. Seems safer to me to hit V. I'm not going to miss much in the 2 seconds that I have the window open.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ruoroni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I was camping this last night and didn't see any nocs wander through at all, only &quot;an ukun warhound&quot; any idea if the ukun drops the ring or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">don't mess with the ukuns man, or the Mastruqs, there is a rotation of mobs that will wander up and down, the noc is the least common, usually you'll see a mastruq or Ukun.<br />
<br />
I can't remember atm, but the Ukuns either summon or are immune to snare/root, the Mastruqs I KNOW are immune to snare/root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ruoroni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ukuns are immune to root...found that out the hard way lol. I really want that ring tho..do i have to kill the mastruq or the ukun to make the noc spawn or will it just eventually come up on its own?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">will eventually come up on its own....its a rotation....if you can get some dependable friends, time goes by a bit faster, and the EXP isn't bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Only time I have seen the ring drop was off a crag beetle in the caves (seen it twice).
