<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dumahim Ashenbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm planning on bringing up a few groups soon to farm him and would like the best way to farm him.  In another post someone mentioned killing all of one type of mob, wait 72 minutes, KOS spawns.  Kill him, then kill the rest of the island then KOS spawns again.  But from what I saw, it looks like it's possible to kill just one mob (with splits of course) and then KOS spawns after 72 minutes.  I'd like to know for sure that this works so we don't all go up there, kill a mob and wait around for nothing.  Has anyone done this and can confirm the best way to get this done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oatasgai Alenxia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kill 1 mob, wait 72min, kill Keeper works just dandy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jooneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I recall correctly, the Keeper of Souls spawns after you kill one of the monsters on that island.  Then you have to wait for that particular monster to respawn again (4-8 hours?) before you can kill the Keeper again.  It isn't really feasible to farm him like you can the Spiroc Lord on the next island.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>timcooper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nah he spawns after killing 1 type of the horses, but seeing as there are 4 of each 4 kills are doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cynan Olwydd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kill 1 Horse, Nottap Ekim spawns (Mike Patton ).  Wait, KOS spawns, kill KOS.  Make sure Mike has despawned, then kill the next Horse mob.  Last time I was in Sky and we farmed him, we killed a horse, waited for kos, then killed kos, then another horse, but mikey was still up some how, and KoS didn't get reset. :(</div></div><hr />
