<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the release of PoP, I have found that in my average experience grouping I am often in very short fights.<br />
<br />
The sequence of events is usually something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
1. Malo<br />
2. Slow<br />
3. Bane Of Nife<br />
<br />
The DoT may or may not finish before the end of the fight.  It usually does, but regardless of whether or not it does my overall damage contribution is fairly low.  Without my coldain military wristguard, that would be 1669 damage.  With it, it *might* (due to a rounding issue with the short duration) by 1886.  <br />
<br />
There is no time to cast a follow-on DoT after Bane Of Nife (even if I cast it immediately after casting Bane Of Nife).  The fight simply ends too quickly. <br />
<br />
So, all that being said, I decided that since I had all this extra mana anyway, I might as well try direct damage.  We have Spear Of Torment.  Now, this is a pretty good spell.  It does 675 damage for 275 mana.  Not as efficient as our DoTs, but much, much, much faster.  This worked fairly well -- I was using more mana, but I was able to recover that quickly with Canni5 anyway so hardly a significant issue.  I could cast Spear Of Torment sustainably perhaps 4 times a fight.  That would be 2700 damage, and no fear of wasting mana if a wizard takes the target from 50 percent to 2 percent in one cast.  It also gave me some flexability in that if a fight was looking ugly I could cast the spell another 8 times or so to really lay on the hurt fast.  This almost never seems to generate alot of agro, for some reason, which I find ironic.  <br />
<br />
So, 2700 per fight on average seemed pretty good.  I decided that since my grouping playstyle was changing it would be worth investing some AA in spell casting fury, so I bought the first level.  That worked out nicely; it gave me something fun to look for when I cast my spell.  In terms of overall damage, it was rather insignificant (since you hardly ever crit).  I would hit for 900 instead of 675.  I was generally pleased though, so I bought spell casting fury 2.  With that, I was able to crit for 1125 fairly often (still rare, of course) with Spear Of Torment.  Now that isn't too bad, actually, but again the crits are fairly rare.<br />
<br />
So what next?  Well, we do have a rain spell with 3 waves.  I usually ignored it because its use is fairly situational (ie: do not anger the enchanter by breaking mezz).  I rarely group with enchanters anymore, though, so I thought I would give it a try.  Well, this is what I observed:<br />
<br />
1) The normal damage per wave is 540.<br />
<br />
2) With scf2, the critical damage per wave is 900. <br />
<br />
3) This spell is resisted alot, even after Malo.<br />
<br />
So, if all 3 waves land with no crit, I can do 1620 damage.  If one wave crits, which happens more often since I now have 3 chances instead of 1, I can do 1980 damage.  I have even had a double-crit, for 2340 (which made me laugh).<br />
<br />
The trouble is the resists.  Now granted, some mobs are more poison resistant than others -- but why do I get resisted on mobs that NEVER resist Bane Of Nife or Spear Of Torment?  <br />
<br />
According to Lucy, neither spell has a resist adjustment.  <br />
<br />
The question is how can I make this spell more effective for me?  Malosini instead of Malo?  Should I be looking to group with a class that has a stacking poison debuff?  Should I say &quot;forget it&quot; and level until I get the next rain at 64(ish).<br />
<br />
As things stand right now, I'm pleased enough with the damage it does (with crits) that I'm willing to invest AA points for Spell Casting Fury 3 and Fury Of Magic.  It's that, or getting one extra tick out of torpor with Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery.  I'd like that extra tick, but I don't actually need it that badly at the moment.  <br />
<br />
So anyway, what does crucible think? How can I be more effective at dealing damage?  I don't want to replace the group wizard or anything, but I want to feel that I'm holding up my end of the deal when it comes to damage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ah the thread that made me register to post :)<br />
<br />
Actually Jaruden that's no longer true of rains.  It WAS true but it was &quot;fixed&quot; i.e. you can kill a mob with a rain but it's not as often.<br />
<br />
Anyway, first let me state that my main is a level 58 wiz and i'm  just getting into my shammy (39) so while dot's are still new to me rains and nukes are near and dear to my heart.<br />
<br />
deria,  rains will resist more often than a nuke (and dot) of the same type.  while there is know known reason for this the consensis is that you get a resist check each wave and since more waves more resists.  otoh i can say that some mobs will resist every rain wave but not resist any nukes of the same type.  this is, as you know, very frustrating.  <br />
<br />
typicly if you get 2 waves on target your have the same mana/damage ratio as if you used a straight nuke and if all 3 hit your ratio will be much improved.  debuffing is your friend and will make a huge difference in the amount a waves that hit.  <br />
<br />
2 things you will notice with good wizards is that if you have multiple mobs togeather that can't be mezed and your split tanking them, if you keep em close and cast a rain on em you will see more than 3 waves hitting.  it's not really a bug, it's working as it was supposed too unlike how it does now (i.e. 2 mobs each get hit by 3 waves verus 3 waves spread among 2 mobs) you will see this when you have mob pets and such.  the second thing and the one that really helps dps is that you can cast a second spell (nuke second rain) WHILE the first one is still going.  while in HoT i could cast a nuke, rain (wave 1 and 2 hit) and second nuke and 3 wave hit about the same time, so I could get 5 nukes for the cost of 3.5 in about half the time.  <br />
<br />
rains do cause aggro even if a wave is resisted but using them can and will help dps but it's situational.  remember you can get hurt by your own rains and since it's aoe nasty aggro issues can happen.  <br />
<br />
you need to play around more and ask your friendly wizards that you group with on ideas of using the rains in the places you fight.  some wizards love em and some hate em.  so you might see em being casted and  you might not.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Several tips to using shaman rains.<br />
MaloSINI/sinia the mobs.  If yer lvl 65, you can prolly get away with dememming Malo for most exp grinds and just using sini.  Sure you get a resist now ans then, but on the whole you save mana and debuff the mob more for your rains.  I do this quite often when in a zone where I have a 70% chance of landing slow/sini first try.  <br />
<br />
Second, if in a group, using rains is easy, just make sure the mob is not in motion and make sure you won't get aggro from raining it and thus pull it out of range of the melees and additional rains.  If you are close to getting aggro, stand just outside of rain dmg range next to the mob.  <br />
<br />
OR use the trick that works well all the time.  If you're solo and have a pet and are tanking the mob, position your pet at the mob's back.  Then target your pet with the rain.  The mob will take 3 waves and you won't get nailed.  <br />
<br />
Additionally, get Tears of Saryn.  It waves for 650 x 3, which is a nice improvement.  It's a mana hog, but rains are.  The best thing is that you can mem both Tears and Torrent and alternate them for TRUE PUNISHMENT!  This way you can get away from the recast delay on both spells.  When not casting one, you can be casting the other for constant rain damage!  It's nice. <br />
If you sini the mob and it's not too PR, you can approach 250 DPS with this method!  Of course you will have aggro, but targetting the pet will make this method still viable.  Keep Torpor on and you shouldn't get beat up too badly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
rain spells will not hit a mob thats at 10% or lower health, its hardcoded in to keep corpses from poofing. You can kill a mob with a rain, but only if the damage done by that wave is enough to take it from 11% to 0% in 1 hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Alright 10%, I knew it was around there somewhere.<br />
<br />
As for the wizard poster, either wizard and shaman rains work differently, or you're plain nuts =P  As of 3 days ago (before the last patch), I still could not land a rain near the end of a mobs health, 100% resist rate.  Also, if you get multiple mobs, you lose waves.  Get 2 mobs together and rain, both will get hit with 2 waves.  Add a 3rd mob and suddenly they all take 1 wave and that's it.  I don't remember what happens at 4, don't do it very often, but I *think* it hits just 3 of them once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the rain not killing the mob is no longer the case, i do it all the time with my wizard .<br />

<br />
and it seems all posion dds/rains get extreamly high resists when the mob is near 10% .... not sure why</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thanks for clearing that up atarak.<br />
The rest of you I'll direct up a few posts.<br />
That sounds like it's exactly the right answer and meshes perfectly with my experiences with rains over the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i can tell you that I most definately experience the &quot;auto-resist&quot; feature of our rains spells when mobs are low on health.  It wasn't removed.<br />
<br />
Same story casting blizzard with my druid.<br />
<br />
I can get a kill shot with a rain if a single wave can do the required 11% or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wizard rains must work differently because I also can never kill a mob with a rain, with the exception that was stated above.  Maybe we should push for a fix on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can also confirm that any shaman rain spells do NOT affect a mob that is at or below 10% health. The only way for a shaman to kill a mob with a rain spell is if the mob is at 11% or higher health and your rain wave spell does enough damage to take the mob below 0% in one single wave. If your first wave of rain spell does 2% damage to the mob, taking him to 9% health, then the other two waves of rain would be resisted 100%, as well as any subsequent rain spells you would cast on the monster. This is absolutely how it works for shaman.<br />
<br />
Now, that said, could it be different for wizards? I dunno. I will have to ask them though. If wizards can nuke with rains no matter what the hp% of the monster then we should be able to as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Big difference between rain ae spells and PB ae spells. <br />
<br />
what i do is keep saryrn and velium strike memmed. this way cast rain then dd then rain then when  mob is at or near 10% use Velium strike only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">All rains have increased resist rate on stuff... long time user of rains and a mob with malo in an exp group that is DB can still resist 2 rains quite easy. <br />
<br />
Not commenting on 10%hp thing as im not sure.<br />
<br />
And the number of rains works like this:<br />
<br />
1 mob. 3 rains on that mob.<br />
2 mobs. 2 Rains on EACH mob.<br />
3 mobs. 1 rain on EACH mob, 1 rain on 1 mob<br />
4 mobs: Havent tried it.<br />
<br />
Max number of rains is 4 except for when there is only 1 mob.<br />
<br />
Note: However many mobs there are, you ALWAYS get hit for all three rounds if you underneath rain</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hail Farrdaar,<br />
<br />
I can't reply to wizard rain spells due to lack of experience, but just because it works for wizards doesn't mean it will work for shaman. :p <br />
<br />
I CAN say that I don't remember ANY Torrent waves ever landing in the last few seconds of a mob's health.  I don't recall if it is at 10 or 20% health, but 10 seems more correct from memory.  The only Torrent of Poison kill-shots I've ever achieved were with mobs (as many have said) went from &gt;10% to 0% from a single wave's damage.<br />
<br />
I would recommed levelling your shaman to 55 (for Torrent of Poison), logging some parses of mobs with both your wizard and shaman, and then come back to prove your point to our community.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure you are extremely knowledgeable about wizard nukes/rains/etc.  At level 39, you do not have an equal amount of experiential information concerning shaman nukes/rains YET.<br />
<br />
Finally, welcome to the Crucible. :)<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Why does Torrent fizzle so damn often , grrr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My torrent fizzled like a bad mofo even at 180 skill or so, it wasn't until I got it up to about 190 have I seen a noticable difference in how often it fizzles.  I like to attempt to cast it a bit every raid that I go on, making sure that when I do it, it isn't when there are mobs in the area that are mezzed..which of course I did once by accident on my first trip in fear, felt pretty stupid trying to explain to the chanter why I was a dumbass.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that evocation is the hardest skill to bring up, it just doesn't matter what the heck and how often I cast that spell, it just doesn't go up.  I've been 60 for a few months now, and been on raids every day casting my DD Ice and my rains, and it goes up once every couple of days....which sucks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">get max skill<br />
get SCM3<br />
it no longer fizzles hardly at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">1 mob. 3 rains on that mob. <br />

4 mobs: Havent tried it.<br />
<br />
Each wave can hit up to 3 targets and there are 3 waves total. The kicker is that only 4 total hits will take place.<br />
<br />
1 mob: will take 3 waves=3 total hits<br />
2 mobs: will take the 2 waves each=4 total hits<br />
3 mobs: will take 1 initial wave each and one of the mobs will take an additional wave=4 total hits<br />
4 mobs: 3 mobs will take the initial wave, 1 mob will take the second wave=4 total hits</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In my experience, when you use a rain on 4+ mobs each will be hit ONE time up to a maximum of four mobs. There is no second wave of rain.</div></div><hr />
