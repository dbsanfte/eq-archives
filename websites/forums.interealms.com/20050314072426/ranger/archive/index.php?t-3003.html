<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 06:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are going to get as many answers to this question as there are posters.  Don't worry about it too much.  Most people agree that stats aren't all that important in the end.<br />
<br />
Your optimal stat boosts depend on your choice of race and your personal play style.  I rarely ever cast much, and I always have KEI on anyway so for me WIS is a total waste.  Others like WIS.  STR has some influence on melee damage.  DEX will help you with archery.  Finally STA will help you with those precious hit points.<br />
<br />
The important thing to remember is that EQ is all about boosting your stats through equipment.  By the time you hit level 50 your stats will come from your equipment not those first 20 points you spent at creation.  So these first 20 points should be spent for the time you play before you get decent equipment.  Basically from level 1-30.<br />
<br />
From level 1-55 archery will add up to about 1% of your total damage output.  I cannot justify putting points into DEX for that.<br />
<br />
If you solo a lot, you'll need to cast a bunch.  That's buffs, heals, dots, roots, fears, etc.  For this WIS is your first choice.<br />
<br />
If you group a lot, you will be called on to be a support melee or even a main tank especially early in your career.  As a melee, you want your points mostly in STR to max damage.  For tanking, you want STA for those hit points.  Nobody is expecting you to be the healer of the group so WIS should not be your first choice.<br />
<br />
I chose wood-elf and put all my points into STR.  If I had it to do over, I'd have been a halfling but still put points into STR.<br />
<br />
Casters Realm says to put all your points in STA.  Like I said, there are many answers to this question.  Really don't sweat it cause 1) no matter what you'll get it wrong and 2) it doesn't matter anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maed</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">stamina and wisdom. dont pick yer race for stats though, starting stats are meaningless at high lvl so pick the race you want. also DONT put them into str. the ATK str gives is only a super tiny amount more damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arroe</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol, that was funny :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fadetree</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As much sta as you can, and then either wis or dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jurrai</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alrighty, so I plan to make a wood elf (much change from my iksar monk :p) with 10 into sta, and either 10 into dex or 5 dex 5 str.  It seems to me that their starting wis is ok, hehe, and I won't need to be healing all that much if I'm soloing because I'll have a fungi.<br />
<br />
One more question..Arroe, where did you get that primary weapon of yours?  The toxiferious axe o0o...looks very nice, hehe.<br />
<br />
Again thanks for all your help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gntik The Rogue</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">only put all into sta if you plan on being the uber end all be all ranger, if you plan on playing your ranger for fun, not loot and being so uber you make Kerafym crap his drawers when you enter ST, then I suggest going some str, some dex, some sta, and some wis. Hell put some cha in there too! :) Nah not the cha, but the rest is pure rangery goodness.</div></div><hr />
