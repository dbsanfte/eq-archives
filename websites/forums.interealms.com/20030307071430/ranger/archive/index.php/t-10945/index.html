Combine 2 shadowjade moss and 2 shadowjade fern leaves<br />

I get these stupid things all the time. Even if you don't care about tailoring, hey, what can I say, it's FREEEEEE skillups for foraging classes!  I've detroyed so many of them, gosh I could kick myself for that.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think handmade backpacks trivial at 88, so you can combine your own HQ hopper/bear skins into backpacks for friends or what not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Otogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/em kicks himself for destroying 4 10-slot backpacks full of foraged &quot;garbage&quot; from JPF.<br />
<br />
I was saving the stuff for a while until I looked on EQTraders and found out it was for druid stuff.  So I destroyed all of it.<br />
<br />
DOH!  I am just starting tailoring and could have used those combines.  At least I have a reason to go back to fear-kiting in JPF (I was getting bored to death there).  :D<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tip!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah, I nearly starve every time I go to JP.....nice to know that the crap I forage there can be used for something.<br />
I bet they put it in so the Dr00ds out there can work tailoring and not keel fuzzy 4 legged things.</div></div><hr />
