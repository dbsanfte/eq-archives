<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.<br />
<br />
I have browsed quite a few magelo profiles on shammys that claim that they have ACs of 900 and above, but I can't seem to get an AC close to that. My defence is at around 190, but still my unbuffed AC is below 800. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here are some easy &quot;fixes&quot; that will raise your defense significantly.<br />
<br />
Legs:  If you can wear Jasarth, get a pair from KC (free), if not do the Kromrif Military Leggings quest (easy) for a pair of Ac 14, +6 wis legs.<br />
<br />
Bracer: do the Coldain Military Bracelet quest (see my post in the Quest and special item section on how)  That will be a HUGE upgrade.<br />
<br />
Arms:  Get rid of the Ulthork and add some JB arms. Cheap and very nice AC.<br />
<br />
Range: get a Medicine Totem<br />
<br />
I would bet with these changes, you will break 800 Ac easily without breaking the bank.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok I wrote a response and then clicked you profile.. it killed it...<br />
<br />
Simply put - you have some good gear there you'll not have to replace for a while.<br />
<br />
Have a look at my profile - in game I have 950+ac unbuffed and only recently added the shoulders and earring. My main chunk of AC comes from the Skyshrine armour. My wis is kept at ~230 because with KEI and/or bearform I still hit 255. This wis will drop as I change bits :)<br />
<br />
I'd suspect these profiles for 900-1200ac will be for shaman that have velious armour. For 1100+ac I would suspect kael armour.<br />
<br />
There are three types of velious armour that make the basis of most Oracle's gear:<br />
Thurgadin: chain look, basic AC and basic stats. need faction with dwarves. Drops in kael arena etc<br />
Skyshrine: dark blue chain, higher AC than thurg, highest stats of the three armour sets. need faction with Skyshrine. Drops in HoT (east ToV)<br />
Kael: yellow chain, highest AC of the three, higher stats than thurg armour. need faction with Giants. Forgotten where this drops lol..<br />
<br />
This is ignoring PoM etc (PoM boots are 45ac to give you an idea)<br />
<br />
I'd start thinking about raiding in kael, at 55 I'd think of HoT.<br />
<br />
I would say invest in some resist gear for HoT as the AE mobs will cold/fire AE for 300-350dmg. <br />
West ToV mobs AE for 500 (telk) and north tov mobs will start AEing with some fun 1200dmg..<br />
An if you annoy a nToV mob that's unslowed... well I got flurried for 950 a pop and was turned into mush by Lady M...<br />
<br />
HP rule for shammies. AC comes a close second (softcap at ~1300ac), resist are important but as with wis can be maxed out with buffs.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kael (Giant faction armor) drops in ToV west mostly.<br />
Pog armor is pretty much identical to Thurg stuff except in look (looks lovely on iksars).<br />
<br />
Pom boots were the only worthwhile piece of the set imho, the bp also had good ac, but nothing like the hps/saves of a Vindi and was considerably more effort to get =/<br />
<br />
Your at the sort of level where you can start venturing into pog and kael for the basic velious quest stuff, and it is a HUGE leap in ac/stats over anything you'll have so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A few gear upgrade suggestions:<br />
<br />
Replace your legs with Brown Chitin Legs, more AC and better stats.<br />
<br />
Replace the belt with Chitinous Belt, more AC and better stats as well.<br />
<br />
Replace the arms with Crystal Chinin or Gladiator Chain.  Either of these has a much higher AC than what you have.<br />
<br />
Replace the Ry'gorr BP with Seb Scale or Froglok Scale BP<br />
<br />
All of these can be picked up relatively inexpensively while waiting to get the quest armors that people have mentioned.<br />
<br />
I have quite a few of these pieces and can hit 900 AC buffed at level 46 and still maintain a 180ish wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just pointing out one of your velium fire wedding rings in your profile is the unimbued version and has no stats.  That should give you a little better ac/hp :)</div></div><hr />
