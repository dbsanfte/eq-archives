<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have a Cog Encrusted Epaulets which has focus effect of &quot; Haste of Mithaniel - Increase Spell Haste by 20%&quot;.    Shortly, my plans are to add the following :<br />
<br />
1. Polished Smoothmetal Torque - Focus Effect: Improved Healing IV (Increase Healing by 20%)<br />
2. Valorian Insignia - Focus Effect: Focus of Mithaniel (Decrease Spell Mana Cost by 10%)<br />
<br />
My question is figuring the stacking values, overlaps, or other better choices.    Plus will Cleric and Mage focus effects/spells work with these items or is it one or the other type thing?   In addition, Malarian Leg Ear Stud and Wicked Bone Atlatl are nice items but the effects almost certainly don't stack.   It's a shame that there are some really nice focus items that either don't stack or aren't allowed by SHM.     Am I missing/overlooking something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fleury Moistfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's my understanding that the lines of focus effects do not stack. What I did was try to aim for the focus effect which gives the highest %. For example, the Ring of Flamewarding from VT has Focus of Flame as its focus effect, which is a 26% damage increase in fire DD spells. Now, the Intricately Etched Seashell has Fury of Ro as its focus effect, which is a 30% damage increase in fire DD spells. Think of Fury of Ro as an upgrade to Focus of Flame. So, if you were to take a focus effect to increase your fire DD damage, you would opt for the Seashell.<br />
I hope that makes sense, I'm not terribly good at explaining things sometimes ;)<br />
<br />
As to cleric/mage focus effects stacking, I'm not certain of the mage focus items but the cleric spell Blessing of Reverence (BOR) certainly does stack with the spell haste line of focus effects.</div></div><hr />
