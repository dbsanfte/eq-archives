<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One thing that just baffles -- I mean REALLY REALLY astounds me big time -- is how clerics sometimes complain that they die.<br />
<br />
What the ???? I've doing massive dying most every raid since HOT in Velious days.  I remember dying 20 times in raids and more because of my slow.  I remember raids that went on all weekend and dying in them dozens of times.  <br />
<br />
With clerics, dying comes far, far less.  It isn't even remotely close.  I can't count the dozens -- is it hundreds? -- of raids I've been on where the only people who died regularly were: 1) FIRST the shaman; 2) SECOND the monk or other puller; 3)THIRD the chanter(which explains why a gigantic percentage of chanters refuse to tash); 4) anyone who over-aggros by pulling newbie stunts such as trying to out-taunt or out-aggro the MT or nuke like hell before aggro is set hard on the MT; and 5) anyone else, sometimes including clerics first, sometimes not.<br />
<br />
That some clerics want to balance the game around their potential of -- dying??? -- absolutely staggers me!  What the heck game have they been playing, anyway? <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, the easy game.<br />
<br />
My bad.</div></div><hr />

By the way, if any cleric reads this, the shaman consensus seems to be us needing a 1800 patch heal. We will gladly take a 2600 patch heal though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want a 50% slow at 60, and a 60% slow at 65. I won't be as good as a shaman. I just want to be able to do it if I can't find a shaman. <br />
<br />
I want REAL plate mitigation. I won't have as much HP as real tank, I just want to be able to do it if I can't find one of those. <br />
<br />
I want snare and evac. I don't want any other ports, just evac. If we can't find an evacer (happens a lot!) I want to be able to do it. <br />
<br />
I want... EVERYBODY'S ABILITIES! In case they can't find any class at all, I want to fill that role perfectly.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that might make logical sense if we were asking for an ability that we havent had since level 1. I even got quoted, boy I'm famous now.  :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
So where are the posts that we made saying we want to be main healer in any content? I've been advocating the more radical healing upgrades, and even I didnt say I want to be able to replace a cleric in any situation. I just want to be even with druids again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You guys really should check this thread out.  There are some people saying just astounding things, including some that are completely unfounded and just flat out crazy -- like shamans are crying out for clerics to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen a single thing here saying clerics should be nerfed.<br />
<br />
Where the heck do some of these guys come up with this stuff anyway?<br />
<br />
By the way steel yourself for some of the stuff you might see here...some of it's a crack-up.  But any class in the mighty trinity will always get more respect than we do, so I'd suggest you tread lightly.  I remember how many clerics screamed that the game was destroyed for ever when we got <br />
Talisman of Kragg -- for weeks and weeks, on board after board.   These guys can be a pretty hysterical bunch.  If we had screamed like that for slows being parceled out on weapons or to multiple classes -- and landing earlier than ours even -- the world of Norrath wouldn't bear the slightest resemblance to the way we live now.  Gird your loins, my brothers and sisters!  Don't burn any bridges though.  Some of these folk are cooler than others...but only some of them.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Why don't they just give shamans our whole f'ing HoT line of spells and kill the cleric class completely?&quot;<br />

Help yourself, have a 20k heal, who cares you already dominate in heals so far I have no idea what a better heal is going to do for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if we got a 2k heal (least fast casting got one almost but too slow), thats 26% of a cleric ch. so sure give them a 19.5% slow:) (not that soe will)<br />
oh they can have our pet (unless soe u/g greatly). they already have it almost with those hammer pets (more of a dot, they dont last past the mob dying) just make them last and you probably got a better pet than us:)<br />
<br />
however one thing this thread does help me with is sympathy for brenlo, as you can see there are alot of poeple out there who dont know much about other classes, and possible not even thier own who want more more more.<br />
<br />
there was also some post made that where reasonable. but for brenlo to shift through all the others must take alot of time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Reading that thread almost made my eyes bleed... Almost everyone there is missing the point entirely. The point is, no one class should be REQUIRED for single group encounters. Abilities should be required. Healing is an ability. There are three priest classes, priests have the ability to heal. Right now, some single-group content doesn't just require healing, it requires cleric healing... that is wrong. We shouldn't necessarily be able to be the main healer in GoD trials, but a druid shaman combo should at least be a viable option.</div></div><hr />

 No worries, No matter how cocky Shammys get, they are nothing but crappy back up healers. <br />
I am not worried about them taking over Cleric/Druids jobs and neither should any of you. <br />
Let them think what they want, it doesnt matter. <br />
They have their own specialties and should stick to them.</div></div><hr />

I don't think any of us really want clerics to lose their jobs... we just want to be able to help out more... and in some cases... when you just can't fricken find a cleric, be able to do a bit better on your own.<br />

There are some great clerics and some idiots just like there are some great shaman and some idiots.  That is one problem with internet message boards... you only see the people that won't shut up and people who know better usually avoid threads like that (like I probably should be avoiding this one).

I'm gonna petition for clerics to get invis, asap!  Not really sure how invis is a balancing point, but fine.  Let everyone have it, I just dont care.  Cant imagine anyone caring much either.

But the one thing it really makes you realise is how intense and bitter it can all get. Every single class certain of it's weaknesses but fighting imaginary strengths. Every class seeing any change as a possible encroachment on their turf and viability.<br />

AMRIS -- Shaman can't control when they slow, it MUST be done right away. Druids have much more control over when they snare or nuke. Furthermore, shamans' heal isn't enough to make them truly viable as an alternative healer, where druids are a viable alternative healer already.  <br />

Then I will remind you that Clerics get to smack mobs because they aren't constantly poking their cannibalize hotkey and they also get tonuke once in awhile. <br />

And here's her response..<br />
<br />
Really? Actually, we're sitting on our asses medding and hoping to god our mana regens fast enough for the situation if the situation is so bad that the shaman is actively cannibalizing so much they can't toss a nuke or a dot.  <br />
<br />
Apparently she's yet to realize it, but she's only one step away from agreeing with us.  Replace 'dot' with 'blast heal so our mana at the moment actually is good enough to regain control of the group's hp' and there you go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a lot of incorrect information about both sides here, mostly about the mana regen capabilities of a Shaman.  When discussing Shaman mana regen, keep it in the realms of a fairly challenging or fast paced xp group and with a competant Shaman.  For example, some things to consider:<br />
<br />
-all the relevant cast times and total time spent for the active mana regen<br />
-low health danger (from canni5)<br />
-the number of spells that a Shaman casts on each mob<br />
-the risk of a resisted spell<br />
-the upkeep of buffs and utility spells<br />
<br />
In a good xp group as a 65 Shaman with regular mod rods, ft1, mc3, canni5, Q, c3, and either bard or beastlord mana regen I can get maybe a nuke in every other mob.  This scenario is fighting somewhere that Q can keep the players alive mostly.  I spend 100% of my time casting a spell.<br />
<br />
I am just trying to clarify that Shaman mana regen is very high, but well balanced by our very high mana use, ineffecient and slow casting spells, as well as forcing us to choose whether to regen mana or to cast other spells.<br />
<br />
What I would also like to present to Clerics here is regarding your usefulness outside of GoD, LDoN hard, and Elemental+ zones.  The feelings here in this thread seem to be that with a larger and / or faster Shaman direct heal that will make clerics fully antiquated for trivial content such as LDoN normal and PoP tier3 or lower zones.  I mean no harshness to the class but if there is a slower in the group (bst, brd, shm, enc) and any healer (dru, bst, pal, clr, shm, rng, even necro and sk combos can work well) then for most of that content a cleric isn’t needed already!<br />
<br />
Increasing the burst healing of a Shaman so that, if needed to, a fully focused and AA’ed chain cast Shaman heal would keep a plate class tank alive against unslowed trash mobs does not make Clerics obsolete.<br />
<br />
Considering that this is a balance issue it would be expected that if SoE were to improve the desirability of Shamans for GoD, LDoN hard, and Elemental+ content that they should also improve the desirability of Clerics everywhere else (hammer procs that scale in damage when fighting lower level mobs for example).  I sure hope that they do because Clerics really need more to contribute to a group doing older content, just like Shaman need more to contribute to a group doing new content.<br />
<br />
It is disappointing that the atmosphere of the Crucible has changed so drastically over the last few months, but what has really incited the most recent posts were the statements made by SoE representatives and the thereafter changes made on the test server.  For example, I believe Brenlo stated something about planning on changing our heal over time spells and he would look into what the &quot;spell guy&quot; had planned.  A week later, most (if not all) other healing classes recieved upgrades to their heals while the Shaman heal over time was actually made worse. <br />
<br />
While it is understandable that changes cannot be made overnight and may take quite some time to go live or even on test, it caused a bit of a knee jerk reaction by the community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is from the cleric rant about shaman (his first post in that thread):<br />
<br />
The rules on this board prohibit me from using the terms and phrases I want to use to describe this round of whining from the shamans. <br />
<br />
I went to the Crucible ... I read through some of those threads, and after choking down some of the garbage and pure blatant inaccuracies there, I came to one conclusion: the shamans have been infected with the same whining disease that infected the druids. <br />
<br />
I used to visit the Crucible on a regular basis ... Back then, the discussions related to shaman issues...not these &quot;nerf cleric&quot; discussions I just read through. It's very obvious that shamans want 1) slows that always land the first time and never be mitigated in any fashion, 2) heals that rival and surpass cleric abilities at every stage, and 3) the ability to both slow AND be main healer in any group they're in, ensuring that clerics are no longer needed. <br />
<br />
Here's a newsflash: YOU'RE NOT DESIGNED TO BE THE MAIN HEALER IN A GROUP. That's not your damn job.<br />

<br />
This is from the general section, Cleric Offense Proposal:<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see: <br />
<br />
- Increase Dodge cap to 150...200 is even better <br />
- Increase 1hb, 2hb and Offense caps <br />
- Innate chance to dodge with a shield (was mentioned as a possibility a long time ago, never followed up on) <br />
- Expand the Unswerving Hammer pet into a line all the way back to lower levels; make the pet persistent at higher levels; add an AA to give the pet a chance to proc Hand of the Gods <br />
- Revamp the Yaulp and summoned hammer spells to extend back to lower levels <br />
- an AA (2/4/6) to reduce the chance that our nukes and stuns will be resisted and/or increase the chance for the nuke to land for full <br />
- an AA (2/4/6) that gives a slight damage bonus on 1hb weapons, say 5,10, and 15% (or whatever would be appropriate); maybe an AA that gives a bigger bonus for using 2hb weapons  <br />
<br />
The goal is to increase cleric damage output in a group without making solo exp gain better than group exp gain. Obviously, it would mean an increase in solo power, but it wouldn't make soloing more appealing than grouping.<br />

Taking the 2 posts a tad bit out of context, perhaps his grand plan is for druids to become main healers while he can be MA/SA and shaman can be LFG. I have to add:<br />

While I don't agree with them everything bolded in that post is offensive in nature and being a tank is defensive.<br />
<br />
The argument could be made that Soe did not create Clerics to be DPS or do Dammage in melee form they have created new tools in the last several expansions that did just that.  Those new tools were created because of the one dimensionalism of a cleric and his healing specifically in Luclin.<br />
<br />
The single thing clerics are good at is healing and will remain healing as long as ch chains are required in raids.  Once the devs open their eyes and sees the needs for so many clerics as a bad thing(all players would I think agree) and rebalances raid healing then made clerics more then a onetrick pony they would not object so much to changes made to allow more classes healing increases.  CH is the biggest thing holding clerics back and the biggest thing clerics have to hold onto.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">CH is the biggest thing holding clerics back and the biggest thing clerics have to hold onto. <br />
<br />
ya, and ours is slow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">for me the arguemnt comes down to this<br />
when I rolled up a shaman I knew the class well enough to know we were solid soloers, pricless in a group and a well rounded class who could bring enough to any group to make something work. I knew shaman were the battle priests I knew we were the gods of debuffing (come on malos+slow? we win) I also knew that all that comes at a price, slow casting expensive spells and that damn macro that chain casts Cani.<br />
<br />
at this point in the game I have the best slow by a slight margine over 3 other classes,<br />
my debuff while still top of the line is no longer such a supreme one.<br />
while my ability to solo remains solid I have lost the title of battle priest and personally miss it alot.<br />
somewhere in the 50's-early 60-'s my role changed from a decent healer and great debuffer/buffer to a crappy healer ok debuffer, weak buffer and still decent offtank.<br />
<br />
when all those clerics rolled up cleric what the **** did they think they were getting into?<br />
clerics, healing Gods, crappy soloers, great buffers...I mean its no mystery to me, the reason I didnt roll cleric is because the one trick pony aint my style. if you rolled up a cleric for anything other than a bot  and are pissed that the only thing you do well is heal your'e an idiot.<br />
<br />
they got a better version of our hot and now scream that we might get a useful upgrade to ours, they scream that we want cleric grade heals when 80%+ of the posts i see clearly call for less than druid grade heals.<br />
<br />
I still cant find where we asked for a 1500per tic hot, where anyone asked for a cleric nerf or half the other things we are supposedly saying over here.<br />
<br />
so done with that post, the monkey's banging pans together to see who can make the most noise are getting on my nerves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">It's especially scary that their moderator is at least as dumb as any of their members.  You'd think he would have a bit of experience, or at least common sense on his side.  Yet he talks about all us shamans wanting to &quot;nerf clerics&quot;?   That guy is severely nuts.<br />
<br />
I also did like the bit when another cleric talks about shamans being basically in dire straits if they have to actually -- uh oh! -- ACTIVELY cannibalize!<br />
<br />
What does she think, cannibalize just happens by itself?  Or that canni 5 restores five bubbles of mana and refreshes whenever we want it to?<br />
<br />
Well...I guess so.<br />
<br />
How long is it that you can play without noticing shamans cannibalizing more than once every so often.  Talk about unobservant.  Piled on top of just general ignorance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I guess what amazes me the most is any of the great three bitching about anything especially when it comes to core skills. We are 5% above chanters in slowing, 10% above BL's and if I recall theirs lands faster.<br />
<br />
Have we seen the class in EQ yet that can heal for 7125 on a 10sec cast yet? Nope!<br />
<br />
Where's the class that can heal for 6750 only do it in 7 seconds?<br />
<br />
How about zone wide HEAL mitigation on PC's?<br />
<br />
They should count themselves lucky that they haven't farmed out the best of their class to a razor thin margin imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Couple of things to add here. For anyone reading my post above the quotes the cleric comments, don't take it serious or as a slam against an individual. My point I was attempting was one of the most vocal opponents to shaman heal upgrades is also the one with an itemized change list for his own class.<br />
<br />
It amused and amazed me that someone can rationalize in decent detail what they need and yet be so clearly uninformed and biased about other classes. One saving grace on these boards is the majority of shaman not only are making sure we do not ask for nerfage of other classes but that we actually have a decent general knowledge of what those classes need help in. Short version: even with our problems, I am much happier being associated with shaman.<br />
<br />
Second, I was in a chain pulling BoT group a few days ago and about an hour into it the cleric comments: &quot;you sure canni a lot.&quot; I was stumped and baffled. Made me wonder what shaman he had grouped with. After reading those posts I am now sure he is just another cleric who has no clue what we do to maintain our versatility in a group/raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is a blatant lie and anyone who gets that out of the discussions at the Shaman's Crucible has a reading comprehension problem. In just about EVERY healing topic that comes up, the comparision to DRUID HEALING is made and always that Shaman do not want to heal nearly as well as a cleric---because that is THEIR TERRITORY. <br />
<br />
All Shaman have asked for is enough healing power to actually back up a cleric when CH is not going to land in time due to mob DPS. As it stands at this point in time, Shaman healing can't do that very well, thus the group wipe outs referred to earlier in this same thread and the &quot;poor widdew cweric&quot; having to go to PoK to buy cloudy potions before he runs back to rez his party.<br />
<br />
Idiotic clerics who posted in that thread need to wake up. Mind you, not all clerics are morons. Some actually realize help would be nice. If cleric's can't see that the insufficient back up heal in their party is contributing to the number of wipes they are experiencing... then yes, they should keep whining about how close the Shaman are to stepping on their oh so sacred toes. Clerics need healing support in GoD and all Shaman want to do is provide it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Someone already said it but I really wonder how any other classes would feel if any of their spells were mitigated. the collective scream would be heard around the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Honestly, I don't ****ing understand the Cleric community. They have gotten melee upgrades, a situational pet, HoT insta cast AA, the only spell haste buff in the game, a buff that mitigates incoming melee damage, DvA(!), BDA, improved DI, innate DI on top of upgraded heals and probably a lot more.<br />
<br />
Where any of them playing pre-PoP? The cleric class has received huge upgrades in both their main and secondary and even tertiary abilities. <br />
<br />
Before anyone is dropping the class envy line, I have absolutely no problem with them receiving all that, but ****ing realize that the Cleric class isn't 1 dimensional anymore as they might have been. Yet their superiority in their main ability is unrivaled up to date.<br />
<br />
A group that wants to replace their cleric with a Shaman healer, needs ****ing 3(three!) Shamans to outheal 1(yes, one!) Cleric Healing per Second wise and they only do so by 10%. This is assuming the ONE Cleric and the THREE Shamans have their best healing and beneficial haste focus in game and all using their best fast heal obviously.<br />
And I am not even going to comapare the efficiency.<br />

If that isn't unbalanced for such a crucial ability like healing, I don't know what is.<br />
