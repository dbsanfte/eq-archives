<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So i hit 24 last recently and sofar have been very pleased with my shaman. My only worry is that im going to fall into some kind of gray area in the high levels due to not being able to either tank or be main healer in high level content...<br />
<br />
I also got this hilarious red cap in Hillsbrad, its really cute isnt it?<br />

<br />
Oh, and I was wondering wich of these two pants i should wear, both seem very good but my question is if the heal focus is better than all the stats on the blue ones.<br />

Thanks in advance, and walk with the earthmother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go with the stats.<br />
At your level, you won't be healing very much honestly.<br />
Even in instances, it's probably not worth keeping the healing ones unless you are the only healer, and healing a lot.<br />
<br />
And when you get higher level, from my experiences, shaman can tank well enough.<br />
We hold aggro probably better than any other class in the game due to rockbiter + earth shock + decent dps.<br />
When I hit level 40 and finally got to equip my mail armor, I was about 2k ac without my shield, and about 3500 with shield.<br />
At level 53, without many gear upgrades unfortunately, I'm over 4kac with shield, and at 2300 without shield.<br />
I am able to kill level 48 elite mobs, caster or otherwise.<br />
I'm wielding a 45dps staff, or a 32 dps 1h mace, and can do that with either weapon choice.<br />
I'm an enhancement shaman, with minor amounts of evocation point allocation.<br />
<br />
My main &quot;attribute&quot; is AC.  After that, I haven't been focusing on anything in particular so far.  Based on how often my flurry proc goes off with huge agility (I've had +90 to agility through buffs and totem) I can see how much more often it goes off and gives me a huge dps boost.  That, and though I haven't seen hard evidence or parses, windfury procs seem to go off more often with high agility.  I'll probably be going for +agility and +sta gear for my shaman for soloing purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">as a general rule, anything that is &quot;+ healing&quot; or &quot;+ shadow dmg&quot;, etc is worthless.  You lose too many stats in that slot.<br />
<br />
It sounds like a good idea but it doesn't work out in game.  In order to balance the ability they have to make them scale according to cast time and spell level.<br />
<br />
...so that +7 to heals really only gives you 2 or 3 points on your 400pt heal.  ooooooh wow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">An exception I'd make to that is +arcane damage.<br />
The reason I bring that up is specificly because of Arcane Explosion for mages.<br />
If you have a +X damage to arcane item, it does 10 more damage per arcane explosion you do.<br />
When my mage is popping off arcane explodes (instant cast due to talents) each +X is multiplied against all the targets you have.<br />
So, if you AE 10 targets, you get +10X damage per cast.<br />
Seeing as I can cast arcane explosion about once every second due to instant spell recast time, if that X is say +10 damage, then I'm gaining 100dps from that one item.<br />
I haven't transferred them over yet, but I've got about +25 in various arcane damage items waiting to be equiped by my mage.<br />
That +25 damage is going to equate to about +100 dps when I ae 4 mobs at a time if I'm doing that for xp.<br />
That +25 damage is going to equate to about +250 dps when I ae 10 mobs at a time in an instance.<br />
That's a huge dps boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I find gear to be simple for my build of shaman.<br />
<br />
HPl<br />
Stam/AC (I try to balance these two)<br />
Int/Agi  (I try to balance these two)<br />
Str<br />
spr<br />
<br />
I conser myself to be a melee shaman that can back up heal if needed and take the role over if the main healer dies, but its rare that im in the mood to be the main healer, its just too boring i cant do it. I find my HP and AC out weigh most people i group with even multiple levels higher and i end up tanking more often then not or heavily offtank.<br />
<br />
But thats my build.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, you can turn of helms in the UI interface options. But i love your rasta pants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like your look, the pants are funky, I was looking for those when I was your level, but good luck bought me an upgrade pretty quick.<br />
<br />
I just hit lvl 40 last night and you can tell from my toon's look I did almost all my shopping in SM.  I look like a frigging serial killer who just walked out of a heavy metal video.<br />
<br />
Now, on to game stuff.  I've tried the 2 handed route and the 1 hander shield/AC/STAM/AGIL route.  I can't come close to touching the DPS of a 2 hander shaman with WF and enhancement specs, especially focusing on STAM/AGIL/AC.  On a good proc streak it's like watching a cement truck hitting a puppy.  You almost feel sorry for the mob or alliance ganker.  That said, on adds or when they get a bad proc streak they go down faster than the prom queen.  Me, I can easily tank and kill (over time) 3 even con mobs with my STAM/AC/HP/AGIL build.  I use a blue shield and a dagger. Adds are no problem, my damage is constant, my dagger is a fast hitter and has more chances to interupt casters, my racial strength and stat bonuses to STR mean I use my shield better and mitigate more damage.  IF I can hold aggro over the screaming wildman 2 hander shaman, I can almost totaly assure us of victory charging into a camp of 4 mobs, all higher or equal con to us.<br />
<br />
On PvP it's harder for me to kill cloth casters because I give them more time to live, but I've never had a problem with cloth casters.  On rogues, pallies, druids and even warriors I do better (consistantly) but the fights last longer and I'm usually in bad shape at the end.  I linger in melee too long (I can get away with this due to LS and some decent mitigation) and I get hurt, but I win through attrition.  Contrast the live hard, die fast build of 2 handers, vs the surviveability and consistancy of the 1 hander/shield, personally, I like the later.  In the end, it doesn't really matter as all the shaman class really does in high level instances/raids is drop totems, supliment a little DPS and BU heal.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I am specced 21 pts in ELE (elemental fury, shocks, Clearcast and a 2 second fire totem), 7 in Enhancement, and 3 in rest (will be 23 for NS).</div></div><hr />
