Second from the left. Looks more like a candidate for &quot;Joe Millionare 3&quot; than a Barb :(.<br />
<br />
Time to befriend the ogers I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That looks like utter crap tbh :(.</div></div><hr />

Ok, now where are the posts saying not to freak out. It's not finished yet?<br />
<br />
It may be unfinished but a stick in a pile of mud would look better. It looks like a stoned, brown Incredible Hulk cartoon in a suit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just be glad you're not inclined towards male elves.  If they were any more gay they'd be a short, balding, hairy man wearing shorts, tank top, talking in an all too high voice and sweating to the oldies ...<br />
<br />
It's bad, but it isn't terminal.  The barbie females look hot, but too damned civilised.  I like a woman who I know can hurt me bad, but these models look like a big boned cheerleader.<br />
<br />
The facial features on female elves is awesome. I was looking at the battle stance on a later SS and if their legs were any further appart they'd be on a doctor's table getting a pap or giving birth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why are they dressed like astronaunts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">*shrug* game isn't out yet I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember when EQ first came out and the only thing that was different was the color of your outfit based on what gear you had?<br />
<br />
Models are starting to come together and I have to say those are the worst I've seen so far all the others I've really liked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can't say I really care what barbarians look like, since I never look at myself anyway--others will have to look at me.<br />
<br />
But that armor is just flat-out awful. They need to cut out like 90% of the ornamentation, armor just doesn't look like that. Clean, smooth lines, shining metal, etc, but not flocking on a Christmas tree...<br />

Heck, n00bs just have to look at Luclin to revisit those days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You're gonna be able to do a lot of tweeking with how you want your character to look like. I believe even in terms of body weight. <br />
<br />
Though that Barb does look pretty crappy I'm not gonna say the Barb models in general suck till I see more pics.</div></div><hr />
