<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">surprised i havnt read anything about it yet<br />
<br />
is it even up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had about 150 tokens that have been sitting in bags since the day casino crashed.  I went and spent them all, and had the same worthless crap to show for it that I did last time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I messed around on it and saw a necro in my guild win holgresh elder beads. It's emoted across the zone so you can pick those out who &quot;claim&quot; to win from those who really do. :)<br />
<br />
I have won rubbish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Call me ignant, but what do the holgresh elder beads do that make them so fantastic?  Same with the Guise fo the deciever?  What does it do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">lol i was gonna ask the same thing<br />
<br />
i think the beads are a click eye of zom but i never figured out why that was such a big deal<br />
<br />
i guess people used to pull or something with them that led to the nerf<br />
<br />
guise is click dark elf<br />
<br />
another item i never saw the big deal for heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Necros make the eye and lifetap it for hps in a bind/pinch, or when just medding up.  <br />
<br />
I guess one or two use it to scout =P<br />
<br />
he he</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Really?  all this hubub over an item that only helps necros?  From the sound of it it made the world stop spinning for a week =).  If someone is desprately vying for this, could they please tell me why you want it?  Why would it be worth the XXXk PP people are dropping on this thing.<br />
<br />
Same with the dark elf mask... can't you still hunt down a dark elf illusion mask these days, or am I just nutty.  And what makes this mask worth the plat?<br />
<br />
now if they were handing out manastones....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I won a DE mask today after about 14k so I was pretty happy. For those that don't know, 3 or 4 years ago these masks stopped dropping. They are clickable from inventory and all classes can use them. The mask that drops in Guk must be worn by a rogue or bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The old guise could be used by anyone, the new one cant. This is the old pre nerf version, one which I just barely missed getting through bad rolls before it was nerfed. Its a status item, and a minor convenience for some.  For me, it happens to be a bit mroe useful, as the ogre model  has some geometry problems which creates collisions. To me, the combination of these 2 factors is worth shelling out 200k+ for one. What else am I really going to buy?<br />
<br />
The elder beads are good for scouting. Monks treasure them in particular, since they can open doors and see around corners w/o risking aggro. Id like a set to play with, but its less a concern w me than the mask is.<br />
<br />
I havent blown a lot of money yet, since I am still trying to get my alt in full stonehide, but when thats done gonna drop a load there.<br />
<br />
BTW, does anyone know if they put the plank for the BFG in the casino?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Holgresh beads give you an eye of zomm for scouting. That's something a lot of classes don't have. Any item that gives an ability you don't normally have is invaluable. They were beyond priceless when the eyes were aggro for pulling, but the eyes are nonaggro now.<br />
<br />
Guise of the Deceiver is the ultimate old school item to have. It shows you've been around with your current character almost since the start of the game. Many servers weren't around when this item dropped. My not getting one was a minor regret I've always had.<br />
<br />
Personally I broke even in the casino, 0 pp spent, nothing gotten back... it's probably going to stay that way, none of the items really interest me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Eye of zomm is a one of a kind effect.  It lets you scout very far ahead in an ldon dungeon, or anywhere really, and it is only available to most class on this one item, which no longer drops.  Also, necros and SKs can use it to heal themselves.  summon eye, lifetap it, repeat.  I'd like to have one, but I'm not going to buy one for 300k, or spend god only knows how much at the casino until I win one.<br />
<br />
As for guise of the deciever, it doesn't help you at all.  It is just a cool illusion item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Really?  all this hubub over an item that only helps necros?

<br />

<br />
Holgresh beads: can summon and lifetap, even though the eye only has 1hp or whatever I believe lifetaps ignore that when determining how much is healed, or could use the leech line which still goes after the mob is dead. Can also use to scout. =p<br />
<br />
Dark Elf Mask: This is the pre-nerf guise of the deceiver which any class can click from inventory. Not the huge deal it used to be before they added shrink, but still cool.<br />
<br />
Fungus Staff: The pre-nerf staff that can be clicked from inventory.<br />
<br />
Mistwalker: Completely and totally just a 'cool' item, the ratio and proc blow in todays mudflated EQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
There were some other items I remember seeing people win but they went downhill from there...I think Rubi BP was one of them. I dumped 10k when it first went live in hopes of either getting lucky and winning a mask or having a 'bugged' win chance and getting a mask, neither happened. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So what are the odds like in getting an old pre-nurf guise of the deceiver? I can only assume the Casino is purely random and you could win one with your first try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I just won a guise of the deceiver and I am not going to say how much I spent to get it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Forget the mask and the staff and the beads, has anyone you know of won a glowing drum yet?<br />
<br />
They were prizes in the original casino.  They still in the prize tables?<br />
<br />
That's the only thing I'd want out of hte casino.</div></div><hr />

Aren't all the items that the casino gives flagged as NO DROP ? At least they were the first time, maybe your guild got lucky  :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, some are No Drop, some aren't.  Depends on the item.   Rubi BP, Ton Po's, Holgresh Beads, etc are all tradeable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monks used to be able to pull with them, but then they nerfed Eye of Zomm so that mobs won't aggro on it.  So now, yeah, they are mostly of interest to necros or maybe SKs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Karana got a serverwide message that Casino was being taken down again around 11pm CST tonight. No explanation given.</div></div><hr />

SS or something, perhaps from the otters in CS, not sure anymore.  It was a weapon that crazy fast procced a knockback.  It looked like a gun . . . and knocked stuff back like a high powered cannon . . hence it was dubbed &quot;BFG&quot;(big effing gun) by the players.  The quest was nerfed like weeks after the first BFG was discovered, which was lame, but anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehehe, I love how terms get traded into new games.<br />
<br />
Those of us who came here from Quake/Quake2/Quake3 know what the original BFG is.  ;)<br />
<br />
Man, I miss that game.  Sometimes I think I should reinstall Q2 on my box and go see how many people still play it.  Never did like Q3 all that much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does level make a difference in chances of winning? Like will a 65 get stuff more often than someone in their 40's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">bfg 9000 is from Doom actually if I remember correctly</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">yea it was taken down because i heard it was the cause of all the zone/tell/server lag.  apparently the random # generator sent a request to server every time, so it was like 50ppl constantly playing 4 at once which lagged everything.  i played for a few hours dropped about 100k since i have no other use for the cash, at about 25k in i got a ticket and got a rubicite bp (quite pissed at the time), then about 85k in got another ticket and got holgresh beads (hurray).  now just have to decide weather to leave them on shaman or give to sk &gt;&lt;<br />

I'd credit the devs with naming the BFG more than the players: Breezeboot's Frigid Gnasher (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27310)  <br />
<br />
Notice the initials, and the item lore. Definitely a tribute to the old BFG 9000. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">For those asking about the utility of Holgresh Elder Beads... aside from general scouting, Eye of Zomm rocks for any class that can lull or pacify.  You don't need line of sight to lull... send in Eye, target, lull, repeat.  It's basically risk-free except for the odd resist with aggro.  One of the reasons the Singing Steel Helm is still a great item for bards.</div></div><hr />
