<p class="largefont">Click here for full thread: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19764">GoD unbalances shamans yet further</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">People who bought GoD said they did so for new content.  From initial reports, that new content means mobs that hit harder, have higher resists and more hitpoints than previous expansions.  This is obivous from a perusual of the non-Ancient spells other classes recieved.  Clerics and druids have more powerful heals.  Wizards, mages, and druids have more powerful nukes.  Even hybrid classes have more options for damage output than before.<br />
<br />
Before GoD, we drafted The Proposal (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19207) which outlined 5 areas where shamans were unbalanced given the then current content.  In the face of the new GoD content, it is useful to revisit what we said in The Proposal and see if the upgrades we actually recieved have kept pace.<br />
<br />
1.  Healing - <br />
<br />
Problem: Shaman healing was underpowered in many high level situations for most shamans<br />
GoD situation: To compensate for higher rate of damage both druids (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4883&amp;source=Live) and clerics (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4880&amp;source=Live) recieved more effective single target heals.  Clerics also received a new powerful heal over time spell (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4882&amp;source=Live).  Shamans recieved a very modest upgrade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4899&amp;source=Live) to Quiescence.<br />
Result: Shamans are farther behind the healing of other priests than before GoD.<br />
<br />
2.  Mana regeneration -<br />
<br />
Problem: Shaman mana regeneration provided very little edge over the mana regernation of other classes to compensate for the higher costs of healing, dealing damage, debuffing, and buffing required of them.<br />
GoD situation: More challenging mobs mean higher mana costs for healing and debuffing.  The one upgrade to shaman mana regeneration will be inaccessbile (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4979&amp;source=Live)  to the vast majority of shamans.<br />
Result: Most shamans will be forced to deal with higher mana costs using existing, underpowered mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
3.  Direct damage spells -<br />
<br />
Problem: Shamans were far behind other casters in direct damage spell output.<br />
GoD situation: Mobs will require higher DD output, since clerics (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4881&amp;source=Live), druids (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4884&amp;source=Live), enchanters (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4879&amp;source=Live), magicians (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4887&amp;source=Live), and wizards (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4906&amp;source=Live) all have powerful, new nukes.  Even beastlords (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4876&amp;source=Live), rangers (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4897&amp;source=Live), and shadow knights (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4904&amp;source=Live) recieved significanlty upgraded DD spells.  Shamans recieved no new direct damage spells.  (Note: even the new DoT, which is less powerful that our level 64 spell, pales in comparision to the 3 new necromancer DoTs, each with huge resist modifiers).<br />
Result: Shaman DD ability is effectively equivalent to those of hybrid classes.<br />
<br />
4.  Slowing -<br />
<br />
Problem: Long the hallmark of shaman power, the edge they had with slowing was removed by enchanter and beastlord spells, coupled with slow mitigation<br />
GoD situation: Mitigation and resists of mobs to magic based slows are virtually unknown.  Based on previous expansions, it is likely that each of these will be more prevalent in GoD.  Shamans recieved a less resistable slow spell (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4900&amp;source=Live), but it last a much shorter time and generates 50% more aggro.<br />
Result: Slightly improved slowing ability in terms of intial slowing (which is now done better by bards) and on mobs with relatively high magic resistance.<br />
<br />
5. Buffing -<br />
<br />
Problem: Buffs available from other classes compounded with equipment mudflation marginalized many shaman buffs.<br />
GoD situation: No new buffs spells were recieved.  The introduction of a new beastlord group buff (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4875&amp;source=Live) decreases the need for shaman buffs.<br />
Result: Even lower desireability of shamans for buffing purposes.<br />
<br />
To sum up, GoD presents new, more challenging content in terms of raids, groups, and possibly new solo opportunities. To keep pace with these new, more challenging encounters, all casting classes recieved substantial upgrades to at least some facet of their abilities.  Shamans received virtually no significant upgrades to any aspect of their abilities.  Apparently developers assumed shamans were perfectly balanced to explore this new content without any upgrades.</div></div><hr />

Still, it may be unfair to say that the new cannibalization spell will be inaccessible to &quot;most shaman&quot;.  Unless you know where it drops or how it is obtained, it is premature to say any such thing.  I've heard that it may be a LDON-style purchase -- in which case that makes it available to all shaman that are willing to put in the time to get it (which can be done in 30 minute chunks).  <br />
<br />
As for the rest, I'm more or less inclined to agree.  This expansion offers me nothing.  In fact, it offers me nothing to such a degree that I'm inclined to dust off my enchanter and play her everywhere except on raids (my role on raids is unaffected by this expansion).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, read the boards (see link above, near end of thread).  It is common knowledge that the &quot;ancient&quot; spells drop off of the boss mobs in the last zone.  Both require better than time capable guilds to defeat.  Something which has not been done yet and probably won't happen for some time.  If you are in a time capable guild, you may have a crack at it, after you get the appropriate flags and kill your way to that encounter.  However, MOST of us, will never see this spell, since it is no drop.<br />
<br />
And, btw, there is no LDoN point system in GoD.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valdak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have maintained for a long time that the shaman class is all but  ignored by SOE and as far as I am concerned the new expansion is a further example.  I am very discouraged by the new expansion, a better heal would have been good, a more effective dot would have been great, even lowering the price of components for alchemy so it was a viable source of income would have given me some encouragement.  Instead I feel we got as little as SOE thought they could get away with for the shamans.  Hell, SOW potions are about the only useful alchemy item and they don't even appear in the new trade skill window, they still have to be made the old time consuming way.  As much as I hate to say it, maybe we should take the same course as the warriors have done to get SOE's attention and stop playing shamans for awhile.  I do believe the bias againt the shaman class is so strong that nothing will help.  Personally, I have a 54 necro and a 42 pally and will be playing them for awhile. So, although it will make no difference at all, that's one less 65 shaman out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been pretty happy (even a bit proud) to play a shaman these last two odd years. I have to say though, this latest expansion is a real kick in the teeth. For the amount of shaman usable content, this really should have been an ingame patch, not a paid for expansion. The AA are a complete joke. Hell, they could have put Weapon Affinity in there and I would have taken it over any of the AA we got. As it is, well - I still have my saved AAs. Maybe I'll find something useful to spend them on in the earlier AA groupings.</div></div><hr />

Oh please... If you're trying to say Shamans don't need upgrades because we're obviously so powerful, find another horse to beat than poor Yeldema. That poor dragon has been slapped around solo by most, if not all, classes by now. Some of them long before Time gear was involved. Or PoP came out for that matter. <br />

More to the point, there is nothing that a shaman can solo that another class cannot solo easier or faster nowaday. And plenty that we can't while other do.</div></div><hr />

Dont buy this expansion for balance, buy it for the content.  If, like me, you simply aren't advanced enough for the content, dont buy it.  I'm not, but it doesn't have anything to do with sour grapes over balancing.  Thats not to say I'm not sour about balance, but I dont expect and expansion to fix it.</div></div><hr />

The thing that saddens me the most is yet another &quot;we are sooo powerful&quot; post was made today or yesterday, which is a sign about how blind some people are because they either don't raid, are the only shaman in raid, or don't have a clue. All 3 being rare cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">They have fairly consistantly said they would not attempt to balance classes with the new expansion.  <br />
<br />
The point here is that the new content means that mobs are more powerful.  ALL classes except for shamans were given scaled up, more powerful spells to deal with this new content.<br />
<br />
I'm not concerned about being balanced relative to other classes as much as I am being balanced relative to the new content.  If other classes needed to be upgraded to deal with this new content, which they were, why weren't shamans?<br />
<br />
Oh, and Litgurv, I don't get it.   What does that picture have to do with Gumby's horse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In a rare move I am going to have to go ahead and agree with Gardeltron on every point.  I think we were in pretty good shape before Gates came out, but things are starting to look worse for us, for all the reasons Gardeltron listed.  The only point I would disagree with you on is point 4.  It is still early in the expansion, but so far, all the mobs I have encountered have very low HP, hit very hard, do not mitigate slow (a few 'mostly' though), and have medium resists (once malos is in, turgurs never resists).  By the time I land malos and turgur's, the mob is usually at around 75% health and has done a lot of damage to the tank.  With the new slow, the -40MR mod is enough to ensure that it will almost always land on the first shot.  It also casts very fast.  With the new slow, we will be able to get the mob slowed (60% is good enough) very quickly.<br />
<br />
Another thing about our mana regen:  I really do believe that the new canni spell is excellent and will vastly increase our mana regen abilities.  Is this increased mana regen enough to make us balanced again?  I don't know, our spells still lack the magnitude that other classes have.  A 1300pt heal just isn't enough, no matter how many times you can cast it.  Also, of course, the new cannibalize is an ancient spell.  I feel this is a very poor move on the developer's part.  Plague of Daluda should have been a poison dot that does 390 a tick, and it should have been the ancient.  Every other class gets a damage upgrade as their ancient, while we get a game-changing mana regen ability.  I will probably get the ancient canni spell, as I am in the #1 raiding guild on my server, but it just isn't fair to shamans that aren't in raiding guilds.  I think most people could live without an upgraded dot, but it is unfair to base shaman balance around a spell that most will not be able to obtain.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't think we were underpowered prior to GoD.  Druids had a slight edge on us.  We were in the middle of the pack though.  <br />
<br />
Now, I'm a bit worried.  Gard is right that nothing got addressed except point 4.  I disagree on the whole slow thing.  Nihil is incredible and will see lots of use.  (High dps, low hp mobs need slow right away... malos+turgurs and it's mostly dead just doesn't cut it).  Being able to gimp adds quickly is very nice.  Slowing clearly got a big upgrade, even if most can't see it yet.<br />
<br />
I think most shamans would have been perfectly happy just to get a healing upgrade... and forget about nukes and buffs (see poll that was done; healing was clear winner).  The new disease DoT has to be the most ***? spell in all of GoD.<br />
<br />
The ward thing could have been really cool for us, if it had been uniquely ours.  I still think the wards should do different things, not just all be hp regen.<br />

<br />
 :D <br />
<br />
 The only point I would disagree with you on is point 4.  <br />
<br />
We actually agree on this point too.  The new slow should help out in many group situations.  It is a modest upgrade as I point out.<br />
<br />
 I really do believe that the new canni spell is excellent and will vastly increase our mana regen abilities.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if it will VASTLY increase mana regen.  It has the same efficiency (mana regen/hp lost) as previous spells, the major difference is the rate of raw mana regen: it's 14 mps (mana per second) for the old spells, and 17 mps for the new spell.  BUT, that figure doesn't take into account mana spent healing damage done by cannibalizing.  <br />
<br />
For Can5 the net mps would be:<br />
<br />
(1066 mana regenerated - 200 mana spent on Quiessence)/69 second recast time = 12.5 mps<br />
<br />
For Chaotic Pain, the net mana regenerated would be (assuming you cast Quiessence once for every 2 casts of CP):<br />
<br />
(360 mana regenerated - 100 mana spent on 1/2 cast of Quiessence)/18 second recast time = 14.4 mps<br />
<br />
The net mps of Chaotic pain would be the same as casting C4 several times without healing the damage.<br />
<br />
The real difference between CP and C4 is the convenience of not having to constantly cast it.  I'm not sure this would provide &quot;game-changing mana regeneration&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I also did not see anyone say that they have killed the boss-mob in Tacvi.  If I missed it, by all means point out who said it and call me an idiot - - I won't mind.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yes, our new slow spell may be better then Turgur's in some situations - but we are the only class to get situational upgrades. Every other GoD is at the very least an upgrade in magnitude to an older spell. We get an upgrade to spell that was a band-aid before (Q), a downgrade to an already not very good spell, a situational upgrade (slow) and a spell thats somewhere between good and very good as an ancient spell.<br />
Somehow getting a few extra points per tick on Q does not seem very exciting to me after getting smacked around for 1200s by yard trash in my first expedition. Having to choose between two high-cost slows, one slightly faster casting and less resistable and one just having a greater effect on MOBs that hit for that much seems silly too. I want to land my big slow, yet I get to choose between speed or effect.<br />
With the current setup the only situation where the new slow is clearly better is if you can reliably land the new slow, cannot land Turgur's reliably and you need slow landed fast.<br />
That means non- or maybe slightly mitigating MOBs with sorta-high-but-not-too-high resists that hit very hard - and so far I have not seen any of those. (Exactly the right sitation to use a slow that generates more aggro too!)<br />

Your assuming a lot here, first of all, that all shaman will even have this spell...its ancient, so that means it gonna be tough to get and require raid forces that have looted Time to get access; second, to those that are lucky (blessed really) to get a copy, who has room in their Big 8 to mem that extra cann? I know that I dont really have room to add another permenant spell; you may though, Time's Antithesis mayhelp that, and granted if your looting Time gear now, in 4-5 months you may have CP, if so pre grats, the rest of us will be chugging away at life with Can 4 and Cann 5 and other ****ty upgrads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">They have fairly consistantly said they would not attempt to balance classes with the new expansion.  ...<br />
<br />
I know, the big A made that statement. Unfortunately i know as well, it was BS from day 1 <br />
 :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
Of course class balancing is looked at during expansions and is influencing basic design decisions. Just look at PoP shaman spells, a rather obvious step to counter the overpowered shaman mana regen (overpowered in SoEs mind) with higher mana costs and overall less mana efficiency. The opening of the healing gap between shaman and druid was part of the PoP release as well.<br />
<br />
They also fairly consistantly said, the bazaar would be included with SoL release ... SoE has a long history of not telling players the complete truth (to put it in polite terms).<br />
<br />
Class balancing is done via expansions, period.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gnawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">First, I dont post much on these boards, but I use and read them a lot. Ive played my shaman since march 1999, so I know my class pretty well.<br />
<br />
Lately it has been nothing than complaining and wining about what other classes get and we dont. Just negative stuff about Gates of D...<br />
<br />
I really enjoy this expansion so far. Died a lot to trash mobs, seen new zones and quests. Having fun with friends...<br />
<br />
Can we please give this expansion a bit more time. Its been up like 4 days. Please be a bit more positive and focus on what we have instead. <br />
<br />
The initiativ with the changes was great, but we have posted that now. If they want to change shamans Im sure they have gotten our suggestions from that post. Give feedback in game is fine as well, but please stop all these complaints and wining posts on this board. Its no more fun to go here and read threads any longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The only point I would disagree with you on is point 4. It is still early in the expansion, but so far, all the mobs I have encountered have very low HP, hit very hard, do not mitigate slow (a few 'mostly' though), and have medium resists (once malos is in, turgurs never resists).  <br />
<br />
Im in a guild currently trying to progress at the *end* game, and for the first couple of trials, this may be true, but wait till Tixv (or how ever it's spelled).  All mobs mitigate.  60 percent mitigate to partially.  I got passed over for a trial group, for a beastlord for slow, for this one.  Im too lazy to look up the previous posts, but we all know by now the miniscule difference between BST/ ENC/ SHM slows, once mobs are only slowing to partially. (Like 1.8 percent between shaman and bst).  We have not advanced enough people yet to see the last raid zones, but as the *trials* (not sure if that's the name everyone uses for them) advanced, the gap between our slow, and a bst/ enc slow, narrowed considerably.  <br />
<br />
Im so... disgusted? ... right now, that I have no motivation to sign in my shaman anymore.  I know many of you *Shaman are POWER* people will give me the overly used and abused If You Dont Like It, Start Over, but that's not the issue at all.  The issue is mobs hitting for 1300 trips, partially slowable, with ramps (yard trash), and our heal cant keep up with the dmg done, and our most useful tool (slow), being marginallized to bst/ enc, with the bst providing DPS to get the mob dead faster (less healing for cleric), or enchanter for the crowd control also needed.  Rooting for crowd control is all fine and dandy, till you get trip hit, stunned, and dead on next combat round (Have 6980 hps at the moment), before you can even say add, or root finishes casting.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I agree totally with the original poster.  Something needs done, seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'm not arguing whether it's going to be easy to get the spell or not.  That's left to be seen.  My point still stands though, that getting CP will vastly improve our mana regen.  Some shaman apparently don't use c4 once they get c5 and clarity and blah blah blah.  I know I still use c4 very often.  At any time that I would be using c4 to wince, I'll be using both to get mana back.<br />
<br />
Even using CP as a replacement to C4, it's still helping tremendously.<br />
You just complained that you have to spend all your time wincing to get your mana back.<br />
Well, CP has the same efficiency roughly as 4 casts of c4.<br />
Instead of devoting 20-24 seconds purely to chain casting c4, you can spend 5-6 seconds to casting CP once, and the rest of the time you can be doing whatever else you want like meleeing or concentrating on CC work or cybering or whatever.<br />
The thing is, the shaman with CP is going to be spending 1/4 as much time wincing to get back the same mana rate.<br />
You might not thing it's that big a deal, but I do.<br />
<br />
The difference is basicly:<br />
*wince* *wince* *wince* *wince*<br />
vs<br />
*big wince*<br />
<br />
Another factor is for the shaman out there that are wincing while mobs are beating on them for mana regen when you are doing the &quot;in teh face&quot; tanking of mobs and dotting them and stuff.  Casting 4 winces while tanking a mob gives you 4 changes to have your spell be interupted.  Only having to channel it once, is another big improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">JuuJuu is a smart man and understands perfectly why the new canni is a good spell (even though the ancient tag is a real bummer).  You all should listen to him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">i am not sure poeple actually said that the mana regen from new canni is bad, just that unlikely to get as it is an ancient spell from a  zone time poeple cant get to yet.<br />
<br />
the new canni is a nice u/g .<br />
<br />
however, how will this greater mana regen (i dont normally go oom atall)<br />
help with our slow casting spells? mediocre healing  and very limited dps?<br />
on short fights with high dps, comparitively low hp mobs?<br />
<br />
greater mana regen so i can stay fm all the time is nice, but i perfer to be able to cast quicker, do better healing and more dps.(depending on groups if they have healer or not)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The new canni may well be a great upgrade.  In fact, if you take the ancient tag off it, it's exactly what we asked for in a new canni.  Unfortunately the devs specifically said that the Ancient spells in this expansion were going to be difficult to get the same way the luclin ancients were.  <br />
<br />
As one of 2 shamans in a non raiding guild that will likely never see the inside of Vex Thal let alone Time, I figure I have 2 chances of ever getting this spell: slim and none.  <br />
<br />
As to the aa's we got, well most classes (with a couple exceptions) feel like they got screwed on new aa's in this expansion so I'd say our aa list was probably on par with everyone else.  (IE nobody got really serious power increases in their aa's for the most part).  <br />
<br />
The spells however were pretty typical, we got rehashed versions of spells from 2+ expansions ago with minimal changes to them while other classes got serious upgrades.  <br />
<br />
I can't say that I'm likely to ever set foot in the GoD zones.  My guild will probably never even set foot any deeper in the planes than tactics, and despite the fact that I'd like to see higher end content I won't abandon people that are like a family to me for a chance to participate in mindless zerg raids for uber gear in a guild where I am just a_raid_shaman_10.  <br />
<br />
I don't expect Sony to re-evaluate the entire state of shaman balance in an expansion.  I do expect that shaman upgrades should actually BE upgrades on the same scale that the other classes get.  However, that didn't happen, and I don't exactly hold out much hope that it'll happen in any of the future expansions either.</div></div><hr />

The difference between our calculations is that you assumed ALL you do is alternate C4 and CP.  In which case, yes, I aggree with you, if the only thing you do is alternate these two spells then you will regen mana much faster.  For example, with C5, CP, and C4, you could regen mana after death more rapidly then is now possible.<br />
<br />
However, if I had CP, I would not use up two spell slots to keep both C4 and CP memorized.  In unusual circumstances I might (e.g., after I died), but for general functionality I would only have CP memorized.  In that case, my calculations would be right.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">1.  Healing - <br />
<br />
Problem: Shaman healing was underpowered in many high level situations for most shamans<br />
GoD situation: To compensate for higher rate of damage both druids (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4883&amp;source=Live) and clerics (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4880&amp;source=Live) recieved more effective single target heals.  Clerics also received a new powerful heal over time spell (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4882&amp;source=Live).  Shamans recieved a very modest upgrade (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4899&amp;source=Live) to Quiescence.<br />
Result: Shamans are farther behind the healing of other priests than before GoD.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We got a 20% increase in healing with Breath of Trushar and a 10% increase in mana cost over Quiescence (1440hp heal for 220 mana).  Clerics got a 10% increase in healing at 10% more mana (2200hp for 440 mana).  Breath of Trushar is still more efficient.  And trust me, healing over time is more about efficiency than how much it heals.  Cast Breath of Trushar twice and we heal for 2880hp for 440 mana and that's far more mana efficient than Holy Elixir.<br />
<br />
As for getting a new direct heal, it would have been disappointing.  We'd have gotten at 1430hp heal for 495 mana.  I would have been more upset with that than no heal at all.  If the options are getting slapped in the face or not getting slapped at all, I'd rather not get slapped.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  Mana regeneration -<br />
<br />
Problem: Shaman mana regeneration provided very little edge over the mana regernation of other classes to compensate for the higher costs of healing, dealing damage, debuffing, and buffing required of them.<br />
GoD situation: More challenging mobs mean higher mana costs for healing and debuffing.  The one upgrade to shaman mana regeneration will be inaccessbile (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4979&amp;source=Live)  to the vast majority of shamans.<br />
Result: Most shamans will be forced to deal with higher mana costs using existing, underpowered mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
<br />
We haven't even seen many GoD mobs to figure out if they require more damage.  Mana regeneration isn't a huge issue for us.  How many times have you seen a shaman yell &quot;OOM&quot; on a fight before other classes?  On Quarm, which is probably the longest single mob PoP encounter, I end with around 40m and I'm constantly casting something (heal, cure, debuffs) during that fight.<br />
<br />
Also, we have no idea if the Ancient spells are dropped or can be MQed or whatever.  It's premature to say that most of the shaman population is getting screwed over.  The Luclin ancient spells were upgrades, but they weren't *necessary* upgrades.  Scourge of Nife and Feral Avatar are nice bonuses, but were in no way required.  Chaotic Pain is definite upgrade and if they limit its availability then that would be wrong.<br />
<br />
Actually, I think we're ahead on mana renegeration over most other classes, since we got no increase in heals, DD spells or debuffs (except Nihil).  Other classes now have to spend more mana for slightly better spells and their mana regerenation has remained the same.  So you're off on your last point.<br />
<br />
<br />
3.  Direct damage spells -<br />
<br />
Problem: Shamans were far behind other casters in direct damage spell output.<br />
GoD situation: Mobs will require higher DD output, since clerics (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4881&amp;source=Live), druids (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4884&amp;source=Live), enchanters (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4879&amp;source=Live), magicians (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4887&amp;source=Live), and wizards (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4906&amp;source=Live) all have powerful, new nukes.  Even beastlords (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4876&amp;source=Live), rangers (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4897&amp;source=Live), and shadow knights (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4904&amp;source=Live) recieved significanlty upgraded DD spells.  Shamans recieved no new direct damage spells.  (Note: even the new DoT, which is less powerful that our level 64 spell, pales in comparision to the 3 new necromancer DoTs, each with huge resist modifiers).<br />
Result: Shaman DD ability is effectively equivalent to those of hybrid classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to burst your bubble, but clerics aren't nuking on most raids and neither are many druids (depends on the target, but with AEs and other junk, druids are healing a lot rather than doing damage).  In xp groups, who cares who's doing the damage, just kill the mob and get the xp.  Most times in normal ldon mobs die before I can get off a second cast of Velium Strike after I slow.  I might get off 3 VSes on hard.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you saw the trend in the spells for all those classes.  It's 10% more damage for 10% more mana (or 20% more damage for 20% mana on ancient spells).  Grats rangers and beastlords on like 80-100 more damage done by spells.  Not to mention all melee classes get the royal butt-ramming on GoD raid mobs (don't know about xp mobs yet) being immune to certain weapon types, whereas casters are used to the idea of mobs having high resistances for certain types of spells.<br />
<br />
We'll also see how endurance (and its regeneration) change the game (probably for the worse).<br />
<br />
As for the necro DoTs, it has the same trend.  They got a lure DoT-lifetap upgrade to Saryrn's Kiss (10% more hp healed, 10% more mana cost) and they got a template upgrade to Funeral Pyre of Kelador.  The only thing major they got was like a ~50% upgrade (in power and mana cost) in Zevfeer's Theft of Vitae.  That's a utility spell more than a damage spell and it's pretty situational.  Necros mostly use it on raids where AEs are unavoidable.<br />
<br />
Also, their lich upgrade is also an ancient spell, so they will have to go through the same hoops as shamans do to get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
4.  Slowing -<br />
<br />
Problem: Long the hallmark of shaman power, the edge they had with slowing was removed by enchanter and beastlord spells, coupled with slow mitigation<br />
GoD situation: Mitigation and resists of mobs to magic based slows are virtually unknown.  Based on previous expansions, it is likely that each of these will be more prevalent in GoD.  Shamans recieved a less resistable slow spell (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4900&amp;source=Live), but it last a much shorter time and generates 50% more aggro.<br />
Result: Slightly improved slowing ability in terms of intial slowing (which is now done better by bards) and on mobs with relatively high magic resistance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Slowing is a triviality.  Mobs aren't hard to slow in most cases.  We now have the fastest casting slow spell and it has a resist adjust.  As for aggro, I don't know how people can say it's 50% more, since many don't even have this spell.  Bards have to cast 2 spells (Harmony of Sound and Requiem of Time) to pre-slow on the same level as Balance of the Nihil.  We can (possibly) now do better in 1.5 seconds than what they do in 6 seconds.  And if your xp mobs are lasting longer than 90 seconds, you're killing too slow.<br />
<br />
If the aggro turns out to be too much for you, get SCS3 then.  <br />
<br />
<br />
5. Buffing -<br />
<br />
Problem: Buffs available from other classes compounded with equipment mudflation marginalized many shaman buffs.<br />
GoD situation: No new buffs spells were recieved.  The introduction of a new beastlord group buff (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4875&amp;source=Live) decreases the need for shaman buffs.<br />
Result: Even lower desireability of shamans for buffing purposes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most buffs that just increase melee stats were useless anyway even before PoP.  People have their primary stats maxed in most cases and if not, the extra buffs provide marginal improvements. The hp increase is the only thing most classes are interested in.  The beastlord buff, Tureptan Spirit, is a group (group-only I think) version of Infusion of Spirit, which sucks.  The only people who regularly ask for IoS over the Focus line are noob clerics who want to keep their self buffs on.<br />
<br />
<br />
To sum up, GoD presents new, more challenging content in terms of raids, groups, and possibly new solo opportunities. To keep pace with these new, more challenging encounters, all casting classes recieved substantial upgrades to at least some facet of their abilities.  Shamans received virtually no significant upgrades to any aspect of their abilities.  Apparently developers assumed shamans were perfectly balanced to explore this new content without any upgrades.<br />
<br />
You see other classes getting new heals, new DDs and new DoTs and you think &quot;wow, everyone got upgraded but us.&quot;  I see it as &quot;the FT cap wasn't raised, there are no new mana regeneration buffs. Wow, other classes really got screwed.&quot;  Every other class now has to spend more mana to do slightly more damage and to heal for a slightly greater amount, yet they have the same mana pools and regeneration as they did in PoP.<br />
<br />
I'm still more concerned about stackability of shamans on raids.  Getting to heal for 130hp more or nuking for 92.5 more damage wouldn't have fixed that.  I can solo fine, I can get groups fine, I'm not complaining about those aspects.  Groups will always want shamans for what they can offer, we will never be fully replaced by any other class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I'm not arguing whether it's going to be easy to get the spell or not.  That's left to be seen.

<br />
Thats almost like insisting that as long as noone has found any martians on Mars you cant say that there arent any. I think if you you really had to be honest you would have to admit that it is very very unlikely that ancient spells are MQ'able, not nodrop or dropping from something else than the very toughest mobs in this expansion. I owe you a beer if it turns out otherwise.<br />
<br />
And if your xp mobs are lasting longer than 90 seconds, you're killing too slow.<br />

<br />
Wow, where is it they are giving out Time's Antithesises ?<br />
<br />
Stop for a second to think how it is for people that dont have a TA if you even having one still dont like the idea of CP taking an extra spell slot. I am pretty sure the developers once said that they wouldnt be balancing classes with items yet from what you are saying thats exactly what they are doing with TA. Its wrong, wrong wrong and a bad idea. The developers have to wake up and try playing a shaman - and not just one with all the top end equipment - to find out what could do with some fixing and what is fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You just healed 2200 hp over 48 seconds.  That is 2 rounds of melee or less.  While this might be wonderful for those times you are soloing, the statement that our healing power is bumped up by 20 percent is very misleading.<br />

We saw the trend.  Classes can do more with less time.  The restraining factor is time, not mana.  Do more in less time.  As shaman can slow with the new slow spell in less time.  This emphasis on mana cost is rather misguided and misleading as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the aggro turns out to be too much for you, get SCS3 then.<br />
<br />
This is kinda funny.  They add a ton of aggro for a spell and make you buy aa so you don't pull aggro with it lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm still more concerned about stackability of shamans on raids. Getting to heal for 130hp more or nuking for 92.5 more damage wouldn't have fixed that. I can solo fine, I can get groups fine, I'm not complaining about those aspects. Groups will always want shamans for what they can offer, we will never be fully replaced by any other class.<br />
<br />
Any upgrade to healing and nuking helps stackablilty on raids.  Maybe the amounts that you state wouldn't FIX stackablility, but it would have made it better.  <br />
<br />
I do agree we will never be fully replaced by any other class though.</div></div><hr />

I suspected it was sarcasm. That why I started with a 'IF', after all. <br />
<br />
But even then. There is way too many trolls and old fashioned VAK (or is it SAK now?) around throwing that old equine carcass around to give the benefit of the doubt anymore. Worse, to keep bringing it up  ourselves just give them more reason to use it.<br />
<br />
It's a dead cliche. Bury it.<br />
<br />
That said... after the rather thoughtful post by Gardeltron, which brought back up so many good points, you're flattering yourself by thinking that, even with sarcasm, you had a point to make beside a narcissistic attempt at wits barely more subtil than a 'First Post!' claim.<br />
<br />
Now, THAT, you can take that as an unconditionnal flame :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Slowing is a triviality. Mobs aren't hard to slow in most cases.<br />
<br />
Since you believe this to be the case, then what good is a Shaman on a raid?  Buffs are negatable Fo7 is ok but not needed. The rest are worthless.  DoT's are sub par to Necros and if you have a Necro or three on the raid, your DoT's are just taking up space that could be used for real Damage.  We cant Nuke worth a crap, and our heal is on par with that of a Pally who offers more DPS then we do.<br />
<br />
So now who will be included on the 54 slots in GoD events?  3-4 Shaman?  LOL  dream on.</div></div><hr />

I agree with the original poster, SHM lifespan is decreasing rapidly.  Even on the long fights in GoD, our dots wont even land on boss mobs.  When they do, the aggro issue comes into play alot.  I have to sit back and nuke, and that is minimal DPS.  Most of the time I just buff, slow and heal.  Bane is about our best raiding DoT atm on boss mobs, and it is totally not up to DPS par.  If i didnt have Elemental pants, I would never load a disease dot.  Sadly I find that I bust out epic and DoT with it still.<br />
<br />
Our class is dangerously close to becomming extinct for high end content...along the way of MAG and NEC.  Its sad.<br />
<br />
My guildleader was one of the ones called out to SoE for the sitdown and he is taking my comments with him.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, this is what I sent in.  Its my opinion of the End-Game raider.  Sadly I dont think that SoE will care.<br />
<br />
Yes shaman are powerful in the exp group.  Yes we can solo some serious green things, but no where what we could.  We aren't what we were but in an exp group we still do rather better than most.  I still get exp groups whenever I need to.  But I think that over time, the BST will be known for being better than us in exp groups, now that mitigating mobs have made their way into normal exp areas.  Lack of BST is whats helping us the most atm.<br />
<br />
Raiding, however is entirely a different ballgame.  If you arent doing end-game content, you may not understand.  I only took note primarily of GoD raiding in my post.<br />
<br />
Here it is-----<br />
<br />
<br />
Naz, <br />
<br />
Some things I would like you to take with you on your trip to SoE: <br />
<br />
General things: <br />
<br />
1-Weapon Itemization for Priest classes in General is not very good. Two of the three top items are still in PoTime: Shm/Clr class weapon and Hammer of Hours. Since Druids get no class weapon, they also yearn for the HoH. The only one in GoD so far worth the effort is Illuminated Hammer, which comes from a heavily contested spawn (Primals) that most high level guilds dont do, i.e it is off the path of KodTaz to Uqua to Qvic. While I dont expect casters to rotate weapons out with the frequency that melee do, some new items for main hand with appropriate focus effects would be nice. These items should drop on the path that most guilds take through an expansion. Please add GoD spell drops to the higher end zones as randoms. Give us a reason to leave farming the sewers and tipt and vxed and explore zones like Qvic and above in single groups.   At our current level QVIC plus...several INT caster weapons are available, while only the Ill. Hammer is available for us, and its all caster.  <br />
<br />
2-Flagging is getting out of hand. The KodTaz correction was a great step in the right direction, but the flagging system of PoP left so many people behind. People in guilds have lives outside of EQ. They also have guilds that they have been a part of for years. Flagging separates those two. Nothing is worse than not being able to attend a raid because you missed a flag. Individual Flag for access to exp zones or for quests but leave it out of progression for guilds. Build something like guild flags or bring back flag sharing, or guild shared keys. The current system does not allow for people to take a month or two off and be able to come back. Quite often you just sit out until next expansion. Back flagging shouldnt be a requirement, no one likes to do it, and their never seems to be an end to it, given the frequency of player entry and exits into big guilds. <br />
<br />
3-OoW expansion and level increase cap: If you require minimum levels of AAXP for zones or levels, you are making a fatal mistake. I for one will quit outright if this is the case. It is bad enough the problems that new levels bring, it trivializes old content, breaking it badly in some places, and only increases the massive problems you have with class balancing. AAXP has always been a better way of granting separation of those who play massive amounts vs. those who play casually. Gear and AAXP separate the two buy such a huge margin, you dont need super-restrictive level requirements. Not to mention the enivitable problems of finding all your spells. I sometimes think that SoE is oblivious to the fact that there are many lvl 65 people, who play casually, who never see all their spells. That is unacceptable. PoP has been out for over a year and LVL 65 spells sell for 40-100k plat on our server. Gear and AAXP separation are one thing, spell availability is not. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SHM class things: <br />
<br />
I hold serious concern for the viability of the SHM class for high end raiding in high end guilds. As we continue to see mobs with more DPS, fights geared for less duration, and the increasing amount of slow mitigated mobs, all rolled into raids that are of 54 man nature, SHM seem to be having a more and more difficult time being productive for the raid. What I mean by this is that given a smaller raid, and if I have to start Benching people because we have extras, SHM make a good class to sit, especially if you need more DPS or Healing (which is saying, you always need more DPS and Healing). You dont actually see this yet, but I would be lying to say the desire to participate is less and less with each expansion. <br />
<br />
The high DPS of mobs requires massive healing, something SHM are very limited in doing. We are not considered healers, for the most part not even rampage healers, yet we are a priest class. More than anything this needs to be addressed. The short duration of these fights is counter to our classs way of doing DPS via DoTs. DoT over-agro has been shown to be troublesome at best, lethal at worst. DoTs take too long for GoD fights to be truly useful. The best DoT spell we currently have is Bane, and its recast time limits its use heavily in a multi target fight. Also given the nature of DoTs, its either all or nothing, with no partial damage allowed. This very much makes DoTs not up to par with DDs. <br />
<br />
SHM DD spells are woefully inadequate for raids, our most useful being Spear of Torment. Even with that there are no current Poison based DD focus items outside of ID4. Velium Strike is practically useless to us due to its long casting time, mobs die faster than most two casts of VS. <br />
<br />
Slow mitigating mobs are the worst part. It severely impacts what our class defining ability used to be. Unless SoE can produce numbers that show that even a mitigated mob is still slowed more buy turgurs than buy forlorn deeds or shas revenge, there is no difference now between having a Enc or a BST as your slower, with the exception of getting a substantial addition in DPS from the BST and the ENC. If the mob mitigates to being only 50% slowed, we all slow it the same. I would tell you to get the other classes because of what else they bring to the table. <br />
<br />
<br />
Our current spell selection/path needs to be rethought out: <br />
<br />
1-Slow line: Balance was a nice improvement. Its turgurs + malos. Its fast casting with a shorter duration. It is a great example of the proper tuning for what we need. Thank you. Expand the next one to be one that reduces mitigation one level down, thus returning SHM slow to its proper place, while still allowing for mitigation. <br />
<br />
2-Avatar line: Nice for the ATK boost, but in all high raids, stats are capped for 99% of people due to gear and thus rendered irrelevant. The +ATK benefit to this spell seems to have moved to augments/items or the BST, RNG and SK buffs. People hit their ATK cap nowadays so Avatar is in less and less of a demand. This and stat buffs need to be combined into ideas listed in Stat buffs below. <br />
<br />
3-Focus line: Again nice for the HP upgrade, but more and more spell lines are not stacking with this buff: Cleric Self buff and Int caster shielding. See avatar above for how useful stat increases are. If the spell didnt add HPs, I am pretty sure Id never be asked to cast it. Want to be usefull, make the FoS line HPs and Mana and Endurance Regen. <br />
<br />
4-Stat buff lines: Please, no more stat spells. Everyone is capped. For those who arent we have enough spells already to cover them. We have enough to last us a lifetime. Change this line to useful offensive/defensive modifyin buffs like strikethough, dodge, weapon effects, etc etc etc. Very much along the lines of the Guard and Spell Guard series other classes got. Save some of these modifiers for classes to use as spells instead of dropping them on all the items everywhere. <br />
<br />
5-DoT line: More Bane like spells. Curse counter based. Fast acting and quick casting. Even if I have two load two of them with say a 1min refresh I feel thats more than I currently bring. Unless you fix DoT agro, critical DoTs is not the answer. Disease line is a waste of time and space, 2+ min spells are too long. Remove them please. <br />
<br />
6- DD line: Ice and Poison based are great for us. Only complaint is that its way to long of a casting time. Need a Poison based upgrade more than an Ice one at this point. 6 second cast times are ridiculously too long for such minimal damage. An 8 second cast time 1200 DD Ice nuke does us almost no good in raiding. <br />
<br />
7-Rain DD line: Spells are a joke, remove them. They have never worked as advertised. SHM dont need AE Dmg spells, we arent wizards. <br />
<br />
8-Malos line: AE Malo perhaps? Not out of line given AE Tash and AE Slow are in game. Also add Disease to the entire line. Disease used to be separated due to a disease spell stopping a mob from regenerating. This was addressed long ago so the need for a separate disease based debuff is now really outdated. Diseased base slow has come and gone as a game mechanic. <br />
<br />
9-Healing line: I saved the worst for last. SHM have no group heal whatsoever. It was a mistake to give the regen over time line to CLRs and now DRU and SHM are paying that price. It is truly sad that I have a hotkey for Shaman group heal incoming to cast group replenishment (thats a regen spell btw). Our sustained healing is around half what a druids is. SHM are not considered to be group healers for raids. Not even an option. For the first 50 levels of EQ, SHM are viable healers, on par with DRU but less than CLRs, 50-60 the gap widens but is somewhat acceptable. By the time you hit 65, something we counted on doing or having available to us from beginning, is gone. Now this is due entirely to slow, I know. If a mob can be fully slowed, then I can keep a tank alive easily. But thats for the exp group, not a raid. But guess what, slow has been mitigated and given out to other classes, yet we saw no increasing in healing power at the raid level. Most of EQ raid situations revolve around needing 1/4 to 1/3 of your raid force to be one of two classes, DRU and CLR. We got left out of this, unfairly. We are priests as well. This must be addressed immediately and not in the form of a nerf to DRU and CLR. Let us heal. We want to heal. We dont want to be DRU or CLR but we want to heal. At a minimum give the class group Quiescence. That would help with the AEs and the like. Or better yet give us access to the elixir line. Hardly unbalancing. We also need a % CH upgrade. Try it out at 3500hp base, medium cast time, medium mana cost, AAXP enhanced to allow for crits. Allow us to be rampage healers. Allow Guilds to start raids when CLRs and DRUs are in short supply. I dont want to tell you the huge # of times lack of CLRs and to a lesser extension DRUs, has killed a raid. <br />
<br />
Bottom line is: As a SHM I dont feel I am bringing much to the table these days for raids. I dont want to be useless. But sadly I feel less and less usefull to a raid every expansion as I see my core abilites farmed out to other classes, mitigated, or left behind. <br />

The Shamans Crucible has a very good dedicated post that has been given to Brenlo, and in theory I subscribe to it to help the class grow. <br />
