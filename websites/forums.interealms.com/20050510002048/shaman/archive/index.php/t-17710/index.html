We've had the same pair of characters doing this for about 3-4 months now.  You'd think people would need to sleep no?  Apparently not; a GM told me I was wasting his time by petitioning them...  It's kinda sickening.  In the situation I'm in, where you absolutely cannot get this camp (and the few people who have managed say the bot camping it has trained them to get it back), I think it's a great idea to nerf it :(  People, and GMs, suck..</div></div><hr />

I assume they are from one of those plat selling companies. I have a friend recently got employed by such companies. All he is required to do is to farm plats for 8 hours per day for $5 an hour. He also told me that there are people sitting next to him doing exactly the same thing.</div></div><hr />

Showed up on the flame forums for our server and sure enough I went there to help a friend camp reets and there they were.  Didn't matter to me obviously since I was there for reets but its pretty sickening anyway.  Oh and I'd think most of the people who are actually employed to farm plat would probably have a hard time getting hired even in fast food.</div></div><hr />

Persistent or not, human beings need sleep; bots don't.  On my server, at least (Quellious, by the way - but that it's happening on other servers as well shows how bad it has become), when I say these 'people' have been camping NG 24/7, I mean 24/7, no exaggeration.  Aside from patches and crashes, they're always there.  A 65 enchanter and a 65 cleric, both anon, neither guilded.  A flame on the Quellious boards has mentioned them and the fact that at least one of them was ebayed.  If anything at all is said in ooc, they answer &quot;NG&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny thing is, if you are persistent, eventually you can get their attention. I even got a rez from the cleric one day, after half an hour of asking for one.<br />
<br />
Word from somebody who knows the player is that the fellow actually lives on the proceeds from selling the plat he loots. Which is truly sad to me, because it can't be any fun, and it ruins the game--who the hell wants to WORK at Everquest?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yantis made close to a million dollars last year through his EQ plat, item, and account sales, and various other odds &amp; ends (he owns a few class boards, including monkly business).  I agree that it ruins the game and that it wouldn't be any fun if the proceeds were paying for a 1-room apartment and bread &amp; water.. but a million bucks?  Think less of me if you will, but for a million dollars I'd do it.  Also, let's not place all the blame on the farmers/sellers.  If there were no market for their wares, they'd be out of a job.  The buyers are just as much at fault.</div></div><hr />

I could have sworn they were bots.  Sounds like the same duo (in terms of level, class, non-human-player characteristics, etc.) is on a few servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This is why we don't want to be associated with scumbags like Yantis.  This kind of crap ruins the game.</div></div><hr />

It's a Cleric and Chanter on my server as well - and they act like they don't speak english, only answering the camp check with &quot;guard&quot; (that's what it's called on our server).<br />
<br />
They will ks you without saying a thing, and not respond afterward. I'd be willing to be that it's a bunch of bots.<br />
<br />
Yantis made $1m USD last year?! That's insane. I have to respect the guy for seeing a real business opportunity and running with it... but I wish he wouldn't do it in EQ :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
blakkin and blutang  they where my friends till they pa'd i havent got ahold of them since .... they camp ng  yet they call it &quot;nj&quot;.<br />
<br />
you can send them direct tells saying camp check and they will say in ooc nj i dont know if they areu sing xylo or macroquest but it looks like they will say that  ... btw if you wanna get rid of them train the living **** outa them      :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Obviously, someone has developed a macro/bot that is used with the cleric/enchanter combo, and they've just gone around placing the toons on various servers.<br />
<br />
They all sound like they operate the exact same way, the only variation being the way it responds to a camp check (which, oddly enough, varies from server to server -- NG, pyramid, guard, etc.).<br />
<br />
Agree that it ruins the game.  Would be nice if SOE would actually do something about this.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Lowering the drop rate, if that is the case, would be a rather &quot;hands off&quot; approach, but perhaps it might work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Folks at SOE have no imagination. If I were the GM and noticed bots were 24/7 farming Necrosis (what it's called on Emarr) I'd pop a few bugs that hit like Reparm whenever the bots tried to camp.  When the bots were dead, poof the uber mob and repeat until the Bots gave up.<br />
<br />
Lowering the drop rates at that camp just means the bots will move someplace else and all of us lose out on a nice place to earn some cash (paid for most of Buttercup out of the profits of a 2 week Necrosis farming stint).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">RE Yantis-  I hope people are confusing gross revenue with net profit here.

What happens when they encounter a camped area?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Shamus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Same thing on Stromm. About a month after it went live 3 characters known as the Ting's took over that spot and have NEVER left it since.  That's about 5 months solid on Bugs.  Funny thing is that all the sudden Yantis had millions of plat listed on Players auction then.  <br />
They aren't bot's though because they are nice enough to give clarity and Rezze's for free just to keep people away from them.</div></div><hr />

I agree with Gloriana, the people who run this game have no imagination (some other things they don't have-talent and common sense). <br />
We don't have anyone farming like that in Seb on my server, but there were a pair of PC's perma fishing in Gunthak after LoY went live. They were out there so often, that I honestly thought it was some sort of funky new NPC type thing (they showed up in /who). After all I had just been exploring Torgiran Mines and had an NPC send me a tell in response to a hail. They have been gone for some time now, I just assumed a GM finally came along and gave them the boot.</div></div><hr />

I stay away from and most of our server does, because they respond to competition by trains. As soon as a gm enters the zone they either camp or sit down and stop what they doing.

If you add up all the millions of plat they are selling on all the servers, you can only conclude that there is a plat duping sploit involved.  Probably something to do with the new shared bank space.  Regardless of how you feel about buying items and plat with RL dollars, there can be no doubt that duping can destroy the game economy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ever heard of a mob bomb?<br />
<br />
Get a Shadowknight, a cleric, and a good evacer and round up a couple swarms (bard term for 10-20 mob trains they use for swarm kiting), drag them to the bots, send them a tell letting em' know their time is up and evac out. Good times. Alternately you don't have to send them a tell and could bomb and evac, rinse and repeat until they get a clue.<br />
<br />
I'm sure if people started making it tough for perma pp farmers to operate that eventually they would stop. Use this knowledge at your own risk of course.</div></div><hr />

If nothing else I could just jump over the side and Fade (overpowered bard, remember). ;)  Sadly, I think those characters were my friends about a year or so ago (before they were ebayed, most likely). <br />
