I hope my post is not inappropriate, but I could not resist the good nature of these forums.  I just hit forty-four on my Troll Shaman and am very interested in getting Stoicism, knowing the difference it can make.  I was wondering if there was any elder Shaman on the Seventh Hammer Server that might be available to assist me in this quest?  As far as I can tell, once I get the Empty Flask from the Pirates, I can easy solo the two sea spirits at my level.  So I need help with the Pirates.  If anyone is willing to assist, I would be ever grateful.  If interested, please email me at niomar@cox.net.  Thanks and stay well!<br />

I wouldn't worry about the pirates. It takes some doing and exploring, but I soloed the whole thing pretty easily at level 44. The hardest part is the drunken pirates for sure, but it's mostly just a matter of patience. You do need to watch out for those wandering guys too... they just hit too hard!</div></div><hr />

Heres a tip; If you are facing the water in Dulak, on the extreme right where the shore meets the pavement there is a small nook.  It appears to be out of the regular pathway of wandering mobs and while there were 2 (I think, its been while) that pathed close, they did not agro while in this spot.  Park the dog near there and just pull the mobs back to that corner.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Maybe I should be more specific as to what water you face, as I jsut remembered that there is water on 2 sides of the zone.  <br />
<br />
When you zone in, follow the wall sharply to the right all the way to the waters edge.  Its right where the pirates spawn; most of the shaman I know that did this quest pulled to there as well.</div></div><hr />

eddiedale posted the tactic I used from the second thread.  A lenghty and verbose post, but his strat worked like a charm.  Got me flask in an evening with good loot and xp for the lvl.  Safe travels....</div></div><hr />

I knew all the strategies, but from what I read, I didn't think I could do the Drunken Pirates part at forty-four.  After reading these replies and receiving an email, I figured it was worth a shot.  So I headed down there, extremely nervous (Invisible and surrounded by con blue KoS mobs).  After about three hours, I have now completed the quest!  Many thanks!<br />

Um looks like to me he has the nature of the quest down, what mobs, what loot, etc....hes asking for assistance of the physical nature, IE can you watch over me and make sure I dont screw up.....which I can understand. If I was on 7th Hammer I would help out bud.</div></div><hr />
