<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's the best way to handle this nightmare.  Disenfecting Aura or Abolish Disease?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get the chardok earring with cure disease.  It's slightly longer cast time than DA, but it will save a spell gem.  BoT goes off so much, you'd have to keep it up almost all the time if you're in any area with the appropriate lizards.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, abolish is overkill, it has a pretty low amount of poison counters.  I think the earring spell is counteract (level 24), you can just keep that one up, it's probably less mana and cast time than DA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CelEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i believe both handle it in one cast... but since my leggings have it as an effect i usually just click them, altough the cast time is pretty long</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">According to Lucy, Bane of Thule puts on 4 disease counters.<br />
<br />
Counteract Disease cures 8 disease counters with a cast time of 4 seconds for 50 mana.<br />
<br />
Disinfecting Aura cures 20 disease counters with a cast time of 6 seconds for 150 mana.<br />
<br />
The Earring of Purity has roughly the same cast time as the spell if I recall correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm shocked to  here DA is so good, because I was in PoN last night and a scourge hobgoblin landed a turgurs on our main tank.  I couldn't cure the slow with DA (tried 3 times) but  Abolish Disease cured it on the first try.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In my experience, pants are worthless for curing bane of thule.  If I do nothing but chain cast my pants I can cure 2.5 melle chars before bot is recast.  I hate bot with passion.  The worst part about the spell is <br />
<br />
a tae ew warder begins to cast a spell<br />
person 1 has been slowed by the bane of thule.<br />
person 2 has been slowed by the bane of thule.<br />
person 3 has been slowed by the bane of thule.<br />
person 4 has been slowed by the bane of thule.<br />
person 5 has been slowed by the bane of thule.<br />
person 6 has been slowed by the bane of thule.<br />
melle_00 tells the group, slowed.<br />
melle_01 tells the group, bane of thule on me.<br />
melle_02 tells teh group, im slowed!<br />
You tell the group, you dont say?<br />
<br />
Man I hate that spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chardok earring (earring of purity) is 5 second cast time, but no recast.  So I guess it'd be the fastest one, if you have multiple people to cure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bane of Thule really sucks since they made it unresistable.<br />
<br />
Our Radiant Cure AA will cure it once in a fight. Casting single target cures does not seem worthwhile unless your group is able to prevent the shaman lizard from just re-casting it 20 seconds later. Velious legs are too slow to be effective.<br />
<br />
The best answer to Bane of Thule is to have an enchanter chainstun all Cazic Thule shaman mobs (except the 55+ unstunnable ones). Clerics also get a group heal/disease cure spell that will remove it from the whole group at once (Word of Restoration, I believe). This spell does eat up a lot of cleric mana,  though.<br />
<br />
When we fight a level 55+ unstunnable Shaman lizard, we sometimes just have to endure Bane of Thule for much of the fight.<br />
<br />
With a combination of chain stun, Radiant Cure, and Word of Restoration, you can mostly neutralize Bane of Thule, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">its not completely unresistable heh.<br />

<br />
;)<br />
<br />
chain stun and burn it down.<br />
use pants or RC to cure it after heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's definitely resistable just not easy. Check lucy http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2133&amp;source=Live<br />
Neg 300 resist modifier means you need to be at probably 400+ dr to resist it reasonably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tanilin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I always used Counteract Disease (best disease cure clerics have at the time), with a 15% haste ring (dropping casting time to 3.5 seconds), and using an insta click to refresh my spell gems so I could chain cast it.<br />
<br />
Doing it that way, I could keep 3 -4 melees unslowed (main tank unslowed continously, others with some loss in effectiveness since it took me time to get to them).<br />
<br />
The best way to kill these is indeed to burn them down -- but chaining counteract disease works too.</div></div><hr />
