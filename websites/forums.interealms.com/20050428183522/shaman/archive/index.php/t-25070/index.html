<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was a little shocked and dissapointed to open my signed CE game manual and to read that that one can be a Dwarven Mage. Ugh. There must have been printed like two months ago at least. I know it does not make or break anything but they should have at least printed this last to keep it up to date.<br />
<br />
I also got the collector's edition  strategy guide. That's the guide that comes with a 3 ring binder that has the alliance or horde logo on it. I recommend THAT one for sure. The maps are very cool and it has useful info on skills like certain zones say what they are abundant in like say copper and silverleaf etc. <br />
It also has a list of cool items and it let's you compare where you stand. Strategies for PVP and pve survival are included for every class and for PVP they are vs each specific class. I.e. If shaman vs warrior do this and this but by no means do that etc. <br />
<br />
Also it has comics included in it which are hillarious. I believe they are from Penny Arcade.<br />
<br />
The coolest thing about the collector's edition guide is that you can download updates from bradygames like maps and quests etc etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
For all those of us that would rather not alt-tab out of the game this is a MUST.<br />

Good Night everyone<br />
