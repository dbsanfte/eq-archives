<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ya I was wondering Is there golden BS earings 2ac 25hp 35 mana? or is it just 2ac 35 hp 25 mana is best you can get?<br />
<br />
Also I was wondering 2 6ac 65hp rings or 1shadel bandit ring and 1 wedding ring from ToFS wedding room (5th floor i think?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">35hp and 25 mana only on the player made ones. The earrings that drop in Chardok are 35hp and 35 mana tho. Earring of Twisted Leaves and Earring of Purity are shaman wearable.<br />
<br />
The ac/hp on the rings is your call, the shadel rings are very popular. Personally I like a pair of 6/65 but I'm a HP freak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are 2 player made BS earrings. Electrum is 2ac 35hps 25 mana. Gold is 0ac 25hps 35 mana. As was mentioned there are 3 chardok earrings that are all 2aac 1 wis 35hps mana. Earring of twisted leaves is the easiest to get and casts scale of the wolf. The other 2 are a bit harder to get and cast cure poison or cure disease.</div></div><hr />
