<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok dunno why I spent 7k on alchemy, other then I am just dumb, but I have a question.  Another shammy was telling me he has a skill of 156 and makes the everfrost gate potion failing once out of 10 trys, is he pulling my leg , really lucky or is he just BSing me?<br />

PS my alchemy is now 160 )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's possible that he did that at his skill level, but I dont think he does it regularly. He probably hasnt made very many. Even if they were trivial at 156 (which they arent), you will still fail on trivial items 5% of the time. That's roughly 1 in 20 times you can expect a failure. <br />
<br />
I'm 15 for 15 of Everfrost potions and 1 for 1 on Innothule potions since I hit 180 alchemy. But I fully expect to fail sometimes, no matter what the skill. <br />
<br />
Tradeskills can be very streaky and failures on trivial items can be at times plain ignorant. I had a 50% failure rate making frost tempers the other day, and they were trivial for my brewing skill. Failed 1 out of 4 on blue diamond powder, also trivial for my pottery skill. Spirit of Wolf potions trivial at 30-something skill, yet you know those still fail sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Remember that the minimum failure rate (of 5%) doesn't apply until you get significantly more skill than the trivial level of whatever you are trying to make.<br />
<br />
For SoW potions, this skill seems to be around 70 (but trivial is 37).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">According to this thread (http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerfrm13.showMessage?topicID=1242.topic) on the EQ Traders forum, there is a possible formula for predicting the average rate of successes:<br />
<br />
Success rate = (1.15*Skill) - (Trivial - 70)<br />
<br />
So to use the current example, a gate potion at a skill of 156, you could expect an average success rate of (1.15*156)-(170-70), or 79%.  <br />
<br />
There is still a lot of speculation regarding this, but so far I have yet to see anyone produce results from a sufficiently large set of data to refute it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hm....according to that formula my success rate with teleport potions is 107%, and Spirit of Wolf would be 240%. (180 skill).<br />
<br />
I was 40 for 41 on SoW potions last time I made any. :p<br />
<br />
What that formula needs is an annotation that if the result is &gt; 95, then the result is automatically lowered to 95. ;)</div></div><hr />
