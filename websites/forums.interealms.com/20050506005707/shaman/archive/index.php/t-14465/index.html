<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just bought a Drogmor last night and was looking forward to the constant mana regen and no more sitting aggro. I am running eq with the Luclin models turned off (all of them), and I am pretty sure I've heard that it should be possible to use a mount regardless. <br />
<br />
It is possible to summon the lizard, but it's impossible to move around when it is summoned. When I look at myself in 3rd person view it looks like I'm hanging in the air on my mount (which gets a human model since horse models are turned off :) ) in a 45 degree angle. <br />
<br />
Does anyone else have this problem? Do I have to turn on the models for horses and Barbarians to be able to use my Drogmor? This really slows down my system, so I'd prefer not to, but obviously I really want to be able to use the lizard...</div></div><hr />

<br />
There used to be a bug where you could summon mount with old models but that has been fixed. To use your mount you must have the model for your character turned on (Barb male or female whichever you play).<br />
I am not certain if you need horse models on to use a drogmor, you would have to experiment with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This was patched a while back. to answer your question, yes you have to have new models enabled for whatever race you are, and horse models turned on.<br />
<br />
I suspect it's a bug that it even lets you summon the drogmor - if you try with a horse you get an error message saying you need to turn the models on.<br />
<br />
IMHO this is one of the few bad changes made to EQ recently - gameplay shouldn't be dictated by PC specs - they should have made it so that horses with no models behaved the same as with models on.<br />
<br />
I find I dont use my horse much these days anyway - it really encourages the &quot;PoP style&quot; of play - ie sit in one spot for 4 hours while the puller brings constant mobs one at a time. Which is very efficient for xp but not as much fun as a good dungeon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks a lot for the answers guys :) I guess I have to consider getting a new PC, I was hoping I could wait for another six months or so, but luclin models &gt; my current PC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I summoned my drogmar the other night and on my wife's computer she was a leather-wearing human female.  Boy, I got in trouble.<br />
<br />
&quot;But honey, she's SUPPOSED to be a lizard!&quot;</div></div><hr />
