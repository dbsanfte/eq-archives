Of course like someone said above the parts for it will be off a mob that spawns on the third day of the fith moon at precisly 6 oclock.

I would disagree with that.  I think they paralleled EQ Shaman with the Native American Shaman lore in some ways.  I don't think it is all that bad.  People have been screaming for Epic upgrades for some time now.  Well here they are along with yet another incomplete expansion.</div></div><hr />

EW_2.0_SHAMAN_solo.jpg.  The other classes had the word solo in the title also.  Now read the description from the new expansion site:<br />
<br />
		<br />
			The quests will be a combination of solo, group and raid content.													<br />
	<br />
<br />
/begin wishful thinking.  The epic 2.0's will be progressive.  Complete the solo section and get the fiirst staff, complete the group section and get a 2nd staff, and then get the final reward with raiding.  I would love to see some challenging solo content(yeah, I know, go play a single player RPG, but I would really like something to work on when my friends are offline), as well as some group content a bit more varried than slaughter x mobs in y amount of time.  Please SoE, let the epic 2.0 fill my wishes.<br />
<br />
Bah, in all likelyhood, the epic 2.0's will require a fully GoD endgame equipped raiding force just to start them.</div></div><hr />

Edit:  Bren...since this will be the &quot;2.0&quot; and completely separate, do you think new Shaman will have to get SoF before being able to quest this one?  Not that is makes a huge difference, but 2.0 would have to be pretty bad ass to replace the Time piece IMO if SOE would actually have the gumption to call it &quot;Epic&quot;, but thats just me :P<br />

<br />
I don't think it's very nice looking at all :( especially considering the other three examples with their intricate looking design and gorgeous particle effects. <br />
<br />
Remember all those necro jokes about Duck Head on a stick? I think it's a little weird that Vah Shir shaman would have to carry around a cat head on a stick. And please...can you think of the possibilities of all the *ahem* &quot;puss-&quot; jokes we'd have to endure?<br />
<br />
I hope it's still in the concept stage and they can work on it a bit more, right now...as a fashion conscious shaman, it's a big fashion don't. It's stumpy and I just can't help comparing it to the Spear of Fate which was arguably the most beautiful of all the 1.0 epics.<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to whatever cool graphic ideas (animations!!) the developers come up with :)<br />

Like Gloriana said, the other three epic arts are these beautiful, intricate staffs and then you get to our...thing... It sticks out like a sore thumb, literally.  I really hope they rethink that graphic and make it nice-looking like the others are.  It's like they put so much thought into the designs of the others then just shlopped something together for ours.  It could be so much better.</div></div><hr />

Great to see that you're still checking up on us and are as sharp as ever (hilarious).  Once again Brenlo only posts when something strikes a nerve, never proactively to keep us informed or give us updates.  That is the classic definition of poor customer service, wait until the customer is pissed before you attempt to service them.<br />
<br />
I think the SOE developers have been spending too much time in the WOW beta and now want to make Shaman into witch doctors.  True, that has been part of our class definition, but they always gave us more of a fighting cleric look (magic spear), vs. the animalistic, tribal look (lionhead).  Not a direction I really want to go in, if I did, I'd just play WOW.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but it's very hard to get excited about yet another expansion.  Unfortunately, I will probably never see epic 2.0 or any of the new zones, just lost interest.<br />

I completely and wholly disagree with you when you say it's neat. That ... thing ... is awful. Perfectly awful. Our current Spears are great ... simple design, and a neat particle effect. Expand on this, please. If you guys (meaning the designers) want beads and &quot;witch-doctory&quot;-type things, Light above, do you have to do it while offending the Vah Shir? What Vah Shir would proudly wield this? Our first epics revolved around Spirit wolves ... well, I meant our Epic 1.0. Why would we all of a sudden start walking around with lion heads on our sticks? Anyway ... if you want beads and &quot;witch-doctory&quot;-type things, keep it simple. I don't want to worry about whapping myself in the face with a lion head every time I canni.<br />
<br />
P.S. Brenlo please stop giving the designers ideas about making this thing growl every time we attack a mob. Please. I like tanking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Seriously guys, I really like the design... Its got that shamanistic primitive totem like feel to it... try putting down the porn and picking up a National Geographic sometime. It's reminescent of tribal masks. And why wouldn't a Vah shir want to walk around with a sculpted lion head club, seriously, have you seen their lion head shields ? Lion head decorations in Shar Vahl, Or their lion head King ? (SIMBA, I AM YOUR FATHER).  <br />
<br />
The one problem I do see is the fact that you just know everyone is going to refer to it as &quot;THE toilet brush&quot;..... But that problem is with the people, not the graphics.<br />
<br />
Besides, as much as I liked the old spear, it's been sitting in the bank for months now. It would be nice to have something that doesn't look like an Sk club to wield... And it really IS going to have to be pretty dam usefull to make someone want to use it over Time's Antethesis... Not just a pretty graphic with a lot of hp... a click effect at least equivalent (preferably better) or the effort put into the design is wasted, which will just frustrate people even more.</div></div><hr />

I'm just wondering when Shaman get to dual wield, or is the new epic intended for some slot other than primary/secondary? And if so, wouldn't the particle effect be pointless then?<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">You lost me, Wastrel, what do you mean by dual wield? Looking at it, I'm not quite sure how a shaman will hold it (right under the head?), but it's surely a primary hand item, don't you think?<br />
<br />
On further reflection, although I am still opposed to the general idea of &quot;animal head on a stick&quot; I really don't like the idea of a cat head on a stick.<br />
<br />
1. Vah Shirs shouldn't have to carry around cat heads<br />
2. The terrible jokes that we will have to endure<br />
3. Spirit of the Cat was never a huge buff for us<br />
4. Why a cat? What does that have to do with being a shaman?<br />
<br />
If we are going to go down the &quot;head on a stick&quot; route, I would much prefer Wolf (Spirit of the Wolf was so significant to many of us at level 9 and of course, our wolf pets are important) or Bear (bear form). Oooh, or give us a new spell that does something really cool with OoW and call it Spirit of the Hawk (something new and really cool!!) and give us a Hawk's head? <br />
<br />
Other spells that I would not like to see incorporated into this idea:<br />
<br />
Spirit of the Monkey<br />
Spirit of the Boar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">And why wouldn't a Vah shir want to walk around with a sculpted lion head club, seriously, have you seen their lion head shields ? Lion head decorations in Shar Vahl, Or their lion head King?<br />
<br />
Yes, I've seen the lion head shields ... one of my druid friends has a Shield of Bane Warding. I've also seen the lion head decorations in Shar Vahl, and the lion head King ... but those are, to me (roleplay wise, of course) symbols of pride in one's people and one's king. <br />
<br />
Why wouldn't a Vah Shir want to walk around with a sculpted Lion head club? Consider that, in order to make the thing, someone would have had to decapitate one of their kin and attach the body's head with some beads to a stick. Would you want to walk around with a hollowed human head on a stick, skin, hair and all? I hope not.<br />
<br />
I don't know. I don't like the design. If they're looking to resemble tribal war masks, I would say there are better ways to do it. One of the reasons I like our &quot;Epic 1.0&quot; is the simplicity of the design and the fact that it is, indeed, a weapon. Glori had some really great suggestions. Shaman and wolves -- at least, the wolves from the Spirit Realm -- go hand-in-hand. We summon our companions, and they trot dutifully at our sides. Why should our &quot;Epic 2.0&quot; not reflect that companionship, that link to the otherworld in which they reside and with which we, as shaman, can communicate?<br />

All kidding aside, I think it should be a back or shoulder slot item that is like what Native American shaman have.  Sticks up, a little over head height with feathers, beads and other hanging shamanistic things.<br />
<br />
To be honest, if our Epic 2.0 is another weapon, it'd have to be a really good one because I don't foresee myself replacing my epic any time soon.  Also, Monks have an epic than can be used in the hands or the primary slot, why doesn't SOE let the Epic 2.0 for other classes use a different slot too so we can still keep our original epic visible along with our new one.

I'd love the idea of a shoulder item that would look like a wolf's pelt draped across our shoulders. I think it was Vigdis who linked a site of her friend's artwork (wonderful stuff, BTW) awhile back, and one of the pictures she made was of a shaman, his hands in the air conjuring a wolf from the spirit realm ... across his shoulders was slung a wolf's pelt.<br />

Wholeheartedly agree! I think someone mentioned here in this thread how replacing the Time's Antithesis would be difficult as well unless the &quot;Epic 2.0&quot; is a damn good item. But I love our &quot;Epic 1.0&quot; look ... simple and functional.<br />

<br />

Seriously, not bashing something that is still in a conceptualization phase, I just hope the devs don't think it would be cool to have the new epic proc spirit call pets, it may look cool for a month, but spirit call damage is sad( having it right click the level 61 pet may work, at least then the pet will be worth the mana it cost to summon)  :D <br />

Epic 2.0 LOOKS GREAT!!!! It has a very spiritulistic look to it.<br />

Disregard the idiots &quot; Hey if it has a vah shir head it means a vah shir was killed and head put on stick as a model&quot; ( I guess Picasso and Monet one of the biggest serial killers around then, ohh and also that charles shcultz character :P) <br />
<br />
IMHO Epic 1.0 looks weak little dangly spear looks like a glorified REIF. Shaman are TRIBAL. Should it be a polar bear head on end of staff ? maybe... i can see the validity of that argument. ATM Im using Sharkspine and would LOVE the TA (graphic, effect, and weapon stats on TA AWSOME) I really hope it doesnt go in primary slot so when can use it till end game and see the graphic. Secondary slot would be perfect for this becuse i doubt making primarys better then TAs that can be quested makes much sense.<br />

  Something like this would be easily replaced in the next expansion or even just the end of the current one.  250hp isn't terribly higher than the norm right now, and while 100ac is quite a lot, many people give up quite a bit of AC for more hp because of the apparent softcap (and it probably wouldn't take long for the other weapons to go high AC for the specific goal of replacing epics).  It would remain bagged for the shrink though.<br />
<br />
  Personally I think that the epics need to go a completely different direction than conventional weaponry.  Like for the melee oriented, have the epic do COMPLETELY magical damage.  That means each and every hit can be resisted fully or partially, but you are able to totally avoid the AC of a mob.  For casters, make the epics provide a functionality that goes beyond normal gear.  Either it gives you double attack/dual wield mods to the point that you are able to melee, or it gives you a couple dozen focus effects rolled into 1 item (and not mid level focus, but top end.  ie - not IH4, but rather an enhanced Marr's Gift)</div></div><hr />

It was fairly simple, but that was part of its charm to me.  Straightforward, but with a little bit of flair.  The epic has huge sentimental value to me, and that means is graphic does too.  I'm not looking forward to losing it.  Wouldn't kill me, but it would be a bit of a disappointment.<br />
<br />
I can't say carrying around a dead cat's head on a stick is helping much.  It's not like my ogre isn't smelly enough in the first place.

ok.. this may have been said before, and if it has then sorry :)<br />

what about an UPGRADEABLE epic.. with an expansion that breaks previous expansion's hp limits.. comes a new quest to upgrade the epic, maybe adding some hp/stats, adding an extra aug slot.. anything to keep it up to date.<br />
<br />
and it WILL be outdated with even one more expansion after OoW if its not upgradeable.. just look at the rate that items are getting more HP.. in luclin we had a max of 125 hp on items.. now theres 250+?.. whats in OoW, 800 hp items? epics shouldnt be only kept for the clicky.. they should be actively used for a long time because they SHOULD BE THAT GOOD.</div></div><hr />

Of all the ideas I have heard so far the one about the shield that looks like a dreamcatcher is what I like best. Even back in the days of Velious by the time you were high enough level to get the shield of falsehood you could get much better items easier.<br />

Minor rant, sorry if I've violated any Crucible rules for being &quot;rude&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Tolann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Wouldn't it be cool if each race had their own epic version? Something that in basic design is the same for all, but yet some feature that is unique for each race, or Diety? <br />
<br />
My thoughts too.   just looking at the somewhat defination of a shaman the shaman is supposed to have a totem or inner spirit that he draws power from.   Totems could come in many forms such as bear, wolf, raven, any living thing that the shaman feels a tie to.   Having a &quot;totem epic&quot; that would vary depending on your race and diety would be awesome.  Example:<br />
Celtic Shaman Animal Allies (http://www.joellessacredgrove.com/Celtic/animalallies.html) <br />
<br />
As far as a graphic, I think something like a large staff may be more acceptable to many.  I really don't care for the baseball bat concept, but I like what they're trying to do with the concept.   I  have the idea in my head of an Elder Witch Doctor/Spirit Walker chanting, casting spells and mixing potions.   Not a club swinging cave dweller.<br />
<br />
As far as an effect to click, the new slow wouldn't be a bad choice and add a mod to make it (and all other duration spells)  last about 10 times longer so the old slow and maybe even a TA &lt;cries&gt; might be bagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Ghobster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">i personally like the new graphic.<br />
i really was not impressed with the rainbow glow on the spear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">I say give us a shield that looks like a dream catcher.  Give it a prismatic radiation effect like our SoF with blowing feathers every time we cast a spell.  As a shield we could use it side by side with the SoF that most us us seem to like.<br />
<br />
It IS the symbol SOE decided to use for us in the inventory screen.<br />
<br />
/agree wholeheartedly - this is a really good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">I heard u have to do a failable combine with your epic spear as part of epic 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Muahaahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">i think that the epic shown is the solo part of the quest cos it does state<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and my logic behind this is that when yu open the picture link its called<br />
<br />
EW_2.0_SHAMAN_solo.jpg<br />
<br />
so maybe it is just part one<br />
<br />
I was thinking the same thing. I read this from the OoW website.<br />
<br />
Epic Weapons: <br />
Epic weapons are a result of completing an &quot;epic quest.&quot; These hand-tailored quests will be available to all classes. The quest themselves will be a combination of solo, group and raid content. However, these weapons are being designed for people at the upper end of the level spectrum<br />
<br />
Now I read two things into this. Firstly they say that it will be solo, group, and raid content. I think that the image we have been shown is for the solo part and will change as you do the group and raid parts. <br />
<br />
I also think that they might instance a dungeon for you to solo, so that you have to solo it to prove your worth. Unless they instance it, you would have the ability to get help from friends.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see an instanced dungeon, that strips your buffs as you enter, and you have to rely on your own spells and skills to complete. It would have to be balanced so that it's not too difficult for a casual bazaar player to complete but challenging enough for a time geared Shaman to complete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AAAAAAAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Hrm.. I'm not so sure.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that it will be one increadibly long quest, rather than three seperate, broken up quests.  My rational for this is thus:  How many quests are in existance that are broken up into segments that give usable items?  I can think of some, I'm sure you can too.<br />
<br />
Now, how many of those quests have mini-rewards that will be viable equipment for &quot;people at the upper end of the level spectrum?&quot;  I can't think of alot.<br />
<br />
If EQ has proved nothing else, it's that it loves repition.<br />

<br />
Sorry, little joke on my part.  :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, from the images I saw, I'd say we can expect a bunch of 2 handed weapons for epic 2.0.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would enjoy it more if epic 2.0 wasn't a weapon.  For example, all casters would probably appreciate a epic that was secondary, and I'm sure that rangers would like a bow epic.  Tanks could surely use a ranged item for their epic, or a armor epic, like monks.  Monks probably wouldn't mind another glove epic, though I'm not sure.  :)<br />
<br />
Why not think outside the box?  Or better yet, have a NPC that will turn your epic 2.0 from a weapon into a secondary/ranged/armor item?  One time usable, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">after reading what meglo said, i just thought.<br />
An NPC that puts a big leather strap on yur trusty ole SoF so yu can wear it in yur back slot.<br />
<br />
i think that'd be rather cool, if yu could run around with yur spear strapped to yur back! (plus ppl being able to SEE yur spear strapped to yur back rather than the pretend see thru capes we got)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">not too difficult for a casual bazaar player to complete but challenging enough for a time geared Shaman to complete.What?  Do you understand the difference between a Time geared shaman and a bazaar geared one?  About 3000hp(unbuffed and that's being real nice).  The differences between the two geared Shaman would be astronomical and attempting to balance this content would just result in a lot of pissed off, non-Time geared Shamans, since Sony always develops content on idea that they can tone it down if they need to.<br />
<br />
No, let the Time geared Shaman walk through it and balance it for the bazaar player.  They've still got the group and raid encounters to complete, so they're going to need others eventually, Time-geared or not.<br />
<br />
My guess is that by solo content, they mean foraging for crap and running around all over the place to pick garbage up off the ground for hours, kinda like the beginning of the Druid epic.  Even though your idea is a REALLY good one, I don't think Sony can pull it off in the time they have to complete it.</div></div><hr />

Good point, I hadn't thought it through enough before posting ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u116"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p116">I think I'd rather have Ceno's version than Sony's.  A girl needs something to do on those long raid nights  :p <br />
<br />
Seriously, though, one thing I'd love to say to Sony (since Brenlo's listening! woot!)  - I really, really, REALLY do not care about graphics overall.  Gameplay is more important.  So if Epic 2.0 is fun and reasonable to obtain and it gives me good stat increases, it could look like a piece of dog poo and I'd carry it.  :) <br />
<br />
Speaking of graphics in general...why does Sony keep &quot;upgrading&quot; the game's graphics to where a lot of my friends with older PCs can't play?  My friends just cancel their subscriptions (after trying to hang and buying more memory and better graphics cards several times over the last 4 years!)  and it makes me less likely to tell more people to come play with me - and I have personally gotten over a dozen of my friends to start playing and they mostly have multiple accounts.  I don't get why Sony's concentrating on graphics when the comments I see on here and from my friends about games they may switch to, such as City of Heroes, all have to do with gameplay and not how leet their graphics are.  It doesn't seem to make sense from a business standpoint to go down a road that loses you subscribers, so I am truly baffled as to the direction EQ has taken the last couple years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">I didnt like it the first time I looked at it, reminded me more of a BL type weapon, but then I started thinking 'shaman' and 'primalistic' and it seemed like a better fit.  They could always give this one to BL and develop another for us, but I think it looks great, should be used somewhere.<br />
<br />
Glad they are finally upgrading epics, as suggested already, would be nice if epics were upgraded ongoing with each new expansion, maybe like the Charm and LDoN charm augment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">Ok my photoshop skillz suck but this is closer to a bear.<br />
<br />
Elongated the nose and made it just a little fatter... more bear like?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">Actually, looking at those photos, I think it is supposed to be a bear, just not a very well designed one.  <br />
<br />
http://images.google.com/images?q=lion&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi <br />
<br />
A lion's mane is much farther forward and its nose is more of an inverted triangle.  Lions also have round ears like a bear and a somewhat wider nose bridge in preportion to their face, making thier eyes appear to sit farther back on their face.<br />
<br />
Either way, its a bad bear or a bad lion or somebody was looking at their house cat!</div></div><hr />

They already stated that you wont need 1.0 to even do it i believe. Mind is a lil rusty ATM, but im positive i read it on the EQLive forums or something. It was either that or it wont involve 1.0</div></div><hr />
