<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ahmaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I read on the boards that QB makes the spell cast time of torpor go down. Before spending points in this AA I was hoping that somebody could confirm that it has the same effect on quiescence also. <br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yup, I have QB3 and a 3 second Quies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep Quickbuff will decrease the cast time.<br />
<br />
However there is a cap on spell haste of 50%.<br />
<br />
So Quickbuff(3) = 50% faster = 3 second cast time for Torpor/Q.<br />
<br />
If, like me, you have a spell haste item, then QB(2) + item might put you at 50% or over.<br />
<br />
Pretty easy to pick up a Wicked Bone Atlatl (20% Benefical spell haste) as well (costs around 10k-ish). Saves you getting those last 6 AA for QB(3). Unless you got an uber range item already.</div></div><hr />

To get a 50% faster Torpor/Q you need QB3 don't you? I have enhancement haste 3 on my ring of shissar and the ring does not activate with torpor. Enhancement haste different from Beneficial Spell Haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also incredibly annoying issue that I've bugged at least 20 times, if you hit can5, then immediately hit Q (3.0 second), you'll get a &quot;spell recovery not yet met&quot;, every damn time.

<br />
Enhancement haste wont work with Torpor/Q as it only effects spells with Min Duration 72 seconds. :(<br />
<br />
Beneficial and General spell haste have no such limitation.<br />
Hence 20% Beneficial Spell Haste + QB(2) = 50% faster torpor.<br />
<br />
My 30% Beneficial Spell Haste legs and QB(1) already give me 3.6 second Queisance.</div></div><hr />

I thought the min 72 second limitation applied to all focus items, but did not apply to AA's.  Guess not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">All focus effects are different.  Some of them, like Enhancement Haste 4, only work on spells with a minimum duration for 72 seconds.  The 8th shawl effect, Zephyr of Brell, only extends buffs that last over 48 seconds to begin with.  Since Q and torpor have a 24 second base duration, neither enhancement haste or extended enhancement will work with it to make it better.<br />
<br />
There are some focus effects, though, that will work with it.  Haste of Mithaniel (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3531&amp;source=Live) does not have a minimum duration.  It works an all beneficial spells and gives you 20% spell haste.  Thus, it works for quiesence.  QB2 + Haste of Mithaniel will give you a 45% haste, which really is good enough - with blessing of reverence you would hit the cap.  A lot of people opt to just stop at QB2 and not spend the whopping 9aa to get constant 50% haste for quiescence, which for most is a perfectly good decision.  However, the only easily attainable spell haste items go in your range or shoulder slot, and I have excellent items in both of those places that I am not willing to give up.  For that reason, I decided to just spend the 9aa and get QB3, and I am very happy with my decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bluntgone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i can say for a fact with quickbuff 2 my cast time on quiesence is 4.5,<br />
with quickbuff 2 and wicked bone atlatl it is 3.3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And invis is 2.8 seconds, which is a noticeable help those times we are relying on invis, erratic as it is.  <br />
<br />
Even just ordinary buffing is nicer when it's twice as fast.  <br />
<br />
QB is actually one of the better AA in my opinion.  You feel its impact in a lot of situations, not just a 3 second torpor (which is worth the cost alone).<br />
<br />
I have SCM3 and for the life of me I don't notice any difference whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To avoid this and to use Canni V more effectly, I cast Canni IV to get to 90% health &gt; Cast Quiesence &gt; Cast Canni V.  <br />
<br />
This allows me to Canni V in the heat of battle without worrying about being able to channel a heal or getting low health aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have a spell haste III item and an affliction haste III item.   They stack which allows me to cast ancient scourge of nife and bane of nife in 3.4 seconds..  helps a lot in PvP.   Instead of eating 2 nukes from a wizzy just to cast one dot I only have to eat one and run.  Rinse and repeat.  :p</div></div><hr />

They don't stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes they do, whether or not they're supposed to or not I dunno..  but they do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:   I know what it is..   I had gotten my hand of the master before my bracelet of the sky.    With just the hand of the master casting time is 4.2 instead of 5.0.   Withe the bracelet it drops to 3.4.   I never bothered to check to see what the casting time with only the bracelet on was...    still not too bad of a combo for the non umber such as myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">How much you want to spend on QB really depends on item availability, and how desperate you are. A haste of mithaniel + QB2 takes torpor down to (as mentioned) 3.3 seconds...if that third of a second is really important to you, or you get AA like a whirlwind, then spend the extra 9 for QB3.<br />
<br />
BUT!<br />
<br />
If you have elemental access and can get a SPEED of mithaniel item (which is faster than haste of mithaniel), then QB3 becomes ludicriously silly to get, since the speed of mithaniel + QB2 will already put you over the 50% cap. Being an elemental item, you are less likely to be sacrificing other stats to wear it.<br />
<br />
Or, if you are like me, and have managed (including the 7 free AA from the PoP reward) to only obtain 42 AA despite being 60th before SoL came out (a whopping rate of 2.2 points a month) then spending 9 on a third of a second of torpor is clearly totally out of the question. I enjoy my cog encrusted epaulets, and likely will never find anything better (even disregarding the focus) to put there. QB2 is as high as I will ever get.</div></div><hr />

They don't stack, the better focus effect takes precedence.  Since the affliction haste on the bracelet of the sky is a savings of 33%:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2362&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
you would notice a significant savings over the spell haste III on your hand of the master which only shaves 15% off the casting time:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2341&amp;source=Live <br />
<br />
Focus items never stack with focus items (for example Mana Preservation III with Preservation of Xegony) but focus items CAN stack with AA (for example Quickbuff + Speed of Mithaniel or Mana Preservation + SCM).  Focus items can also stack with AA AND spells, for example the cleric spell haste stacks with Quickbuff and focus spell haste.<br />
<br />
I also have a spell haste III item (Essence Lens) and Affliction Haste III (bracelet of the sky) and I've never seen both items &quot;activate&quot; for the same spell cast.  I also have a Mana Preservation III item (Sky Watcher's Monocle) and an Affliction Efficiency III item (boots of the dead dream) so I've had a lot of opportunity to observe how focus items interact: the better focus item always takes precedence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There is a question that comes to mind... <br />
<br />
If you have quickbuff 3 = 3 second torpor/quiesc.<br />
<br />
then add say haste of druzzil focus which seems to haste spells to speeds less than 3 (ex 2.5)  Do you get a 2.5 second torpor/quiesc or is it Capped at 50 percent All effects and aa's included ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">No, 50% is max savings for spell haste, so the lowest you can get Torpor/Q is 3.0 seconds.</div></div><hr />
