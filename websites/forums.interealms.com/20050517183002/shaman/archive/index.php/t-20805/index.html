<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Srab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well guys tonight I was on an Agnarr raid, got all the way up to the big boy himself, had just finished killing off all his guards when the LD demon strikes.  I was finally able to get back on about 5-10 minutes later and I was dead, group mate said I ran right at Agnarr guns a blazing.  Well I asked if I was too late for the flag, and was told yes I had missed my chance.  So I sent a quick tell to the only guide on my server at the time, name is Cyanne.  I asked if that was something that could be petitioned to get...most likely no was the response, but then I was told by the same group mate that Karanna was still up.  Long story short this Guide actually helped me out and summoned me up to where the dwindling remainder of the raid was, luckily I managed to get my flag.  So I would like to send out a warm and heart felt thanks to that Guide.  I also believe if we get more guides like that then maybe EQ could take a turn for the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/agree, kudos to Cyanne.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It boils down to SOE recognizing that GM's are not always on/available, and empowering guides a little more to assit with non-major issues.  No, a guide should not be able to restore your epic if you delete it.  However, they should be allowed/given the ability to handle most problems that occur with the game that are not legitimate/reported bugs that that require some investigation into programming errors, etc.<br />
<br />
Give them a few more tools.  Treat them (both SOE and us) with some respect, and maybe people would actually start volunteering to be a guide again.  A couple of years ago, guides, and being a guide was a great thing.  They were slowly chipped away, drained of their utility, and beat down to obscurity.  Most of the good ones left.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if SOE brought back some of the old guide spirit and corps that once existed in an effort to restore some CS in this game.<br />

just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's terrific. Grats on both the flag, and on finding a Guide who was willing and able to assist. Few more like him, and the SoE CS suxors posts, might become a memory again.<br />
<br />
Though I'm sure there will be the occassional rant about how Guide_01 refused to PL me to 65 and give me Quarm lewtz! :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congrats on the flag but he will be fired for doing it.<br />
<br />
I don't know that but given SOE's usual response that seems likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">They are phasing out the guides. They are not allowed to do anything anymore.<br />
Grats on the flag:-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good story to hear.  Another guide helped my guild in a similar situation, but a much wider scale.  Ive also seen guides who were bards willing to highsun mobs stuck in the world for people.  Guides like this help make the game better.  phasing them out would be a SERIOUS mistake in my opinion.</div></div><hr />
