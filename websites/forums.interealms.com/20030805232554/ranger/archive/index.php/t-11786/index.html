<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have farmed all over the world... here is some of the things I've found.<br />
<br />
Mid 20s<br />
Get a group in the dungeons in Highhold. Great loot. 200 to 300 a day in full group<br />
<br />
Mid 30s<br />
Find a cleric and fear kite seafuries for thier FS weapons, toes, jewelry, and mugs of sea foam which are used in smithing tempers.<br />
Fear kite giants in RM<br />
Solo gnolls at the gnoll spires in SK (good solo exp at the level and most drop FS. Sell at the gypsys or at the aviak vendor at the top of the treehouse. A bank is only a spire ride away<br />
<br />
Mid 40s<br />
Ry'gorr orcs down in CC. Drop velium weapons and frozen weapons words and various other things. Both vendors, bank, and guards to run to within easy reach. Also get rare drops off the nameds such as the Foreman's Skull Cap, Cloak of Ry'gorr Oracles, Crystalline Robe, Blackened Crystalline Robe, and Herbalist Pack (nice WR back to store food or arrows in)<br />
<br />
50+<br />
Ice Giants in Everfrost. 3 distinct camps which ellimantes alot of the fighting over mobs and KSing. Spawn time seems to be around 6 minutes. If they are already camped then they also provide a fine way to work on your archery skill as the druids keep them rooted when farming them and the necros will keep pet on them. Most people seem to have no problem with rangers plinking away at thier mobs especially if you are willing to snare or root the mob in case the casters get in a little trouble, heal the caster if they take some hits, or buff the pet and caster (str of earth helps with the bieng encumbered from all the phat loot) in the case of Necros. Usually you will find either a druid, necro, or rarely a ranger camping these spawns. Halas is close for vendors and banking as well as an archery supply store in case you decide to work on your archery while your there. WIth a bow delay of 40 and a Lvl 55 druid dotting the giant I was pumping in about 2 stacks per mob before the druid killed it.<br />
<br />
Also don't forget the old tried and true methods.<br />
Farming quality cat pelts in EK<br />
Farming Spider Silk in EK<br />
Farming Spider Silk in Lguk<br />
Farming Blackened Alloy from the gobbys down in Runnyeye<br />
Foraging tradeskill pieces<br />
-Sylvan Oak from various places in Velius<br />
-Oak from BB and Kithicore<br />
-Planer Oak from PoG<br />
Iron Oxide off Elementals near the Mini caves in SteamFont<br />
Griffienne Blood in NK or Laggedpine Forest<br />
Highquality lion skins (used in making the fleeting quiver) off lions in HK<br />
<br />
Now yes.... none of these ways will make you rich any time soon. You get about 100pp per stack of pelts and silks, 1plat per foraged item is about average, 100 plat per Planer Oak branch seems average, 5 plat per grif blood seems average... Iron Oxide.... no idea on that one. <br />
<br />
The other thing to keep in mind is that you won't find anyone posting a farm in here that isn't pretty well known. The more people that know about it the more people will be there doing exactly the same as you. For stuff that you sell to other players remember that there are other players also farming the stuff to sell and you have to stay competitive. As for the question &quot;Whats a good camp&quot; There are no good camps. The best way I've ever found to make plat is still a bug group in Seb when you can avoid getting a loot whore cleric. On that one... don't hold your breath. Some clerics will be happy just to get back what they spent on dots for the group.... and then everyone gets to share in the gems and jewelry that drops.... other clerics are just plain old fashioned greedy and will insist on all PP loot that drops. Giants in RM are a good choice but also a widely known choice. Mobs are overcamped, trained, and frequently KSd. Iron Oxide is another thing. Sells for good plat (up to 500 plat per) but it is also a well known farm. I've seen Level 60 Necros farming those elementals and they are noob mobs. Everyone wants to make a buck. One good way to earn some money.... Baking. Make fish roles untill 130 or so...... fillets untill they trivial... then patty melts. After patty melts take the griffon meat you looted while farming blood and you can get your skill to 240 or so. These by themselves don't make plat..... but... once you get your skill to 200 you can start making the things like Halas 10lb meat Pies and the like which do sell well in the Bizaar and are an expendable resource so people are always wanting more of them. Here is the info on that<br />
<br />
Fish Roles. Bat wings + fresh fish. Both available from Vendors in Freeport.<br />
Fillets. Filleting Knife + certain type of meat. Lion meat works and can be saved while farming pelts or can be purchased from a vendor.<br />
Patty Melts. Bread + Cheese + certain meat + nonstick frying pan<br />
All the ingredients can be bought from vendors except the frying pan which is a smithed and pottery created item. The cheese is sold in Laggedpine Forest.<br />
Griffon Melts. Griff meat +bread+cheese+non stick frying pan<br />
<br />
This is one of the most under exploted money making attempts I have seen but that is changing quickly. Want the best way to make money? Make an enchanter.... twink it (int gear is cheap) and then get it to as high a level as you can. Cha and Int are a enchanters primary statistics needed for battle... but those same statistics help them learn tradeskills faster and sell the products to vendors for more. Plus they get enchant materail spells which you can use to make enchanted materials for other players. Also there is of course good old fashioned crack whoring, but with the wide availability of KEI that is becoming less profitable. Could make a port whore but with the already easy travel via Nexus and soon the travel plane from PoP that is also not a very profitable thing. Lastly... Make a cleric.... get the best gear you can for it... and play it often. Clerics are a somewhat expensive class but they also get a lions share of the loot. From 40+ it is considered normal that the cleric get all gems that drop no matter what they have cast on the group. Also they can be rez whores. No matter how easy it is to travel or whatever else people are still dying and loosing exp and not liking it. Just go to a zone with lots of deaths (ME, DSP, DL, and the like) and just wait for a shout asking for a rezzer. Think about it... how often have you seen a truely poor cleric?<br />
<br />
In summation basically if you are looking to farm something don't expect much per item, try to farm things that sell to a vendor rather then a player because that takes alot less time and the price is always the same. Expect to spend alot of your life doing it if you want to get rich. Occasionally you will get lucky. When Verant where about to Nerf the smithing trivials suddenly everyone wanted to get thier stats maxed before the nerf which created a sudden dire need for quality pelts. Personally I made 5K that day selling pelts to a single smith. I personally think that pelts and silks in EK is the way to go. Not at all challenging but as a ranger you can track the mobs and find them... and if you have sow you can get there quicker then the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tendoryl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On Xev, at least in Seb, it's no longer custom (from what I've seen) for the cleric to recieve all the gem drops. Usually it's about 4 gems to the cleric, then alpha. (this is from my experience hunting there a month and a half ago, might be different now)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally, I carry my own stack of peridots...when my symbol runs out, I toss one into the clerics trade window....screw loot whores.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Clerics should bring their own dots, we shouldnt have to worry about giving them some in the small group atmosphere but some clerics dont get this idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my enchanterly days, I would ask for money for peridots if the group came to the decision to use them for rune...<br />
<br />
..if I did it just to be safe, like if I knew an 8 pull was going to be coming soon, I'd rune myself up and just take the loss. The same if I feel I needed to help heal. I managed to aggro one of those pegasi in sky pretty hard once, and twice in that single tanking streak saved my life solely from rune. While not technically my fault I still sorta see these as extra runes and wouldn't *expect* money for them. I wouldn't turn it down though ;)<br />
<br />
It's a bit different from the cleric's case though, as it's a big pain for clerics not to use aego (well, it is once they get used to it :p also can be a pain if you're short on buff slots, although there is the small advantage of being tougher to dispell.) Certainly if groupmembers ask for aego, group money should refund the cleric.<br />
<br />
Note that I carry peridots on my ranger for aego ;) hell, I even have a couple of pearls on me for call of the hero. Be prepared!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bugnugget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">on the iron oxides that you werent sure about, price on them are 500-1k EACH on the 7th Hammer....very rare drop nowadays though<br />

-Oak from BB and Kithicore<br />
<br />
<br />
Oak is also foragable in Warsilks Woods. You can forage them while doing the Goblin fort up by the sea trying to get Grachnist (spelling?) to drop his Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring which normally sells for a few thousand (rare drop though).  There are also a few items that drop here for the Museum quests in PoK (Green Emeraldscale, and one of the music instruments I believe).  If you've spent time in Seb, or have done this a lot, you can sell to the Iksar outside of Cabilis, just be on the lookout for Crusaders for they are on a different faction than the Legions of Cabilis (Brood of Krotiz or some such I believe).  You can normally bring in a couple hundred in a few hours soloing this place.  (On a side note, if there is a battlemaster spawned by the fire on the west side of the building on the east side of the fort, leave him be.  That is the only place where Pit Fighter Dob spawns, and he tends to be more trouble than he is worth.  Battlemasters and Witch Doctor's don't agro, but you want the battlemaster as he will not heal/SoW the other goblins that you are trying to kill.)<br />

Like other people said, Clerics no longer get all the gems, at least on Fennin.  Common gems are all FFA, BDs and such get rolled on.<br />
<br />
This is probably because no one casts symbol in pickup groups anymore.  At least I never got it.  And I carry dots.</div></div><hr />
