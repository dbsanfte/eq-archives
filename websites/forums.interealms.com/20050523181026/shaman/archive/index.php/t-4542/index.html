<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well you have nice things, so I assume you have some money.<br />
<br />
Matchless dragonleg breeches, barbed rubicite leggings, or the iksar smithed fearsome skyiron legs are all purchaseable upgrades for you.<br />
<br />
Or else its Velious leggings, which require at least a semi-raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aren't Sebilis scale leggings are wearable by Iksar shamans?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If ya really wanna upgrade, get into NToV and get Onyx Chain Leggings:<br />
<br />
+45 AC +10 Str +10 Wis +10 Int +10 vsDis +70 Mana +8.00 Wt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are no leggings in your reach which would you push over 1000ac.<br />
Best ac leggings you could get (if your guild is strong enough for NToV) are Spirit Caller's Greaves (kael quest). That would be 32ac (+stats) = +20 raw ac (about +30ac with defesive skill). Not enough to hit 1000ac.<br />
Only way I see for you to get over 1000ac is getting a new BP too.<br />
<br />
Dropable leggings with more then 13ac:<br />
- Matchless Dragonleg Breeches (26ac)<br />
- Barbed Ringmail Leggings (25ac)<br />
- Peerless Dragonleg Breeches (24ac)<br />
- Heavy Dragonleg Breaches (23ac)<br />
- Barbed Rubicite Leggings (22ac)<br />
- Fearsome Skyiron Leggings (22ac)<br />
- Reinforced Dragonleg Breeches (22ac)<br />
- Worked Dragonleg Breeches (21ac)<br />
- Kylong Greaves (16ac)<br />
- Crystal Chitin Leggings (15ac)<br />
- Oiled Greaves (15ac)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Three points:<br />
<br />
1.  If you're at 985 unbuffed, you're easily getting to 1000 AC even with the lamest of buffs.  Aside from being able to say you got their unbuffed, there isn't much benefit unless you're always getting your buffs dispelled.  :)<br />
<br />
2.  Given the gear you have, your next upgrade is a fungi tunic.  I'd be willing to sell of a few of your pricier pieces to raise money for it, too (barbed booties, bracers, of course the iksar BP, the sleeves, probably even the horse- you can always buy it back.)  The difference between a fungi and an iksar BP is going to change your game more than getting your AC to 1200.  Not sure if this is possible, though (availability and price of the fungi vary by server.)  Is this is an option, go for it.<br />
<br />
3.  In case you ignore #2... barbed ringmail shoulders (ac 19) or leggings (ac 25) are both nice choices, and campable (pricey to buy, though.)  Dragonlegs as buyable, but pricey (start around 5k on Karana, if you're lucky.)  Sebilite scale and Kylong (each ac 16) represent more minor upgrades, but are available for around 1k.  Crystal chitin and oiled leggings are generally too expensive for their stats for a shaman.  One other nifty choice- replace your spear with a Di'zok sceptre of authority (10/20, +5 wis, +25 mana, and 10 AC.)  Or if you get really lucky, you might stumble on a reasonably priced Stretched Fungushide Shield (ac 32, +15 sta, +10 wis, +15 vs disease.)  Free choices include a shrouded medallion (ac 12, +25 mana, +15 magic) from the 4-arms camp in ME, or a Divine Inspiration (range, ac 15, +15 wis/int, +35 mana) from the chieftain camp in ME.<br />
<br />
But ignore #3 if at all possible and go with #2.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting!<br />
<br />
P.S.  Really nice gear selections you've made.    :)</div></div><hr />
