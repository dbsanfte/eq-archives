<br />
I am only level 46 at the moment but I was thinking I could start my Velious armor quests at level 51.  I checked on Allakazam's and it looks like the stats are better on Wolf Caller's but you sacrifice some of the AC you get from Spirit Caller's.  Can you guys give opinions on which you think I should go for?  Thanks crucible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Find a guild with people you like and do whatever quests on the faction they are on. I prefer wolfcallers but I'd have been just as happy to get kael armor if my guild had been on giant faction instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sivilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure what kind of guild you're in, but I think at 51, you should be happy with either set, as it will be difficult to attain at  that level.</div></div><hr />

Spirit callers - looks like pee.<br />
<br />
Seriously, the other posters are right, these quests are not the type of things you can do solo, until your guild gets comfortable with ToV it will probably take 24 people (at least) to farm armor.  It is possible to buy multiquesting, but it would be pretty pricey if the pieces are even available. (for example, in my guild, we still have chain folks with no hats).<br />
<br />
It would be more likely to join some kind of pick up-style raid in the Kael arena if you were interested in getting some Thurg armor.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think SS is the best armor with the best wis/resists and hitpoints, not to mention it's much more attractive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Honestly, it doesn't matter, Hamesh.  Both require guilds to get, and it depends what faction your guild is on.  Presumably you are in a guild, but if not, I would never recommend choosing a guild just based on faction.  Choose one where you know and like the people, and then get whichever armor you like.<br />
<br />
I think (and this is from memory) that AC is a bit higher on Spirit Callers, and stats and resists are a bit better on Wolf Callers.<br />
<br />
Both sets of armors are from ToV mobs.  The Wolf is from the mobs in the Halls of Testing (east ToV), and the Spirit are from the mobs in West ToV (though technically all the mobs in north, west, or the entry area can drop the armor for Spirit).  I believe HoT is a little easier than the other areas.  Easier is a relative term.  The armor can be done with 2 good groups, but getting that kind of caliber firepower in a pick-up group isn't likely (hence the guild requirement).  All the mobs are a minimum of level 60 in ToV.  The non-named range between 60-63 I believe.<br />
<br />
Given the level of difficulty (and probably the competition for the armor within your groups or guilds) don't worry about which is better.  Go with what you can get!  :)<br />
<br />
If your guild is trying to decide on a faction, go with giant faction.  Being on CoV faction limits your raid choices too much, imo.<br />

*Edited -- let me emphasize two GOOD groups--mostly level 60s with very good equipment and very good players.  If you are in a slightly younger guild, I'd go with 4 groups minimum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hamesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the quick replies!  Hehe, I feel like a schmuck.  I been soloing practically all of my 46 levels.  Guild? Hmm, hadn't counted on needing one for the quests(I'm a noob, this is my first char).  When I get more time to play the game I'll work on this stuff then:-)</div></div><hr />
