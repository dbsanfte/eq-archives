<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Remember that thread I put up about how I miss that band Motherlode and how I was lucky to have their rare cd that is impossible to purchase nowadays?  Remember me telling you I had a bunch of other IMPOSSIBLE to get cds, some of which I had to go to great lengths to track down and purchase (got lucky on one from a store from Sweden)?<br />
<br />
Well, they're gone.  All gone.  Some stupid mother f*cking ho-bag a**hole broke into my car last night.  Stole all my cds.  Stole my 200 dollar oakley sunglasses. Tried to steal my stereo, but since it's a b*tch to install, all they could do was break the hell out of it while figuring out it's not going to come out easily.  Then he stole as much crap from my glove compartment as he could, including my car registration.<br />
<br />
I'm sure this story isn't new to anyone.  I've never had it happen to me before and I'm at a loss of emotions.  Years of carefully building my cd collection, some of which are to never be replaced again, is gone.   Hell, part of me is still in shock and believes this is just some bad dream and that I'll wake up soon and none of it will have ever happened.<br />
<br />
I seriously, and do very honestly and soberly hope that the person who did this rots in prison  while being buttf*cked over and over again by a man who has never heard of the word &quot;gentle&quot; in his life.<br />
<br />
I'll see you in hell, you motherf*cking sh*thead.</div></div><hr />

It sucks what happened, Numbuk :( I guess you won't be leaving your cd's in your car any more...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Auriane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ouch!!! That hurts!! I'm so sorry big guy... I hope you can replace at least part of that collection somehow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no cds to leave.  That was my entire collection.  Over 160 of them, many of them rare and irreplacable.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, I ripped most of them to mp3 on my work's computer, so I've got about 10 gigs worth of mp3s that pretty much encompass my old collection.  Still, it sucks.<br />
<br />
I know this is a small thing in grand scheme of crimes that have happened to other people, even people here, but I still feel like crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/comfort Numbuk.<br />

Thats the reason I never leave anything of value in my car besides maps and emergency stuff. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aizle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had a friend of mine have his entire 600+ CD collection stolen from his house.  Like Numbuk, he had TONS of imports or other impossible/difficult to replace music.<br />
<br />
He has, however, over the years (yup years) managed to replace about 99.5% of it through patience, ebay and normal retail outlets.<br />
<br />
Sucks that it happened to ya.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Screeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I feel for you dude. On my 22nd birthday, somebody stole my Jeep from my apt complex. I ended up getting it back, but had to pay Mexico $60 in impound fees, and then had to pay $500 to replace the shoddy and mismatched rims/tires that were on there. Then I had to pay $30 for a new harness for my stereo because they saw fit to remove it from the dash, cut it and then bolt it back in (I have a detachable face stereo).<br />
<br />
I'm sure they'll get there's, but you probably wont be there to witness it. Sorry brotha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lonedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That sucks man.   What makes it suck worse is that the cops won't do a damn thing.  I had my car stolen...with some of my CD's (fortunately only 10 or so), my golf clubs, and other assorted stuff (my car was kind of like an extra closet).  Apparantly I had left an old credit card reciept in the car someplace...the credit card company called when $4,000 was charged on my card.  I have nothing bad to say about the credit card people...I didn't have to pay a penny of that charge.<br />
<br />
The cops called me two weeks later to tell me my car was impounded...and totalled.  The thieves had completely stripped the interior.<br />
<br />
The silver lining to the story was that replacement value of my old POS '84 Celica was enough for a down payment on a new (used) 4X4.<br />
<br />
Do you have homeowners or renters insurance?  That would at least get you some cash to get at least some recovery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thieves annoy the hell out of me too.  Replaced the battery in an old car 7 times in one year, most probably because of jackass low riders and their need for power for their hydraulic systems.  Five of those times they rifled the car for whatever was there, I stopped leaving stuff of value in the car after the first time, but one of them even stole the newspaper I left on the front passenger seat.  After the second time I stopped buying good batteries, the cheap ones disappeared too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Subwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ack...I feel for ya bro. I have some fairly rare CD's myself....limited edition Iron Maiden CD's and the like......and I would go thru the roof if they got stolen. Expensive to buy....but thats not the point.....they would be extremely difficult or impossible to replace...and I LOVE listening to them while I play eq.<br />
<br />
Wish I could at least send yaaa some mp3's.....but it doesnt sound like I would have much of what ya lost.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>danfromsyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I know it's slim that you have,  <br />
but renters/homeowners  insurance covers the 'mobile' items in your auto, <br />
they don't cover the stereo  thats the auto insurance poliy, most don't cover non-dealer/shop installed units though<br />
<br />
<br />
sucks none the less...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cal the Dude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dang, really sorry to hear that Numbuk.  :(  But I've gotta ask, did you happen to have any really rare Nirvana CD's?  I know there's some CD that they only, and accidently, printed 1000 of.<br />
<br />
I hope you can get most of your stuff back somehow, or replace how you felt about your CDs with something else, at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nope.  No Nirvana.  I did get most of my collection ripped to mp3 on my work computer's hard drive so I can listen to music at work without having to lug my old cd case around all the time.  That at least will help.  I didn't get entire albums ripped, but most of it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the consolation guys.  Sorry to hear some of you guys have had crap happen to you too.<br />
<br />
I've talked with the gal (who's also a good friend) who I rent from and I think she's going to lobby really hard with several others (possibly even other apartment complexes nearby) to get a security guard  or something.  This isn't the first incident something like this has happened.<br />
<br />
Sad thing is, I was taking my sunglasses and cds into my apartment for a while.  Then you get caught up in that notion of security and forget/feel you're ok.  Bam.<br />
<br />
Sigh.<br />
<br />
Oh well.  It could have been a lot worse I guess.  I am going to see about getting renter's insurance for sure now.   It's just not worth not having it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>J'horra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That is one of the reasons I only used burned cd's in my car now.  That way if they get stolen I can just burn another one.  I feel for you, have had that happen to me before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Evenshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">....not sure what the situation is, or how large a city, town or otherwise urban area you live in, BUT, one thing I would do is go do the rounds of the places buying and selling used CDs over the next week or so, if its an option.<br />
<br />
Same thing happened to my cousin a few years back, and granted its a fairly small town we live in, with only a few places to check, but we walked in about 20 mins after the ****head sold the store owner a huge stack of CDs.  Guess what?  Same ones, and we got the name, and the rest was just vengeance.  Eventually got the CDs back too - most of them.  Rare ones make it easier for you to identify.<br />
<br />
Long shot, but it gives you something to do instead of brood.  Also, a lot of the *******s that do car breakins are stupid kids, or otherwise feeding a brain-emaciating habit of some kind.  They aren't too bright, often, and head to the nearest second hand place to get some quick cash.<br />
<br />
Worth a couple hrs of your time, once again depending on your situation to make it feasable.  In L.A., you are prolly S.O.L., but in a smallish to mid-size town, you might get lucky.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah, I gave the cop some names of some uber rare cds that I highly doubt anyone else in this entire country has.  Called up the local Graywhale (best place to go to sell cds) and the guy told me that they turn away anyone trying to sell cds without a case and booklet insert for the very reason that they're probably stolen.  He told me that all pawnshops in the area do the same.  He still took down the names of cds and my police case number.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I doubt I'll ever see my cds again.  <br />
<br />
I'm slowly starting to lose my faith in humanity.  This only helped further that.  Am getting a really strong feeling that the only rule to life truly is &quot;F*ck or be F*cked.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I feel you pain, I truly do. It seems that not a week goes by that I don't question humanity as well. But I put it into perspective by realizing that for every one person that would do such a horrible thing, there are 100,000 that wouldn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had my house broken into earlier this year, and they robbed alot of stuff also.<br />
<br />
Now I am trying to get the money back from my replacements from the insurance company. This also sucks.<br />
<br />
They give you are hard time about each detail and whatnot. Kinda like they think you are lying. Funny thing is, from what I am told, they can actually drop my coverage for no reason at all once this is done. And if you get dropped, you are likely to not be able to get coverage from another insurance. Like having bad credit or something.<br />
<br />
So basically, insurance companies can drop you for no good reason on home insurance. My insurance is State Farm atm, and right now they aren't taking any new coverages also.<br />
<br />
Thinkin of changing companies after I settle this thing, just so I don't get dropped.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, CARS. The thing about leaving stuff in  your car is, eventually, its gonna happen. Cars are so easy to break into. Bust a window, grab some stuff, especially if it's visable, and take off. This is one reason I don't upgrade my factory radio. I simply leave it in, and make hidden upgrades like CD changer and such. Alot of times they look for expensive stereos and leave factory ones alone. Keep all you stuff in hidden places also. Anything that is laying about will catch notice, whether it's good or trash. An empty box or bag is enough reason for them to break in sometimes. Try an alarm if you don't already have one too. Noise makes them at least hurry to get away.<br />
<br />
I wish we could install electric shockers, where if they touch the metal body, pow! hehe<br />
<br />
Hope you get your stuff back man.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Today I re-purchased the same type of sunglasses (http://oakley.com/ostore/eyewear/a_wire/) (platinum/polarized ones) that was stolen from me (isn't any other kind that fit my face and I like so well).  I had a hard enough time paying the pricetag the FIRST time around.   This time it only enraged me more.  But, not nearly as bad as having ot squint all the way to work every day.  I truly had forgotten how much sun sucks to non-polarized eyes.<br />
<br />
Oh well.  They're never going to be left in the car again.  Ever.<br />
<br />
Going to get a stereo that plays mp3s (did convert most of my old cd collection to mp3 on work computer) so that will help, and it will have a detachable faceplate.  going to also get an alarm installed.  Am not going to take any chances this time around.<br />
<br />
Am also causing a stir with condo people.  Something is going to get done about this kind of crime at our place.  Things are in motion.  This crap isn't just happening to me.  Others have had the same kind of problem.<br />

Man I wished I lived in Iran, if only when it came to their criminal justice system.  Heh.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you stole my cds, huh?  Would you please place your hand on this wooden chopping block for me?  Thank you.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Sorry to hear that happen to you.<br />
<br />
I had something like that happen to me, but I actually caught them inside my blazer (I was up late and hungry, was going to head for IHOP :) )<br />
<br />
After jamming one into the wheels under the blazer and pinning one with the door a police car just happen to be driving by.  Even though there was some confusion on who was going to stay handcufffed, those three punks were taken in.  Third one was in a car in the parking lot and tried to get away after the officers started to show up.  It looked like my blazer would have been the 7th vehicle hit that night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>The Lone Ranger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Just my thoughts but I would set up some bait in the same area that your car was when it got robbed. Anything that is valuable will work. Watch it from a hidden location at all times. Most likely the person who tries to steal it is your thief. <br />
<br />
Now you go get him. I really can't say what I would do to them so I'll leave it up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>TalvaranRW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">That fuvking sucks, i'm reallly sorry :(  i would be so pissed i hope that scum bag rots in hell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Merrikat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">This type of thing gets kind of overlooked in the scheme of theft, but when your music means as much to you as the car it sits in, or, hell, some of the people that sit in your car... the feelings are unique and difficult to deal with.<br />
<br />
Two years ago, I had to teach a highschool class substitute style on music appriciation. I left my gigantor CD cases in the car because my hands were full trying to get back into the apartment.<br />
<br />
The next morning, I was out over 1000 cd's, eight of which were unmixed, raw data from a recording session I was lucky enough to be involved with. One of the highlights of my life up to now is mixing and tracking Elton John in the studio, and I lost all the original burns.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear about your trouble... I'm definatly sympathetic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Sorry to hear about many of yous guys' similar experiences, especially about da Elton John mixes.  :(<br />
<br />
Dis ordeal does have somewhat of a happy ending dough.<br />
<br />
Me insurance company looked at me car and estimated da damage to repair, along wit replacing da stereo.  (me tink it estimated 50 dollars too high for da stereo, but me tink it because da guy knew Numbuk wasn't trying to swindle him).  Dey cut Numbuk a check for $1,150.83, dey estimated it as 1250, but took 100 out for my deductable (amazing how much damage someone can do in a short amount of time).<br />
<br />
Well, me room mate recommended a place to get it fixed.  Dey even saved him a lot of money.  Numbuk went in and dey looked over me car and said dat me insurance overestimated da damage and me didn't need one particular part.  Dey said it would probably be enough to cover me deductable.  Me was happy to hear dis.  Well, happiER.<br />
<br />
Me just got car back today.   Da guy me worked wit told me Numbuk actually  didn't need two pieces, instead of one.  Me signed over da insurance check for him, and den he cut Numbuk a check for da difference.  How much did me pocket?<br />
<br />
$497.00.<br />
<br />
Dat pretty much gonna cover da cost of da new mp3/cd stereo AND da alarm!!!<br />
<br />
It get better.  Me so glad for dat, dat me is gonna splurge and upgrade me car's sound system.  So, even dough me old cds are in subpar mp3 form, dey will sound BETTER dan dey ever did, even back when me had me cds because of da newer sound system.<br />
<br />
Dat made me day.  What unmade me day was having a personal revelation about meself, it not being good, and den learning dat udder people have known dat about me all along.  :(</div></div><hr />
