<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in a LDoN group with bard doing CC.  For some reason, whatever she was singing was interfearing with slow.  I didn't get a resist message or the &quot;yawn&quot; message.  The mob was just obviously not slowed.  Once the MT got on it, I was able to slow it normally, so I'm assuming whatever she was using to mez/rootpark the mob was interfereing.  I asked what she was singing, but either she didnt answer or I missed the response.  Anyone know what this might be or am I just imagining things?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only thing that comes to mind is Charm.  When you try to slow or damage a PC's charmed pet, you get the same effect as if you were casting on a player (ie no messages at all).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like a charm. Happen to notice at pet health under the bards name like when we bring up pup? Can also con it next time if that happens again. Charmed mob will be indiff and you wont see any message when you cast on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also you won't be able to target the charmed mob with F8, although looking for the green pet bar would be easiest, but in case you're not in group with the charmer.<br />
<br />
And you may not have gotten a response because it can be hard for bards to engage in conversation, especially in the constant action of LDoN.<br />
<br />
If it's not Charm, I can't think of anything else at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Definately charm.  Have them mez instead.</div></div><hr />

It is a very annoying habbit, and when I group with bards I tend to con every mob im trying to slow several times while I'm castng slow just to make sure it isnt suddenly indifferent to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I have a Bard in my group, I /pet attack the mob before I start slow. If at any point I get a message from my dog that it can no longer attack the target, I stop slowing.<br />

Much easier than constantly conning a mob. :)<br />

ALWAYS slow mezzed mobs. It's always the best time since if you get a resist they aren't gonna beat on your arse. Remember, mobs are not going to awake from mez unless it wears off or damage is inflicted on it. Always slow and root.<br />
<br />
Just keep an eye out for a pet health bar under the bards name or con the mob to see if it's charmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He's talking about charming, not mezzing.  It's easy to tell when a critter is mezzed - they stop swinging.  This would be to check for charm... because they're still hitting, but it's hard to tell on a target change.<br />
<br />
That's a good suggestion Totuk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ah ya, get what you mean now. Actually come to think of it used to do the same when I had a bard friend I used to always group with.<br />
<br />
It worked well for us because we knew each other's techniques. An add comes, he'll take the add and charm it almost everytime. <br />
<br />
Bards should announce it though if they're with people they don't know.</div></div><hr />

My rule is if it's not slowed by 70% it aint getting slowed i'm tossing a Bane and Ebolt at it to burn it down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do slow mezzed mobs, I can't slow charmed ones. If the Bard is crowd controlling with charm instead of mez, my pet will back off when he charms the mob. Thus, I stop my slow.<br />
<br />
Should have been more clear in my explanation, I guess.<br />

EDIT: Saw that other people pointed that out before I replied. Oh well. :(<br />

<br />
unless its a raid..calling slow isnt really important.  I grouped with a ranger one day and he called when he snared when he nuked when he DoT'd (it was a lvl 34 ranger..); trust me its annoying.  What i would do in groups of strangers is ask if they wanted me to call slow...99% of groups say no.<br />
<br />
same with the bard..sure it would be nice if he announced charm, but if the mobs were the same would it really matter? Look for the pet bar under his name if you want to know if he charmed something.  And trust me now, you dont want the bard announcing his charms..bard charm is 3 ticks (at least 29 charm is..higher maybe little longer?)...do you want to see &quot;CHARMING %T&quot; every 18 seconds? yeah, didnt think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Calling out every slow is annoying and unnecessary in most situations.  If you're in a raid with multiple shaman and there are adds, then is a time when it's useful.  Otherwise there's pretty much no use to it.  It might not hurt, but as a person above stated, it might annoy the hell out of your group mates, and I'm sure you don't want that.<br />
<br />
You'd be better off making a hotkey: &quot;/g Slow resisted, keep an eye on my hp please&quot; and using this only if another healer is in the group.  This can save your life when you get some very MR mobs or have a bad run of luck with the RNG.<br />
<br />
Everyone knows you're going to slow every mob and they'll be able to tell without the call.  It's your game so do as you like, but just so you know that it's annoying to a lot of people when we announce every slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Totally off the subject, but I think someone answered his question anyway....<br />
<br />
I quit announcing slows in LDoN... it's annoying.<br />
No ones wants to read I have slowed the mobs, not even me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tikker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bards charm mobs rather than mez for a bunch of diff't reasons<br />
<br />
mostly because charm lasts longer than mez (1 minute instead of 18 seconds) and it adds more DPS to a group<br />
<br />
the bard can then break charm at will(invis) and will have the HP/ac to absorb the mobs agro until the shaman can then slow it<br />
<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
bards CAN hotkey stuff, but do you really want them spamming that **** every 18 seconds(or less) ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">had a nice bard break charm that way (with invis) the other day.  Myself, the 2 necros and the mage were QUITE peeved about it too.<br />
<br />
Seems their &quot;simple invis&quot; kills all the pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks for the responses.  I'm sure it was probably charm the.  After I said something, she switched to a different song and my slows worked normally.  I just want to know how to deal with it should the need arise  in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Bard needs to call it OR just simple state i use charm for crowd control. Really dont need every mez called out nor every slow but does help to know they are going to use charm. <br />
   The difference between calling slows and calling charm is I WILL be slowing all mobs i dont know if they will always charm or use charm and mez. <br />
  <br />
   As for their invis i know they have a group mist/invis spell which is going to make everyone invis and kill pets. Do they have one that just gets them also? I thought they might but its been awhile since my bard friend killed my pup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Seems their &quot;simple invis&quot; kills all the pets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then the bard was a fool, and had no clue about their class.  <br />
<br />
A knowledgable bard would have used something sneak/hide-ish, a ring with an insta-click invis from LoIO or the rogue/bard cloak with invis from FG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">bards CAN hotkey stuff, but do you really want them spamming that **** every 18 seconds(or less) ?<br />
<br />
If you look at the magelos in my sig, you'll see that I play both a bard and shaman.  I play my bard a LOT more than my shaman since I came back to EQ, too.  (I know, I'm a traitor :p)<br />
<br />
I hotkey my mez and charm messages and hit them once... not spam every 18 seconds. :p  It communicates to the group what I'm doing and eliminates guesswork as to what the tank should be on.  Simple, effective, and easy.<br />
<br />
edit: oh yeah, and /agree Spite btw<br />
<br />
As such, do all shammies announce all slows?  goose, gander, yada yada...<br />
<br />
Why would you?  Pretty much Every mob gets slowed.  Not every mob, however, gets mezzed or charmed.  I will announce mitigated slows or slow immunity though, healers and tanks need to know these things.  Goose, gander?  More like apples, oranges. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I don't hotkey that I'm slowing mobs... if players don't realize I'm there to slow mobs, I have no idea why I'd be grouped with them in the first place.<br />
<br />
Bard charms are different though since not all bards use it. Should they announce every charm? Hell no, that'd be annoying after a several times. But announcing to the group before you start engaging in an adventure that you will be charming or announcing your charms the first couple times lets people know that they're dealing with a bard who likes using his/her charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ogrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Bards have Hide as a class skill.  It should be what they use to break charm, not invis.  Lol, poor pet classes, that must have been really funny in hind sight.  Not so funny when it happened though, eh?</div></div><hr />

When I'm slowing several mobs I am only aware of the health bars in a cursoury way. I advise groups when I get resists, so they know that I'll be casting malo and slow again and they will be taking more damage than usual. I advise groups when mobs are slowed, but only after my intial slow was resisted, not every slow...so they can breath easier. That's all...but we all expect to be told by chanters when mobs are mezzed...so why not bards? And why not charmed when it's intially done? That's what hotbuttons are for after all. To save time. And if he doesn't have time to tell me he's initially charmed a mob, then that mana I wasted isn't going to his next haste till he makes a button for me. When my eyes see that initial message, I won't need another in the fight. We are a team and communication is key, especially in pickup groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, the group should be smart enough to tell when things are slowed(WOW! This mob went from hitting me every second to hitting me every 5 minutes! I wonder what happened...). And it does get frickin annoying to see the &quot;target slowed&quot; &quot;target malosinia'd&quot; message every 45 seconds.</div></div><hr />

I never expect a chanter to announce mez; thats something chanters are there for..if s/he isnt mezzing why in the world are they present in the group?  The reason chanters announce mez is because there always seems to be some moron breaking it over and over.  The only reason a chanter should be expected to announce mez is if multiple enchanters/necros/bards are present and many things need to be mezzed.<br />
<br />
Have you ever played a bard?  its not often easy to push more hotkeys so everyone can see you've charmed something for 18 seconds.  I do agree with others though..if a bard likes using charm for crowd control, they should say it at the beginning and everyone will know when 2+ mobs come one is going to be charmed.  If i'm in a group and people announce every action they take (other than incoming messages, and heal messages are nice if more than 1 healer is present) I break out the &quot;I'm breathing now&quot; hotkey and press it liberally...<br />
<br />
Oh and..I dont think the bard will lose any sleep over you not hasting them..they do have epic and song haste afterall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The first bard charm song, at L 27ish (maybe 28?) has a 3 tick duration, and I don't know if I'd bother announcing that all the time. Starting with the second charm song, in the high 30's, the songs start costing mana, and have a 1 minute duration. Once a bard gets up to using that song, I think they should definitely announce they are charming. <br />
<br />
With my bard, I have made hotkeys to cast my songs. They look like:<br />
<br />
/stopsong          (ends the previous song)<br />
/cast X             (casts the song in spellgem #X)<br />
<br />
In the case of charm, I have just added<br />
<br />
/g Charming %T       <br />
<br />
to the hotkey. And I swap that hotkey in whenever I mem charm. That way everyone knows when I'm going to be charming something. I think it's the only thing I announce, other than when I sing the group invulnerability song. I also message that one, as it confuses the heck out of the group otherwise. <br />
<br />
If a bard still twists using the actual spellgems, then they'd have to have a separate hotkey to announce charm, and that'd be a pain. Bards really OUGHT to use a hotkey setup to cut the twisting buttonpressing in half, but many do not. <br />
<br />
Low level bards may not have an instant invis item, but with the low level 3-tick charm that doesn't really matter. As they start using the 1 minute charms more, they need to get an invis item of some kind, or use Hide. Hide can slow you down, but in the 40's maybe you couldn't afford an invis item. At high level, they should have an item to break charm with, since the invis song affects the group. Any type of invis will work. My bard uses Boots of the Mosquito - a right click insta cast from inventory Invisibility to Animals. Breaks charm instantly whenever you want. <br />
<br />
In any case, I wouldn't suggest that a bard NOT charm just so the shaman can slow. Mez'ing as a bard is a pain in the ass, with the 12 second mez's. Once you have the 1 minute charm it's MUCH more easier to use, and jumps up the group DPS substantially. The best solution is that the bard announce the charms, or at LEAST tell you he'll be charming when there are two mobs in camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">ALWAYS slow mezzed mobs. It's always the best time since if you get a resist they aren't gonna beat on your arse. Remember, mobs are not going to awake from mez unless it wears off or damage is inflicted on it. Always slow and root.<br />
<br />
Absolutely always slow mezzed mobs, if only so that if they don't resist but mez drops, they don't hand the chanter their butt before things get locked down again.<br />
<br />
However.<br />
<br />
Always slow and root. Uh, no? Not unless you you want every melee other than the MA to ball you out for causing them distance agro. You don't need to root. If the chanter is worried about agro then they can Boggle the mob, if you're worried about agro in LDoN then you either need better gear or a tank with a better taunt. :p Much easier to leave them unrooted, better for the melees to move the mobs around if they need to and less grief for everyone else to work out why the mob's flailing about like a windmill. Albeit a slow windmill.  ;)<br />
<br />
And getting back to topic, checking for a 'pet' bar underneath the bard's health bar is a very good and quick way of determining their CC method. I'd prefer this than to ask for the the aforementioned spamming of '%T charmed' which would indeed get quite annoying after the first few times (when everyone should have got the routine down pat anyway).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I personally announce every slow, but I always ask if the group wants it announced. Actually, most say yes to announce it. Sometimes it is necessary to announce it, like just last night, was in a pet group, so the BL wouldnt rush in to melee until the mob was slowed, so he didn't get chewed up hehe.</div></div><hr />
