Does this same change affect sneak?  If it does affect sneak then a bunch of quests (notably the ranger epic) have become impossible.  If it doesn't affect sneak then it's not really much of a fix now is it?</div></div><hr />

Open the trade window then have someone invis you.  This is how I did my PoA sphere MQ.<br />
<br />
Then again... maybe that wont work either.<br />

<br />
In fact, the Rogue epic would have a piece that either wouldn't be possible, or at least wouldn't make sense, if sneak/trade didn't work.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loga</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They had a problem with syncronizing the player invis attribute and the game recognized invis attribute.  Their programmers were too inexperienced to find the bug and code it properly.  Instead they coded around it making it a requirement that you be visible.<br />
<br />
Even so, I don't think sneak is part of this change.<br />
<br />
It used to be that when you initiated a trade you'd go vis.  I remember noting in the recent past that if you did this you sometimes appeared to be invis still.  I think they made a change some time ago and can't find out where their mistake is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daareon</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is/was a bug in that affects Rogues. Apparently sneak and hide get dropped if the player tries to pickpocket an NPC. Previously just hide would drop (leaving you indiferent to the KOS mob).<br />
<br />
Very very messy when you have to pickpocket KOS Rogue Guild leaders deep in Kaladim/Neriak for the epic.  I dont know if the other handins are affected but it would be bad for a number of Epics where the quest NPCs are KOS. <br />
<br />
I'de give good odds of another small patch in the next day or so if the bug wasnt fixed last night.</div></div><hr />
