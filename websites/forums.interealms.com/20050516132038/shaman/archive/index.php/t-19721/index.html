Any other information you could give us?<br />
Such as where the camp is, what mob dropped the spell, and what # &amp; strength of forces you were using?<br />
<br />
Sorry you lost the roll. :( <br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

I started a thread about spell drop locations here http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19716 although no one else has replied.  Some friends on another server had the spell drop for them during the sewers expedition.  From the original poster's description, it sounds like he was not at this camp.  This leads me to believe that it is dropping all over the place and you have a good chance of picking it up if you are just killing in Gates.  Anyone have information to the contrary?<br />
<br />
Also, when you said &quot;1 drop the whole day&quot; do you mean just one spell dropped the entire day, and it was balance of nihil, or that you had multiple spells drop and only one was balance of nihil?<br />
<br />
btw, if you can expect 1 balance of nihil a day to drop, that isn't bad at all :)  Don't suppose you ever camped torpor/malo? =P</div></div><hr />

The trick is to levitate on the ledge up out of the pool.  We figured that one out the second time through.  The first time we had the same problem you did, with no one being able to cast on them b/c they were halfway in and out of the water.  One of the most frustrating half hours of EQ ever.<br />
<br />
But yeah, thats sewers.</div></div><hr />

YES !! it was the most frustrating thing, my group started to talk **** to me and said &quot;*** do you mean you can't land slow? noob shaman!&quot; the other shaman in the group helped defend me ... then they all shut up ...<br />
but yes, its HARD, even with levi and getting on the ledge, your gunna have some problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">it's easy for the most part.  The mites you can land a spell on them unless you are above the water.  you can't heal the tank unless you are in the water.  Most of the other mobs though, you have to be in the water to do it (yeah, this happened to me the first time too on that guy).<br />
<br />
oh, and named doesn't summon if you didn't notice</div></div><hr />
