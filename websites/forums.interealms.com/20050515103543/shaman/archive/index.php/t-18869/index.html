<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I posted this so that people would realize that it isn't just shamans getting the shaft.  Everyone is more or less getting the shaft equally, except for wizards who are getting everything they could possibly want.<br />
<br />
I don't see anything in our current beta AA that makes me want to jump for joy, but I don't see anyone else (except wizards) getting anything amazing, either.  I think in general the GoD AA's are pretty disappointing, but it isn't just shamans who aren't getting major upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not so sure that a familiar that boosts spell damage at the cost of like 8 mana/tick, 30 to all resists, 300 mana, +9 spell casting level is all that great.  I guess they can port faster anyway.  Go wizards!  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to a wizard in my guild, who is in beta, it is a 30% damage focus that stacks with the ID line.  So, with potime gear, 65% ID to strike of solusek.  He's creaming his pants as we speak :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ahh, well a less uber wizzy in my guild (who's also in beta) is annoyed that it doesn't stack with their normal familiar.  I suppose it'll be nice for raiding, but that seems like a lot to give up for normal groupage.<br />
<br />
...and your friend wears pants?  Dang, most wizards I know wear dresses, and it creeps me out. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm Jinheim you make a good point. I guess I shouldn't be angry, Druids get the shaft far worse than us. It seems everyone except Beastlord Wizard and Ranger get totally worthless AA, while Beastlord and Wizard get ridiculously powerful ones. Ah yes, what wizards need most is a manaless familiar that increases DD damage by 30%, and an offensive &quot;discipline&quot; making them crit way more while its active. Because Wizard DPS is just so terrible!<br />
<br />
Quote sony, &quot;We plan to make melee damage higher, to catch up with spellcasting damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
A step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wouldn't call the familiar manaless. 15aa per each one, and it increases the mana cost per spell, for that increased chance to crit.<br />
<br />
Jinheim, Could you get some more information out of him by chance? Like what's the DPS output now? and the damage per mana ratio and the like? If it's increasing damage by 65%, and the mana cost is double, it may not be that big of an improvement, let alone an improvement at all. Fast initial numbers, but alot less over the long run.<br />

<br />
You're getting the AA's mixed up.  They are getting three new AA that help with their damage:<br />
<br />
1)  Familiar.  This gives either a 30% or 35% ID focus that (to my knowledge) stacks with ID focuses from items.  Thus, with the AA familiar and a potime focus item, you can hit 65% ID.<br />
2)  Damage disc AA.  This makes them crit more, but also makes their spells cost more.  I have absolutely not clue what sort of percentages are involved here.<br />
3) Advance Fury of Magic Mastery.  Even more crits.<br />
<br />
That's all I know and I am reluctant to say more, because I don't like spreading around information that I haven't seen or experienced firsthand.<br />
<br />
As for what kind of damage he's putting out, I'll ask him in a few days.  As of now, his main hasn't been copied to beta yet so he's using a /betabuffed wizard with 1800hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pet Affinity<br />
This ability allows your group spells to also affect the pets of group members.<br />
<br />
Hey one of my favorites slipped in.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree that most new class aa's are a disappointment.  but, at least the shaman ones are somewhat useful.  However, I must also agree that the Wiz and BST got more than most and needed this boost less than most, oh well, life is not fair.<br />
<br />
My one hope is that the new spells will somehow make up for these aa's.  The GoD ads do state new &quot;arcane spells&quot;.  Call me an optimist, but one of these may still be Canni 5, or a 1200 hp dd, or a low aggro DoT.  Who knows?  They did add a couple of nice DoTs in LDoN, so I suspect we will get at least a couple of worthwhile spells in GoD.<br />
<br />
Now, I will really be po'd if the BST get additional spells that put them closer to shaman in casting ability.  They are simply overpowered at this time, and yes, I play a BST also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Great time to be a wizard I guess.  Critical affliction is good.  We need a lure component aa as well to replace that wolf pack, god, 5 more dogs?????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree with the tone of the other posters, there's really not much here to be excited about.  We get a couple of pet abilities that seem ok, the critical affliction is something many have expressed a desire for.<br />
<br />
I found LDoN pretty lackluster, I'm pretty disappointed in it.  Bane would have been nice had they put a realistic recast time on it, otherwise, the only thing it did for me was provide a change of scene.<br />
<br />
IMHO, the jury is still out until we see our spells.  I think we have the only AA that regens endurance (the stationary warder).  My guess is that we will be the only class given an endurance regen buff, or at least have the best one.  It would be nice to get higher level pet spell and a decent DD to increase our DPS so we might once again become attractive to groups for something other than our buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What are you guys talking about? This has to be the best set of AA's to come out EVER! Advanced tracking anyone?! i dont know how many times i needed to track a bandit in West Karana and could'nt do it from zone in, and now i can! Boo-YA!<br />
<br />
ok really, the way i see it is that its kinda of a mixed bag of aa's. The pet afinity line is something that shuld have been there the whole time but it is nice to see it is there. The dppleganger ability for enchanters seem like a novelty and im sure that after i few tries it will be deemed worthless, unless it forces mobs to agro it, then im sure it would be broken somehow. most of the abilities just seem like improvements on what was there. I highly doubt that there is going to be some huge creative spark at SOE and our class or any class will end up with some giant change that advances us. <br />
<br />
In regards to the AA for end regen (call of the ancients?) i feel that atleast it is some sort of totem thing similar to the whitch doctors in Warcraft 3, where you can cast it in the middle of a group of melees and not worry about it wearing off, and making sure people dont click it off, ect. <br />
<br />
yes we kinda got shafted, but did you expect anything else?</div></div><hr />

Holy Blessing Hotkeyable<br />
This ability allows the cleric to call upon the favor of their diety and receive an instant infusion of mana. Additional ranks increase the amount of mana that is granted.<br />
<br />
This equivalent to Cann5 without the HP hit?</div></div><hr />

Non of our class specific stuff is really worth mentioning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shadowknights have had the no-fizzle AA for a long long time now. But at least their hybrid parent (necro) also gets them. We get a big pile of The Shaft. Hell I want no-fizzle turgurs. If we aren't going to have the spell itself upgraded in 3 years (name for me another class whose primary group responsibility has not gotten more powerful at least once since kunark), then at least give us the ability to cast it without botching the job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">my feelings on our new AAs.<br />
some are good, most are very disapointing.  who the hell wants another spirit calling type AA, or an aa that lets our pets crit....these really could have been something usefull instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Beuh ,cleric ,wizard ,mago and chanter get great aa . Ok there a class who get worst than us : druid ,but that all . And it's not like we got good aa with luclin and pop (except of canni5 and some rare other).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It seems everyone except Beastlord Wizard and Ranger get totally worthless AA, while Beastlord and Wizard get ridiculously powerful ones.<br />
Ok, enlighten me which of the mighty ranger AA skills stuck out? Advanced tracking anyone? Don't get me off with useless bow AA skills, ranger do more damage with melee when not using trueshot.<br />
<br />
So much crap AAs all around, it ain't funny. right now I see no reason to buy this crap.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i just had a great idea...however off the subject.<br />
<br />
sony can take away all our new GoD AA if they fix rabid bear.  By fixing rabid bear i mean, changeing the AA so as not to be a worthless toy.  To do that Sony will need to turn the AA into an insta death touch to any targeted bard, pallidan, druid, cleric or SK (perferably one who you have dueled and who killed you with HT).<br />
<br />
trust me when i say, i would be quick to hand out death and judgement, and i would have a grin while doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ahh, well a less uber wizzy in my guild (who's also in beta) is annoyed that it doesn't stack with their normal familiar.  I suppose it'll be nice for raiding, but that seems like a lot to give up for normal groupage.<br />

...and your friend wears pants?  Dang, most wizards I know wear dresses, and it creeps me out. ;)<br />
<br />
Look who is talking, the kilt wearing hippie  :D . Think i heard some shattering glass while reading this ...<br />

Just kidding, go on with your regular bitching.</div></div><hr />

I agree with your reasoning, I was just pointing out that we weren't the only class this happened to, so no reason to direct anger at Beastlords exclusively.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">They can take away all these's AA and just give me AA's to increase hitpoints, and increase damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
You would think they would look at the class and see what they could add to it that wouldn't step on another class's toes.<br />
<br />
Things that come to mind.<br />
<br />
reduce hate on shaman spells like dots.<br />
Increase dot damage<br />
spell cast time decrease on slow.<br />
inate spell (this would be good for all classes) - this would be an aa that turns a under 44 or maybe 49 spell into a ablity that can be used like a clickable item. Doubles cast time. Or this could be an AA that can reduce the mana cost of a spell while increasing its cast time that would work on any level spell.<br />
<br />
Cano other - a spell that converts your hit points into targets mana or voice versa. Maybe converts targets hit points into targets mana.<br />
<br />
Give an upgrade to rabid bear that gives double attack of say 25, 50, 75 and reduces reuse time mildy.<br />
<br />
Give a rune effect to rabid bear.<br />
<br />
group torpor or quin.<br />
<br />
aa to increase shaman dodge cap.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you guys could think of hundreds more.</div></div><hr />
