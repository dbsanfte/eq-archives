<br />
Have all the questions been asked about the game and answered? <br />
<br />
Is there no one here to offer help to the new people joining?<br />
<br />
SOE know about the problems with out class, they may not appear to be doing anything about it but they do know. <br />
<br />
So how about for one week we have positive posts, questions to help people and that sort of stuff? Surely for one week we can put a lid on the constant gripes.....<br />
<br />
Oh and just for information I do have a 65 shammy on Brell, who is at the stage of just being pre-ep. <br />
<br />
I'll now wait for the flaming to commence...... sadly.   :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm all for positive posts ... that said ... it would be deathly quiet here as there isn't much to be upbeat about unless we talk about old content and other history.  If you want to find out more about that, use search.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Positive..positive...Hmm....<br />
<br />
Oh yeah!  I am one of the best PL classes out there.  Untill about level 50 only the druid does it faster, but with a shaman PL'er you have your offensive/defensive skills maxed.<br />
<br />
Umm...hey!  I can be a competant healer in pretty much all Velious content, about half of Luclin content, and tier 1 and 2 content in PoP.  In the content I actually try an play in I cant heal even one round effectively, but this is about positive things...<br />
<br />
What else is positive...Umm....Only the enchanter has more spells in their spell book...thats positive, right?<br />
<br />
More sarcastic than positive, but thats what I feel right now.  Im a Velious hero in a post PoP world.  I can say positive things about the shaman class, but it seems that all the positives are buried under 3 expansions of negatives and the &quot;man trying to keep me down'.  My class has been beaten down (but Im not yet defeated).  I've been marginalized in everthing but slowing, and my slowing has been mitigated.  And I still stand tall.<br />
<br />
I guess the biggest positive I can think of is that I'm still playing my shaman.  In spite of all that has been done to my class, I can still get a rush playing Thor.  Standing up to four mobs that want to tear me a new one and saying &quot;Wont kill me today, eat a slow, ***hole&quot; still makes me laugh.  Till the bitter end....<br />
<br />
wow, this went a different direction that I thought it would</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I love this place, I really do. I've learned so much from all the long-time players. It's really made my time as a shaman much more enjoyable. Lately, though, it hasn't been much fun to read the posts in the general forum. and Ceno's retirement post affected me more than it should have.<br />
<br />
I mostly solo because I constantly ride the bleeding edge of spousal aggro. 6-8 am est seems to be the mutually agreeable time that doesn't move me up the hate list. I even belong to a small guild, but they're on in the evenings so all I get to talk to is their bazaar mules.....not very stimulating.<br />
<br />
I started this game with a paladin named Flummox, then made Shiuna so Flummox could have a source of cheap SoW potions (didn't catch the lvl 24 thing with alchemy). By the time she got to the point where SoW potions were trivial, she was too much fun to stop playing, so Flummox sat and moldered. Shiuna leveled to 65, got all her spells (except expansion ones), farmed bazaar heavily for equipment, and tradeskilled her hiney off. It was a lonely path, however, so Flummox was reincarnated on a second account so they could duo (wheee! someone to talk to!  :D ).<br />
<br />
We LOVED the LoY expansion...perfect for solo/duo and plenty of undead to bop. LDoN was a disappointment.... have to group and she's been soloing for so long......Then GoD was a bigger disappointment, except her alchemy is 200 now. Nothing since LoY for my style of play.<br />
<br />
I'm stuck at the Hole for my epic, stuck at the escort mission for my 8th shawl....my roadblocks are a lot different than the people playing in GoD, but at least I have a way to break through them.<br />
<br />
But, y'know, I'm still having a lot of fun. A few days ago I cleared the Tower of Frozen Shadow.....never been there before. Even though almost all the mobs were green, The final fight was no pushover...Tess has a lot of hps for a caster. I think I'll visit other zones I never got a chance to see.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping that the new expansion will have more stuff for solo/duo teams, like LoY did, but I'm not holding my breath. At any rate, I don't see me quitting this game for quite a while.<br />

edit: While I'm fixing a typo, I thought I'd add that I LOVE Virulent Paralysis 3 and Suspend Minion 2, a soloers dream!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then post something positive.  <br />
Ask a question that hasn't been answered 25 times in the last 2 years.<br />
Compile some of your own data on a subject that interests you.<br />
<br />
Coming here and whining about whining doesn't add anything positive to this board.<br />
<br />
If you want shamans to talk about the latest content, then read what is said.  If its negative, maybe thats due to the content of the game and not due to the foul mood of the posters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am positive that I am a fool for buying GoD. I never even entered one of the zones yet! I am positive that I will not fall in to another trap and buy the next expansion! I hate being positive now...can I stop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well one positive we were in vp, I wandered too close and the drussla(sp) aggroed us, so the cleric camped and I was the only healer for 5+ min.. we won :) SHAMAN &gt; ALL. As long as it is content no one cares about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Want positive? Contribute by being positive. I tend to swing from positive to absolutely p*ssed-off depending upon which way the SOE wind is blowing. That said, if another shaman asks a question or asks for advice and it is something I know about I am more than happy to help them out with an answer ... a positive answer.<br />
<br />
Remember though, being a shaman is not a cookie cutter template for wise or noble. Real folks play these toons. Some are jerks and some are angels and most are a mix of both - more/less.<br />
<br />
As for playing Rodney King and coming along to say, &quot;can't we all just get along?&quot; at this point in the frustration level of the SOE/shaman relationship is only going to get you, most likely, a tad too much sarcasm in reply.<br />
<br />
MY 2 cp ... even though I stole it before I contributed it was mine to contribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">After reading this thread about positiveness, I did a search for positivity, and you will never guess what I found out.  That's right, there is a POSITIVE CLUB!  Never would have known that had it not been for this thread.<br />
<br />
I think what the board needs less of are threads whining about whining, because all they lead to are posts whining about whining about whining.  I guess I am guilty of whining about posts whining about whining about whining :)</div></div><hr />
