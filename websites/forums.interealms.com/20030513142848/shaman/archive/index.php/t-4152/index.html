<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Compleat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can a SK who is only 3 steps from completing their epic MQ the tear from fear and hand it in for shaman in CoM.  They are on truespirit faction for theirs until they get KoS on last step.  I have done all steps up until then but have been unable to get tear.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't recommend it.  I don't know jack about SK's epic and faction, but the person handing in the tear should be an already epicced shaman to be sure it will work in my opinion.<br />
<br />
If however, the SK already HAS the tear, it is your choice to take the risk.  Don't expect GM's to help if it fails and you FUBAR your epic.<br />
<br />
Fear isn't really that hard to do.  If your guild is small, ally yourself with another small guild and bring sufficent forces to bear (sic) to get your tear.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
