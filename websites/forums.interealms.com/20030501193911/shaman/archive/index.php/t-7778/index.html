Yeah, it still sucks as a potion, but at least it's something new.  What other potions using Yerbhimba can we try this with?  Anyone notice any more possiblities?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't care if they make potions that would allow fully armored Valkyries to fly out of my butt and attack the mobs, I ain't gonna work a trade skill that's been broken for 3 years and the only change they made to it was to halve the reagant costs and put them in more accessable areas.<br />

No singing &quot;Ride of the Valkirie for THIS Bear!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Not to say that the new alchemy is much better. It's too expensive, and skilling up any trade skill in this game is torture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">True, they had the new Alchemy online by the time I made it to 25</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is not a new potion. It's been in since Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, I couldn't find it in the Alchemy section  (shrug)   Thanks anyhow.</div></div><hr />
