<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where is the place to go LFG for 46 good exp? I've been soloing for a long time...wouldn't mind a rest, heal and slow, buff whore a little. I'll send in the dog, but other than that, wouldn't mind just kicking back and backup healing/slowing mobs...any suggestions on where to LFG?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">karnors, maybe.  CoM, prolly have to bring your own group.  Probably some decent places on luclin too, but i'm not familiar with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not too familiar with luclin zones for that level, but Echo Caverns could be nice, or maybe maiden's eye, but you may need a few levels for maidens. Not sure. If you can get a group to go, though, CoM is a fun zone. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I usually got 3 tells for a group as soon as I shouted in the Dreadlands.  People have bad things to say about that place but I always thought it was great.</div></div><hr />
