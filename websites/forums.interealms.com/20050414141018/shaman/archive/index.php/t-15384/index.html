<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone else been experiencing random crashes to desktop while in the game?  (Sometimes it says that eqgame.exe has generated an error and an error log is being written... other times its just as if I never ran EQ at all... sitting back at the desktop).  Still, sometimes my entire computer will reboot without warning also.<br />
<br />
All these problems are completely random.  For example, it occured twice while I was typing, once while I was running, once while I was just standing there, once doing a bazaar search, etc.<br />
<br />
The problems have only occurred since the last patch... <br />
<br />
My first attempt at correcting it was to downgrade all models to old world and turn off the sound.<br />
<br />
Then I reformatted my machine and made sure I had the most recent drivers.<br />
<br />
Next, I sent SONY tech support info and the log files... all they say is that my sound card is not supported.. which by the way, I have disabled the sound (as stated before) and the game still crashes.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I have disabled Norton Anti Virus and made sure EQ was the only program running... and, you guessed it, I still crash.<br />
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
All these problems have only occurred since the last patch, so I'm willing to bet its SONY's fault... <br />
<br />
If anyone has some info, solutions, or just to tell me that I'm not alone, I would really appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly it sounds your machine.  If you have hosed your drive and started from scratch.  <br />
<br />
First thing that comes to mind is a heat issue.  Video card and cpu have plenty of cooling?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have the same problem on a freshly installed machine. Nothing but EQ installed yet. I blame HW/drivers. I doubt I will be able to fix it, so I have pretty much resigned myself to live with it. Feel sorry for my group mates though.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First of all, I thank you for the responses... its good to know someone is listening at least :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stats on my machine:<br />
<br />
AMD Athalon 1 gigahertz (1 year old).  Upgraded CPU fan to best available at the time.  Also added another case fan.  I don't think heat is an issue.  My cpu and system runs at below average temperature for AMD chips.<br />
<br />
Video card is a GeForce 3 64 megs ram; most recent drivers.<br />
<br />
655 megs of ram (2 x 256 and 1 x 128)<br />
<br />
2 hard drives, both are 1 year old also... neither has ever given me a problem before.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
Again, I cannot emphasize this enough:  I never had a single problem with EQ until just after the last patch.  I do not think it's my machine or settings considering I did a fresh install and STILL have the problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, well, lets check the obvious.  <br />
<br />
What OS are you running? Have the latest service packs installed, and the latest drivers for everything?( not just your geforce? )<br />
<br />
Check device manager for any !'s.<br />
<br />
Custom UI? Try default for awhile if so.  Mabey this is the reason for crash to desktop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Running Win2kpro.  Have all the latest patches, service packs, etc.<br />
<br />
No caution &quot;!&quot;s in the device manager<br />
<br />
I do use a custom UI, but again, I've had the same UI for a looong time and only NOW I've had problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had the same problem 2 patches ago. The SOE tech board is filled with posts about this issue and the only response is this or that component is not supported. SOE will not admit to a software problem.<br />
<br />
I solved this by slowing down the ram speed from 200 to 166mhz. Not an optimal solution but it works. Try adjusting your ram settings in the BIOS and see what works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Since I have an &quot;older&quot; machine, and &quot;older&quot; ram, I am already running the ram at 100 mhz (yeah I know, I suck :P)<br />
<br />
I got another response from Sony... this one more detailed and with a tracking number also.  They suggested I downgrade my directx from 9.0b to 9.0 (first time I've ever heard them say downgrade).  They also want me to disable my sound entirely... which sucks but oh well I'll give it a try.<br />
<br />
They also said to see if an upgrade to my motherboard chipset is available... and I'm a little hesitant to upgrade that because then it could make my whole system unstable...<br />
<br />
I'll keep you posted and I thank you all for the responses.</div></div><hr />
