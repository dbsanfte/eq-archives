<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few days ago I was in MPG at the Blind Hunter Rekamu camp. The Warclasp earring dropped, but nobody in the group could use it.<br />
We were about to announce it to the zone when our druid said that we should all roll on it, as it could be used for guild tribute.<br />
This surprised me a lot, as I have always heard that there is no tribute on No Drop items, but the druid insisted on that many OOW No Drop items can be used for tribute.<br />
<br />
Can anybody confirm this or is it a false rumour?<br />
<br />
I have checked Lucy, and it says that the tribute on the Warclasp earring is 0.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OoW ND items can be used for GUILD tribute (only) i can confirm that personally as i turned my Soul-Imbued ring from MPG to guild tribute master after i got an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the answer Maitz.<br />
<br />
Nice to know that there is a good use for stuff that otherwise might have rotted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Confirmed True. There have been many items in OOW that I have personally looted on guild grind groups purely for donating to guild tribute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Some people also get confused with Attuneable items.<br />
As long as item is not Attuned yet it can be tributed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The amount of tribute is pretty small, compared to what the resale value of such an item would be in Bazaar if you could sell it there, but you can turn them in. Most bring roughly 2k worth of guild tribute.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not all no-drop OoW can be guild tributed though, and personally, I would STILL announce anything the group couldnt use to:<br />
<br />
1. The zone<br />
2. My guild (and the guilds of the group members)<br />
<br />
. . . and only THEN would I want to roll/loot for tribute. If the stuff was worth some massive amount, fine, but its not. One Bloodmetal Earring of Engaugement is worth 10x what most no-drop junk is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I heard about this recently also, but why oh why is it only for guild tribute?  Especially if the no drop items in question (warclasp, soul-imbued) don't give a lot of tribute? I'm a tribute wh...umm lover....I want some too :(<br />
<br />
Bah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wish they would make it where you could do something with all No-Drop gear.  I have a bank full of old no-drop gear I'm afraid to get rid of. <br />
<br />
I just know when I nuke it Sony will give like 10000 tribute an item or something stupid.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it actually paid off when the created the turn-in for Hate/Fear armor. They should create SOME system to encourage people to hand-in all their old gear. After all, wasnt that one of the driving factors of Tribute and the Casino in the first place? To clear out some of the untold billions of items that just sit in the bag of characters in this game.</div></div><hr />

Tribute and Casino was more to clear out the billions in excess plate floating around from various bugs/exploits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well yeah, that too. PP and items are all in the same chain, really. People give other players cash for items, then turn those items in for tribute. The seller hopefully takes the cash and turns it in at the casino. There are many other examples of pp sinks in the game, tradeskills, etc, but there wasnt REALLY a big item-sink until Tribute.</div></div><hr />

Just made me laugh, as being on FV those soul imbued rings sell for like 5k, as do most of the common drops from nameds in MPG. If I win any of that MPG crap on rolls, I usually guild trib it anyway if you can, as there's always an assload of those for sale, and I hate carrying junk around :P</div></div><hr />

Well, I think that was Fudas point. 5K pp vs 1K tribute isnt a very good investment for your dollar. In fact, its completely opposite of what I look for in bazaarable tribute fodder, I want a 5x return for my pp in tribute. <br />
<br />
Of course, FV is a special case. With everything tradable, the economy is totally different from the other servers. Stuff that sells on regular servers very well probably has almost no value on FV. For example, I used to buy up Bloodmetal Earrings for tribute, since I could usually find them under 7K and they are 21K in tribute, but on FV, Bloodmetal Earrings are probalby close to worthless, other than their tribute value, which may keep them up a bit, but I doubt people want to have all kinds of garbage like that in their bags (note, not calling BMoE earrings &quot;garbage&quot;, but on FV, there are many many better earrings that are not tradable on other servers). I honestly dont know, I have never played on FV. Its definitely a whole different can-o-worms, economy-wise there.</div></div><hr />
