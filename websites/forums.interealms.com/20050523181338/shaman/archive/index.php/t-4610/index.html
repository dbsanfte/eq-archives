<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Selkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I'm just busting with pride and had to share.  (Disclaimer, level 11, no uber revelations here. :))  Last night, in an Orc 1 group, the cleric was totally incompetent, but our group had no deaths.  By incompetent, I mean she was buffing only her husband, telling me not to heal though she was letting people get dangerously close to death, waiting until after a pull to announce OOM, going AFK without announcing it, etc.  <br />
<br />
I kept everyone sowed and buffed (including AC/hp buffs since she wasn't doing it), meleed, slowed and dotted the red mobs, and healed people when she neglected to.  I know I was the backbone of that group.  I really felt the power of a shaman. Just had to share. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I love it when there is no enchanter and I have to root park adds, along with slowing every mob and patch healing - shaman rule!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I love enchanters, I really do...but mezzing mobs can just slow you down.  As long as they are non summoners, I prefer to root em, dot em, let em cook.  By the time the melees are done with the first mob, the second mob is at 75%, by the time the melees are done with the second mob, the third mob is at 50%.  Then, it's time to go pull some more.  <br />

Assembly line of death, no waiting!</div></div><hr />
