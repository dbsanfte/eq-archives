<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Luxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Excuse the possibly obvious question, but would I be incorrect in saying that in general Shamen are happier than other classes?  I ask this because after perusing the other class boards for some time, I've been entrenched in the sky is falling mindset when it comes to evaluating the state of EverQuest.  After a long hiatus from my active lurking of this board, I returned expecting much of the same kind of negative mindset, only to be intrigued by its absence.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something big here?  The proverbial elephant in the closet perhaps? :)<br />
<br />
BTW:I do realize that the first 2 items in the &quot;Top 10 Issues&quot; list (effective healing and dps) for the shaman class are important.  However, how bad could things be if MGB Shrink is number 10 on the list. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Apologies if my post came across as troll-like.  I was genuinely curious in my initial question.<br />
<br />
You shamans (corrrected plural form of shaman as per http://pierceclemmer.us/marina/archives/000094.html) seem more content than other classes I'm more familiar with.  Cong for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't really think we are content.<br />
<br />
But we are a sensible bunch for the most part.<br />
<br />
We have screamed for years.<br />
<br />
To no effect.<br />
<br />
The ones who don't absolutly love the class are gone. <br />
<br />
And most of the ones who love the class but are impatient are gone as well. <br />
<br />
So that the people that are left are resigned until we get smacked a few times then the old bears get a little persnickity.<br />
<br />
Omens has been good for the shaman class. But Omen has been better for many classes than it is for shaman. So While we are happy now due to our abilities feeling good at the moment, as time wears on and the expansion is weighed and measured and all the suprise and need for the versatility and adaptiveness for the shaman gets cut in favor of more specilist attributes we will once again be left sucking hind tit. <br />
<br />
We will always shine in Trivial content. And when trail blazing shaman are an adaptive bunch Far and wide. <br />
<br />
It is the Very very large middle ground where we will show all of our designed weaknesses Vrs other classes strengths. And it will start in about 2 months time.<br />

<br />
No thank you, make the pet good or something useful to us. Make Bear form worth having. Fix our healing and burst dps. Give us some working focus effects in the new expansion. Make us more desireable to  group with. Make slow mitigation less of a shaman nerf. <br />
<br />
numbers 8-10 in are top 10 list are of no real importance, but are just the devs filling in the numbers. OOW thru us half a bone but the numbers of shaman that have already left the game after the GoD debacle is huge. I almost quit myself.<br />
<br />
This is a busy active board. You want to see upset shaman? Use the search facility. I won't, too depressing to read all those dedicated shaman who have left rather than be scorned by sony anymore.<br />
<br />
So in answer to your question the answer is &quot;Yes, you would be incorrect to say we are happier than other classes&quot;. We are shaman. We have many issues. But we don't all want to quit for good or spend all our time moaning about the obvious way that our power has been downscaled in relation to the other classes over the last few expansions.</div></div><hr />

It didn't start too heavily until GoD, but we're burned out on it, especially with SOE's &quot;currently under review&quot; cookie-cutter responses to what we feel are our most important issues.<br />
And I don't know about you guys, but I don't like being passed around from group to group like a shammybong.  MGB shrink is an ability we should have had ever since they started the &quot;let's cut down on the bitch work of most classes&quot; kick they've been on for so long... without ever really looking at shamans.<br />

<br />
The sky has been falling for shaman for so long, we haven't had a chance to evaluate everquest in the bigger picture.  Other, more balanced classes have had plenty of time to turn to the game as a whole, compare it with other mmorpgs, predict its downfall, etc..<br />
<br />
We are just still trying to get a fargin blast heal thats worth a damn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Gates of Discord expansion truely , hosed the shaman class over in my opinion . However I do feel that much of the damage that was done by gates has been corrected in OOW .<br />
<br />
My bigest gripes pre OOW were  ...<br />
1. Not enough healing power .<br />
2. No Group heal .<br />
3. Marginalization of Slow &quot;Through mitigation and super fast fights&quot; .<br />
<br />
OOW didnt really do much for Issue #1 &quot;although we did get a bone or 2 in the healing dept&quot;<br />
OOW did however adress Issue #2<br />
OOW to an extent adressed Issue #3 &quot;Mitigation is still to blanketed but at least fights are longer&quot;<br />
<br />
So in a nutshell the current OOW Shaman IS happier than the old GoD Shaman but he isnt truely happy quite yet .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Omens has been good for the shaman class. But Omen has been better for many classes than it is for shaman. <br />
I dunno about this Snoww. I think Shaman got more of a bump upward from OoW than any other class. Meaningful buffs (general consensus is that Wunshi is the best new buff in the game), a fair heal (FINALLY a 2K+ blast heal), MGBable group HoT, some reasonably useable DPS (AE Rain isnt bad, new poison nuke isnt horrible, don't have the new Curse yet but it looks fair). Combine all that with the Gates slow and I think we FINALLY took 2 steps while most other classes took 1, or in some cases, 1/2. <br />
<br />
They gave us enough to shut me up for a while. Sure there are still issues. Every single class in this game has issues all the time. There is no magic wand. Game and Character balance is a process, not an event. Speaking for myself, I am quite happy with the current &quot;niche&quot; I have in EQ. I feel strong, I feel wanted, and most of all, I truly feel like I am contributing again. <br />
<br />
Maybe as OoW goes on, I will change my mind, but I honestly don't think so. In fact, I think as time goes on, we will become a bit STRONGER. Places like BoT and Tactics didnt become trivial for shaman to heal in right away. It took time. People gearedup, people leveled and got AA, couple non-highend expansions provided some upgrades, and eventually, most shamans could hold a group together in BoT alone. I think this will happen in OoW as well. Might not be main-healing in Riftseekers anytime soon, but I can already keep a decent tank up on PG named if the cleric or druid goes LD or something. <br />
<br />
SOE has made it rather clear they do not want 3 classes capable of main-healing at the very highest levels of the game. They have made no effort to end the cleric dependency for raiding, and they continue to keep clerics in the CLEAR Number 1 healing slot. I have accepted my role as a SOLID back-up healer, debuffer, buffer, and reasonable DPS contributer in most groups. Its enough for me, for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your sight is ending just past the tip of yah trollish nose. <br />
<br />
Wunshi is probably as good as I am hearing. (need 40% to get it Just have not had alot of time to mainline xp and the 67 instances suck ass for xp but we needed the upgrades/spells)<br />
<br />
But the heal percentages are not different than before. The longer group based fight times will decrease as people gear up and learn the encounters and what to expect from monsters. And unlike Gates of discord (Which was changed if you remember because all the mitagation was killing the zones fun factors) Every damn thing mitagates slow. <br />
<br />
What has really changed is we got a placebo buff. Remember stats are doing little I am sure overcap stats are even less. So once the novelty of seeing that high number wears off and it becomes commen knowledge that the buff is a glorified hp buff once again it will be nice but not game changing. <br />
<br />
Spirit of might is a good buff. Hell maybe even a great buff. If they fix the stacking issues.<br />
<br />
The avodance buff is okay. I still havent gotten actually impressed by it however. Take up a slot in mighty fine fashon though. <br />
<br />
Did we get some help Yes.<br />
<br />
The biggest help though is not in the rote upgrades of our healing spells or a couple marginal buffs. It is in the duration of the encounters. And that duration is dropping as things get used to and worked out more. and the other classes get thier upgrades as well. <br />
<br />
My opinion of course. Am I enjoying the zones. Yes I am. But once I jumped into the Gates zones I enjoyed those as well. I wasnt happy with them but I took them at face value. New content. Once the glitter wears off of Omens We will still be on top of the same old hag. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Like any other class board there is also some exageration. I know there's very real problems, but right up untill I retired for personal reasons I allways said that the day I stop loving my shaman is the day I quit everquest and I've played practically every class to some extent. I'd definitely still be playing if I had the time to devote to it. That was from kunark right up to the end of Plane of Time and the beginnings of GoD. If they manage to find a good balance for shaman healing in relation to slow mitigation they'll have solved most of the classe's problems. The rest is mostly tweaks now that they've made buffs worth using again.<br />
<br />
Personally I just think the different classes tend to attract certain personality types, and from what I've seen the people that enjoy playing shaman tend to be fun social people. They chose a support class because they enjoy grouping as well as being generous and helping others with their buffs. They steered  away from being a cleric because they like to have fun and didn't want so much responsibility :D . If there is a difference in the atmosphere of these boards that probably has a lot to do with it. <br />
<br />
That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, there are a few things i'm concerned about:<br />
-Two or three of our spells are very, very situational (useless)<br />
-Our nuke could use a bump in power, and cast time reduction<br />
-Healing is a little under what I was hoping for<br />
<br />
But really, from what i've seen, things are better.  I can go LFG and get a tell for MPG or WoS in under five minutes.<br />
<br />
One BIG thing i'm happy about is that we can do some pretty nice DPS again via DoT spells.  If you've grouped in MPG you know what I mean.  Those things have a lot of HP, and all of my DoT (except disease:) ) run full duration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I definately agree with you there, but I think clerics got even more screwed on useless buffs. They get an upgrade to the heroic bond line which is completely meaningles especially when they removed dots from all the other hp buffs (even with the dots I'd never casted one of those spells). An undead only dot with ultra crapy dps oh joy.<br />
<br />
Our three worst spells at least have a 1/100 use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Blazz my friend,<br />
<br />
Wunshi is probably as good as I am hearing. (need 40% to get it Just have not had alot of time to mainline xp and the 67 instances suck ass for xp but we needed the upgrades/spells)<br />
It is. Everyone is reporting more crits, more procs, etc from the STR and DEX overbuffs. I am willing to wait for Steel Warriors to do some serious parsing, but I am betting it will pan out to be good.<br />
But the heal percentages are not different than before. The longer group based fight times will decrease as people gear up and learn the encounters and what to expect from monsters. And unlike Gates of discord (Which was changed if you remember because all the mitagation was killing the zones fun factors) Every damn thing mitagates slow.<br />
Well, I never got the Gates heal, so the OoW heal was a MAJOR upgrade for me. Dunno about you, but regardless of teh &quot;heal %&quot;, which is something we ARENT GONNA CHANGE, a 2500 heal ACTUALLY moves the tanks hp bar, and with more chances to crit available through new AAs, its even better. Serenity is VERY strong, and so is Ancestral Aid. The new regen is also solid. We got NOTICABLE healing upgrades. Also, no matter how you slice it, unslowed mobs put out a TON more damage than even &quot;partially&quot; slowable ones. The tanks I play with also report less flurry/proccing with Cripple as well. Fights are long enough and spells cast fast enough to matter, IMHO. <br />
What has really changed is we got a placebo buff. Remember stats are doing little I am sure overcap stats are even less. So once the novelty of seeing that high number wears off and it becomes commen knowledge that the buff is a glorified hp buff once again it will be nice but not game changing. <br />
I am gonna agree that Sense may be a placebo, by I get 80+ hps from STA overcap, and tanks get 140ish. That doesnt TOTALLY suck, in a world where an item with 130 hps is considers HUGELY superior to an item with 100. As for Might, I will wait to see how that all pans out witrh stacking and parsing, but again, this isnt a game of HUGE jumps, its a game of marginal increases, and every 2%, 4%, 7% etc COUNTS. If it didnt, then why are people so obsessed with numbers like that? +20 DPS is less than 10% to a Rogue, but he will KILL for it. Thats the game. Stack up lots and lots of little numbers. +10 hps here, +50 mana there, +7% avoidance over this way, +5% damage on that side, etc etc. It all adds up. <br />
Did we get some help Yes.<br />
We got a ton of help. Which class do you feel got more help in OoW than Shaman? After all, that was the statement I challanged. <br />
The biggest help though is not in the rote upgrades of our healing spells or a couple marginal buffs. It is in the duration of the encounters. And that duration is dropping as things get used to and worked out more. and the other classes get thier upgrades as well. <br />
As the players level and the encounter times shrink, so does OUR ability to main-heal in those encounters. I was main healing a group in WoS today, and it was a YAWN fest. I was doing slows, cripples, heals, Bane, a nuke, and STILL never got under 60 mana or let anyone get under 60% health.<br />
My opinion of course. Am I enjoying the zones. Yes I am. But once I jumped into the Gates zones I enjoyed those as well. I wasnt happy with them but I took them at face value. New content. Once the glitter wears off of Omens We will still be on top of the same old hag. <br />
And so will everyone else Snoww, so will everyone else. Honeslty, its time to stop looking at the glass as half empty. EVERY SINGLE CLASS in this game has issues, and if they fixed EVERYTHING, every single class would STILL have issues. Why? Because you CANNOT please 100% of the people 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
Put me in the % that thinks the glass is more half-full than ever. Put me on the list of people who have decided its not worth sweating tiny little issues, and just wants to have fun. <br />
<br />
Oh, and put me on the side of the Shaman factions that DESPISES the idea of Shaman becoming main-healer quality. If I wanted to be a main healer, I would make a cleric. <br />
<br />
I like my niche. I dont see it going away. Slow is being de-valued, but still has power. Buffs ARE going to parse out reasonably well. OoW has tons to do and see. People should really take Otanis advice from another thread, and just PLAY the game. cause if you arent having a blast now as a Shaman, then your EQ carreer should probably come to a close. Honestly, time to find a new game, cause there is a TON of fun out there to have. <br />
<br />
One last comment Snoww.<br />
(need 40% to get it Just have not had alot of time to mainline xp and the 67 instances suck ass for xp but we needed the upgrades/spells)<br />
Get out of these stupid instances. Go to PG. Go to WoS. Go to Ruined City. Spells are there. Upgrades are there. Need a list? I will put one together for you. And the XP is SO superior to the instances. The frequency of Nameds is also FAR FAR superior to the instances, honestly. There are nooks and crannys and nameds and camps ALL OVER those 3 zones, not to mention the ones I dont even know about in places like Nobles, Bloodfields, etc. You wold probably be lvl 70, with 5 more spells and a PILE more loot (or cash/trade fodder, whichever) if you never went into an instance. They are not the place to farm, Snoww, trust me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Well I'm really happy they gave us an avoidance buff rather than a useless agility over buff one. Now when some tank asks for an agility buff I can just tell I gave ya Sense, it's better. (Ya, they do stack... but less people ask for agility now when they see Sense up)<br />
<br />
I'm trying to determine how much of an impact it has. I had one experience though it could have been coincidental but on my guild's last Emp raid we were missing our top cleric and the CH wheel was a bit messy. Needless to say we had our tanks dropping left right and centre. Kept doing battle rezzes, buff them up quick and get them back in there. One tank actually had 11 deaths, lol.<br />
<br />
I was heading CC and had to be an offtank there so I wasn't with the Emp group and I was the only Shaman with Sense. So when the tanks were getting rezzed all they were getting were Focus and Boar from the other Shamans present. At around 40% of the Emp's life left I figured I may as well run over and hot them with a refresh on Sense. <br />
<br />
Once I did, I think we had only one or two tank deaths. Somehow we miraculously won the battle. <br />
<br />
Like I said, it may have been a coincidence but I'm wondering if that extra +7% avoidance actually made just enough of a difference to give our clerics a chance at getting back on track and keeping the MT up.<br />
<br />
As for other spells I have so far. I'm happy with the rain spell. Just under 2700dmg when all 3 waves hit. Was using this in ferubi and I was barely getting resists. Was nice to be able to pump out some nice damage.<br />
<br />
The poison nuke is nice, though I'll probably be putting it away once I get the new Ice one. I want to see my nukes hit over 1k :)<br />
<br />
New dog is a dissapointment. Still a speedbump and doesn't inate duel wield.<br />
<br />
New Canni I love. My finger doesn't hurt anymore from constant clicking.<br />
<br />
That's all the spells I have so far. Looking forward to several others. (and groaning about others I have to get first)<br />
<br />
Also with Ancestral Aid and my Epic 1.5 I have two HoT's and both are stackable and stack with Quiessence. :)</div></div><hr />

&quot;We got NOTICABLE healing upgrades&quot;<br />
<br />
But so did druids and clerics.  Our ratio of healing power hasn't changed with them.  I think thats my biggest gripe right now, that slow went from nerfed, to more nerfed, to consistently nerfed, and the healing percentages haven't changed.<br />
<br />
Just yesterday in Bloodfields, we were doing that Gargantuan mob, and one of the yellow (I'm 68 atm) Dreamweavers attack a pally guildmate.  I slowed it (mitigated of course) and then started blast healing as fast as I could.  Tank when from 80% to dead in about 7 heals.  <br />
<br />
Its time to rethink the priest balance if slow is going to remain nerfed. (and btw, I have all healing AA and daluda's atm.  Not sure that having Yoppa's would have made that much of a difference).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I have given up, its so simple, I do not care anymore. <br />
<br />
All three accounts are canceld but Shismar is still payed till next years May so I play him once a week to go raiding with my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">To answer the original question - we were the most unhappy class ever but we realized earliest that no changes were going to be forthcoming.  So we got to accept our lot in life a lot earlier than many of the classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">No we're not happier. But it's not because we suck. It's because as we get more powerful we get so vital to the success of guild things that we get locked into a role. The resident rogue or ranger can often just switch characters for variety for a night if he wants to, not so the critical classes like a shaman or cleric. <br />
<br />
But if you only mean in terms of balancing, most high level shamans I know are pretty content balancewise.<br />
<br />
The lack of balances is for sub-55 shamans who do not have near enough group buff spells or dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont disagree, Ung, in fact, I totally agree.<br />
<br />
But I dont care. <br />
<br />
I am all done comparing myself to other classes. I dont care if Druids have better heals, or Rangers have better nukes, or BLs have better buffs, or Necros have better DOTs. <br />
<br />
I like my heals. I like my new fast nuke and my new AE. I like my new buffs. I like my new DOTs. <br />
<br />
Thats all that matters anymore. IF I start to feel useless again, THEN I will begin the comparison game. But right now, regardless of our deficiencies, WE ARE STRONGER. We recieved the largest upgrade as a whole with OoW of any other class. If anyone disagrees with this, please tell me how. We went from a bottom 5 class to a top 5 with this expansion, IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Aye, agree Blazz.  I know I'm not the best, and I've watched 12k hp tanks drop on my watch because my fast heal couldn't keep up:), but I'm having fun in OoW atm.  My buffs are more desired, being able to contribute an mgb heal rocks, etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Everyone except Wizards are pissed, and Wizards aren't pissed because they are - and have been for the last several years - the most overpowered class. Everyone else likes to complain. Especially hybrid classes.<br />
A few months ago, myself and several friends all got sucked back in to EQ by a few other friends.  One of the other people who came back was a wizard.  While the rest of us have been having a fun time coming back to the game, the wizard has already re-quit because of his dissatisfaction with the class.  I don't really know the details (because of playtime/level differences we didn't group very often) of what made him so unhappy, but a big part of it was the fact that he couldn't get a group (he was only 62 yet had the guild tag of the second most uber raid guild on our server, and still got invites only very rarely).  Also, I dunno if this is relevant, but IRL he tends to mutter &quot;sit ... stand ... nuke ... repeat&quot; a lot ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, that about sums it up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Well just from what I've been hearing while grouping with guildmates and pickup groups, Enchanters and Bards are unhappy for similar reasons and Rangers are unhappy about their dps and heals.  I'm pretty happy with where we are.  I kinda see where rangers are coming from, seeing how their heal is toopid and from what I'm hearing their dps is falling behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">im happy! shamans rock!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Kavak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Well seeing as I have found the class boards more fun lately than even playing EQ these past two months, I think it kind of goes something like this  as far as their class goes and not EQ itself. (keep in mind every single board has at least one whine that they suck):-<br />
<br />
Clerics/Warriors/Rogues/Wizards:- Usually content lately. Few gripes about how boring the classes are (yes all 4 are pretty damn boring) but all have their roles (raids especially again for all 4, clerics being probably the best set for exp groups). <br />
<br />
Enchanters:- pretty unhappy (lots feel Oow has greatly diminished their role)<br />
<br />
Mages:- unhappy<br />
<br />
<br />
Beastlords:- About the happiest class overall for a while now<br />
<br />
Druids:- always unhappy<br />
<br />
Shadowknights:- always pissed off (hey they are sks!)<br />
<br />
Paladins/Rangers/Bards:- generally always unhappy for a while now. All 3  are convinced they should be as powerful generally as they were in PoP. Whether thats fair or not is in the eye of the beholder I guess.<br />
<br />
Berserkers:- Pretty much most have given up, the most useless class imo regardless of what any other class says.<br />
<br />
Necros:- Less happy lately <br />
<br />
Monks:- Pissed off since Luclin<br />
<br />
Shaman:- Well I am sure you know how the general consensus is better than I do :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats a rough guestimation from what I have seen. Probably off on a few classes but thats what I have seen for the most part. Phase two of quitting EQ is now in effect! (trying to quit the messageboards after the game :)).</div></div><hr />
