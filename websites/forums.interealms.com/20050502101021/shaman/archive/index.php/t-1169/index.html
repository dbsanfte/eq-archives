<br />
I havent been playing since the relese of SoL. But I reinstaled it some days ago, now im wondering if there is some new nice equipment from the moon?  that isnt that expensive.<br />
<br />
I have seen that the centi longsword has become realy popular and is realy cheap, anything like that for shamans? <br />

I will have about 5k to buy stuff to upgrade.<br />

<br />
Other than that, the best way to significantly upgrade ya kit is to get 51 and turgurs, this will open your grouping potential right up, and let ya get decent kit for yourself<br />
<br />
You could also camp the hunter/forager ikky BP in TT with a few friends, and get seb keys at same time I'd say a group of you, cleric, ranger, melee would be fine. Some other nice drops on this cycle to 'bait' ya friends with heh, plenty of spoilers out there.. (I used to do it with necro/ranger)<br />
<br />
Velks is good for easy upgrades (Crystal chitin&gt; JB), once ya get to low 50's.<br />
<br />
Kael is good low 50's (chain drops etc), a lot of fun but slowing resists bite until 54/55ish. Kael armour is better than JB on the whole too.</div></div><hr />
