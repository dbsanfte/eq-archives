<br />
That long? Time is flying, I guess.<br />
<br />
I honestly haven't thought about it, but I tend to agree and disagree with the usual people, so that I never made much use of the system. I bumped a few good posts, but that's it.<br />
<br />
What I wouldn't like to see is people suddenly changing their attitude, just because they think they can't be &quot;punished&quot; by other posters anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">2-3-05 does not &quot;a couple months&quot; make.<br />
<br />
The Crucible just feels better without the E-penixes.~<br />
<br />
beat deadhorse /off</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's the kind of things I don't get. Do you guys actually believe anyone of the people who had a &quot;high&quot; reputation felt special or super cool because of it?<br />
<br />
What world are you guys living in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Been gone a little more than two weeks.<br />
Been a good two weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, seemed longer for some reason, coulda swore it was the beginning of the year it was removed. <br />
<br />
Oh well, didnt actually mean to put this up anyway, since I couldnt think of a fair, unbiased set of questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All I have to say is:<br />
<br />
What does having the reputation system accomplish?<br />
<br />
My answer would be: Absolutely nothing, or in other words... absolutely useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blazz, at the time you posted it had been gone for 16 days.<br />
&quot;Sixteen days, that's almost two weeks!&quot;<br />
I think Blazz's new nickname should be Tucker.<br />
(Red vs Blue reference for the unenlightened)<br />
<br />
Leave it gone.  It was lame.  Even people with big reps said the stupidest ****.  It serves no real purpose</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah I agree with Juujuu it was just lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I thought that it was kinda neat, but had its flaws.  <br />
<br />
Either way, it wasn't that big of a deal.</div></div><hr />

Yes.<br />
<br />
In that case the end of the post is for you:<br />
<br />
What world are you [guys] living in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The one with EQ Rankings, Post Counts, Reputation Systems, LDoN server win rankings, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The one with EQ Rankings, Post Counts, Reputation Systems, LDoN server win rankings, etc.<br />
<br />
If you live in that world, you need to pull the plug every now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">WAR! unh. yeah. good gawd y'all. what is it good for? Absolutely Nothing! yeah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">This time, I would like a more serious response.

<br />
Don't miss it. Never saw it as anything useful anyway, as long as people can post such votes anonymously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That's the kind of things I don't get. Do you guys actually believe anyone of the people who had a &quot;high&quot; reputation felt special or super cool because of it?<br />

<br />
i felt special because of my reputation.. my e-penis was 3 red bubbles bigger than yours! (and its not because of loving women who aren't clean, either)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Years of karma-whoring ... GONE!<br />
<br />
Eh, just as well.  I mostly used my Green-Star Rep Powers (tm) for evil rather than good.<br />
<br />
Did you know that if you got more than six it gave you access to the secret Sub-Crucible with all the posts from the old forum?  That Eduin was a hoot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I loved the rep system.   I never looked at the dots under people's names unless bored, and they didn't affect how I read people's posts.  I took everything as it was stated and evaluated it from that.<br />
<br />
  I also never really GAVE rep bumps.   Just wasn't something I felt was worth taking the time for unless a post just blew me away.<br />
<br />
  What I liked, was that it was sort of the online &quot;applause.&quot;  If you posted something you were unsure of, or worked hard on, you could go back and check the rep bumps for it to see how much the post was approved of.   Contrary posts that weren't constructive I simply ignored most of the time, but seeing some posts in favor encouraged more attempts at similar analysis/humor/parsings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">For what it's worth, I got a ton of feedback on my posts via the rep bumps. And most of it was not in the form of &quot;u sukx harhar&quot; or &quot;right on&quot; but useful feedback. In contrast I got perhaps a whopping 3 PMs in regards to my posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Really it had little use and its no loss that its gone. Though I guess it could be useful in something like threads of improving shaman and equipment, then its not about praising/criticizing someones viewpoint but the people who provide the best information and the popularity of an opinion for improving the shaman. If that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm glad its gone.  It was used as a means of posting anonymous abuse by people who didn't have the guts to post publically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Heck, I prefer to have abuse private rather than public, then only 1 person has to ignore it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Heck, I prefer to have abuse private rather than public, then only 1 person has to ignore it.<br />
<br />
Sure but if you read my post I said it was stuff they wouldn't dare post publically - so without the the rep system noone would be having to ignore it, it wouldn't get posted at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think the system had its strong points and its weak points.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind if it were in, but I'd prefer a reputation system to be voluntary. the ones who wanted to have it, could &quot;opt in&quot; and those who didn't could &quot;opt out&quot;.<br />
<br />
it really doesn't matter to me, the few rep bumps that I had recieved were little more than a small entertainment. some people had appreciative things to say, while others just made small notes about my posts.<br />
<br />
I will agree that those who do participate in such a system should not be anonymous. your opinions are your own, if you have the courage to voice them in the first place, you should have the courage to continue to stand by them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">What I would have liked to see is something like this.<br />
<br />
• agree : comments ; anonymous or not<br />
• only comments ; anonymous or not<br />
• disagree : comments ; NOT anonymous<br />
<br />
That way, there can be comments that are not worth posting or PMing someone, without a rep bump and the big one of the non-anonymous negative rep bumps.  I never once got a negative rep bump with a name attached to it.<br />
<br />
I liked the system because it was fun.  I didn't like it because it was annoying and threads sometimes took a turn for the &quot;who the hell gave me a bad rep bump&quot; way.  It was something different, and I thoguht that the basic idea was cool.</div></div><hr />
