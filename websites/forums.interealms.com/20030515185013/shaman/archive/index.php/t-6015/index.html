<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quillan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just wondering where i can solo for good xp at 57 i'm in ful thurg and some wolf callers, epic'd and have all my spells except for drops from ssra.<br />
<br />
seb is no longer good xp :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I've read..the only reasonably accessable place to go with easy accessability is HS.  I did some soloing at 56 at the entrance and some in the basement: It was tough and I died a few times, but nice exp and I got to join a lot of groups when they lost a groupmember to RL stuff.<br />
<br />
There was a spot in shadeweavers' thicket that some people have mentioned.  I was there pre-turgurs and group got pwnd by the summoning fire elemental guy..but the exp for the other little guys was good as I remember.<br />
<br />
Edit (additions): Found a few threads mentioning sentient suits in WL, and the graveyard (plus other areas) in Katta.  Now that i have upgraded system..I think I might head out to katta and see what's what.  Before my luclin lag was too high. (end edit)<br />
<br />
I have been scanning all the old messages for more reasonable soloing spots...you probably should too.  Let me know what you find out.<br />

<br />
I love/hate Katta - 200 pp per hour and 5 to 7% exp with little risk.  Bank in zone, sell in Twilight Sea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Quillan!<br />
<br />
Chardok is good till about 59, two BoN just about kills each mob and down time is almost nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quillan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey Lendain!<br />
<br />
i know chardok is good, but i'm in the process of raising faction there, the spirit wracked cords are way to good a piece for shammies to pass up.... 100 hp's :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did ME on toiler hill and the entrance to Akheva as well.<br />
<br />
ME: pull only toilers, use whatever tactics best suit you, but personally I mixed up the IN THE FACE with the root n'rot.  These guys hit in the 140's and are chimps when slowed.<br />
<br />
Akheva: doing the entrance, the transient patrollers are doable, but a pain in the butt, the centi's are the meat and potatoes.  Stick to the entrance.<br />
<br />
Chardok: zoneout, zone in and lev tunnel are all doable solo and CAN be excellent experience.  pull with slow and you should be able to single pull most of the mobs.  with zone out there are 2 mobs that spawn in aggro range of you so be careful of how you break it.<br />
<br />
Suits in WL: At 56 these mobs were doable with epic and JBB with doggy and could be single pulled.  They are doable before this, but its harder to single pull them.  They are immune to poisen and disease, use slow, malosini and melee mixed with JBB shots.  They hit for a max of 117.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Korash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey Q!  Hey Lendain.  I just stepped into Seb and no one was there.  I plan on checking out Khatta asap.  Sounds curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My spot for great solo action is Gorangas in ME.   I have, buffed, 1014 ac, JBB and epic (no fungi).   I am easily able to handle an add without a problem.<br />
<br />
Advantages: <br />
<br />
noticable xp movement, outdoor zone (horse and JBB combo for negligable downtime), usually plenty of mobs to pull. Pretty quick run from Nexus.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages:<br />
<br />
Sometimes you have to deal with moronic quadders, no UEBER loot.<br />
