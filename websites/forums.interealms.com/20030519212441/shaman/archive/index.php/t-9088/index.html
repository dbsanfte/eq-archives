<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durgin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone please give me the low-down on the Kael shaman armor and Skyshrine shaman armor?<br />
<br />
Any information about which would be most useful in the long run would be most appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thank You,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kael - more AC<br />
Skyshrine - more hp/mana/resists/stats<br />
<br />
stats are nearly the same on most pieces, hp/mana/ac vary a bit.  skyshrine is probably a better choice.  but its up to you whether you want AC or other atributes more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">minor drawback to kael armor if you're a fashionista like me, its a fabulous pee yellow! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">skyshrine armor is prettier and has more hp.<br />
<br />
therefore, skyshrine &gt; ALL!! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i prefer the yellow actually, doesnt look like anything else, where the SS armor is kinda greenish like all the dragonhide armor walking around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kael is better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every lvl 51 to 59 shaman is wearing a full suit of wolf callers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't you want to be different? :o.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also the ac improvements &gt; the 5 or 10 hps some pieces may have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Both are good sets. Which ever is easiest to get for you is probably the best. Personally I'm only wearing one peice of either anymore and it's SS legs which is specifically camped HoT for to upgrade to from my kael legs. Other than that I'm not wearing any of either and have an almost full suit of kael sitting in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i dont plan on even wearing a full set of SS, but i think i am the only one who is probably going to do this in my guild. i have nicer gear for other slots. i mean why would you wear SS gloves when you could get coldain skin gloves? there are better, cheaper bracers out there too.<br />
<br />
i'm also probably going to hang onto my ikky bp until i get a lucky roll on vindi. rengen seem to make a much bigger difference than stats for me anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Avasheon Salvador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Assuming the question was asked about which gear would be best and that armor from either faction would be an upgrade over your current. Farm Halls of Testing for Skyshrine armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">http://www.eqshaman.com/equipment/velious_armor.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kael arms and helm are better.<br />
Skyshrine is better for the rest of the slots; both gloves are terrible compared to coldain skin or shissar.<br />
I can't really say either suit is a huge difference though, so go with whatever your friends/guild/raiding companions choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>pokalow998</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ac &gt; stats<br />
ac = after you slow , you need tank a lot<br />
wis = you can't use all mana u will dead with bad ac<br />
stats/hp = you can add form other item like fire opal fire(6ac 65) and PoTC earring etc...<br />
all 1 or all 2 resis form each part isn't good ..</div></div><hr />
