<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm curious if anyone else has this problem.<br />
<br />
/rant on (not about JBB)<br />
I'm level 58 and just recently starting doing HoT raids about a month ago at 56 or 57.  For some reason, almost EVERY raid, I get a tell asking Khura's or Focus (and of course for str/dex while Focused).<br />
<br />
Now, I can perhaps understand people having no idea what level the spell is.  I don't always know what level other classes' spells are (like Brell's Mountainous Barrier).  In all fairness, *most* people seem to realize Khura's is a 60 spell.  What gets to me is the people that don't realize that the group and single target are the SAME level.  I've had more tells from people who died or weren't grouped for Khura's ask for Focus than seems reasonable considering the level of the people in attendance and the fact that Focus has been around much longer than Khura's.  I've even had a raid leader direct people who need single Focus to ask me (being the highest non 60 shaman there) instead of the 60's.<br />
<br />
Yet, at the same time, it seems almost universal knowledge that Aego and group Aego are both 60 Cleric spells.  Though I've never played a cleric, so I can't say 58's never get bugged for Aego.<br />
<br />
Is it REALLY asking that much of people to know what they're asking for, or am I just letting the small stuff get to me?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it's not so bad being asked for a buff that is beyond your casting ability. what is really bad. is when the same person asks you after there next death for the same buff they asked for last death after you told them, after there first death, that you dont have that spell and it is lvl 60 and im below that. <br />
<br />
thats really annoying :p</div></div><hr />

It wouldn't be nearly as bad if they would make that fracking hammer 1HB. Switching out 2 items for one a few hundred times tends to get on your nerves.</div></div><hr />

They ask for Focus and they get Harness. Honestly, I've yet to have one single melee notice the difference. Sometimes I think they just like having the pretty icons and wouldn't notice if I just cast Inner Fire :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of the smarter ones (relatively speaking) actually look at their stats, but they mostly just want a placebo. Melees are stupid.<br />
<br />
Will they ever learn? No, no they won't.</div></div><hr />
