I hate ambush.  Last night I was lucky.  Palliance rogue took a shining to my 51 hunter friend and myself (51 shaman).  He would target me first, but he must have had crap gear or a crap build as he'd ambush and hit me for less than half ... most 60 rogues drop me into the last third of my HP bar in the first 1-2 seconds.  I'm not used to the alliance showing that much backbone (1 lvl 60 1v2 on 2 lvl 51 chars).  Anyway, we would have beaten him anyway with a good chance that I might have died, but we were apparently being being used as gank bait by an UD rogue (Domoco man, nothing but love brother).  Time after time the hummie would attack and be sent to the gy seconds later.  Even after UD rogue took off to help a guildie, the hummie attacked.  The good part of ambush is once they are out of stealth they become very weak.  Even though engaged with two mobs (priceless, the mobs were AEing and helping us with the rogue) the rogue seemed to give up mid fight when it was clear they were not getting through very well on my 3700 AC (I was pot buffed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On test they are talking 2000 hp ambushes routinely, and this is supposedly after it was toned down some.<br />
<br />
Dev posted on rogue boards saying they were trying their best to make ambush/backstab much more effective, gods know why. Majority of rogues out there I fight are still backstab wusses, which is why they always lose, but they can drop casters faster and if they didn't have their head up their asses in the hp department they might win a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I guess when you think of Rogues you think of sneakiness et al so I can see where having them ambush/backstab should be a great opening attack. However I could do without the stuns where you can't do anything for a good 5 seconds or whatever then constant interrupts on spell casts thereafter. And of course you are snared the whole time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Litche,<br />
<br />
so you think it makes sense to pidgeonhole all classes into one template? How about all mages need to be fire, all warriors defensive, all hunters survival, and all druids feral?<br />
<br />
All the best rogues I have read about in books usually are stealthy yes, but oddly, they rarely use daggers.<br />
<br />
I waited months to finally get a decent weapon, to be out damaged by some jerk off with a dagger you can get solo, easily, is just silly.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I never said there shouldn't be other methods of playing a character. I said I can see where they may want to increase the sneak/attack factor in a rogues arsenal. I just hope they don't go overboard, rogues are pretty darn effective already. As far as dagger vs other weapons I have no real comment not knowing enough about the differences. Balancing classes and builds inside classes is not easy. No matter what you do you will tick someone off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Warlocks basically have one choice if we want to PVP, and that's Demonology... That being said, it's nice sucking up cold blood eviscerates while the rogue is thinking &quot;OMG WHY WON'T HE DIE!?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok so dagger rogues are wusses who can't win a fight, they work on fixing that, and now you're complaining that your 2 button combo might be obsolete.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dagger rogues are wusses who can't fight, me. Because almost all go for 3000 hps. Their damage was always fine.<br />
<br />
My two button combo indeed, takes just as much skill, jackass, to be a combat rogue as it does to be a wuss rogue, grow up with the insults.<br />
<br />
If a dagger rogue actually went for some hps, they might have a chance against me. But idiots think losing 1200-1400 hps is okay for 10% extra crit chance, idiots.<br />
<br />
Hmm, if you are not a combat rogue, you do not use BF and AR, or riposte, so does that make YOU a button pushing no talent rogue? use your head.<br />
<br />

<br />
Follow your own advice and the rest of us might do the same. What is commical is that your statements about what a tough guy you are have nothing to do with what weapons a rogue uses. What you should be bleating about in your comically whiney manner is that hitpoint rogues &gt; crit rogues. Not only is it more accurate, it's mostly true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cappi, you are like every other dagger rogue out there, trying to pretend you are skillful and above everyone else, grow up.<br />
<br />
And yes, a 3200 hp rogue is a wuss rogue. Show me a 4400 hps dagger rogue and I will respect them, but noooo, blizzard has to up their damage even more because most are too stupid to get some hps.<br />
<br />
I hope they make evis damage weapon dependant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Mill, having read the entire volume of nonsense you've posted on these boards I can say with with full confidence that I'm more skilled than you. Not only that, I can have disagreements with other players about topics and I don't feel the need to disparge them. Maybe you would cry less on these boards if you sucked it up and tried to post in a constructive manner for a change. If not, please feel free to build up a head of steam, cry foul, and run on home with your ball.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hey Mill.  Could you explain to us the part about why it's impossible for rogues wielding daggers to get gear with agility and stamina on it?  Last I checked, about 80% of all your gear was &quot;XXX of the monkey&quot;.  As far as I know, rogues wielding daggers can also equip &quot;XXX of the monkey&quot; equipment.  I didn't think daggers had a restriction on it that says &quot;may not be equiped by people with over 150 stamina&quot;.  I guess I'll have to hunt around for the mod that displays that.  You remember where you downloaded it from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You can try to say it cappi, but then again I would send you to the GY every single time, so keep trying, asshat.<br />
<br />
I can have disagreements with other players about topics and I don't feel the need to disparge them.<br />
<br />
oh really? and what was the insult again about combat rogues being two button wonders? Are you that goddamned stupid you don't even know what you are shoveling?<br />
<br />
Juujuu,<br />
<br />
I said, a million times, it is possible for a dagger rogue to have stam, problem is, after inspecting every single rogue I can, I have yet to see one. Most hps I have ever seen unbuffed in a group from a rogue is 3400 something I think. This is why they lose, and why they are wusses in my eyes, not their damage. But heh, just like in real life, we need to coddle the lazy and weak instead of them smartening up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And dammit Cappi, you lose credibility with each stupid post. Skillful, haha, you don't even know how pvp works for crying out loud. hps &gt; then any other stat, period. We had horde rogues crying, that with their improved ambush and backstab, they could not one or two hit warlocks, gee, maybe because warlocks often have very high hps and are not dumbasses like 2500 hp mages?<br />
<br />
dagger rogues, two button pushing wonders, no skill, sounds silly doesn't it? Yet it must be true, since they do not use AR, BF, or riposte.<br />
<br />
Getting really, really sick and tired of dagger rogues saying how &quot;l33t&quot; their phat skillz are, yet they keep dying, all because they use two skills I do not, yet I use two skills they do not. Doesn't take a goddamn genius to get behind somone, nor gouge and get behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well **** Mill, I'd be all admonished except that I never said hitpoints weren't important. If you would learn to read instead of stroking your epeen 24/7 I specifically stated hitpoints were more important than anything else.<br />
<br />
I don't need to &quot;try and say&quot; anything, I come right out and say it. From listening to you piss and moan about things that aren't even a problem I can tell you don't know jack **** about the game. All of it is your typical bull**** posturing. You make these insulting posts and then later backpeddle decrying the responses and telling people to grow up. Maybe if you posted something worthwhile people would bother to take you seriously. Your typical  &quot;ME 4200 hitpoints, hit buttons die hippy fags!!!!11 wuss alliance no talent paladinss god mod blah blah!!!&quot; doesn't quite cut it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, how many hps do you have? What weapons do you use? Why are you so skillful, yet I am not, yet still manage to kill almost every rogue I have ran into for the past 3 months?<br />
<br />
How can somone as bad at this game do so well?<br />
<br />
You are like every other blizzard battlenet kid in their forums, &quot;oMG dagger rouges are l33t I ambush for 1500 ftw! Combat sucks, two button no skill!&quot;<br />
<br />
don't post like an idiot and maybe I will respect you.<br />
<br />
Or are you just pissed because you lose some 1 on 1 fights too often?<br />
<br />
You ain't got hps, you are a wuss, don't care what class. I have never come across a single rogue that has decent hp gear, it is all % crit or attack power or mega agility or some other dumb crap.<br />
<br />
You use a few skills I do not, I use a few skills you do not, skill doesn't have much of a factor in this game unless you are a serious wasd circle strafer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't want your respect Mill, I think you're a clown. I would however appreciate if you kept your idocey confined the grey. Barring that at least attempt to post in such a way that doesn't lower the collective IQ of the board. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">heh douch bag, only idiot here is you, can't come up with anything but insults, must suck being an awful rogue and a silly board troll.<br />
<br />
Stupid battlenet kiddies, shouldn't be allowed to use the internet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Mill, have you ever pondered that the only reason you've ever cited as why dagger rogues are no skill rogues is that they have less hit points than you?<br />
By your own words people suck because they don't have a lot of +sta gear.<br />
Does the inverse hold true then as well?<br />
Do you only consider yourself a good rogue because of your gear?<br />
Would you still be a skilled player if you had different equipment?<br />
If I bought a level 60 character with Monkey gear in every slot, that I'd never played before, would I be skilled because of how many hit points I have?<br />
<br />
Playskill is not based off of equipment.<br />
Character base stats are based off equipment.<br />
Playskill is what you do with what you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Juujuu,<br />
<br />
skil has very little to do with this game, we both know it, it is really just a few buttons you need to push in a certain order.<br />
<br />
Rogues with low hps probably have plenty of &quot;skill&quot;, but they lack the &quot;skill&quot; I guess of equipping their character properly.<br />
<br />
Honestly, what would a &quot;skilled&quot; person do to me that a dumbass wouldn't? Not much, even a dumbass can use CS, gouge, and blind. Problem for them is, when they cold blood evis me for 1700, that is a smaller chunk of my hps than they are used to. My evis hits generally harder than their's, and my SS hits way harder than their's, and I have the hps to use time on my side.<br />
<br />
Also, did you ever see me come out and say(non being a dumbass) that dagger rogues have no skill? No, I just said that to show how stupid Cappi is by saying combat rogues have no skill because they use a couple different buttons. She/he/it uses ambush and backstab, maybe prep or CB, I use AR, BF, riposte. Neither is more &quot;skilled&quot; then the other, but I will win because I do not sacrifice 1000-1200 hps for 5% extra crit.<br />
<br />
Funniest thing is, I panic as much as anyone when jumped by a rogue, but by the time stun wears off, I still have plenty of hps, I wonder what they are thinking when I don't just fall down and die, but proceed to shove those daggers/swords(why the hell not more mace rogues? mace stun rules) up their ass. I would love to see how those poor dumb rogues handle such a unexpected defeat?<br />
<br />
&quot;woot, I am gonna kill this rogue, heh wait a sec, why is he alive, heh, ow, ow, stop hitting me with that hammer, oh, hello GY spirit&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, gonna attempt to work my 42 mage, has full rested exp and mages in the honor system absolutely crush. Prolly get ganked so much cant do anything though hehe.<br />

Yeah, I love this. I can't even imagine what goes through peoples' heads when they're mashing away at the keys trying to cut through my hp. &quot;WHY WON'T THIS CLOTH DIE F$@*!&quot;</div></div><hr />
