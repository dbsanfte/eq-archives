<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can take a look at my profile, though I am certain it's not 100% typical of a level 42.  As for weapons, if you are going to melee, you have to consider that you are not going to do worthwhile melee damage.  Mostly you are tanking for your pet, so you may as well hit the attack key.  In this scenario, I like the proc that the Spine Chill Spear, or Howling Harpoon has.  Especially after I proc my tash stick.  I figure if I am going to melee, I want my weapon to actually do something worthwhile, hehe.  All IMO, of course, and I cannibalize while getting beat on quite frequently (have a pretty decent AC).</div></div><hr />
