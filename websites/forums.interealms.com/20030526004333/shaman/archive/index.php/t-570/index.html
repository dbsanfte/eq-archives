<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bexar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone tell me what the Bear spell can be used  for and is it worth going to Lucilin to get. Are there any advantages to fighting in Bear form, and what determines the amount of damage you can inflict in Bear Form? Any help would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are no advantages to fighting in bearform, and one minor disadvantage (cannot slam in bearform, just like wolf form). Damage is determined by what weapon you are using, just like wolf form (except wolf form gives extra ATK, bearform doesnt).<br />
<br />
The advantages to bearform are infravision, extra wisdom, and a little extra hp regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">+5 Wisdom  = 30 extra mana at your level<br />
<br />
+1 hp/tick regen - it all adds up<br />
<br />
Infravision eh<br />
<br />
The thing that really bugs me is that I can't tell when I'm standing or sitting because there's no animation for that in bearform.  Which is really ironic because when I first got Cannibalize the constant standing/sitting really bugged the heck out of me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Form of the Great Bear gives infravision (for us nightblind folks), dont know about the lower form, but I imagine it does. But, you probably never noticed if you have Acumen up all the time, like I do. ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: Er...or Ultravision, in your case, since you dont have Acumen yet. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's also handy for getting into the outdoor homes of elves.  You can fit into those rotten wood elf houses with the narrow doors in bear form.  Useful if you frequent Firiona or Kelethin much, or for hunting in OOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I personally have it on whenever I'm in a support role.  When I'm soloing or tanking, I take it off.  Bash is only 1 pt of damage, but I still get the (rare) occasional stun out of it.  Uncertain whether the 1hp/tick regen outweighs it.<br />
<br />
I also cast Spirit of Bih Li on myself when soloing... 20pt atk buff.  Worth the mana, to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, forgot about those narrow elf doors.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Predictably, but little known, bear form also allows you to get into the hole without using a shrink potion / rogue / key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I F.....ING hate that bug.<br />
<br />
<br />
so yes I have noticed, but I was unaware what was causeing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bah I can get into the Hole when I'm in regular form!  Or was that for the trolls and ogres?<br />
<br />
One thing I don't like about using bear form while meleeing is that the up and down movement when I swing gets really annoying quickly, usually to the point where I don't use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nochnaya Zhara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I just hate looking at the inside of my lower lip every time i swing.  as for the motion, my 55 ranger is in wolfform whenever possible so i am used to that by now and bearform is nowhere near as bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Does anyone else spend most of their time in bearform looking like Kojak?<br />
<br />
About 90% of the time, when I cast bearform I do not get the bear illusion, but look like a bald male human wearing no equipment.....<br />
<br />
...Why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizzli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I mainly just use bearform to get rid of my helm graphic, and allowing me to keep the stats of my helm.<br />
<br />
1) Cast Bearform<br />
2) Click it off.<br />
<br />
I like to look like a troll. ;) Too many brown bears all over the place nowadays.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like bearform. Personally, I could do without the up and down motion when fighting, but I like the regen and extra wisdom. I know I should use bash more, but I have yet to successfully stun a mob with it, so I just don't worry about it. I'm usually grouped with plenty of melees who can interupt casters, so it's not that big an issue. I do like the infravision effect. It saves me from having to cast ultravision, which is good. ;) It helps me fit in those elf buildings like posters above mentioned and LOL sometimes it scares the newbies to death. I can't count the number of times I'd run into halas and have some newbie turn and high-tail it away from me as they were low on health and couldn't take another bear attack. Anyway, bear form can be fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Definately go get it.  It's at most 30 minutes of waiting for spires, and 10 minutes of walking to the vendor.<br />
<br />
The look alone makes it worth having.  Just go into bear form and shrink yourself a few times and you're just so cute the high elf wizzy and cleric chicks can't keep their hands off you!<br />
<br />
It is also a great help to me because on my server (solosek ro), gfay is our auction zone and you can't fit in the bank without it or the help of a druid (which is something I don't really want :) ).<br />
<br />
Also, people are more friendly and open to you if you're in bear form.  It's like a gnome magician.  He's just so cuddly and adorable you just can't help but like him (different from halfling druids, though.  they are just sinister looking, like chucky the clown).  Whenever you're in bear form, people will lighten up and even start to call you Mr. Bear.  &quot;Excuse me Mr. Bear, can you sow me?&quot;<br />
<br />
All in all, shape changing spells are cool.  I especially love bear form because of the goofy looking face (gotta love that huge lower lip), and the newbie-looking run animation.  I can watch myself run around in 3rd person view and keep myself entertained for a good while (handy for when you're naked after getting wiped out in a raid in waiting for CR).<br />
<br />
sincerely, Jinheim The Big Brown Buffing Bear of Love.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hail!<br />
<br />
I also like Bearform in support roles, and in vending in cities like FV w/ skinny or low doors.<br />
<br />
An added bonus is when you are banking and low on mana, you can sit and be medding while still perusing your vault inventory.  You can do it w/o bearform on, but it takes some fast clicking to open the vendor screen as you are in the process of sitting.<br />
<br />
In FV, I usually only bank when stuffed full or low on mana, and the mana regen while sifting through bank bags is a nice side-benefit.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels<br />
<br />
PS:  It also makes a bear-hug a little more realistic. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I used it until my shammy got her fungi, then the extra 2 pts of regen seemed pretty useless.  Then when I hit 60, i didn't bother either.  No point in looking like a bear when ya got a sexy barb chick to show off :)  Too many bears out there now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">re: banking <br />
<br />
Sit down, then right click after the 'sit animation' is finished....no need to try and do them both at same time.<br />
<br />
you can right click the banker (or any other NPC) while sitting and they will still open the trade window/bank.  Unless you are too short to see over the counter once you sit...(in that case just switch to an external view).    <br />
<br />
Too many bears out there now.<br />
<br />
<br />
I could say the same about barbarians :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Andal Ecstasia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I always banked in Kelethin using Vision.  I'd target someone who was banking, go around the outside of the hut until just the wall between me and the banker, cast Vision.<br />
<br />
Now looking through the other person's eyes, click the banker and bank away :)</div></div><hr />

That's clever.  I would never have thought of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True. Bear form plus shrink is instant chick magnet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Umelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The one thing that made Bear form worth it for me is.......<br />
<br />
Fitting inside those FRICKIN wood elf house in GFay and FV !!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">One advantage I have found is that it makes moveing throug a mass of player much easire like on a lage raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Bearform and Paineel=good for Tuga. Paineel is like a second home to me (better faction there than Oggok :) ) and I spend a lot of time in that part of the world (leveling and farming pelts for smithing) before lvl 29 I had to do the funky wiggle to get through every bloody door in the place and it was still worth it. Now it's just awsome, and the newbies allways love seeing the bear show up, &quot;oh oh oh please buff me big bear maam'! Since there are so few of em' and they allways seem polite I never get tired of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The fact that bearform has no sitting/standing animation is a real advantage for me..I can't stand the canni-dance animations, and explaining why I'm sitting/standing/sitting to no0bs and ebay'ers gets tiresome.<br />
<br />
As a side note...on raids you can sit while no mobs are around without having a melee uber-boss yelling in your ears about 'no-sitting', like us dumb casters are too stupid to understand aggo as well as a tank.<br />
<br />
sigh...I need to buy a pony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Mwinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I love bear form. regen is good, infravision is goo, and 10(5) wis is good. For me it means that I never bother getting my wis above 220. I just cast bear form and boom I'm at the max effective wis. (still wonder where verant got the 230 - 255 crappy mana/wis idea.)<br />
<br />
I never even thought of trying to use bearform to get into little doors. Thats cool. Although I never had any problems using the bank in kelethin or any place like it. (I spent from lvl 12 to 18 in gfay and crushbone).  I just always walked around to the back of the bank (outside) switched into 3rd person view and swung it around till I could see the banker through the window. Then click. I like the vision idea too. :)<br />
<br />
I can't believe they made kitties a large race. Have you guys seen the kerrans?</div></div><hr />
