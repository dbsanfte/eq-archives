<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering of anyone knows when WoW will be released ? - kinda looking forward to playing a Tauren shaman.<br />
<br />
Will probably go for Dwarf Paladin (me) and Human Priest (wife) for when we can play together.<br />
<br />
Edit: Ooops probably posted this in wrong forum, Mods feel free to move although I think quite a few shaman will be interested in this question :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't know yet any sure date, waiting for it myself as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Unlike SOE, Blizzard likes to work out all the bugs in house before releasing a game.  Thats why they've had beta going on for like 6 months now.  No..seriously...people beta testing.  I know that we, who are framiliar with SOE's way of pushing out product with more holes than swiss cheese find that almost impossible to believe, but its true.<br />
<br />
And from what I hear from the WoW forums over at Graffes, its looking to be an awesome game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's in 3rd phase closed beta.  They haven't even tested max levels yet according to the WoW forums (I'm not in beta /weep)  They are starting to test higher level content, PvP and a whole bunch of other stuff.  I don't think they've even introduced all the classes yet (I don't think hunter class has been active).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rumors are floating around that Vivendi issued an ultimatum to Blizzard for a code freeze on 9/15, must be gold by 10/15, and released by 11/15.<br />
<br />
Again, this is ONLY RUMOR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Blizzard is one company that stands by the &quot;when it's done&quot;.<br />

I believe StarCraft, Diable 2, and WarCraft 3 were all delayed until they felt it was ready.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there is some pressure to get a return on their money, and to match or beat EverQuest 2 out the door.... but I believe blizzard will not release until it's done... AND that there's a good chance that any release date you find right now, will not be met... not out of sloppiness, or WoW being a mess... but just out of &quot;Its not ready to release yet, and we wont screw customers&quot;.<br />
<br />
Love or Hate Blizzard games... I think they have a track record for quality.</div></div><hr />

I remember when D2 came out for weeks you couldnt log in, they didnt have enough servers and there was mltiple patches if i recall right.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has never done a game this complex and people forget that EQ isnt a stagnet game with a few expanions to keep it going, its a living breathe online experience. YOu can literly live your life in EQ if you so chose to. None of the blizzard games can claim this.<br />
<br />
Im not trying to rain on anyone's parade, im just as excited about WoW as everyone else, but dont get your hopes up too high or itll be easy to be let down is all im saying.<br />
<br />
I know we all got issues with SoE, but just be careful placing such hope in something else. I mean i even find myself treating WoW like the second coming of christ, but wouldnt it suck if he turned out to be woody allen?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's almost certainly coming out in november. They're suggested that, their parent company announced that (long before the &quot;rumor&quot; came out) and their beta test seems tuned to that. Not to mention everyone expects EQ2 to hit at the same time.<br />
<br />
It looks like a fun game, quite looking forward to it. But between EQ2 and WoW it will be interesting to see how EQ whethers it all, of course how decent OOW is will have a say in that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, lets be honest.<br />
WoW has a long way to go before I will be truly happy with it.<br />
There are to many bugs, to many lose ends and to many missing parts atm to call it a finished product.<br />
<br />
However Blizzard does have a vision for the game (as can be seen with the recent water/food discussion and even more important Bl;izzard does actually listen to the testers and is not afraid to change things.<br />
As it stands now the game is better then any MMORPG on the market and that is in its current crippled state.<br />
<br />
The only thing that people may not like about it is that the end game raiding will be 20-25 player raids and thus no more zerg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Been playing two weeks on my friend's beta account.  It is without question the best game I have ever played (so far).  It is also the most casual friendly online game I have ever played (so far).  I've been meaning to post my observations as a non-raid player in the other forum but I've been way too busy and what free time I do have, I spend playing, not writing. :)<br />
<br />
Game is rock solid stable as is.  What's not done is content and finishing out class balance.  I can't wait to play with my rl friends and my old EQ crew.<br />

EDIT:<br />
Really really want to try out a hunter.  I love the idea of having a pet that I can name, choose, and level up with me.  It's like bringing home Lassi, and then watching her grow up with you.<br />
<br />
Now if you could equip the pet with gear like you do yourself, I'd be the happiest bugger out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
.. and remember that this is BETA folks.<br />
<br />
Developers always listen in Beta. DAoC, SWG and even EQ (for those who remember) had very constructive conversations with thier beta player base.<br />
<br />
When the flood gates open, people start paying for the game and the whineplay starts things all change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Blizzard recently announced that the hero class (whatever that was going to be) would not be available with the intial release, which seemed to surprise many folks.  Thus the concern that there are pressures to release the game sooner with perhaps not quite as complete of content as was orinally expected.<br />
<br />
I remember a post sometime back where the idea of an 11 month beta program was discussed.  That would put the realease out sometime next year I think.  I really doubt it will be that long, but I guess you never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think they would be foolish to miss Christmas this year, but thats from someone that isnt in on their Beta and has to put up with a hard assed friend that is (and wont tell me jack or squat)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">These are the same types of discussion I heard while playing UO when EQ was close to coming out. Don't fool yourselves, they still have to make money and will do what they think is in their best interests to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think they would be foolish to miss Christmas this year, but thats from someone that isnt in on their Beta and has to put up with a hard assed friend that is (and wont tell me jack or squat)<br />
He's just being an ass then, because the NDA was lifted a long time ago. You can get a lot of information from reading the beta forums at worldofwarcraft.com. They're open to non beta particpants to read, but only beta peeps can post. Still...a plethora of good info about the state of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">To complete the derail, some Woody Allen movies are hilarious, however despicable the man may be in real life.  Same with Polanski.  Knife In the Water is just brilliant.  Leni Riefenstahl, arguably a Nazi propagandist, was also an innovative filmmaker, and Olympia is still mind-blowing to watch even now.  You can appreciate someone's artistic or intellectual work without endorsing every aspect of their personality.  Thank goodness, or we'd have to start ignoring most of the great classics.<br />

On WoW, the low-mid game is amazingly entertaining and accessable.  I will hold judgment on the game's quality over the long run until we see a little bit of the endgame.  The game is not quite stable enough for release right now, in my opinion.  I would expect to see it released at the end of the year or early 2005.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think its quite an odd move to have such a long beta. I know it has to test so many things but of those people playing beta they might have plowed through most of the content before its released and therefore having little incentive to  buy.</div></div><hr />

I use to think the exact same way and can definitely relate. I was so fed up with the entire time investment required to get anywhere that I honestly couldn't see myself committing another 5 years to another game.<br />
<br />
Then I actually did it (quit MMO gaming) for a few months. Not just once, but 3 times.<br />
<br />
The first time I quickly came to the realization that MMO's, be it EQ, DAoC, CoH, WoW, etc., are by far more bang for the buck than dinner, movies, mall browsing, et al. The second and third times just reinforced what I already knew.<br />
<br />
All games will always have their flaws. All games will always have their perks, but bottom line for my wife and I is pretty simple. We spend less money when we're subscribed to, and playing a MMOG than we do when we're not. Even if all 5 accounts are subscribed ($69.05/month) it's still cheaper than one dinner at our favorite restaurant (Fogo de Chao, Brazillian style steak house, BEEF BUFFET!!! ) which usually comes in around $115 after tip.<br />
<br />
It's an economic thing for me, regardless of the game. :)</div></div><hr />

Im fortunate that the wife plays EQ (even though shes got a BL :)).Which means that we dont go out for entertainment near as much as we would if no EQ.Hell we still go to friends but that dont cost anything :).<br />

I don't know if Online Games are a big deal as holiday gifts since it is kind of the type of thing you have to buy for yourself.  I can think of no time of the year that more people are taking vacations and holidays.  Sure folks are off in the summer (northern-hemi-centric) but they are also doing outdoors summer things.  Mid-Nov will be the best time to release this game.<br />
<br />
I won't be one of the WoW players as my sig points out, but I wish WoW all the luck and its players all the joy possible.  Online gaming is not a zero sum game and the medium is growing.  The more successful games there are the more big money dilbert investors are likely to fork out the cash for new and better games to be developed.<br />
<br />
Successful games benefit everyone developers, players and the economy at large.  Online games are my 12 Step program.  Like Mill says they save me hundreds of dollars on bar tabs monthly.</div></div><hr />

There is NO PAID SERVICE for the on-line features... those are extras.  Blizz does not generate extra revenue from D2 or WC3 for the on-line play services that they offer for those games...

The fact that they recently decided not to add another data base system (for linked auction houses) makes it pretty clear that they're trying to feature freeze their systems.

I have asked myself this a million times. We are humans 24/7 why be humans in a game. Most of the time humans get no bonuses (sight  etc) SO dear god WHY?<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
As for wow release date let's put it this way EVEN IF it won't go gold this year open beta will be this year.<br />
And litgruv the problem D2 had in the beginning was underestimating the playerbase. See their severs could not handle the sheer number of players that were tryign to connect all at once. They did sort that problem out. They also know after seeing the number of ppl who signed up for beta what kind of numbers to expect (playerbase) so i think they shoudl be good. Game seems &gt; 90% finished from what i have read so we shoudl be good :D<br />
<br />
Soon oh very soon :)<br />
