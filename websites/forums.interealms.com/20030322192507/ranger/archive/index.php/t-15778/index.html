<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I thought I read that The Hole turn in can be done back to back for several rangers at once, but I just wanted to ask this question specificly and make sure. If you can describe the method of turn in so you can do this back to back I would appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Do you use sneak to just get behind him, then hand him the bowl, then sneak away again to kill the pop? Sneak plus Invis? Please let me know, as we have a few people possibly that want to try this tomorrow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes he can.<br />
<br />
Just make sure nobody accidently agros Jail teh wretched or if they do you mermblur him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>makrus quintius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, make sure all know not to aggro Jaeil the Wretched and you can do multiple  turn-ins.....I used sneak--handed in the bowl and Jaeil the Insane popped....we killed him easily (2 grps) and another ranger did the turn in.<br />
<br />
If someone aggros him you can try memblur if available or they can die....but only if you dont wanna wait for next pop..(I dunno spawn time)...<br />
<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />
