<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kenthil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone developed any successful method of defeating the other trials in the game outside of executioner? If so, any pointers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arbok of Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hanging is very similar to execution but with a little twist of CCing it can be completed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First of all, get 65 , or bring 65s with you to help, fire was hard as heck before then, the rest get easier but still :)  Second, dual comping is very difficult in these.<br />
<br />
I'd rate them easiest to hardest<br />
<br />
Execution:  Bring dps...lots of it.  <br />
<br />
Torture:  Bring dps, and a slower.  Kill the spectre when your team is low on health for a big surprise :)<br />
<br />
Hanging:  bring dps, and a slower, and watch the friggan fungusaur clones cause they make casting...difficult when they hit you.<br />
<br />
Stoning:  bring dps, and rangers with eq/am3 , and a slower and its not so bad.  Show the npcs what the line of sight bug is all about.<br />
<br />
Lashing:  bring dps, and when that dark elf shows up you need to do some exploring fast with one member who can deal some damage.<br />
<br />
Flame:  bring dps, 4 people who can tank (doesnt have to be a &quot;tank&quot;, shamen work), and a paladin, and get ready for a long night :)<br />
<br />
Please don't ask for any more spoilers than that :)  I defeated all of the trials when the last member of my 6 man hit 65.  My makeup was myself (65 rng, 250+ aa), Kraiven (65 rng, 300 ish aa) Dantos (65 mnk, 150+ aa), Ughmooze (65 shm, 150+ aa) Bizdor (65 cleric, 150+ aa) and Wyldkeel (65 pal, 200+ aa).  We waltzed through all the trials but flame, and stalled there overnight while we devised a strategy that would win.  All in all, the other trials take lots of tries, a few deaths, and most importantly, FULL RAID BUFFS :)  DO them as a guild, and you will have much more successes.  All of our trials were completed with enchanter buffs on top of our existing setup.  <br />
<br />
I also know flame was completed by Wiz Brd Pal War Mnk Clr with ranger atk buffs, and enchanter mojo.  It can be done, keep at it and don't stop trying :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kenthil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well... grinding to 65 in the first tier planes is agonizingly slow past 62... but I'll do mah best regardless ;)  Thanks for the info so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I disagree with Celt. Don't wait until 65 to pass the trials. Levelling is so much faster in PoV/PoS. I did it at level 61. Also, if you want real advice then just read the other thread about the trials. No need to create a new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ticat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i think he mean get 65 before try trials beside execution</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Borzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Getting to 65 before doing the other trials is kinda counterproductive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How so?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hanging torture lashing stoning and execution can all be done pretty darn easy before you hit 65.  You just lose a lot in between, get frustrated, and don't get anywhere for a day or 2.  Execution is so retardedly easy in comparison to the rest of the trials you can complete it with level 60's:P<br />
<br />
You won't beat fire without a lot of dying beforehand unless you are mostly ifnot all 65 with a very balanced gorup.  Fire&gt; all 5 combined, at least for me :)<br />
<br />
Or, you can be gimps, bring a ringer squad in there, and camp eveyrone out in the various trials beforehand, logon and loot when everyone is out, adn use the same 6 man to beat the trials over and over (like a few guilds I have read about :P)  That needs to get fixed, fast :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>i005237</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">sitting watching the trials can be pretty boring and basically with the time delay when a group succeds most of the time you sit there praying they will fail. so one tend to hit tracking a lot to check the progress of the group. <br />
<br />
With what Celt wrote here suddenly explains a bit. Seen a few times specially when a purely melee oriented squad of ppl decide to go thru the exe trial, that after they go in i hit trakcing and watch em, and then suddenly the team of 6 goes to 9 or 10  in very close proximity of each other. ( tracking same direction as the ppl i know is doing the trials and they are close on the distance sorting list)<br />
<br />
the pure melee group suddenly had a chanter cleric and bard ... log in aparently camped out in the trials room it could seem.<br />
<br />
kinda takes the fun out of the trials if this is possible, sure hope not!. else some kinda camp out prevention should be implementated in these rooms.</div></div><hr />
