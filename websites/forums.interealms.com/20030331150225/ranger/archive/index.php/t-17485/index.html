<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valedhel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You are better than me?<br />
<br />
It's not really a rant, it's just irritating. You, yes, you, the Pre-Kunrak ranger. :D<br />
<br />
I grew up in the Luclin era, though most of my leveling was done in old world locales. My trek to 60 took nearly a year. In the proces, I failed my 2nd year in Aerospace engineering. All subjects. No, I won't break off here to complain about how EQ broke my life. I considered that outcome during the course of my year.<br />
Back to the subject.<br />
I started a ranger on January 4th, 2002. I chose a ranger because I've always roleplayed a wood elf ranger. Before starting, I researched a bit using planeteverquest, as well as a few other (somewhat misguided) sites. I did not know about archery mastery till. . .oh, april? Found the glade in June, or so, a very fortunate time, as I think I was in my 40somethings, and the movement was begining to falter.<br />
From then on, it was full steam ahead, surrounded by crazy ranger franatic loons. *cough*oops did I say that out loud? ;)<br />
Fast forward to today, and I see. . .<br />
'damm noobs nowadays, level 60 in a pinch'<br />
'in MY prekunrak days. . .'<br />
'he was a prekunrak ranger, he prolly knows more than you'<br />
'rangers nowadays have no knowlege compared to us prekunraks'<br />
etc etc etc<br />
<br />
Ok, so this is starting to wear down the polish on my efforts a bit. Did I come all this way to be ridiculed?<br />
I had my share of falling off the Kelethin platforms day in, day out. And the corpse runs associated with not knowing the zone.<br />
I somehow managed to attack my trainer even though I remapped the autoattack (on advise from prior research) to Z.<br />
I never met the retiring level 50something monk who gave away an fbss and a ton of goodies like some of my friends. I never had a PL session.<br />
I *can* run from Kelethin to Qeynos, and everfrost too, if need be. Heck, I used to do newbie runs for my ex-guild (all of us migrated to everquest at once) at level 20something. Qeynos to freeport, no SoW, praying cameo held through gnolls in high pass.<br />
I recall distinctly running screaming from Re(d?)wind in everfrost after he first harmtouched me. I did nearly all my ivy armor quests.<br />
I can root park, harmony pull (till this silly latest nerf, bleh) snare without aggro, keep a party buffed, and use my DD spells to good effect. I gain aggro in 0.5 seconds if the tank forgets to taunt, and the mob wails on casters, and lose it in 1.5 seconds. Unless I fizzle.<br />
Most zones I've been to, I am fammiliar with, though my sense of direction is horrible, even with the compass (heck, i even get turned around in gfaaydark).<br />
<br />
The only thing I cannot do with confidence so far is to position mobs in a large scale raid. But that's only because I've not been in any large scale raids for a while now, nor pull in hate, as my playtime does not allow for raids anymore. <br />
<br />
So please, tell me-what am I lacking, to be truly recognized as a 'good', or even 'skilled' ranger?<br />
<br />

Sounds to me like you got them down.  Some people who have played for a looonnngg time think that just because you came in the last year you don't know your stuff.  It's annoying.  I've been on my current server for a year so I see sort of the same problem.  My friends know that I've been playing since launch though.  Even more annoying though are the people that played beta and think if you didn't play beta you don't know what your doing.  Those are rare, but I've met one.  Funny thing is that the game has changed so much that comparing beta to now is like comparing...a zuccini and an cucumber, at first glance they look the same, but that's where the similarity ends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kelliani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You've taken the time to fully explore and learn your class.  That's great.  The complaint threads are for those who have played for a year and know pretty much nothing about all the little tricks that a ranger can and cannot do.  I think you'll find it rare to see someone actually posting that if you didn't play pre-Kunark, you suck.  Most threads that mention pre-Kunark are just illustrating how us old timers learned the hard way.  Most also grumble a bit about how easy the game is from 1-60 today, but that's just because we wish we had it as easy.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dude, you're a rarity. The game was a lot harder pre-luclin and before the changes of 2002, which is why many of us (OK, so I'm ONLY Kunark-era myself) take the skills of someone who started recently and soared to 60 with a grain of salt. <br />
<br />
Frankly, it takes play time to learn this class, and more than for many classes. If you don't have the playtime, you probably (note I said probably) don't have the skills. You have to earn respect, and with as easy as levelling is now it simply isn't enough to have levels. <br />
<br />
You sound like you've done your time, but most of your peers (Warders with only a year in game) haven't, and they don't deserve respect simply because of their level.</div></div><hr />

If you werent there for the Dark Ages for Rangers that was Kunark you wont understand.Kunark damn near killed of the Ranger class and it took a long time for the prejudice and misinformation created during that time to wear off.Those of us who have played through pre-Kunark had no choice but to learn how to survive and hone our skills.<br />
<br />
You started during Luclin and are 60 already? Good for you.I would still assign a Kunark Ranger to an important job on a raid because I know that guy can walk through a mountain of **** and get the job done.You might be as skilled as him You might not.All the good rangers I see in action have been around for awhile.All the bad ones are new.Doesnt take anything to get to 60 anymore thats no test of someones skill.<br />
<br />
If your as skilled as you think you are you dont need anyones approval.You will show it on the battlefield,the only place that really matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My story kind of parallels Valeds except I I'm only 52 since I breaked from ranger for a couple months and I didn't get the Luclin expansion until my ranger was in the mid-late 20's.  Heck, I was still wearing mostly ordinary ringmail for most of my 20's.<br />
<br />
While I respect what I've read that Kunark rangers had to go through, what bothers me is when people post that noobs can now get to 60 overnight while AFK in their sleep, or saying it's practically that easy. I do wish I knew what they were talking about. I finally have decent though not exciting gear, learned most of the ranger duties and skills, and am stuck in the low 50's barely eeking out a couple percent exp per session soloing griffs in JP because I now have trouble getting in groups in decent xp zones (much less PoP) and I have a time-zone problem with many of my game friends.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, some of us still earn our levels and learn our skills the hard way and often don't have any options but doing it  so.  I've read a lot of brilliant advice and suggestions on the Glade and it has been an indispensible resource.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I find the same thing about Pre-Kunark people. I have an insane habit about pulling things out of my arse as a Ranger. I did the Eyepatch of Plunder in 12 Hours, (Dumb Luck), I wear a Ry'Gorr BP, Kromrif Leggings, and other lower end gear at level 49. I don't have the cash for better, I quest a decent amount. I can run myself blindfolded through most zones in the old world, Velious, and some of Luclin. I can go through half of Kunark with keeping an eye out for the Iksar. <br />
<br />
I know my zones, I can still Harmony pull. I can drop aggro, gain aggro, use my bow to deal out damage, or go crazy and melee. (I have a Flamesong and a lamentation, both of which I busted the crap out of my Bank to trade for and Buy through gear I couldn't sell otherwise). I use a Brain of the Beaked Bear I got by a freak accident. <br />
<br />
My Guild knows I AM a better Ranger than the level 58 Ranger who has been playing since Kunark, and he admits it. He has problems dropping aggro without Jolt to this day. I can Gain it, save our Cleric, and redrop it faster than he can cast snare. <br />
<br />
I have been playing since the Luclin Era. I never met the guy who was giving away the FBSS, and I have turned down free pieces of gear at lower levels JUST TO CRAWL my way up. If I wanted a blasted easy life, i would have been a Druid. My friends and I know, and I prove time and time again, that I am the best puller outdoor in the guild, like it or not. I have out aggroed a 54 SK who couldn't get the aggro from the cleric, dropped it to a Paladin lower than me, who switched it back to the SK. <br />
<br />
I have never been PLed in my life and have personally shunned it even for alts. I am only level 49 and trying to drag my way through the XP.<br />
<br />
Now, I went out to learn all this, and more, and you people say &quot;I would trust someone playing since Pre-Kunark.&quot; <br />
<br />
Just because they were around in Kunark does NOT mean that it taught them a damn thing. In fact, I have met quite a few idiots who were around Pre-Kunark. That is not, should never be, or ever will be in indicator of someone's skill. What is the determining factor is how they perform BEFORE that situation. I wouldn't send the Pre-Kunark Ranger ifn the newer Ranger knew more of his ****. That would be retarded, predjudice, and stupid. That would be a mistake that I would be forced to regret. For all of the talk of Bigotry on the Rants section in other threads, I have never seen a more bigoted post than &quot;All Pre-Kunark Rangers know their stuff.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me add to that excellent list.<br />
<br />
I saw my first rez at level 35.....<br />
I bought an Ebony Sword for 750 pp when I was level 35. It was a bargain.<br />
I ended up tanking everything I faced .... no jolt<br />
I spent 12000 pp on a Crystalized Short Sword at level 50 that sells today for 200 pp in bazaar.<br />
I wore Patchwork well into my teens and banded mail well into my 30's<br />
FBSS used to cost 25000 plat<br />
A short Sword of Ykesha (8/24 75 dd proc)<br />
used to cost 20,000 plat, it was the best sword in game although some might argue that the Waki (7/21) was better !Most Rangers nowadays have probably never heard of them.<br />
My first weapons upgrade was a minotaur battle axe at level 6, paid 10 pp for it too. We used to dream of saving 63 pp to buy a combine longsword to hit magic creatures.<br />
At level 30 it took me 3 days to raise conjuration above 100 so I could cast swarm without fizzling, there was no Dance of Fireflys or &quot;clarity&quot; back then.<br />
I could solo Maid/Butler camp with self buffs at level 49<br />
There were two zones that gave experience above level 47 or so, Sol B and Lguk, and they were camped to the gills.<br />
<br />
Anyone that leveled pre-Luclin  has a wealth of experience's that worth more than all the Centi Longswords in Norrath combined.<br />
<br />
And btw in case you havent noticed its Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He has problems dropping aggro without Jolt to this day.<br />

That should be a good thing, in most cases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It can be good and bad. Where as I can get the aggro without Jolt, keep it, hold it, and dump it at will. He can't. He has problems losing aggro period. It's common knowledge. He's just too twinked with procing weapons for his own good but he refuses to drop them &quot;In the name of DPS&quot;. Lot of good the DPS did him when Captain Bvellos in Kael ripped him a new one, huh? Real fine job when I saved the cleric right after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You can not &quot;dump it at will&quot; without Jolt.  Not unless there's some new aggro-reducing spell or ability we get pre-51 that I don't know about.<br />
<br />
Additionally, him getting top aggro with weapons, etc. means he's not using Jolt enough (or Snaring too early); it does not mean that he should try using a centi LS instead of a frostbringer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't need to. If you can control your aggro pre-jolt level then you have no problems.

root, back off, turn off autoattack for 5 seconds, then attack again, but not getting closer than MT.<br />

No special ability, though it is pre-51. :D</div></div><hr />

I just have a big ego in front of all of that to feel like I can do anything put in front of me. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valedhel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I did not intend this to become a collection of life stories, and how gear has improved over the ages, but if you must. . .<br />

1) I was using a frozen longsword and a tarnished bastardsword till the high 20's.<br />
2) After painstakingly saving money for a month or two, and enough unrezzed deaths to make a mortician cringe, I bought a blackened alloy bastard sword for the eqprices price of 100pp.<br />
3) Before questing for ivy etched, I was wearing a lockjaw hide vest that I won after a group of us killed LJ.<br />

6) I have no idea where the heck the rest of my money went, eaten or something.<br />
7) My first haste item, I bought in my high 50's. I never got swiftwind due to my playtime and such.<br />
<br />
Let me make clear, however: <br />
I do not wish to claim superiority to the Pre-Kunrak rangers. I mereley wish to be recognized as an equal and an end to prekunrak elitism. Skilled rangers should be skilled rangers, no matter when they started playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Peatnallie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd have to agree with Elured on the point that pre-jolt, you rely heavily on your main tank to peel a mob off of you, as you cannot shed of aggro in a heart beat to avoid damage.. well, other than a good ol root, but you still rely on someone to regain aggro if you aren't tanking ;). <br />
<br />
Besides, any ranger who has made it through the kunark era should consider it an accomplishment, but theres no point in boasting about it. Humility is a good thing :). I haven't personally seen someone say &quot;I'm pre-kunark and better than you!!&quot;, but if they have, you (those you have started post kunark) shouldn't necessarily stereotype them to be asses. Sure not every pre-kunark rangers are the best, you meet good ones, and bad ones. It's the person behind the character that counts :). <br />
<br />
Valdaar, to be recognized as a good/skilled ranger, you first have to see yourself as one, actual ranger skills follow closely behind :). Ignore the narrow-minded people who say they believe pre-kunark people are the best. The people that the pre-kunark rangers were referring to about the lack of knowledge are those who are usually twinked/powerlevelled just to become &quot;uber&quot; and have not learned their class to their best abilities. It seems that you have, so you do not have to find it offensive to your abilities.<br />
<br />
Entilzah, I'm not sure if you still need advice but.. the low 50's are probably the toughest of levels for the rangers, mainly because, besides jpf, there are a few places to fear kite. I would recommend you keep trying to find groups in sebilis, velkators, maiden's eye, and it's best if you group with guildmates, as it makes it easier than waiting with a lfg tag.<br />
<br />
Siriath, there sure is alot of animosity in your posts. It's like your saying prekunark rangers don't know crap, because you've seen one in action. For one thing, rangers learn through experience, and to those who are open-minded, they learn more everyday. <br />
<br />
If you see yourself as a good ranger, don't let anyone talk you down, but don't get flame happy either.. that is all :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bellia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Why is that not dumping at will? <br />
<br />
IMO, dumping at will means, anytime *I* chose, I can make the mob beat on someone else.  <br />
<br />
And as for Jolt... um... not every ranger is old enough to have Jolt.  The game does not start at 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's not the same.  Losing 500 points of hate is not the same as rooting.  Additionally, root resists a lot more than Jolt and Cinder Jolt in most cases.<br />
<br />
Causing the mob to temporarily (for as little as 1 tic) beat on the person closest to it is just not the same as moving yourself down the hatelist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Peatnallie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Why is rooting not dumping at will?<br />
<br />
You still have aggro after rooting, and you rely on someone else to take aggro off of you. You have to wait till the person establishes set aggro before you continue, if you do not want to be hit. Otherwise, it's root, root, root, till the mob dies. The difference between rooting and jolting is that jolt is specifically meant to reduce aggro on the mob. You can dump a significant amount of aggro with one cast, and probably won't have to worry about aggro the rest of the fight, depending on who is tanking for you of course, and other factors. These two have pretty much the same result though, you aren't being attacked!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I see this argument all the time except replace new Ranger and Pre-Kunark Ranger with Teen and Parents. Your arguments are just as invalid as that one is, a Teen may be smarter than his/her Parents, but without real world experience it is just theories.<br />
<br />
For the record I don't consider myself an exceptional or even a good ranger. But in my guild I am the oldest ranger in terms of starting date and I always get complimented by guildmates on my playstyle and aggro control (I take it and I keep it through hell and high waters). When I think of people who know Rangering, I turn to Underbrush and Ladas on Terris Thule, both of whom started pre-kunark, I have yet to meet another ranger from any era of play that approaches the level of skill these two possess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Valedhel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">A most exellent comparisam, Hopwin, never thought of it that way.<br />
At what point would a teen be considered an adult by the parent then? I mean, I've seen 80something year old people still preceive their children as 10 year olds, or teens, even.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank all the Kunrak rangers for what they made the ranger class what it is today. Without your actions, the ranger class would be the least respected class of them all. Your efforts changed the dev's minds, not a mean task. <br />
<br />
However, I am tired of being, as Hopwin so rightly compared it to, being treated as a child, or teenager. I'm sorry, but it's been 3 expansions now, your kids have grown up and are leaving home. Please, treat us as adults now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Maggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Come on folks, some of you old schoolers are making us sound like the old timers who creak on their rockers saying &quot;in myyy day we had to walk to school in the snow barefoot! uphill! BOTH ways!&quot;<br />
<br />
We were LUCKY that we got to start at the beginning. Granted some things were not available, but read some of the posts in the general forum on how many of us miss those old days and how exciting they were. <br />
<br />
My opinion is that if you want to be a good ranger, you will be. If you dedicate yourself to playing your class well and with skill than that is what it takes. Yes, having a lot thrown at you at lower levels (easy access to good loot, twinking from friends, huge exp zones, etc) makes it verrrry tempting to take short cuts, but, if you're a smart player, you'll know how to use those to your advantage, not to your detriment.<br />
<br />
I feel pretty darn lucky that I was around to see EQ from the beginning, but sometimes all that 'stuff&quot; that we had to deal with was nothing more than a lesson in patience....long long journeys to do CR's, exp penalties for hybrids etc. That didn't teach me to be a better ranger. Trying, failing, trying again, failing and learning from my mistakes did. <br />
<br />
If the beginning rangers don't allow themselves the opportunity to do that, then they have no one to blame but themselves. But you can certainly do that in this current time of EQ, just takes the determination to BE a good ranger!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you did, so let's get on with it.  My Ranger was created 3/16/99, the day the game went live.<br />
<br />
1) I was using a frozen longsword and a tarnished bastardsword till the high 20's.<br />
<br />
I had a Combine Longsword (bought from the vendor!) and  Silvery War Axe in my high teens, a Tentacle Whip before I could dual-wield which I used to kill Wisps for money.  Then I got a SSoM in the high 20s.<br />
<br />
2) After painstakingly saving money for a month or two, and enough unrezzed deaths to make a mortician cringe, I bought a blackened alloy bastard sword for the eqprices price of 100pp.<br />
<br />
Back then it wasn't understood that 2H weapons are superior to dual-wield until level 35 or so, so I had a 2H skill of about three.  I didn't start working on it until I was over 50.<br />
<br />
I didn't get experience ressurections on a regular basis until I hit 45.  I just ate the deaths and kept going.<br />
<br />
3) Before questing for ivy etched, I was wearing a lockjaw hide vest that I won after a group of us killed LJ.<br />
<br />
I had blackened iron.  Not alloy; that didn't exist yet.<br />
<br />
4) I was using ivy etched and Ry'Gorr till 58. The rest of me was a patchwork of cloth and the occational chain.<br />
<br />
You got me here; I was in nearly full ivy by 40 or so.  (No helm, didn't want the graphic, and no gloves, too hard to get and I prefered Dark Mail anyway.)  At 45 I had a Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate (looted) which I wore to reduce downtime and a Tree Weave.  At 47 or 48 or so I went to my first Fear raid and got the TV chest off the last TT (the one in the temple).<br />
<br />
5) The two pieces of gear I was most proud of till 55 or so, was my centi longsword and my lamentation.<br />
<br />
I had both epics at 55.  Prior to that I had the planar weapons, Rat Whip and Flux Axe.  Lamentations were obscenely expensive, far out of my reach, and we just didn't HAVE tradeable weapons of Centi quality.  Between the planars and the 20s stuff I first had Yaks, a SS and a Dragon Horn, then I ditched the SS for a Wurmslayer.<br />
<br />
6) I have no idea where the heck the rest of my money went, eaten or something.<br />
<br />
Oh, I went through cash like mad.  I did have one advantage: the fletching market hadn't been destroyed and I was a 200 Fletcher (the cap at the time) before I was 30.  I made and sold bows to finance my equipment acquisitions.<br />
<br />
7) My first haste item, I bought in my high 50's. I never got swiftwind due to my playtime and such.<br />
<br />
Around 45 for me, an FBSS.  Then I swapped it for a Swirlspine; I soloed a lot, we didn't have Panic and we thought AC did something.<br />
<br />
Let me make clear, however: <br />
I do not wish to claim superiority to the Pre-Kunrak rangers. I mereley wish to be recognized as an equal and an end to prekunrak elitism. Skilled rangers should be skilled rangers, no matter when they started playing. <br />
<br />
I agree that people should receive due credit for their skills.<br />
<br />
However, you are never going to &quot;end pre-Kunark elitism&quot;.  Rangers who lived through the Dark Ages -- especially those who were high level at the time, which I was not  -- walked a much, much more difficult path than anything any  Ranger born after Velious has endured, and they will always be a breed apart for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Malevant Faeshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Bah, Valedhel, when *I* was your age, things were different!  We didn't have any newfangled &quot;PoK books&quot; or &quot;Nexus&quot; or &quot;Jolt&quot; or &quot;Haste&quot;...<br />
<br />
We used to journey 2 hours, uphill both ways in the snow from the Orc lift to Crushbone, just to die and eat an unrezzed death... AND WE LIKED IT!  It built character, you young'uns have no character!<br />
<br />
We used to all run around with rusty weapons we had wrested from the cold dead hands of Orc Pawns that we had zerg rushed to be able to kill... AND WE LIKED IT! None of this newfangled &quot;Ratio&quot; crap.  There were TWO types of weapons in the game; Newbie weapon, and Rusty.  And it took a Grandmaster Smith to use a Sharpening stone in those days, only there weren't any because all the skills capped at 12!<br />
<br />
We used to run around in our guild tunics in Greater Faydark shouting &quot;Hoo-dee-doo! I have 4 AC!&quot; because no one had any better armor, except for one Necro on the server who could afford banded and he would only put it on his pet in the middle of CB to taunt us... AND WE LIKED IT!  None of this nancing around in your uppity &quot;Ivy Etched&quot; and &quot;Thurg Quest&quot; armor... only 5 people on my server had Patchwork, and they were all so uber that we only saw them when we ran by the dwarf docks camp in BBM, because they were ALL DRUIDS!<br />
<br />
Speaking of docks, boats used to take 3 hours to get from one end of the ocean to another... real time.  And there were pirates, GNOME PIRATES who would get on, and steal your rusted scimitar because your body would fall off the boat and all the necro's were out giving banded armor to their pets so they couldn't summon it for you and it rotted... AND WE LIKED IT! None of this wimpy &quot;Oh, can I have a port plz, pst!&quot; crap; there was 2 people on my server who could port, and they were both 2-boxed toons of Banded-Armor chucking necros!<br />
<br />
We used to run in fear from the Napper, he was the Sleepers grandfather, y'see.  They don't have dragons like him any more.  He could only be killed by a raid force of 70 level 10s, and the tank had to have banded armor, only he never did because all the Necros had it, so the Napper kept killing everyone until one of the Necros solo'd him with his pet... AND WE LIKED IT!  None of these noncey little &quot;1200pt a tick DoT&quot; dragons you get these days.  The Napper had CHARACTER, you were PROUD to be eaten by him, not bitch over some horrid CR past the shrooms!<br />
<br />
And in MY day, we used to need Orc-Bane weapons to kill Emporer Crush, only we didn't HAVE any orc bane weapons, because all the Necros had given them to their pets, so we tried to kill him using Chain casts of Flame lick, and then he ate us and camped our corpses til they rotted... AND WE LIKED IT! Dwarven Ringmail Tunics went for 3 million kpp in those days, which only the necros could afford, and then they gave them to their pets!<br />
<br />
And in my day, we didn't have any of this &quot;LFG&quot; junk!  We used to run around, and if we couldn't find a group, we'd go outside and build a pile of mud and throw sticks at it... AND WE LIKED IT! None of this watery &quot;/lfg ON&quot; commands, unless you were a necro, you couldn't get a group, and all the necros were too busy making banded armor for their pets, so we all just played with mud.<br />
<br />
And... in MY day, we didn't have things like &quot;PST&quot; or &quot;wtb&quot; or any of these other noncey abreviations!  We didn't even have class titles, Rangers were known as &quot;Those who agro many things and then die to Emporer Crush because they run out of Flame Lick Mana&quot; and bards were called &quot;Prancing oddly androgenous and arousing nadgers who run annoying fast and cause nausea whose wrists may explode&quot; and Druids were called &quot;Farmers, and Necros were called &quot;HEY YOU FOCKER, GIVE US THAT BANDED ARMOR!&quot;... and WE LIKED IT!  It took 4 hours to type out what classes were in your group, and that was good because it took that long to med back all the Flame Lick mana you'd spent dying to Emporer Crush.<br />
<br />
And in MY day, we didn't have any of these new fangled graphics... AND WE LIKED IT.  There were only 2 sets of breasts on the entire server, and they both belonged to a Troll named &quot;Voluptua&quot; who ran around with all the Necromancers begging for banded armor!  You'd see them flailing down the path in GFay and you'd get out of the way and go &quot;WOW, the only female model in the game!&quot; and then go to your bed and have a lie down because you were so hot and bothered!<br />
<br />
And in MY day.... ummm.... things were better then.  You guys these days have things way better than us, and have no skills, just because the game is &quot;enjoyable&quot; and &quot;more diverse&quot; and.... umm.... yeah, stuff....<br />
<br />
P.S.  Yes, I am being facetious ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Venture, I do not ask for an end to all things prekunrak. You, and all the rangers who weathered Kunrak have something in common. Something I do wish I could have. The 'dark days of Kunrak' brought everyone closer. I beleive we all understand that.<br />
<br />
The 'Pre-Kunrak Elitism' I speak off, is exactly as you mentioned, that all players be recognized for their skill and not when they were created. This is my plea. I do not ask for Pre-Kunrak rangers to just give up their friends, or stay forever silent on their trials and tribulations through the Kunrak era. We do respect the opinions and thoughts of our elder ranger bretheren. We, howver, do not like being stereotyped as 'n00b no l33t skillz' (excuse my language) rangers that had it easy. We had our share of trials. They may not have been the same trials as your own, but beleive me, we had trials.<br />
<br />
And im gonna hit anyone who thinks I only mean PoJ trials with my shovel :p<br />

If I don't know you, you have to prove yourself to me. I'll never ask when you started a toon, and frankly don't care in game. I do care about skills, and I think the perspective gained by watching this game change over the course of years has value by itself. Sure, there are 3 year old Rangers who don't know what they are doing, but there aren't many. Sure, there are 1 year old rangers who know what they are doing, but outside those who come here and pay attention, there are damn few of those.  You're fighting a losing fight if you want equal respect based solely on levels, because like it or not you had it easy if you started in the last year. You have to earn your respect, and after all the changes in the game levels are no longer a measure of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rakhal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I started out in late March, 2002. We didn't have no schmancy fancy zone called Jaggedpine back then. I made the run from Qeynos to Highhold Keep  at level 10 with only 2 (count em) sow potions. I didnt have the 300-400pp needed to buy an ivy etched tunic AND a centi short sword until April, and can you believe that it wasn't until May that I was wielding the jagged blade of mourning/centi LS combo that served me well into my 50's?<br />
<br />
Today's rangers know nothing compared to us pre-Jaggedpine rangers. They go to PC, Neth Lair or MSeru, Dawnshroud and bam! They're in their high 40's and fearing animals until the gain the levels needed to get a pickup group in PoN or PoI so that they can achieve hunter status before the last friday of the month. Before Jaggedpine we actually had to work for our XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">For the Above, I am not good with quotes, and I just got off work so I am not looking for names.<br />
<br />
I don't mean it to sound as animosity, and I don't mean to sound completely irritated with the subject though it is sounding like beating a dead horse. Again, a quote there comes to mind, but I won't use it.<br />
<br />
It does, however, bug me when people say that a Pre-Kunark Ranger is better simply because of that. What I meant to say, and I don't know if I phrased it wrong or not up there, I didn't look, is that a Ranger should be judged by themselves only, not when they started playing. That is like saying someone who has typed for five years is automatically faster at it than you. Again, I don't mean to say that none of them are faster, just that some of them may not be. <br />
<br />
That is what I meant, and if it came out wrong, I apologize for my incorrect wording. I don't mean to sound bitter about it, though it does get annoying sometimes over the little comments like, &quot;I would put the Pre-Kunark Ranger in over the Post-Kunark one always.&quot;<br />
<br />
To me, that was a statement made in haste, and stupidity, if the other Ranger were doing his job better. I would personally look for what the two of them had done for the group and in what ways, etc, before sending the one I thought would handle the situation best. If I didn't have time, I would probably roll a random or flip a coin irl and choose that way. I would, however, try to send the better Ranger, not neccessarily the one who has played longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I began playing during Kunark, a bit before Velious. I hit 61 just before christmas, and my 2 year anniversary playing will be on the 28th of this month. I took it slow.<br />
<br />
The Combine Longsword brings back memories. I begged and pleaded my guild for money to purchase one so I could actually hit those darn ghouls in Oasis.<br />
<br />
I fletched my own Trueshot Longbow at level 21 with a fletching skill of 143. (Was 142 but I skilled up on the combine.)<br />
<br />
I wore a lot of banded until near level 30 when I was able to start questing ivy etched, which I wore until my mid 40s. Late 40s I was able to acquire a couple Ry'Gorr pieces and early 50s I was able to win some TV from Fear and a piece or two of Untamed from Hate. Didn't get any Thurg Quest armor until 54. Didn't get any Golden Leaf until 61.<br />
<br />
I used that CLS (Combined, NOT Centi) for the longest time. Somewhere in my mid to late 30s I upgraded to the Sarnak Pitchatka and Eitchatka and thought I was uber. In the late 30s and early 40s I upgraded again, to the Crystallized (Crystalline?) Longsword (11/29) and Gleaming Short Sword (11/29 and some CHA I think). Eventually upgraded one of those to the Kodiak Claw and the other to a Sword of Skyfire. Late 40s I managed to scrimp save and make my life hell but finally afforded a GJBS. That was it until I got Swiftwind at 51. I've never touched a Centi LS or a Lamentation.<br />
<br />
I don't consider myself to be a great ranger or a crappy ranger. I do the job that has to be done. I've root parked, harmony pulled, etc, and I've also soloed using fear kiting when I couldn't find a group.<br />
<br />
What really makes me sick is seeing a level 10 ranger running around with weapons I carried when I was 50, and whining that he needs to upgrade. Seeing someone create a baby ranger and instantly have him/her in full Ry'Gorr. Not even Ivy etched. What makes me sick isn't the equipment these folks have. I twink my alts like a lot of folks. It's the &quot;Ub3r L337&quot; attitude that just because they have nice_toy01 at level 5 that they are better than those of us who had to work our way up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It took you almost 2 years to hit 61?? You suck!!! I did it in two months!&quot;<br />
<br />
That kind of attitude.</div></div><hr />

Kensei, unless you are not referring to me, in which case I apolagise in advance for this post, you are not reading my post correctly. Or are blinded by your sense of overwhelming superiority that you lose track of the line of thought. Happens to me on occation too.<br />

In response to: <br />

I'll say it one more time, though it feels as if all my posts sound like parrots repeating the same thing over and over again.<br />
<br />
All I wish for, is that players be judged on skill and not playtime. <br />
<br />
Just because a person started before Kunrak, it dosn't mean that they are better than you. You stated in your post, <br />
<br />
If I don't know you, you have to prove yourself to me. I'll never ask when you started a toon, and frankly don't care in game. I do care about skills,  <br />
<br />
There, you said it yourself. Now, how do you know if a prekunrak ranger has these skills? What if they stopped playing before Velious? what if they decided they knew all about the game they needed to and stopped learning? What if they ebayed and the new owner claims to be that person? What if a lot of things. <br />
(Edited in)<br />
Assumption is a very bad thing, in this case. 'Assuming' a post-Kunrak ranger leveled to 60 in 20 days played and dosn't have any class defining skills is bad. 'Assuming' a Pre-Kunrak ranger is a one man army who can solo the might of hate is bad. (Ok, so maybe not, but eh).<br />
(End Edit)<br />
Once again, to draw on the most exellent comparisam by Hopwin, we *were* the teenagers. We've grown up now. You may contine your 'war veteran club'. No one's asking you to give that up. However, we wish to be treated as adults now, with due credit to our skills and not ridicule against our playtime.<br />
<br />
Again, I apolagise for the attack. My preceived attitude of your post appeared to be a direct attempt to idly flick off my arguments, provoking my response in kind.<br />
<br />
(Edit: After re-reading my first round post, I think I missed a few points, editing them in)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Valedhel I am having a terrible time taking your skill seriously when you can't even spell KUNARK K-U-N-A-R-K. Little things like that add up.<br />
<br />
Also, Being level 60+ does not make you grown up, as others pointed out there are level 60+ rangers out there less than a month old. If people won't take you seriously based on your skill, then who needs them? Find a new group of people who respect you for you, don't look to a World War II Veteran to respect an &quot;all grown up&quot; 18 year old.</div></div><hr />

Ouch, Hopwin, that's below the belt. Am I being judged on my spelling skills now? I'm a member of a writing community elsewhere on the net, and I have yet to be criticised on my spelling, even though I know my spelling is fairly terrible.<br />
<br />
In other news, all I can think off right now is, <br />
<br />
&quot;Is it so wrong to try to get the respect of your elders?<br />
<br />
Respect is earned, not given. But it's so much harder to earn respect if people refuse to acknowlege one's skill in a particular field just because you have been involved longer, or in this case, just because we started playing after the release of Kunark. There, spelt right at last after one year of playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: What little things do you speak of? My repeated mispelling of Kunark? Or was there something else?</div></div><hr />
