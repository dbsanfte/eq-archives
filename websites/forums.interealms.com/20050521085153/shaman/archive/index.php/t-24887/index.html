<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Per the discussion in this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=24669)  we were wondering if talisman of sense actually does anything.<br />
<br />
k, so I was bored as hell and any reason not to cast a buff on a raid is a good thing.<br />
<br />
So, I went to pof, snagged a flame lordling, malos,root, turgur'd and tanked it, when turgurs wore off I backed off put on sense, re malos/turgur'd it and did second run.  Each run was about 7.5 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
total dmg 30918<br />
dps 78.67<br />
accuracy 71.65%<br />
<br />
<br />
total dmg 27027<br />
dps 62.27<br />
accuracy 62.07%<br />
<br />
Anyway, damnit all to heck, it looks like its working.<br />

<br />
Well, I guess that is a good use of mana.  Not earth shattering, but given its duration, it does save mana in the long run.  Still, when buff room is tight, I imagine this is one of the first clicked off:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jerikt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, 1 heal on a low dps mob.  But it decreased dps by 16 out of 78.  That's about 20% decrease in mob dps.  Against higher dps mobs, that's a huge help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are making a big assumption here... that the 20% number will remain constant on every mob.  I doubt that is true.<br />
<br />
I'll get some parsing done on Time boss mobs and see how it fairs.  I'm still fairly unsure just what the +7 avoidance actually is.. <br />
<br />
For instance, if you cast cripple on a weak mob doing 50-60dps, I'm sure the green mobs dps would drop alot.  However, cripple on a god does very little.  <br />
<br />
My suspicion is, we'll see much less performance from this buff, the higher the mobs accuracy and attack values are.  I'm hoping not, but I have a sinking suspicion that the avoidance part isn't absolute, meaning, your chance to avoid is linked to the mobs chance to hit.  If a mean KT named mob, or Time boss mob have a huge chance to hit you, I bet that overwhelms the avoidance benefit.  <br />
<br />
But at any rate, it might save some mana grouping.  I'll try to run a couple parses over the next two weeks to see how it matches up against uber mobs.  <br />
<br />
Doubt I'll have the time, but if anyone can run it against KT or PG mobs, that'd be a big help also.</div></div><hr />

I would actually like to see more parses on this as well. I think the new Cripple is saving a TON of healing. I regularly group in deep PG and Riftseekers, and I can actually NOTICE a difference after Spasm has landed on how fast the tanks HPs drop. Perhaps on a God its not as big, but on big, higher DPS trash mobs Spasm seems to work. <br />
<br />
Of course, Cripple has 2 effects, one is lowering the mobs DPS, and the other is lowering its defensive capability versus player DPS. Rogues I have gruoped with said that they notice MUCH bigger hits after cripple lands. Any way we can get this tested as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For what it's worth, I also started pulling out cripple in MPG.  <br />
<br />
I really should do a parse, and not rely on my intuition.  But when push comes to shove, I don't care that much...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I wouldn't be surprised if there where some mobs well worth crippling in MPG. The obvious ones that come to mind is the lightning guys since they flurry and the nocs since they have that damm proc. The dex reduction is commonly accepted to reduce the proc rate which would reduce the flurries and chaos claw procs. Not sure if it will reduce the dmg delt by other mobs but it definitely can help on those 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Cripple is a fixed number and not a % so it will not scale like sense does.  If sense is truly a % number addiing raw avoidance then it will have the exact same effect on any mob, discounting any special attacks or modifiers that the mob might have to negate the sense effect.  Such attacks or modifiers would be procs and any abilities that automatically hit or reduce the chance of avoidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Jaidin,<br />
<br />
You are correct from the players standpoint.  According to Lucy, it will add 7% to your avoidance value.  However... <br />
<br />
Assume a mob's accuracy value is something absurdly high, so that in essence it has a 137% chance to  hit you.   Even if you have 30% avoidance from abilities/gear, and sense gives you an additional 7%, the mob will still connect with you 100% of the time.  <br />
<br />
Whether thats how high a mobs chance to hit gets or not, I'm not sure.  Thats why I'd like to see a parse raiding to see or not.  For instance, tonight in Uqua, we fought Barxt.  I was in an all monk group.  My group wiped:(  After it was over, I asked them if any had seen any misses.  Nope.  Barxt hit all the monks 100% of the time.  A couple might have had sense on, I'm not sure.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, I'm just saying it would be nice to know if its useful raiding or not.  After everyone has the time to get the new buff slots from AA's, it won't matter much because there will probably always be room for it, so might as well slap it on the MT I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You can't parse stuff like this on one mob and expect to get a clear answer. You need to do it with a variety of mob types/levels in different scenarios (group/raid etc) and with different toons (level/gear/class), since all of these things might affect the numbers you produce. In this particular case it is &quot;increase chance to avoid melee by 7%&quot;, which means that it is a relative increase to that value, not an absolute one. If your chance to avoid is 20% you shouldnt see a noticable effect, whereas if your chance to avoid is 80% you will see a large effect. That implies that the results from whatever parses you do may vary greatly depending on the specific mob involved and the quality of your toon.</div></div><hr />

Nice job on this little parse, at least we do know it works in SOME situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess this is the confusing part, that probably only parses will end up showing... at what point is SOE applying the 7%?<br />
<br />
A) Is it actually addition?  20% becomes 27%?<br />
B) Is it a 'true' percent increase?  20% becomes 20x1.07 = 21.4%?<br />
<br />
Do we know for sure?  I know % shielding items add together. 4% shielding and 5% shielding = 9% shielding in the world of EQ math:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ungkor,<br />
<br />
True if the mob had over 106% to hit you then it shouldn't theoretically have any affect, but I was under the impression that the 7% acted like an avoidance discipline.  If so, then no matter how likely the mob to hit you, it will miss sometimes.  However it's very likely that the buff doesn't apply the modifier in that way. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well, if you use an avoidance disc such as evasion on something that has a high probability of hitting (PA in IK for example), it doesnt do a lot because your chance of avoiding is so low. The 50% increase in the chance to avoid is relative, not absolute. The same thing would apply with sense. Of course mobs like PA are not that common, so you wouldnt see that sort of thing normally, but it could be an issue on boss mobs which are much higher level than players. I would think that sense probably is more usefull on trash, and less usefull on high level nameds or mobs that have accuracy buffs on them.<br />
<br />
Oh, and about the 106% thing, I doubt that it works that way. More likely the chance to avoid is based on a calculation using your avoidance number and the mobs accuracy number, with soft caps at either end of the scale, so that no matter how large the discrepancy is one way or the other, you will never reach a situation where a you have a 0% or 100% chance to avoid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True the 7% is highly unlikely to be a hard number, much like how Might states 5% but because of the way it is calculated, only adds about 3%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Might doesn't add 3% or about 3%. It adds 5%, just not to the total damage.<br />
<br />
Sense will take your base avoidance into account which is determined by Agility, Level, Avoidance effects, Disciplines like evasion etc(not defensive skills as block, parry, dodge etc) and mutiply that with 0.07.<br />
<br />
Then your new avoidance number will be modifying the mob's innate Hit ratio(probably detrimined mainly by level, zone modifier(much like an exp modifier, mob type(warrior vs. caster etc) and a fixed setting for nameds or gods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Softcaps should be in place at 5% and 95%. Just like everything else in this game, remember it was supposed to be a digital version of a D20 system =p</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I should have been more clear - I meant that Might adds ~3% to the total damage because of the way the 5% modifier is applied.  However, Sense is much more ambigious in it's description (or at least to me) so it's difficult to tell where and how the 7% is applied.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  So the question is does this effect current group and raid content?  I have no idea.  Not even sure how to go about coming up with a clear answer in the way that you say it needs to be done in, but it sounds like you do know how it needs to be done and are perfectly capable of doing it.   I thank you for pointing out my errors and I'll be happy to see your results.<br />
<br />
  I do know that I used to see tons of parses on the crucible of people trying to figure out if things were working and if they were working correctly and I ain't seen jack lately so I stepped up and did my little part.  Hell, myself and some others were starting to think that sense actually Decreased your avoidance and that is what I was working on checking.  We now know that by putting this buff up we are not going to get hit More and that is a start.  And we have people commenting and thinking about it and perhaps some of those who are saying that my parse is meaningless will feel compelled to go out and do some parses that will be more meaningfull and create a clearer picture of what is going on.</div></div><hr />
