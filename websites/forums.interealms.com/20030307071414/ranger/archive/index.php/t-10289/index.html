<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gilorien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail all - this is my first post to The Ranger's Glade Forum. <br />
<br />
I've been eyeing up the Swordsman's Armband (21% Haste) found on Overseer Gizgaplank in Grimling Forest. I was going to go on a scouting mission the other day, but found myself getting aggroed quite a bit in the zone. <br />
<br />
Can anyone give me some information on this zone in general and this mob in particular?<br />
<br />
I know that his PH is &quot;a Grimling Overseer.&quot; I checked Track from the Vah Shir outpost and noticed that the only Grimling Overseer on Track appeared to be in one of the camps far to the West. Is this correct?<br />
<br />
What kind of group do you think would be necessary to take this mob? Can his camp-mates be handled with Harmony (as the Grimlings in HS Moor can)?<br />
<br />
Any and all information/advice would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The named overseers ar ein the cave commplex heading to Acrylia Caverns. Harmony will do you no good, the grimlings in Grimling Forest are immune.<br />
<br />
The Overseer himself is an interesting mob, he hits pretty hard for a level 40, but has level 40 appropriate hitpoints. He also likes to summon. The other grimlings that inhabit his immediate vicinity seem to be on a pretty fast timer as well, so care will be needed to keep them from respawning on top of you. <br />
<br />
The main thing you need is the capability to kill a level 40 mob quickly. We went in with a level 50ish group and were fine, but I was surprised how quickly his cave respawned.<br />
<br />
One other piece of advice.. Reduce the size of your sig, or it will be removed by the moderator.</div></div><hr />
