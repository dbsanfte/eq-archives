<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldn't go Can II unless you found it for sale.  It's a LONG quest, with some expensive components.  And it's too hard for the plus that you get out of the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its not that long..only thing you can't get in bazaar for 100pp total is the TT powder and the no drop bone chips.  Did mine in about 3 hours one night and it is WELL worth it!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mine took 4 hours, very much worth it.  If you are on Xev I have a clay for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I haven't read the other post, but I found it to be very useful.  Even with the really fast levelling nowadays it's not worth to wait on Can 3.  The quest can be done solo, and with little effort it is totally worth it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I picked up a strange ocre clay in the bazaar for 50p saw the crushed diamonds for 25p. a druid friend helped me get mine in timorus deep. went to Karnors castle and hung out buy ent did an /ooc to ask to loot the bone chips, then my druid friend was getting his seb key and tracked and helped kill the yun shaman. bonus was I got my seb key.. all in all was fun and easy with a little help.. got mine when I was 40...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jhael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you can get the bones from KC then I say go for it, the rest of the quest is a breeze.  There is rarely more than one group in KC anymore on my server, so unless you can bring your own group you may be SoL.  I spent some time soloing in DL and poping my head into to KC now and then, I did not have much luck but got some xp while waiting..<br />
<br />
Right now at 45 its on my list of things to do, but not at the top of the lst by far :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ahhhh, this is probably true.  I did mine in the days before the Bazaar (hell, in the days before EC was the huge pain that it became, and people only traded there on the weekend evenings).  If you can get the components cheap, then I guess it would be worth the small pain that the last couple of items would be.</div></div><hr />

The only PITA piece is the bone chips.  Pick up diamonds, buy the others in baz.<br />
<br />
Finda a good group in KC and try to convince 'em to go for it.  I've had no luck begging/donating (and I hate to beg).<br />
<br />
Until then make a CanI x3 hotkey, figure your computers lag (mine is around /pause 35) and you can get 3 CanI casts as quickly as possible for 1 keystrike. <br />
<br />
/cast 4 (CanI in slot 4)<br />
/pause 35<br />
/cast 4<br />
<br />
etc..<br />
<br />
Helps a bit. <br />

If you are able to do the quest, then do it...Canni II is much better than Canni I. I bought all the pieces in the bazaar, except for the greyish bone chips, I grouped in Karnor's and they dropped while I was grouped. I got pretty good experience while Karnor's and got the bone chips to drop to boot. I finished the Stoicism quest the same day I got Canni II, quite a productive evening for Storm, the Scalypimp !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Canni2 is much nicer than Canni1.<br />
<br />
It takes 5 minutes to get the diamonds<br />
<br />
I found the Ochre Clay in the bazaar for 25pp<br />
<br />
I sat at the zone in in KC and just /ooc 'd for the chips, took about 45 minutes (this was before PoP though when KC had 40-50 people in it...not sure how crowded KC is now)<br />
<br />
Had a ranger friend track shamans in TT, was done in 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Not a hard quest at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I play on Venril server, which = KC is empty 24/7 lol.<br />
<br />
I did the canni 2 quest, while difficult for me, it was well worth it imo.<br />
<br />
After reading all the posts and deciding to do it myself i would say it depends on your server and playstyle.  <br />
<br />
ie.. if your going to grind levels hard, and the components are difficult for you to get, i wouldnt bother.  If you can get those bones without too much trouble on your server i would go for it, hands down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just an Fyi<br />
<br />
I was the first shammy to come of age in my guild to go after this.  I got it at say ~ lvl 51. . took me a bit eheh<br />
<br />
BUT! I managed to keep looting the greyish bone chips to do the quest for other shammys in my guild.  As I was still lvling in there from time to time and they do usually drop.  You can either hand in all the items for them or do it half and half no biggie works either way.  Spell isn't no drop so its all good.  I just handed in all the componets for them and handed over the spell.  Its real nice havin' it I find my canni doesn't have to be quite as endless with it eheh ( fingers start to crap up after a while ya' know!? )</div></div><hr />

Why not do like this:<br />
<br />
/pause 35,/cast 4 and repeat it 5 times?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't like a multi canni hotkey because a) you can't stop in the middle of it then, and b) you get out of sync so you end up missing ticks - even if you get the pause value correct, the lag varies, so chances are you're going to miss it<br />
<br />
Mine just does the dance and allows for fizzles.<br />
