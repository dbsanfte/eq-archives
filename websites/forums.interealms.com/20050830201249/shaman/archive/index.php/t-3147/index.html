<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Right now I'm 39, and would really like to get 45 as fast as i can. My gear is quite decent, and i would like to know where to hunt. I have been doing Gornit off and on, just for the money really, saving for a JBB. So where would you recommend me fighting? Gornit gives about 1/3 to 1/2 a blue a kill(varies from level 35-37) and drops around 15pp average. Should i stay here or move? Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Once you can't stand it any longer, I would suggest Grimlings in Tenebrous Mts, or the underbulks in Echo caves.  both are good xp and the loot is ok...nothing spectacular.</div></div><hr />
