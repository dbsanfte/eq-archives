<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JESTER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well all I am looking for ideal's for a 54 shaman to solo, thanks for the help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spend 5 minutes browsing through the archives in this forum, theres plenty here.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, things change in this game (rather frequently actually)and sometimes new people find new places and bring fresh ideas here.  <br />
<br />
Don't shut down this guy's thread before it even gets started.  If you have no suggestions for him, you are not forced to respond to the post.<br />
<br />
Here's a few places I've solo'd in 54, not in love with any of them and I would be interested in other suggestions myself:<br />
<br />
1)  BURNING WOODS:  A bunch of stuff here is dark blue to you.  I've found 4 hunting spots:  (a) the giant fort; (b) The hornets nest; (c) the Sarnaks in NE corner outside Chardock (d) multiple mobs near undead ruins--giants, wurms, gorilla's, skelly's and hornets.  Leave Gullerback alone if you soloing, he is HIGHLY magic resistant.<br />
<br />
2)  SCARLET DESERT:  Again, many dark blue mobs.  There are several tribes here, you start out non-KOS to all of them.  I'd leave most of them  alone because it makes the zone a tad safer if you only focus on killing one tribe.  I kill the Bloodtribes (drop Acrylia!) and the Sun Reaver fellows.  Easy zone to exp. grind in if you can get a port to Twilight Sea.<br />
<br />
3)  OCEAN OF TEARS:  Not great exp, the seafuries are mixed, dark blue and light blue, but this is a no brainer EASY camp where you can go AFK.  I find this place just plain relaxing.  Some gems drop here that sell well.  If you want more cash, claim to Gornit (named HG) camp if it is open and kill clops between Gornit spawns.  Save you seafoam for your guildies doing cultural smithing, they will love you.<br />

P.S.  Others have suggested Jagged Pine, Kedge Keep, High Hold Keep, and the entrance to Charisis at this level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">solo'd the chardok entrance at 54, huge exp. Quite mana intensive TBH, but was about 3-4 kills for a blue. Mele partner of the same level here for really good exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JESTER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you for the help, I did look thing's up but there are alway's new and different thing's to see nadlearn, thank you I will try out bw and that way I will close to chardok so I can try it, stay safe and have fun all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dok is seriously amazing exp, i suggest you try that if you have good enough gear to keep you alive.  If you have a JBB then it wont be as mana intensive as Krak says, because he is a scaley  :)<br />
<br />
Too bad im on dok faction, or am trying to be, until i get that spirit wracked cord quest done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whats the &quot;DoK&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it is an abbreviation for Di'zok, or Brood of Di'zok (their faction). Used in the following quests (you can look them up on Allakhazam):<br />
<br />
Di'Zok Signet of Service <br />
Regal Band of Bathezid <br />
Spirit Wracked Cord<br />
<br />
Amberfox, 52 Shaman<br />
Oblivions Door</div></div><hr />
