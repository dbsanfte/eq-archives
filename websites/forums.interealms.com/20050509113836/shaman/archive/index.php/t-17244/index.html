<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I normally solo and join the serverwide Shaman channel and my servers(Kane Bayle) Market channel to help keep me company. I took about two months off this summer and came back about one month ago. The Shaman channel like this board has remained helpful and friendly. But, I have added between 10 and 15 people to my ignore list from the Market channel. There are so many people on there that act like they are 13 years old and loaded with their parents money. There didn't seem to be so many before. There is constant swearing, people saying this or that type of person in RL should be killed, hardly any help if someone asks for a price check but usually many comments on how stupid they are for asking, and on and on. I don't remember this from a while ago. And then if someone did act like that a bunch of people would jump on them for being mean or swearing or other people in their guild would report them. <br />
<br />
Are all the mature respectable people in high end guilds constantly raiding? Have they all quit and given their accounts to their snobby neighbors kids? Or, is it just me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">..or is someone just getting older =)  Just like in RL you avoid those who you dont agree with and go on.  Opinions are like azzholes .. everyones got one =)</div></div><hr />

The /buysell channel on Xegony has always been littered with immature morons spouting stupid stuff.  No decrease or increase --- it's always been at a high level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think that overall maturity is declining or maybe I just never noticed how bad it was before. My server Ayonae Ro is bad. It just seems that too many people are out there trying to belittle everything said and insult everyone. My cure was to turn of ooc and shout and not to join any channels. It helped me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I dont think the overal maturity so to speak has declined, though on a somewhat unlrelated note the min/max's vs more casual rift has widened more so lately imo.  The resulting arguments from respective sides can often degenerate into immaturity more often than not.  Folks getting to caught up in thinking they know how other people &quot;ought to be&quot; playing this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anything is possible, but I find this unlikely for a variety of reasons. It is against the rules to be offensive in tells, even though there is an /ignore function. It is against the rules to be offensive in ooc, though you can turn off /ooc. It is against the rules to use profanity, even though there is the profanity filter feature. In short, the ability to avoid offensive behavior has never before been an excuse for permitting offensive behavior to occur. <br />

<br />
As Serbitar states and from what I recall being said, the auction channel is a channel that one actively has to join, thereby making the choice to view the content. You cannot receive unsolicited /auction text therefore you cannot complain about the content. For tells, ooc, emotes, etc. you can complain if you see them or receive them even though you can turn them off because you shouldn't &quot;have&quot; to turn them off to avoid foul and obnoxious behavior. I will see if I can find the posting somewhere and post the link here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't think so.  I never have auction on because I find it annoying, and when I zone in bazaar I turn off all channels..ooc, shout, etc. <br />
<br />
I have never joined the serverwide shaman channel because the one time I did (when I was much lower level and just starting my epic) I asked a question and people were so rude I just never bothered going back.  I work in tech support and deal with enough rude people every day that I am sure not going to deal with any in a game.  <br />
<br />
I have about 4 channels operated by various friends and my guild channel and my alliance channel, that is plenty to keep me occupied:). <br />
<br />
There are good and bad people in game, same as always.  I've met a lot of both over the past 3 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The bazaar tends to bring out the lowest common denominator, but people get in fights over the funniest things, so it can be quite entertaining.  A few days ago I listened to a great debate revolving around a theoretical BP for a L14 SK.  Someone said Vindi was a great choice and he was immediately jumped on by some cartoon decrying that &quot;vindi bp is teh suck&quot; and &quot;elemental BPs are much better and not hard to get&quot;.  They must have gone back and forth for about 30 min or more. :p</div></div><hr />

My goodness if I hear another level 65 whine about not having an enchenter/bard in normal LDON, or say &quot;no way I'm doing anything except for a slaughter&quot; I think I'm going to scream.  I do think we have a complete generation of peeps who are used to mindlessly leveling and anything out of the ordinary scares them to death.<br />

What many people fail to realize is that not everyone that plays this game is an adult and that children will be children whether it be in game or out. The only thing you can do is /ignore and move on.</div></div><hr />

I think this observation maybe key in the discussion.  I don't necessarily think the player base as a whole has decreased in maturity.  It is more that veteran players have come (or perhaps had come maybe more appropriate) to expect a certain level of civility and levelheadedness for the higher-level player base that simply isn't extant.  Prior to &quot;the great experience balancing of 2002&quot; trudging your way to 60 to a very very long time. Players who made it there displayed true determination and dedication to their characters and their behavior tended to reflect that. Now the old exp barriers in the 30s and 40s no longer exist and thus no longer deter the ph4t l33t twitch game playing 14 year olds from breaking into the 50s and 60s.  With access to higher level zones these folks have more money and more loot to throw and begin acting in a more and more repulsive fashion.  I guess this just isn't our old EQ anymore...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Here's another quick comment from me...<br />
<br />
The server auction channels are a bastion for morons, scamers, and general asshats.  The bazaar has made it so easy to simply offload your merchandise that most of the people in auction channel are either trying to sell you something for more than its worth, buy somethng for less than its worth, or otherwise deprive the average player of platinum.  I realize some people frequent the auction channel because they can't sell in the bazaar for whatever reason, but it has been my experience that those people are in a definite minority and the rest tend towards sleaziness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">GMs/Guides can certainly police the auction channel, I've seen them do it on a few occasions.  The problem is that there aren't many GMs around, and I've found that Guides, while they tend to be nice people, are generally not the brightest bulbs in the light fixture, and therefore often unhelpful.  You petition something that's happening now, and unless you pay 40 bucks a month or the person you're petitioning has the patience of a rock, when your petition is answered in two days the bad behavior that caused it is no longer occurring, and therefore in the eyes of GMs/guides, the problem has been solved.<br />
<br />
The playerbase has absolutely become less mature.  I'm not sure if the changes that have been and are being made to EQ are in response to the generally younger &amp; less mature players, or are an ongoing attempt to entice this type of player, as perhaps they have more money to throw at online games?  Either way, there's no doubt about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this can't be true.. if it is they wouldn't police anything, since you can /ignore or turn off ooc, shouts, etc.. you choose to have those turned on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yes, but even though you can choose to turn them off or on, they're turned on by default.<br />
75% of the playerbase doesn't even LOOK at the manual before playing.  Of the remaining 25%, less than half will learn the commands in under an hour.<br />
It's easier for them to just police it than to deal with the numerous petitions about someone swearing or being rude and having to explain the /filter command.<br />
Besides, who wants to play with those who are abusive to fellow players?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Prior to &quot;the great experience balancing of 2002&quot; trudging your way to 60 to a very very long time.

<br />
<br />
It takes the same amount of experience to go 1 to 60 now as it did when RoK was released. All they did was smooth out the level progression so hell level experience was more evenly distributed instead of one big wall.<br />
<br />
That being said, the only thing that seems to be different to me these days is the increasing fad of ignoring common courtesy and using &quot;soe rules&quot;. People aren't respecting camps, people are plopping down in the middle of lower level groups and pleveling, and the universal justification is &quot;there's no such thing as camps&quot; or &quot;soe rules say you have to share&quot;. It was more friendly when faster/stronger gets the prize applied to just raiding, instead of might makes right in exp groups. <br />
<br />
A good example, from my own server:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think the biggest problem with EQ has become the lack of controls placed on the population. As fewer and fewer of the rules/policies are being enforced less often, people's behavior begins to degenerate to the lowest common denominator. Its human nature. Many of the things being complained about in this thread simply would not have been tolerated 2 years ago. It is also indicative of what EQ has become: a bloated and unwieldy characiture (sp) of itself as SoE sacrifices product integrity for profit margins.</div></div><hr />
