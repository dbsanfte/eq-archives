<br />
To the zerker poster's defense ... because they don't.  They are *meant* to kill things quickly, but they lack anything more than the ability to swing a weapon.  Their AA tree looks less-than-half-done, their snare ability is random duration (and usually lasts like shaman invis, hehe), and their throwing damage - supposedly a class feature - is no better than any other class's throwing damage (as well as lacking the Endless Throwing AA that most folks assume they have, plus things like a Fleeting Quiver equivelent).  They are playable only to the extent that a class that adds bad dps is stackable with the rest of a group or raid, but at the moment, they are inferior to rangers in ways that make the shaman/beastlord problems small.  I agree that shaman are as badly in need in examination - we used to have a role, and have lost it ... they never had one at all.  Both of our classes do little more than take up space at the GoD high end.</div></div><hr />

I still think its funny that he demanded a complete revamp and they need attention more then any other class. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, not trying to flame the guy, it just struck me as funny. I mean alot of classes need help and have needed it for a long time and i just dont think zerker should be #1 priority of anyone else.<br />
<br />
Anyway. Nuff said. I got my chuckle :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>diwahabulin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Litgruv you need to roll a zerker.<br />
<br />
I have a 65 Shaman and yes we need attention but the fact of the matter is no one in EQ knows *** a zerkers role is.<br />
<br />
-Our Cry's are havoc on Raids and have stacking issues with other classes discs.  Not to mention the endurance use and the reuse times are way to long to be of any use.<br />
<br />
-As stated before our throwing is no better than a rogues.  If we are empasiased in our throwing ability then make us a notch under rangers in the range attack department.<br />
<br />
-Our AA listing is so incomplete its a joke.  No real class to speak of.<br />
<br />
-Our &quot;special abilities&quot; like snare are so unreliable its a joke.<br />
<br />
-Our DPS is nothing like I would have thought it should be.  I would think a zerker would have around 75 pct the dps of a rog and not have to be behind the mob to get it.<br />
<br />
Other classes have their problems but they have been around for 5 years and have received so many upgrades and nerfs.  Berserkers where incomplete out of the gate and you damn well know it.<br />
<br />
Zerkers need an overhaul or something that lets the EQ community know that we exists and we are safe to group with.<br />
<br />
You are a whining Shaman who wants to jump to the front of the line which is understandable.  But other than arguing &quot;They are so young and already complaining&quot; how can you not see how &amp;*^% up this class was made.<br />
<br />
I feel confident that I can get a group within 10 mins of logging on my Shaman but I cannot say that for my Zerker.  Most of the time I have to dual box just to level him.  Zerkers seem to be such outcasts right now.<br />

<br />
How on earth is having an overpowered class any better than having an underpowered class? If anything, from a PR standpoint, it's in SOE's best interest to roll out underpowered classes. That way, you can boost them up and everyone thinks good of you, whereas if you nerf a class, everyone thinks negatively of you.<br />
<br />
Please try to use some logic in your posts...:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Adding yet another class was stupid to begin with. there arent enough roles for all existing classes allready</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All that adding another class does is present Sony the opportunity and temptation to whore out the class abilities of others and screw up class balance.  They're not creative enough to really think up much new, so the most likely thing they will do is just lazily grab things from other classes that distinguishes them and makes them worth playing, and dump them into the slopbucket of a new class.<br />
<br />
A new class is just something to advertise on a box in bright colors and new art, to help sales.  <br />
<br />
As to who needs more work on class balance, I've gotta go with anyone and everyone's class who is older.  Many people have hundreds or thousands of hours played on their characters; that's the kind of investment in time and energy and desire to play the game that needs to be protected, respected, acknowledged, and rewarded as the very first priority -- not somebody's three week or three month investment in a new class. <br />
<br />
Which isn't to say zerkers don't need fixing.  As a priority? No, that's just pointing your resources in exactly the wrong direction.  <br />
<br />
I also have to wonder what people realistically expect when starting a new class.  It may sound harsh, because I don't think anyone at all &quot;deserves&quot; a bad break, but...really, what could you expect? <br />
<br />
Wouldn't it have been wiser to give Sony a few months to iron out the kinks?  To hear word from the other &quot;early adopters&quot; before investing your own time?  <br />
<br />
Very few new products come out that don't have problems and need fixes.  Over time, they become better -- you hope.  Cars, cameras, VCR's -- new models are buggy!  Period.  Now look at Verant/Sony's records of having things not be buggy, and it just compounds things.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think any thinking person would have known zerkers would have plenty of problems, and completely expected them, and expected they would last a good long time, if they were ever even substantially dealt with at all.  It's not like you asked for it or deserved it, but good lord, you sure should have EXPECTED it.  100%.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but it's true.  Maybe that's the price you pay for being an early adopter?  But in a way, you have to blame yourself as much as you might blame Sony.</div></div><hr />

You my friend are missing the whole point of this this thread. It has NOTHING to do with zerkers needing or not needing help, it has to do with the poster claming zerkers should be first in line over everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That's actually pretty understandable, IMO.  Berserkers ARE the most F'd up class in eq at the moment.  Shaman fall apart in GoD, true.  Berserkers fall apart... Well, actually berserkers were never put together right in the first place, so you can't really say they fall apart anywhere in particular.  <br />
<br />
Shaman are still fine and dandy through most of EQ, all the way through PoTime IMO.  It's not until the fast paced action of LDoN that you start seeing our weaknesses really hurt us and GoD is where we really get bent.<br />
<br />
It's understandable when people say that SOE shouldn't have added another class, because they shouldn't have.  But, if we're talking about &quot;should&quot; then they SHOULD have implemented the new class at least mostly finished.  They SHOULD have reassessed interclass balance issues before releasing a new expansion.  They SHOULD have ensured that all the zones in the newest expansion were at least functional and remotely doable/fun before release.  etc. etc...<br />
<br />
And everyone SHOULD just quit this PoS game called EQ and find something else to do with their free time because SOE has again and again released unfinished, poorly tested expansions showing that they care about one thing and one thing only... cash in their pockets.  IMHO :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Im not suprised that the Berzerker community is complaining; their chosen class sucks really really bad.  What baffles me is that the people that decided to roll up 'zerkers didnt expect them to suck.  All it took from me was reading the small amounts of info that were around pre-GoD release and I could see that they were gonna suck.  True, they had some interesting abilities (throwing as a basis for utility...you gotta give SOE points for originality there) described, but on the whole it was a lackluster class with a half hearted attempt at design.<br />
<br />
My ranger (54 at the time this happened) was in BB adventure with a 56 'zerker.  My ranger isnt decked out in the best super gear out there, but hes got about 2500 hp 1100 atk unbuffed.  The zerker was in full ornate and she 'said' she had almost maxed stats.  We were both wielding WMBS.  Both had Alanya's quickening for haste and the zerker had a cloak of flame, my ranger had a FBSS (I really need to upgrade that).<br />
<br />
My rangers DPS blew the 'zerkers away.  I parsed an average of 53 dps for the ranger, and 45 for the zerker.  I could have missed some of the zerks hits, because I was also pulling, but for 90% of the time spent attacking I was right behind the mob next to the zerker.<br />
<br />
Do zerkers need work?  Yeah.  In my opinion the class was a mistake and their abilities, while interesting, are poorly designed and horribly executed.  I believe zerks were designed to deal with the incredible DPS output of mobs in GoD so they could help end fights faster.  Well, whatever SOE's aim was for zerks....they missed.</div></div><hr />

Sice the release of GoD it was for sure that this class would lack in the end game.<br />
If someone still things that SOE has ANY CLUE about what they are doing.......well.<br />
<br />
It was all about &quot; Give them a new class and hope they enjoy it for some time &quot;.<br />

If berzerkers are to live up to their name, why limit damage to less than rogues?  At least rogues have other skills they bring to the table.  You wear the same armor and bring less to a group - why not do more damage?  At least rangers can stand back and still do major damage with their bow.<br />
<br />
I may have missed something, but I didn't see anything that suggests that our whining shaman wants to jump to the front of the line - just suggestions that perhaps a gimped class that everyone knew was gimped before people started playing it probably does not jump to the front of the line.<br />
<br />
I play a zerker because it is fun.  And it is parked until the class is fixed.  But I like to think that SOE has more than 1 developer working to fix the various classes, and that they may actually be able to work on more than one at a time.  But I may be wrong.</div></div><hr />

First off beserkers dont deserve any attention more then any other class in the game. Im sorry, but if you think a class is going be balanced out of the box in 2 months, i suggest you remember the company your dealing with. I also suggest you go look at the BST's and ask them how long it took them to have any serious worth. And while your looking at the BST's ask them how much they are worth now. A lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Second off let me make a suggestion to you that may be of some use to you in real life and online. Dont put words in peoples mouth. Dont well THEM what THEY mean. They are the ones speaking the words so it would be wise of you, if you are in question, to ask them what they actualy meant. You got a vastly wrong opinion on what was meant by this thread so im going to explain it to you.<br />
<br />
This thread was simply to point out the humor in any class, much less the zerkers, asking to be first and fore most in all class rebalance. Never once did i say shaman should be first in this balance and its my opinion they should all be getting equal communication and if nothing else a .plan relating to what fixes are coming for all of them. After reading up on zerkers and checking their forum i see they do need more work then i though (thank you for helping me enlighten myself), but certainly nothing to warrent them needing it more then any other. Shaman are just as broke and knights certainly have some serious high end issues.<br />
<br />
Not one person here ever said &quot;Berserkers shouldnt be fixed&quot;. So how about we share a tribunal peace pipe and say Funk it all.<br />

Ideally, there would be no &quot;coming first&quot; at all, but it doesn't seem to me that this is a game in which the developers go hell for leather and pour massive resources into fixing things as soon as possible.  Choices will have to be made on resource allocation.<br />

Hello - incoming clue: You been duped!! When you started your Zerker after leaving your shaman that SOE dropped along the wayside 3 expansions (very liberal interpretation here) ago did you really ... and I mean, really and honestly believe you were moving to a class that SOE had taken the time and effort to make perfect?

Yes, the Zerker should have come out of the box with better design, abilities, yada, yada. Should have. Didn't. Can you honestly say that was not to be expected?<br />
