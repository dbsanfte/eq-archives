<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">if you want to  put this in the medicine cabinet or whatever mods ~ ~dosent matter  <br />
<br />
<br />
i would link it from TSWarrior but i think its down  well anyways<br />
<br />
step 1  make a hotkey <br />
step 2 find the hotkey in your name_server file that contains your hotkey information open it <br />
step 3 find the hotkey you made ex. slow, malos, etc, etc  <br />
step 4 find the peice you want perferably an un augmented peice of equipment or item.  it can be made auged fake like but thats harder to do<br />
step 5 make your key   lets say  ---&gt; %T &lt;--- is SLOWED !  at this point you can use character map to make it snazzy or whatever if you wish<br />
step 6 use this box   it will be what you need to start off the link<br />
step 7   to get the code of the item  use ;t  item link   it will say could not find player blahblahblahblah  <br />
step 8 make your link like so 0016994-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001E8BC5E4D Š&#321;&#337;&#373;&#904;&#273;  this is an example   mine  i use  it links Whore's bane <br />
step 8  make shure you have text going on the front of it  and the back<br />
step 9 save it and use Save as ....   under where it says encodeing use UTF-8 thats what eq uses to read it <br />
step 10  reload your UI or you can zone / log  it dosent matter but reloading the information is what is critical<br />
<br />
<br />
there you go its all good and going  <br />
<br />
this is my Slow msg <br />

<br />
it shows  %T and Slowed as a link if your gonna use %T as a link  make shure you add in spaces to make the full name get in   and good luck  if you have any more questions ask</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cool idea, use a link for the spell parchment for Turgurs, Malos, whatever. When you give your slow message people can click on the link and get the info for the spell. <br />
Haveing said that, how do you get the code for a particular item you'd like to use? You may have explained that, but I sure missed it if you did. And thanks for the post, never occured to me this could be done. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">step 7 to get the code of the item use ;t item link it will say could not find player blahblahblahblah  Just like sending a /tell to someone but using a link instead of players name.<br />

Thanks for posting this Gangaskan, it's great!!<br />

Very cool tip, Gangaskan! I started using this in raids and had to create a new hotkey that says &quot;/r Easy to do, but not easy to communicate in chat, I'll post a note on the forum&quot;. Bombardment into tell hell!<br />
<br />
One question. When I tried to post on this topic, our guild forum software didn't show the &quot;box&quot; character properly, translated it into a space character. Does anyone know a technique for creating this box (hex 0x12) in Notepad? I would like to be able to explain to my guildies every step, and not rely on the copy and paste.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">If the cut and paste isn't working here may be the reason why....<br />
<br />
I just got this to work last night after messing around with it for about three days.  <br />
<br />
What I was doing wrong is if you read the post it says you need the &quot;box&quot; linked item (slow message or any other message)than a &quot;box&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The box, item link, message, and box need to have no spaces between them.  <br />
<br />
The part I missed is before the first box and after the last box you need text without spaces also.  You must have some form of text touching the first and last box.  Than it seems to work. <br />
<br />
Hope that might help some of those struggling with this matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If anyone can offer how to make the  in notepad it would be much appreciated. copy/paste doesn't do the trick. i don't know how to get this to work without that little box thingy. :)<br />

Also, what I wrote above goes in the hotkey file, not the in game hotkey correct? Thanks<br />

hmmm, tried these codes, they dont seem to work for me /sigh <br />
<br />
As for the code listed, since I'm not an expert, but was able to get it to work within 30 minutes of messing around, getting those codes, and setting it up as I'd wanted, these codes should be correct. Easiest way to make sure, is follow Gangaskan's original set up, then modify it according to your desires. Make sure you don't leave out the 's or anything else that is needed, or it simply won't work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">This is how the link should be made....<br />
<br />
some text,&quot;box&quot;,item link, message, &quot;box&quot; some text <br />
<br />
All the text must be running together to get this to work.  No spaces in between them. <br />
<br />
The link will than be the right click of your message, ie <br />
<br />
Turgurs: 0019265-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001546DB724<br />
<br />
I would type something like this for slow message: <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; %T ~~0019265-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001546DB724SLOWED!!!~~&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
My message would read &gt;&gt;target ~~SLOWED!!!~~&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
You would then be able to click on SLOWED and would get the scroll of the spell listing what it does.  <br />
<br />
The no spaces are required and is why I used the &quot;~~&quot; before and after the item box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Winterfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I took what I read here and experimented a bit and got it working just fine. Once I started using it, of course, all the tells came in asking &quot;How the hell did you do that?&quot; So, I put together the following message for them. It's basically a re-write of Gangaskan's message, written with the ini.file noob in mind. <br />
<br />
========================<br />
<br />
The following technique can be used to incorporate item links into your hotkeys, so that  messages can actually contain more information for the viewer, linkable and unobtrusive, but communicative. Using these links, players can actually see links to the spells referenced by your messages, so that they can better understand what you’re actually casting. The credit for this goes to Shaman (yay) Gangaskan Gnollbasher on Torv, whose post on the Crucible site was the first I read on the topic.<br />
<br />
Step 1: Make a hotkey and give it a recognizable name, like Linktest. Give it some kind of /say text like “/say I have SLOWED %t.”<br />
<br />
Step 2: In your EQ folder, find the file named [YourCharacterName]_[ServerName].ini. So, for example, my file was Winterfury_Firiona.<br />
<br />
Step 3: Open the above file in Notepad and find the hotkey you made. You’ll see the text next to the hotkey that’s labeled by page number, line, etc. You will be editing this text.<br />
<br />
Step 4: Your hotkey will start with some kind of /say or /g, /rs, whatever. The rest of the text will consist of whatever you would ordinarily put in a hotkey message, but will include a snazzy new link. The link you will create consists of four parts: <br />
<br />
a) an opening “box” character (hex 0x12); <br />
b) an item code; <br />
c) a label; and <br />
d) a closing “box” character. <br />
<br />
I’ll explain how to get an item code and make a “box” character below. But the result should look something like this:<br />
<br />
/g0026915-00001-00001-00001-00001-00001C7442067 MALOS on ---&gt; %t in 4.3 seconds ...<br />
<br />
Note the opening /g makes this a group message. Following this is the required “box” character which denotes the start of the item link, followed by the item code, the label (“ MALOS”), and finally the end “box”, followed by the rest of the hotkey message. The text that you put between the last number of the item code and the closing “box” character (in this case “MALOS”) is the label and is the pink text that people will see as a link in the message.<br />
<br />
Step 5: Save As … the file and make SURE that you select UTF-8 encoding in the bottom drop down. This is the format required to be read by EverQuest and is the only way that this will work.<br />
<br />
Step 6: Once the file is saved you’ll need to reload it into EQ either by restarting or just zoning will do. I test these by standing next to a zone line, alt-tabbing out to edit in Notepad, then jumping back in and zoning. <br />
Ok how do you get the item codes and how do you make that little box character?  Every item in EverQuest has an item code and it’s accessible using a simple technique. Send a ;t to an item, and EQ will return a message saying it “Can’t find player xxx…” where xxx… is the item code. Simple, huh? So, typing ;t followed by a link to an item will get you that item’s item code. It’s just like sending a tell to someone but sending it to an item instead of a player.<br />
<br />
The box is not so simple, I’m not sure how to natively create a hex 0x12 character but fortunately you can just copy and paste it right from this example above.<br />
<br />
That does it. Let me know if you have any questions about this technique or suggested improvements. I get a great variety of responses to these messages in my groups, ranging from “Ahhh, so THAT’s what Cripple does” to “Wow, your HAXXORS ROXXORS my BOXXORS”. It’s always neat when a fun technique turns out to have some nice utility as well.<br />

just compressing the info, I suggest you copy paste to a Notepad doc (word didnt work so hot) so you can do this offline.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">The box is not so simple, I’m not sure how to natively create a hex 0x12 character but fortunately you can just copy and paste it right from this example above.<br />
<br />
I can't help directly but perhaps I can give some pointers, that at least are useful in general terms anyway.<br />
<br />
Firstly, you can access a whole bunch of characters if you use windows, by accessing the character map. On some systems this will be under your accessories list, on others you may have to find it yourself. Mine is in C:\WINNT\system32 at work. Fire this up and you can copy and paste to notepad directly.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you can type character codes directly into notepad. First switch numlock on, then hold down alt, and with alt held down type a number such as 13. Now release alt and the character should appear.<br />
<br />
In fact it even works here on the forums with certain symbols!<br />
alt-13 -&gt; &#9834;<br />
<br />
You can add these to your ini file messages to further spice things up (this is old news, but may be new to some). For a list of some symbols see here: http://www.robelle.com/library/smugbook/pcextch.html<br />
<br />
Now for some rambling.....perhaps someone more knowledgable can clarify some of this and make sense of it.<br />
<br />
By typing in random numbers, it seems a lot are supported in some places like notepad, but not here on these forums. Typing alt-14 here gives me &#9835; (hey that's our box!) but in notepad gives me twin-notes (a semi-quaver pair to the initiated!). Hex editor shows 0x 99 ab so I'm pretty sure this wouldn't work.<br />
<br />
I suspect (but can't check, I'm at work) that the &quot;box&quot; has to explicitly be the character from the original post, and copying my one might not work. I actually stuck that box in a hex editor and it came out as the 0x 12, as suggested.<br />
<br />
And I'm still not sure how to produce the box directly...perhaps the &quot;white box&quot; in character map would work but I'm not sure. If someone could find the alt-### combination for it, this would be quite useful information. I wonder if its actually some control character that the forums display a box, and notepad doesn't understand (and thus, also displays as a box). Possibly its outside the scope for the extended character set and there is no alt shortcode, I can't find it in character map either yet but there's so many fonts... <br />
<br />
Finally - I'm sure a list of the common spell IDs would be useful, particularly for some of the ones that are harder to find in the bazaar like RGC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
QUOTE]<br />
<br />
Since it's hex 0x12, it should be decimal 18, and therefore shouldn't alt-018 work? Doesn't seem to, in NotePad I just get a beep. But then, maybe this is because we're talking about a non-printable character and the &quot;box&quot; that we see is nothing more than one particular application's &quot;substitution&quot; presentation for that unprintable character? Maybe the actual code *is* getting embedded into the text so that the key will actually work. Edit: I tested this on another machine and it didn't work. Alt-18 and Alt-018 didn't work. Stumped. All we need to know is how to generate the 0x12 &quot;box&quot; character in Notepad. You'd think it would be pretty straightforward ...<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, here are some updated codes based on recent drops I've picked up (fortunately, I had my wits about me when I looted these and got the codes before I scribed the spells). I'm including only the first and last portions of the codes, as everything in between appears to be the same for all the other codes (i.e., 00001) These have been tested and work:<br />

I had to put in a space between &quot;Incomming and the box for it to be spaced on the message. I tried excluding the space like suggested on one post but the &quot;Incomming&quot; and the item link weren't spaced like I wanted. Also, I had to add a second space to get the entire &quot;C3&quot; to be the actual link text. With a single space after the link code only the &quot;3&quot; showed as the link text. So after figuring all this out and getting the message to &quot;look&quot; right, the &quot;C3&quot; text in the message shows like it is a link but when clicked on it acts like a broken link (doesn't show any info). I've tried excluding spaces and such and have not been able to figure out how to get the spell info to show for the link. I have it saved under the correct format also. Any suggestions???</div></div><hr />
