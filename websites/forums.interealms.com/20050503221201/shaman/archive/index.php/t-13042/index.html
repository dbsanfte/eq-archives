<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I realize that pretty much any class can solo if the mob is slowed , with the exception of casters. So I was wondering about when can we stop tanking? I currently as a 19 Troll Shaman I root, slow, disempower, dot, and the nuke till the root breaks and  I solo them thru. I can always get the slow and disempower is just random. So I was wondering about how far I could go with this method and where should I go to keep this method working constnatly. I am aware we get pets at 34 but all that means to me is more DPS or perhaps someone to tank a bit for a while while I canni. Also is it good anymore for me to charm an animal at 29? I heard of the charm nerf and I was wondering if I shoudl even get that spell. 19 to 24 is a breeze for me as PC is xp haven but after that I am stuck.<br />
<br />
Another thing is there any way I can make my root last longer by some focus effect? and what is a focus effect to keep my buffs as long as possible ? and does spell haste mean I am casting all of my spells faster or just a certain amount?  I ahve a serpentine bracer so my dots last longer and do mroe damage but other then that I am unaware of any other focus effect items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shamans can solo til lvl 60 using slow and tank method if you heal yourself too.  60+ soloing with slow and tanking is tougher cause POP mobs hit really hard and mitigate slow alot but its doable (I soloed for pretty good exp in BOT before, but its tough).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can still do it higher up too. I've tanked in PoS desert when I've had nothing better to do, but its so slow you're better off just grabbing a group anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ihopp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not that it matters but I grab a KEI in Nexus and go solo in Netherberian Lair at lvl 25. I still could do it without KEI but it sure would take a heck of a long time to med back up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">before tier 2 there really isn't much of anything that a shaman can't tank as long as it doesn't mitigate slow (exp mobs of course, not named crud).<br />
<br />
Once you hit tier 2 though the mobs hit for the 500's. when stuff hits for 500 even when its slowed its bad news for anyone but a warrior. Especially considering how they can triple as well, one interrupted heal and you're finished.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm 49 almost 50 and I still tank...  Just started working on my 2hb which makes things go slower as I don't do as much damage or hit as often...   I plan to tank till 60 or whenever I get my tail handed to me, whichever is first...  Once you get canni and regen it will make you downtime a lot less...  Getting KEI makes downtime faster also, but I find I can still solo without it and keep up a good pace...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kedge keep is a great place to solo using charm animal and enduring breath.  I started doing it right at the zone line at about lvl 34, got me to 39 really fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually with good stuff and all defenses aas skills maxed, shamans are the best tank in Tier 2 imo (PoV is a good example). Slow pull, land 2 poisons dots, and torpor / quiessence yourself twice or so... None can outtaunt you, mobs barely do more damage than your quiessence, and this way you do descent damage...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We can tank/torpor/solo any mob that we can slow doesnt mitigate and hits for less than 600 with no special attacks ie flurry aoe stuff like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You might actually start having a harder time in your late 20s and early 30s.  Your thinking of the dogdog right.  He isn't a tank, but added dps :)<br />
Once you hit 29 the better slow helps, and then dogdog's dps helps at 34 and lets you back out to heal if you need.  I'd say the hardest times to tank/solo are 24-39 or so, and then 60+.  Even during those times with good gear its doable, just slower.  Now that there is KEI and BoA and HoV even 24-39 might be easy.  Better gear today too then when us old farts did it ;P</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMHO Shamans dont med we canni C-line spells and BST crack are just a bonus.. dont get stuck on medding learn to canni.<br />

<br />
What about Shadow Knights and Paladins? They are without doubt the best taunters in game.<br />
<br />
Good luck in soloing dont get stuck on the tanking idea though, wont work when you get older.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">now, i'm not in teir 2 as of yet , but , as a 54 shammy I can outtaunt a 61 pally with no trouble, he's chain casting stuns and group healing in the hopes that it would make a difference but plauge, ebolt,venom hasted out bear and a reif keep taunt with an occasional ice strike :)<br />
<br />
i suppose it's kinda a moot point tho, if you have a pally that wants to tank,  unless his gear is depressing, let him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I tanked PoV inner caves yesterday for 3 or 4 pulls when the SK went LD.<br />
But then again I was buffed to 5k hp (no Brells, alas and only Virtue rather than PoT9 + Symbol).<br />
Was pretty easy to keep taunt with Blood of Saryn + Bane.<br />
I am fairly confident I could have continued tanking.<br />
<br />
The only hard part would be splitting mobs but there was a bard so he could have lulled I guess.<br />
<br />
PoS desert (not giants!!) is tankable.<br />
<br />
So yes, there are some spots in Tier 2 where you can actually Tank (with Virtue/etc). Haven't tried CoD or HoH yet - must go give it a bash sometime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure a shammy can tank in PoP when there's a cleric/dr00d healing them in a group :D .<br />
<br />
I think what Medican is on about is when tanking a mob solo becomes inefficient. I'd have to say that slow-tanking mobs prior to PoP was fairly efficient for a shaman but soloing PoP is very inefficient. Most mobs in PoP double hit for 900+ which is still a lot of damage when its slowed. Shamans can still solo a PoV Golem etc. but it would be extremely inefficient compared to the speed of EXP that could be gotten out of a good group.<br />
<br />

<br />
Bah I could have done it chain torporing easy. :p :p<br />
<br />
I wouldn't even try tanking Golems.... it only takes 6 mins to kill one root/rot for 8% AAxp. Be even less once I get Ancient Scourge of Nife next VT raid $$.<br />
Hmm... 8% per 6 mins is about one AA per 75 mins. Now even if say there were a few small gaps while locating mobs to pull single,etc, thats maybe one AA per 90 mins-ish. <br />
(Note that is using Ulthor, Saryn, Epic, Pox, Bane of Nife, Level 64 Root).<br />
<br />
Yes you _can_ get better exp in a good group. But you can also get FAR less in a crap pickup group.<br />
<br />
But back on topic. There are PoP mobs a 60 shaman can tank solo and kill. Planarian Larve in PoV can be tanked the whole time. Just have to chain Torpor/Quiesance yourself. Maybe cast the odd Tnargs if it gets a lucky hit in. Less exp than Golems but less risky.<br />
Also bound to be lots in Tier 1. Go check out the hunting guides!<br />
<br />
Then again.... Soloing IS BORING AS HELL! I normally cant stand to get more than 1/2 an AA before it gets tired and I feel like having someone else to chat too!<br />
<br />
Its nice to actually talk to people while you group. Except for the one time I was with a group of peeps who only spoke GERMAN the whole time :) gah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If you have good gear you can tank quite a few mobs. Can tank most mobs in Halls of Honor, including mobs such as A Valiant Spirit, which hits for max 588, but mitigate slow(&quot;Your spell was mostly successful&quot;). This is with maxed defensive AAs and about ~1400 AC. On this particular mob, your hp will go downward, but with enough hp, you will kill the mob before you get too low to need a Tnarg.<br />
<br />
The lieutenants in the zone hits for 656 max but are fully slowable, so they are easier than A Valiant Spirit(Blacksuits downstairs). <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dasgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have duoing a shaman(45) and monk(50) for a bit now and after getting my 8th character (2 accounts) to the 50's I have to say I really love the shaman class ... how anyone could live with out a shaman is pure futility(sp).  Yes chanters are flashy and make a ton of cash /yawn <br />
<br />
I just found my new main =)<br />
<br />
I have a 55 warrior that can group with my shammy.  I read about monks and their inablilty to tank at high lvls, so I am wondering where and at what lvl I should start pairing them?  Ten lvls isn't that bad but keeping the warrior healed is my biggest question.  With Stoicism I gained a great heal but not that great.  This is based on my old main which is a 62 cleric ... hard to compare to a c-heal ... but thn again hard to compare c-heal to slow =).  Guess I will try the normal places ... like seb, GD, HS and chardok ... any other fun spots U can think of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">About us outaggroing hybrids:<br />
<br />
It won't happen unless the tank sucks or you're trying very hard.  I can usually slow right off and apply two poison dots, and on the second dot the mob will turn to me.  Then, the tank will hit it with one of his aggro spells or use his taunt button, and will have aggro back.  If I keep nuking the mob, he'll keep losing aggro, but he can always get it back.   Usually, though, they say &quot;screw it, the shaman can tank if he wants to so bad&quot; :)  Last time I was in a pickup group, the SK was from one of our rival guilds, so I felt like giving him a hard time.  I dotted the mob twice and started nuking away, and it turned to me, and I said &quot;WHO'S YOUR AGGRO DADDY?!&quot;  I kept doing crap like that for the next hour, and eventually made the SK cry in real life.  Of course he didn't tell us all he was crying, but I can tell.<br />
<br />
Warriors are easy to outaggro in an exp group, though.  Our MT has bloodfrenzy and blade of carnage but I can outaggro him any time I want.  Not so easy though at a raid, where he has a few minutes headstart on aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyways, about the original topic:  At level 19, your slow isn't that great.  It doesn't slow the mob by much, so it isn't that much different from tanking an unslowed mob.  At higher levels though, your slow is amazing, to the point of being almost broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm guessing your two poison dots arent Blood + Ancient Scourge then...<br />
<br />
It's actually sort of funny how badly our high end dots aggro, compared to similar necromancer spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have tanked just about everything I have encountered so far, especially when I don't feel like rooting things off when my pally bud and I are goofing around. Your pooch can tank a little at 34, but I'd say only to give you time to regen a little and/or get some mana back, or to heal up quick before charging back in.<br />
<br />
 I regularly crowd control *cough* adds when our group overpulls, to the point I was surrounded with spiders in Velks the other night, and stoicism literally allowed me to do it, once they were slowed, else we'd have been toast. Generally, ofcourse, I try to kick the gnome in the way due to his ridiculous AC, much higher defense etc etc but I still tank regularly, whether on purpose or not, though I'll confess I struggled in the LoY Crypt zone (can't remember name atm sorry!) when I got slows resisted multiple times and got eaten alive.<br />
<br />
An important note, I go for ac/hp kit as far as possible, and now a regen BP, and as a fellow troll you'll already appreciate we get our own innate one (that improves at certain levels) which helps. Obviously max out your defense (doesn't sound like this'll be a problem for you =)) and be aware losing hp/ac for wis may not be a good plan until later on, though I've found with the release of PoP I can have 200+ wis and maintain about 950ish ac with half decent resists, I've been away from the game 6 months and am staggered by some of the kit available, so could probably bump ac over 1k with a bit of effort.<br />
<br />
Anyway, yes we can tank all the way to 60, as far as I know (PoP and 61+ I am clueless on) but some mobs will eat you, it's a question of working out which ones won't *punts gnome in front of them* to an extent. The later doggies can certainly tank a little better, I still use my 49th one to tank on lower blues whilst I do other things. <br />
<br />
Finally, I'd consider duo'ing with a tank of some description on the way from mid 20's to 34, I seem to remember I was a bit slow when I did it mostly solo. As soon as I relented and grabbed a tank, I flew along, though gameplay does change significantly.<br />
<br />
Ooop and also finally *ahem*, I'd suggest looking up focus items on one of the bigger info boards but I'll try answer your queries (like I said I have been away a while so hopefully someone will correct me if I am horribly wrong, a likely event):<br />
<br />
As far as I am currently aware...<br />
1. Root can't be extended by any focus effects.<br />
2. Extending beneficial buffs uses the Extend(ed?) Enhancement focus items (eg Totemic BP has lvl II on it).<br />
3. Spell Haste focus items affect all your spells except those cast off items/potions etc.<br />
<br />
Hope at least some of that was helpful and not too full of waffle, happy tanking =)<br />
<br />
*EDIT* Forgot to say (grief can this get longer), you won't be doing a lot of damage weapon wise as you get higher, in relation to the mobs hit points, but tanking allows your pet to chew away, and with decent ac and, later, stoicism you can often canny successfully whilst taking a few hits so you are good to go soon after the mob drops (decent regen helps a lot at this point).</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was my point exactly. The original question was when does tanking mobs become inefficient and its definately the case that standing toe-to-toe with mobs in PoP is an inefficient method. You're much better off not tanking them and root/doting them. Sure you can chain heal urself and tank one but I'm sure you will have considerable downtime between pulls.<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>MoonDoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">One time I partularly enjoyed was when I was L62 (I think) in PoDisease, the group lost its tank so rather than break up the group, I took his place.<br />
<br />
Just slowing on incoming, and casting 2-3 Disempowers on him (fast cast, low cost, good aggro), made sure that I didnt lose aggro, and Torpor made sure that I didnt take much damage.<br />
<br />
I kept at it for over 2 hours, and with a rogue and ranger on their backs, and a wizzy friend nuking I rarely lost aggro, and they went down pretty fast.  It was the most fun I'd had in ages.<br />
<br />
And if you ever go to kill the MB in PoI, and get assigned to crowd control, dont be disappointed, be happy, it's great fun. <br />
<br />
Pick a corner, and when the signal comes, slow every clockwork bug you see, as fast as you can.  With torpor, and a bit of luck, you can end up with a constant steam of them on you for the whole raid, anything upto 6 at a time. <br />
<br />
I should mention that the objective is that the spiders never get past you, or they mess up the raid, getting aggro and keeping them on you, whilst the others kill them, seems to be the best way to do this, and is great fun (mezzing and rooting is a BAD idea - but charm is fine).<br />
<br />
But I only tank for fun, or out of necessity, not to accumulate experience points.<br />
<br />
Regarding Medican's other questions;<br />
<br />
Befriend Animal has never been a lot of use to me, and 5 levels later you get your first pet anyway, a happy day :)<br />
<br />
I'm not aware of any way to extend the duration of root spells.<br />
<br />
Yes, Spell haste means that most of your spells will cast faster, and there are several other focus effects also of use to shaman.  The easiest way is probably to go into you /bazaar screen, put in your class, and select focus items from the list of types, then just browse what's there.</div></div><hr />

I tried to outtaunt a ranger. used, slow, bon, eb, vos, plague, scourge and cripple.<br />
