<br />
we have less healing cause our mana regen? all i can say is bollocks.<br />
<br />
cleric with (looks liks aa) instant regain mana 2 times our canni and no hp reduced?<br />
admittly it level 5 so least 30 odd aa, and i cant say how long recast is, but still.<br />
<br />
bah bah bah bah<br />
<br />
though i happy for clerics, by GoD , give shaman a good heal/nuke/pet etc we really are being screwed.<br />
<br />
also the cleric thought we screwed with new quin:) i dont think cleric would mind us getting a desecent HoT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i sorry if this another thread, but i didnt see anywhere mentioning that cleric getting a mana regen aa. and i seen arguements that our mana regen is a reason why we are overpowered/cant heal as well etc.<br />
which with this oblivously isnt the case.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i agree i dont know the recast time, but it still a free mana regen, ours might still be better but if they get a free 2500 mana per 2 hours? which i think it will be less  more likely 30 mins or less. it abit like the wizard gather mana i hear how long that?<br />
<br />
why cant we get a quick 2 k heal?<br />
or the same dd that cleric get at 1200 dd?<br />
or better quin for total off 5k (including aa)<br />
<br />
even on the cleric broad the orignal poster of some the aa said that the new quin screwed shaman. <br />
<br />
mind as low planes and normal ldon i have no complaints for healing , it in  hard ldon and elemental planes and  a lot of GoD likely our healing is pitiful. a new spell for quin i dont think would over power at 400/tick but to help with higher planes a seperate aa to improve that to 500 , 600, 700, 800  would be good. and take up alot of aa:) and you would need to get god as it would only affect the new spell.<br />
 or that healing aa we got actually affect HoT spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I know they seem to have intermirsed so many class identity abilities its not even funny. The new wards is basically along the lines of giving them regen surely. And this 2500 mana thing is to suit clerics for raids. Looks like underlying there is a raid and group  balance and unfortunately these seem to be contrary to each other.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">1 - clerics already have a mana buff (Armor of the Zealot) which stacks with everything else (except Fo7 of course, go go IoS.) <br />
<br />
2 - their heals aren't that expensive.<br />
Cheal (the MAIN heal in raids, which is where the above AA would be most useful) - lvl 39 spell - 400 mana. <br />
Supernal Elixir (their best HoT) - 400 mana. <br />
Supernal Light (their best quick heal) - 600 mana.<br />
<br />
This of course is before any Focuses. So it's not like they're dying because they don't have enough mana.  :rolleyes: (and let us remember, this AA would more than likely be only 59+ attainable and any good cleric actually knows how to play by then, baring the usual idiots in ANY class, including our own shaman)<br />
<br />
I'm not advocating nerfing something before it's even been implemented, don't get me wrong...after all, healing is the clerics MAIN job (not their only job, we shaman should know better, just as we're not JUST buff bishes). I have no problem with a 2 hour or even 1 hour refresh on this AA for clerics, after all it would restore about half of the average 65 cleric mana pool and could save an entire raid. I would have a problem if it allowed some to go stunning, nuking and what have you without care to their pool because they could refresh it every 15 mins. That would be over the top, but not an AA that would basically be saved and used for Raids or the odd oom cleric in groups.<br />
<br />
So, while I don't really see the overall need for this besides in a raid, I don't have a problem with it...as long as they keep the refresh time high enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just to clarify the mana regen on the Armor of the Zealot line does not stack with the druid Protection of the Nine mana regen.  So usually on raids you see clerics asking for Focus and going with Symbol and Pot9 instead of Virtue/Armor of the Zealot.<br />
 <br />
With the second point, if their spells are so damn cheap isn't 2500 mana a little too much?  They get way more of a bang for their buck then any other healer gets per mana.<br />
<br />
Going back to the 2500 mana Cleric AA.<br />
<br />
The way I see it is that supposedly Clerics need some way to get mana back quickly after a wipe or death.  Someone proposed this, and everyone jumped on the bandwagon.  <br />
<br />
Except for the fact Clerics already get Divine Resurection which helps them on a wipe or death and gives them back all their mana, though of course gets rid of their buffs. <br />
<br />
Similarly Divine Resurrection got its timer reduced and an AA added to make it faster during PoP.  <br />
<br />
Do Clerics really need another way to get back mana?</div></div><hr />

Didn't know it didn't stack with Pot9, thanks.<br />
<br />
But I have to disagree with your second paragraph. Let me give you two scenerios, taking that this AA might be 2 hours and that GoD AA are going to be so expensive, that this will probably only be gotten by clerics that are already 65.<br />
<br />
Grouping Cleric - Cleric joins a group and casts HoV. Cleric then needs to waste time and med because most can't safely heal after HoV until their pool goes up. Uses AA, no time wasted, group can play, but he can't use AA again for 2 hours and HoV without any extensions is 2 hours 30 mins and here we goooo....2500 mana.<br />
<br />
Raid Cleric - (not speaking about the wipe scenerio since you already know of that one) Clerics chain cheal. A cleric will more than likely go oom before any other caster in a raid. Why? Because it's their job to keep the MA going. No matter what. Necros feed clerics in raids. Extra bards sing near clerics to enhance their mana regen during raids. All because they use so much more mana, despite the cost of their cheal (which isn't 'cheap' imho, just not expensive). If say a 3 cleric raid had all 3 clerics with this AA, it can greatly improve the chances of the raid. - I'm all for this.<br />
<br />
Why? Because it's only 2500 in one shot ever 2 hours. That's NOT a lot of mana to regain in comparision. I figure most 65 lvl clerics (non-elemental) are going to have about the same mana pool as I do, 4k and that's probably on the low end. No shaman with canni4 &amp; 5 and quiess should complain about this unless they lower the time.  (although you have that perogative)<br />
<br />
So basically, this gives them the ability to cast HoV for free (with MGB being half the normal cost) and/or using it for refreshing their raid healing pools. <br />
<br />
I can see your point, that you don't think clerics need this. And you're probably right...I don't  like the idea that they can group and cast HoV every two hours and not pay for it, but I also see the raid benefit far outweighing that and the fact is, clerics aren't in a race against us unlike say beastlords (with their slows)...or any other class, except for the average grouping druid healer, so I say more power to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">noone cept test poeple knew what the recast on this is 2 hrs was a guess, which i think it will be less than myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The group situation is a good example where its useful, but I really don't see clerics doing that since the get out of jail free card of 2500 instant mana behooves them to actually keep it up not use it during the buffing phase.  In addition shouldn't a group have to pay some sort of penalty in time and mana for getting such a powerful buff?<br />
<br />
Actually I was thinking more about this AA and how my guild handles healing during raids, both bosses and yard trash.  And considering how things are right now, and how things might possibly go in terms of encounter design and difficulty I think this AA would be an extremely bad idea.<br />
<br />
The only times our clerics run out of mana during a boss fight are fights which have an AE mana drain/dot.  Think Saryn, and Terris Thule in Plane of Time.  With this sort of AA, clerics get to keep functioning, without the support of other characters, that is a bad design direction in my opinion.  If future encounters include mana drains, clerics get to keep going and casters without an instant mana surge button are **** out of luck. <br />
<br />
Encounter designers have to design with this AA in mind so make fights last a bit longer than they would have had to before which in turn makes clerics EVEN more necessary, something that most agree is problematic for raid and guild composition. <br />
<br />
There are probably other unintended consequences with this AA in terms of encounter design, and if I was a designer for this game something like this would've probably been nixed from my list a long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can already see upgrades for this ability in the next expansions(after GoD) to accomodate the higher mana pools and mana expenditure.<br />
<br />
I sure find it funny that the 2 most important pure casters(Cleric, Enchanter) get an instant mana button(without any sort of drawback mind you).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Personally I'm really looking forward to this aa since i know it's going to be very handy for our clerics to have.<br />
<br />
I'm going to bet that the recast time is simular to enchanters (hour and a half off the top of my head) and it will probably end up costing 30+ aa's to get up to level 5. There's also the issue of cast time.<br />
<br />
I didn't really see anyone complain about enchanters gather mana and they get a free FM. Cann is still infinitely more useful than that and I'd bet Cann will be more useful than the cleric version.</div></div><hr />

yes canni is very likely more useful, just i wanted it taken into consideration that we soon wont be only class with aa mana regen.<br />
and as such our canni spells arnt an excuse not to get better heal/dd/buffs/debuffs/pets etc:) my i cant believe it is more related to oh you get slow/good mana regen therefore to powerful threads:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
An aa like Gather mana and likely the cleric one is not a mana regen aa. It's emergency mana. 2500 mana every 90 minutes equals out to less than 3 mana a tick. Hardely even noticable on the grand scale of mana regen. Cann v on the other hand is over 30 mana a tick even taking out the mana for a torpor/q. Don't get me wrong I'd like to have a better direct heal and a better nuke but saying look clerics get an aa that gives them mana too isn't gonna get you anwhere since it ISN'T the same thing. Yes active mana regen (aka cann 4) has definitely lost it's luster and doesn't have a big enough lead over passive regen anymore.</div></div><hr />

Next time you log on, don't use Cannibalize at all and see how broken your class is without it.<br />
<br />
Clerics And Enchanters on the other hand, do great without the respective instant mana abilities.<br />
<br />
This isn't a class envy thing btw. Granted that this is imo a pretty relevant boost for the 2 classes(I am throwing Gather Mana in there as well), I don't think it's broken or overpowering. It's VERY useful, however.</div></div><hr />

surely this would suggest that we are balance for mana regen and cant be used as an excuse why we dont get better spells. so that only leaves slow , which we are only 5% better than the next class and 10% from the next, who can cast it lot quicker?<br />

As I said above I think something like this is a bad idea to give to clerics.  With respect to raid encounter design this can throw a serious monkey wrench into possible designs.  <br />
<br />
It almost feels like the design team is throwing this AA to clerics as a bone, as a &quot;we can't think of anything else to give to you&quot; so we'll give you more mana! In other words I'm not confident they thought this one through all the way.</div></div><hr />

Isnt this kind of like saying Clerics go out and play without your heals and see how broken your class is.<br />
Manna regen is an intrinsic part of Shaman wheres other classes its a bonus.<br />
Though why we seem to pay such a high price for our manna regen is beyond me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">not really, <br />
cleric not healing would be more like shaman not slowing/debuffing/healing maybe casting odd damage spell. you cant compare a unique spell to a completely different spell. but you can compare how a class is affect by 1 spell.<br />
canni use to be a much bigger advantage as if not grouped witha enc we could regain our mana quicker still, like necros. now though the advantage of canni is lessened as alot more classes have mana regen spells ft15 and other items that regen mana passively, it still gives us an advantage but just noway near as great as it use to be. i would say the advantage it use to have and the advantage now has been halved atleast, just by this. but the mana thing that has handy capped us it the speed  things are done at now, we just dont have time to cast canni as much either, because it isnt passive, it`s an active thing and this has decrease its value again, not so much for soloing but for groups. when things die in 30 sec to 45 sec its hard to canni much and cast our own very slow spells, shaman are penilised in 3 ways, higher mana, longer cast time, due to our higher regen, and then again to cast our regen. but we are still penilized as if it was still the same advantage as it used to be before all the new passive mana regen and the speeding up of the game.</div></div><hr />
