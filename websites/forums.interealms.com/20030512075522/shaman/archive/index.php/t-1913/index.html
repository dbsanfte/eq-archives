<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In echo caverns do the needlite area with your monk partner.  They hit extremely fast, but soft.  If you run out of them pull some boglings.  <br />
<br />
Loot wasn't there when I did this zone, they added wings/legs to the needlites however just before we were done.  Stackable loot that sells for 1 or 2pp each one.  <br />
<br />
You can solo the needlites also, there is only one set of spawns that will pull two (just avoid them).  Nice thing about needlites is when you hit 30 (if you haven't been soloing them) is to pull one with a slow, dot it and let it beat on you.  Your defense should max out before you hit 31.  The delay on them must be around 10 or less, I haven't seen a mob hit that fast before, maybe the main guy from the rogue epic . ;)<br />
<br />
Fortunately they hit like this 2, 2, 2, 13, 21, 2, 2, 2, 2.  Pull with slow tho as its hard to cast thru them at full speed.</div></div><hr />

Any clue exactly what level they are?</div></div><hr />

They do run when low on health but as they take a right to leave the needlite area, you need to move to their left. Hitting them from the left forces them to go back and forth, and allows you to avoid wormspores.<br />
<br />
As for their level, everyone else says that they turn light blue at 34.</div></div><hr />
