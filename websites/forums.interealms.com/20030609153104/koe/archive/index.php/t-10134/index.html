<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...a day for (shock) giving thanks.<br />
<br />
I am thankful for my friends and family, even those whom I know only as pixels on the screen.<br />
<br />
Share your holiday sentiments (and recipies!).<br />
<br />
Buttermilk Pumpkin PIE <br />
<br />
Ingredients:<br />
Pie crust<br />
3 eggs<br />
1 egg yolk<br />
3/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar<br />
2 tbsp. all-purpose flour<br />
1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice<br />
1 tsp vanilla extract<br />
3/4 cup canned pumpkin puree<br />
1 1/4 cups buttermilk<br />
<br />
Method:<br />
Roll out dough on lightly floured surface to 12 inch round. Carefully transfer to deep 9-inch pie pan. Press into pan. Trim and decoratively crimp edges. Let stand in refrigerator for 2 hours or overnight. Freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Bake crust until just golden, about 15 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, whisk eggs, egg yolk, and sugar in large bowl until blended. Mix in flour, pumpkin pie spice, and vanilla. Stir in pumpkin and butter, then buttermilk. Pour filling into crust. Bake until set (center will puff slightly) about 45 minutes. Cool completely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beer Bread<br />
Ingredients:<br />
3 cups flour<br />
3 1/2 tsp baking powder<br />
2 tsp salt<br />
1 tbsp sugar<br />
1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese<br />
12 oz beer (gotta use cheap stuff...better beers don't have nearly enough yeast to make the bread rise. Budwiser works well.)<br />
<br />
Method:<br />
Grease 9x5x3&quot; loaf pan. Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Add beer and cheese, mix well. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake at 350 F for 45 minutes. Turn out on rack to cool. Let cool completely before slicing.<br />
<br />
HAPPY HOLIDAYS! :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!<br />
<br />
I dont have any recipies... but I do like single malt scotch, NEAT.  No ice, no water.<br />
<br />
Good stuff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm..<br />
<br />
Not a huge recipie type of person, but this dip goes well with chips, crackers, etc. <br />
<br />
1 jar of salsa<br />
1 2 pound block of velveeta<br />
1 can of chili<br />
1 pack taco seasoning mix<br />
<br />
Mix chili, salsa and taco mix in a microwave bowl. Add peper, chili powder, tabasco, etc to taste. Put in microwave for about 12 minutes, stirring once (should be warm enough that a bit of steam is coming off). <br />
<br />
Melt cheese in another bowl. Add other mix to cheese after it is melted. Stir and mix well. <br />
<br />
I think it is better if you put it in the fridge and let it sit over night, but you can use it then. To serve, warm slightly and stir. <br />
<br />
You can adjust the &quot;heat&quot; with what type of salsa you use along with what type of velveeta and how much you throw in for spices. <br />
<br />
Happy Thanksgiving everyone.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That dip actually works well if you just use Chilli and Velveta.  Just in case you don't have any Taco Seasoning etc...  Its great with tortilla chips.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">But, but...<br />
<br />
The taco mix is the sekret ingredient.. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">While I have never had it with Taco Mix I am sure it does add some pizazz.<br />
<br />
But I would hate to think of someone having to go to the store on thanksgiving JUST to get taco seasoning ;) <br />
<br />
Also, I dont remember if you said this, but you can do it on the stove top and just throw the Chilli and the Velveta in a pot and cook it up.<br />
<br />
Cube the velveta for better results rather then throwin in a whole block :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So what is a good Thanksgiving wine?  Well don't go with the old addage &quot;white wine with white meat, red wine with red meat.&quot;  Do both!  I think a Riesling (off dry) will please even the &quot;I don't like wine&quot; people as well as match up with that cranberry sauce, yams or whatever sweet thing on the table.  If you like reds, go for a Pinot Noir, or if price is not an issue, go for the French Pinot Noir, Burgundy.  Others worth mentioning: Chianti or Sangiovese and Zinfandel (not white, but red).<br />
<br />
Main thing is just enjoy the day, the company, the food, and the wine!  Just make sure you don't drink too much, so you can sneak on line later to say &quot;Hi&quot; to all your Turkeys in EQ!!<br />
<br />
Happy Turkey Day,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Here's my recipes that I'm cooking for today.  <br />
<br />
Turkey:<br />
10-12lb gobbley<br />
after removing turkey colostomy bags or whatever those gizzard things are.  Cut 1 lemon into 4 parts, rub in the lemon on the skin of the turkey.  Take one quarter lemon and shove it in the turkey.  Next use about 4 small pieces of garlic from a clove cut them up in halves or fourths and rub them into the skin as well when done same as before shove em inside dat bird.  Take 1 onion cut it in half and you guessed it .....body cavity.  Now for the seasoning.  I use the following covered on both sides:<br />
<br />
Jamaican Jerk Seasoning<br />
Paprika<br />
Kayene Pepper<br />
Seasoned Salt<br />
Parsley<br />
<br />
I cook the turkey for about 3-5hours depending on size.  I use a broiler pan as it collects the juices from the turkey. I put a pan of hot water under the rack the turkey cooks on to keep the bird extra moist as when it comes out i literally can shake the meat off the bone.  I take the turkey juices left over and put them in a bowl.  I take the onion out of turkey add it to the bowl of juices and then the following:<br />
<br />
Flour<br />
White Wine<br />
Black Pepper <br />
Salt <br />
<br />
Poppin Cranberry Sauce<br />
1lb fresh cranberries<br />
3 Oranges<br />
Half a Lemon<br />
Red Wine <br />
Brown Sugar<br />
Regular Sugar<br />
Karo Syrup<br />
1 cup water<br />
<br />
In a med sauce pan add the cranberries the sugar water and wine.  Mix it together gets kinda thick until the sugar breaks down.  Chop the lemon and Oranges into pretty small pieces.  I cut them in 4ths and then slice them down from there.  Add the lemon and orange.  Over med heat let it cook for about 40-60mins.  The cranberries will pop as they cook.  You'll know when the sauce is done by looking at the texture and color.  Should be a real thick maroon.  <br />
<br />
Cheesecake Pumpkin Pie<br />
<br />
1 can evaporated Milk<br />
1 big can of pumkin solid NOT the MIX<br />
Cinnamon<br />
Vanilla<br />
3 oz stick of Philly cream cheese softened<br />
Frozen or homade pie crust<br />
2 eggs<br />
Karo syrup 1/2 cup<br />
Brown sugar or reg sugar your preferrence<br />
<br />
Preheat oven to 325 which from cookin the bird it should be :D<br />
<br />
In a med size mixing bowl beat the cream cheese and no Baracus not with a mallet :P.  With the mixer on med speed beat it until it gets kind of fluffy.  Add 1/4 cup of karo syrup(half of the half cup) and vanilla.  After it's mixed up pretty good set it to the side.  <br />
<br />
In a second bowl add the pumkin lump(can of solid pumpkin), eggs, evaporated milk, remaining karo syrup, sugar, cinnamon and  small pinch of salt.  Beat until smooth.  Pour pumpkin mix into pie crust.  <br />
<br />
Add tablespoons of the cream cheese and I use a fork or thin spatula to mix it in.  It also adds that swirled marbled look.  <br />
bake for 50-60 mins and boomba you got a kickin pumpkin pie.  <br />
For a twist you can make it with a graham cracker crust. <br />
<br />
I make smashed potatoes.  Ehren my wife makes a homemade stuffing that uses water chestnuts.  We usually have rolls to go with that.  <br />
<br />
The kicker to all this is it serves 4-6ppl easy and I get it usually at under 50 bucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ice:<br />

I prefer a Dry Reisling over off-dry, personally. Also, a nice sweet Gewertztreminer is very good.<br />
