<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure I can't be the only one stuck at work and wondering about AA's and wanting to play around.  I've done some web surfing and found nothing, so I thought I'd ask ya'll.<br />
<br />
Does any know of a program or webpage that has interactive AA pathing?  It would list the costs of the aa, and prereqs, etc.. and when you're done playing you could export it to a file so you can follow the path later.<br />
<br />
It probably has limited use, but to someone that just hit 65 and is starting to farm some AA's, it would be useful.  I have a IRL friend that is also about to hit 65 for the first time, but he's a SK, and I wouldn't mind looking at his AA's too and try to give him suggestions/recommendations too.  It's just a pain having to look all this stuff up, get an idea, then not remembering where you saw it and such.<br />
<br />
Anyone know of something like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well other than Samanna's site and the AA listing there and the semi accurate listing at EQCastersrealm I dont really know of any such animal. I can, however, offer some good information on AA paths to take.<br />
 For your SK friend, for sure is defensive AA, defensive AA, defensive AA...sure its nice to have the Unholy Pony, but no one gives a rats ass about that if you tank like a wet noodle, HT crits are nice on raids for Boss mobs, but dont do a lot in groups. He should go for AT LEAST his Luclin defensives and Hp raisers before looking at anything else, then from there Weapon Affinity 1-2, Theft of Life 1, then from there crit AAs both nuke and melee based. Here is a link to the &quot;official&quot; SK.org thread on &quot;Your first 100 AA&quot;<br />
Tanking SK AA path for first 100 AA's  (http://shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=23691) <br />
<br />
For a shaman, go straight for Cann 5, from there go ahead and finish up the buff extension AA's (SCM/SCRM), Spell Casting Mastery (flat reduction on spell costs), VP 2 at least (1 just doesnt push the mob far enough back), and Puppy Pack 1 (good to help snag adds sometimes, others for push when you need it)... also finishing up to LR5 is worth the time.<br />
Lots of good stuff to look at after that, so many that its really hard to look back...once I hit 200 I really had gotten all the ones that I &quot;wanted&quot; and started screwing around with crit nukes, Rabid Bear, etc.<br />
For a &quot;cap&quot; and just a last sidebar, I have to say skip regen 3 and get Metabolism 3....its much more return on your investment, especially if you snag some of your favorite foods :)</div></div><hr />
