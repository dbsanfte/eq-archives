i liked th e idea from this board about alchemy res potion. aslong as it didnt cost more than about 100pp to make and didnt fail alot. mind i dont think any potion should be more than 100pp to make.</div></div><hr />

I guess it would be fitting to add it if they want to increase our jack-of-all-trades role, but it will not make us more desireable in a GoD group since you basicly need a cleric there anyway.<br />

A rez potion would also make absolutely nothing to make us better group-members. It would however increase the value of a shaman as a buff/tradeskill bot, and thus effectively lowering the overall skill of the shaman community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are the kings/queens of niceties. Do we really need more? Shouldnt they focus on our heavy shortcomings instead of giving us more glass beads?<br />
<br />
But still i can somewhat agree with what youre saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would love to have a rez ability in any form even if it was 90%.<br />
<br />
Vigdis is right that it would do little help the Shaman in the high end game seeking desirability in groups, but it would be a huge benefit to the Shaman that loves to solo.<br />
<br />
I think the balancing issue is going to be with the necros and their form of resurrection.  They will not be happy if the shaman gets a cheep and easy form of res when they must do a sacrifice to get the same.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would love to see a reincarnation form of resurrection that would provide the same experience recovery benefits of a resurrection but also place a timer type buff that would give the reincarnated character the form of some random global animal model for the duration.  It might also give a negative -20 int and -20 wis as a detrimental side effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I really like the idea of &quot;Spirit Call' or some such that doesn't rez, just calls the naked body to the corpse.  Let a cleric rez em later.<br />
<br />
Not overbalancing, but it keeps things moving if we don't have to wait for the main healer to find their way back to the group if they die.  And it fits the profile for the spirit magic class.<br />
<br />
Of course, as mentioned above - this does not fix the basic problems with our class now, just adds another tool to our swiss-army-knife class.  But at least it is a tool that makes sense in line with the poor, trampled 'Vision&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>takk the silent one</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shamans getting rez must be the worst idea of &quot;fixing&quot; our class that i have ever heard.<br />

I guess it would be fitting to add it if they want to increase our jack-of-all-trades role, but it will not make us more desireable in a GoD group since you basicly need a cleric there anyway.<br />
<br />
I think the main thing is if there is a role for  a shaman rez, it is one of last resort.  Nearly everyone wipes, but no cleric or rezzer available. There is not enough people to finish the objective and  a long and tedious CR. <br />
    For example, a necro saved a  trial because he was able to rez in people. Of course it was costly using EEs but it meant the expedition could finish. Would a necro normally consider doing this.... probably not.<br />
I would be in favor of a aa skill with a Long  duration like divine res (36 hrs) but for a regular rez. (and get rid of the 20 pt aa skill for group buffing of summon pets... we know we all like that one)<br />
<br />
<br />
A rez potion would also make absolutely nothing to make us better group-members. It would however increase the value of a shaman as a buff/tradeskill bot, and thus effectively lowering the overall skill of the shaman community.<br />
hmm I'm not sure what you mean by this... In general, potion does not make us better group members or shamans. I'm not sure how making a potion will lower the overall skill of the shaman community... If you mean that a shaman would allow his group members die because he has the extra clutch of a rez potion, I don't see this happening. <br />
<br />
On the other hand,  I can see the difficulty in such a potion being implemented.. I guess you can target a corpse and throw the rez potion (like the snare potion) but then I would expect some kind of negative effect similar to eating away half the maximum hp of target. (a 10000 hp tank drains 5000 hp from thrower) to balance giving a rez with 25% health to the corpse.<br />
   It would be nice to quaff a potion and you can instanteously be at your corpse with a rez effect but that would mean changing the way rez are implemented.... targetable  corpse in the same zone.  I doubt SOE would make the changes necessary to make a rez potion work like this (but who knows...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree it might be a bit far-fetched but its really very easy.<br />
<br />
Making potions is not an ability that requires you to actively group. A rez potion  increases the value of having a shaman buff / tradeskill bot. This  will make our class even more a subject to shaman characters with players who dont know the basics of being a good shaman - and thus - making shamans in general less skilled.<br />
<br />
Far fetched, i agree to that, but if theyre giving us rez, make it a spell, not a potion. We need stuff to contribute to groups. Not to encourage botting even more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It would be a major boost to shamans, with all their extra dots they have got a lot recentl <br />
<br />
<br />
ROFL. I just had to share that nugget of knowledge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and just FYI i think a no rez spirit call is pretty pointless. Yes i can see how it would work, but not giving us a 90% rez if any rez at all would be silly. <br />
<br />
I see this as the shamans willingness to take anything they can get cause they been told they deserve less for so long. SoE and even other players have brainwashed themselves into a  kunark mentality and never come out of it. People just go &quot; oh the shaman are super uber already&quot; cause their friend had one 3 years ago and he owned.<br />
<br />
There is no need to dumb down your requests for something in hopes that SoE will listen. Leaving the 90% exp off it is doing nothing to help its cause i feel. What you need is unity from the playerbase, to make SoE listen. A big voice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personaly, in my opinion, i think there is no reason what so ever for shaman to not get a 90% rez potion that is no drop and castable on other people that cost 300-500PP to make each. Necros have a rez that costs about 300PP that is like 92 or 93% and no one is complaining at all about those now are they.<br />
<br />
<br />
See rez is not a class defineing tool, its not something that any class wants. If you actualy talk to a cleric or a pally or even a necro, they will tell you its the one spell that is more a burden then a addition to their class then anything else in their line up. They are constantly being asked to travel across the world or to other planets or planes to rez some shmuch ( like me ;) ) that got in over his head. It takes time out of their day and can often be complicated to get the rez done. <br />
<br />
Clerics, from the ones i talked to, couldnt give this burden away fast enough and no one with half a brain is going to complain or go&quot; omg clerics wont be needed cause other classes can rez, cause if they do they are not seeing the big picture on what clerics offer.  The best rez that costs nothing in the game, the best heals which no class can touch and the best straight HP buffs in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like i said.  90% rez, 300-500pp each and no drop which means only the shaman can cast it. ( last part is debatable, buti feel its best )<br />
<br />
Its does 1 thing and 1 only. Remove un-needed stress and aggravation to the game, which as much as i though it was charming int he past, those days are now gone. You cant think both ways. SoE wants everything quicka nd fast, then you need to stick to it, cause when things move fast it makes that 1 thing thats slow, seem 10 times slower then it did before.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if this idea isnt implemented, some sorta alternative rez solution need implimentation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the plate-wearing cleric and most of the group wiped, it would be rare that the shaman was one of the survivors IMHO.  Not sure how often this would apply.  But it would be good any time the Cleric gets deaded.<br />
<br />
The theory is that folks will PL more shamans up just to buff and make potions - not to actually play as shamans.  No real exp =  no ability.<br />
<br />
At the risk of suggesting that these should actually be made, they could be a pre-death thing.  Drink it before a death and get an automagic rez after you die.  Not hard to implement if there is a yes/no box to let you time it.  These would sell like hotcakes to clerics and soloers at the right price...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I disagree. I have often been the survivor of a whipe. When i get aggro i Q myself and toss a few short heals and a lot of times, in doing that the cleric will pull aggro. Sometimes they run around thinking they will live and i cant heal them cause they are OOR or they just get smashed before the group can pull aggro off them. There is more reasons for this out come, im not going to list them all, but just say it does happen. At this point i could rez her for 90% and the group can carry on.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Them giving us rez would be like tossing us breadcrumbs with jam, when we all need a solid bear-sandwich to keep us healthy and in shape.<br />

<br />
Again, I agree. Everyone wants rez. Shamans with rez! whats next? Druids with Feign Death? Call it, Natures Deception or something... no, what we need isnt to take others abilities.<br />
<br />
We need to either find something entirely new, or - hopefully - buff us in our current role(s).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It doesnt matter. If they gave us rez they would make it drop  in some god forsaken zone that most of us wouldnt see and make it no drop. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've been keeping an eye on that thread.  To be honest, the following quote kinda just sums it all up for me:<br />
Maybe if they scrapped the berserker and made another healing class of some sort, the game would actually have enough healers. As it is, 90% of the time, I can throw together a group in ten minutes except for finding a decent healer. <br />
<br />
Hell, maybe they could...ya know... make shaman heals not suck. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I would definitely appreciate some form of rez: AA, potion, or even Spell.  Everyone is saying this is chump change, but I can't count the times a single rez could have changed my whole play night.  Even if it was a no exp rez (I liked the idea of a no exp rez, that allowed for a rez later on).  Heh I would've payed a couple of K for a stupid rez potion to rez my cleric who was only one to die right before Kyv Heartstriker in Tipt (and was the only rezzer).  Not that I recommend that sort of price range at any rate, but that's how convenient a rez would be.<br />
<br />
I disagree with whoever posted it wouldn't help our desireablility to get GoD groups and in raids.  It's very, very hard to get a group to go to KT or whatnot when you don't have a rezzer.  Even if you have a 10k tank and fully aa'd and decently geared druid to heal, people will still want rez.  As soon as a group wipes the members will ask, did the cleric live?  Then they will ask, did the Pally, Necro, or Shaman live?  I'd like that.<br />
<br />
And for raids, this would speed up the unwiping process.  When your Uqua raids of 54 (53 if you don't count the cleric/pally/necro you have camped, right?) gets completely dropped and no one gets out because of ae's killing the fd'ers, you'd appreciate any sort of rezz's to get things going.  Or in a certain DT event in Inukta, where it's all about the rezzes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think they need to upgrade necro rez to ee free after 65 or so even if it's an aa related to start with. I would like to see them give it to another class shaman would be nice, but any class would make me happy. Nothing I hate more then doing a ldon and have to wait for timer for my body to pop so I can get a rez. I think it would be kinda cool to let us do rezz's but require dufrenite as a component. The old gem we had to use for totemic. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So yeah the bots are already there, and most could get the alchemy up high enough to attempt it.  Sitting at 210 with Grandmaster and wondering why in the hell I did it!   Any potion worth a flip is too costly to make and sell for much of a profit (Gate, SoW) and the rest of em, well, they kinda are pointless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I find it amusing that the two most needed classes in the game (clerics and encs) are arguing about being weak in any way, shape, or form.  <br />
<br />
That giving shaman a 0% rez is in some way going to make clerics worthless?  Whatever.<br />
<br />
I also find it amusing that on other class boards, shamans are actually still considered &quot;buffers&quot;.  LIke our stat buffs provide any benefit.  Casters like clerics and enc's, I guess, just assume that the melee are happy with us.  What they don't know is that most int classes would rather have their self buff over focus, and that melee click off any stat buff we give them.<br />
<br />
I also find it amusing that encs/clerics think our dots are actually useful in most encounters.  Sure, a couple raid mobs perhaps, but grouping, no way.  If its tough mobs that last at least 5 ticks, like in KT, I might drop bane, (assuming we don't have that underpowered ENC in the group which makes all the mobs drop in 15 seconds).  <br />
<br />
Jeez, I guess it never ends.  If you are class X, all other classes are better than you.  Grass is greener syndrome perhaps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your reverse Rez AA allows you to cast a ' Rez ' spell on the body of the person, sending them back to their corpse (no XP gain, the spell would be more of a ' translocate to Corpse ' type spell whereby it just mimicks a person running all the way back to their corpse, so there is no HP nor mana loss - remembering naked mana / hps are negligible compared to equipped mana / hps anyway, and the corpse remains Rezable as long as one item is left on it) ... Level 1 has a re-use timer of 15 minute .... Level 2 - 12 minutes .... Level 3 - 9 mins ....<br />
<br />
Now, as the Shaman Rez team, you and your fellow Shaman have to decide who to send back in ... Do you send the monk to check to see if mobs are still corpse camping so that they can FD and advise on who to send next ....  Do you send a Rogue back for SoS and corpse drags to a safer area ... Do you send a Cleric to Rez box somebody .... Do you agree to send Group 1 of the Raid back simultaneously to clear the corpse campers ... <br />
<br />
Hehe, it also helps Shaman stack on Raids ... you will need 6 Shaman to send a 6 person team back to clear and secure an area to Rez ....<br />
<br />
Its not unbalancing, because 99.5% of the time, an SoS Rogue with a Rez stick can safely make it back, it just takes a bit of run time ... <br />

Pick something you actually have a snowball's chance in hell of getting. Rez Potions are never ever going to happen. Somewhere, somehow, someone will exploit the crap out of it, and then you'll have 1,000s of Shaman crying when it's taken away.<br />

Level 1 has a re-use timer of 15 minute .... Level 2 - 12 minutes .... Level 3 - 9 mins ....<br />
<br />
Now, as the Shaman Rez team, you and your fellow Shaman have to decide who to send back in ... Do you send the monk to check to see if mobs are still corpse camping so that they can FD and advise on who to send next ....  Do you send a Rogue back for SoS and corpse drags to a safer area ... Do you send a Cleric to Rez box somebody .... Do you agree to send Group 1 of the Raid back simultaneously to clear the corpse campers ... <br />
<br />
Hehe, it also helps Shaman stack on Raids ... you will need 6 Shaman to send a 6 person team back to clear and secure an area to Rez ....<br />
<br />
Its not unbalancing, because 99.5% of the time, an SoS Rogue with a Rez stick can safely make it back, it just takes a bit of run time ... <br />
<br />
Anyway, my 3cp on the matter ... <br />
<br />
Tek<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
YES!<br />
<br />
me and my shaman crew were talking about this thread and we came up with this same idea too... an we all agreed that this would be more usefull than a rez the corpse... yes there will be bots but theres always bots.<br />
<br />
<br />
as well as the 3 lvls maybe actually give it a % return 1 = 30% xp 2 = 60% 3 = 90%. tho i'd still be happy even if it didnt give xp back<br />
<br />
so once again YES!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Well I think that Druids should get a rez spell maybe 90% and Shaman should not.  Shaman compete against Enchanters and Beastlords for single content group spots (no rez) and Druids have to compete against the 100lb gorilla Clerics in the primary healing spot.<br />
<br />
My 2c,<br />
<br />
Purdypog<br />
<br />
PS:  Now I certainly would not be against a summon dead person (out of zone) spell for Shaman where the dead player (cleric) could be summoned to his/her corpse for rezzing.  That makes some sense and would be a nice unique ability to help Shaman group desireability.  Like a 0% rez but a higher rez could be applied after the 0%.<br />
<br />
Often the main tank and the cleric bite it in more difficult content and the rest of the group manages to survive if not too many mobs.  At least that has been my observation especially with a bard/chanter who can finally get things under control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I don't think that giving shamans and druids a rez equivalent to a Paladin's rez would be out of line, as we are priests and I seem to remember all priests in D&amp;D type games having some form of rez.  I do feel that our healing has gone down the tubes for too long though.  I remember when I first played my shaman and at level 29 we were as good at healing as clerics, if not better because of the help of slows+regen+cannibalize.  Then in Kunark we were considered equals to druids as far as healing was concerned, except we had the bonus of slows and cannibalize to give us an edge.  After that though, it is as if someone decided that druids needed to be the cleric substitutes and we were just given token heals from that point out.  <br />
<br />
Most druids that I knew and know now did not play the druid to be a healer, they played it to be a self sufficient character that could solo and get around easily, while being second best to wizards in direct damage.  Now druids are second to wizards in DD's (tied with mages for second I guess you could say), and second to clerics for heals, they can give mana regen to anyone 45+, and are 3rd in power of DoT's.  I don't mean to sound jealous, but I think that we have been overlooked on the heals for too long and for no good reason that I can think of.</div></div><hr />

You have to quit out the game to avoid serious penalties? Always struck me as the prime cheat in EQ.<br />
<br />
But, it's a necessary cheat, because people don't have the tools to recover from wipes quickly without it. Punishment for failure can be absurdly costly, in terms of the amount of time it takes to regroup, particularly in GoD. And without a cleric, a group is seriously fubared.<br />

A punt to corpse would help a lot in that respect.<br />

A fast slow (GoD Balance of Nhil) is a good spell to GET a GROUP with.... To bad ya got to get one to get the spell.  Horse behind the cart kinda thing.<br />
<br />
I would like a return to the roots for our class.  We are supposed to be spirit masters and natural healers (Using potions and spells).<br />
<br />
They started briefly down a pth with the creation of MIST type potions.  Why not have a line of regents that a shaman could use to do specific things (Like mage focus items).  Allowing us to focus our spirit powers to do things like Summon Spirit to corpse.<br />
<br />
Hell Wizards have Mana Burn..... Since we are so in touch with the spirits why can't we dump mana to Heal/Shield/Cure/Divine Aura someone in our group or raid.<br />
<br />
Beastlords surpassed our ability to buff ATK (Even thought most of them don't extend duration theri stuff much, +150 ATK with ferocity and under OOM they are supposed to get a +187 ATK buff.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with Chanters being able to haste more, I'm fine with pretty much every class being able to nuke better than us, I okay with being the worst of the healing classes....<br />
<br />
But gosh darn it give us something class defining in the way of spirit mastering. Allow us to reinforce the spirits of our allies! Make us an asset to a group in GoD..... Hell let us blow out our mana to be able to cast a Divine Aura type spell on another group member.  Which *WILL* keep someone alive long enough for another heal to hit.<br />

Go to the Druid boards, they have been asking for this for a long time.  As was stated, they compete for the main healer slot with clerics.  Most groups will take a cleric over a druid every time, why, because although the dps, ds, evac, etc., are nice to haves, rez is a must.  Plain and simple.  Most 65 druids I know only get groups with their guild members and friends, try getting a pickup group (only if no clerics are lfg).  <br />

Actualy they will sorta. This basicly boils down to the warrior vs knight issue. For a time you would never take a knight to a raid to tank and you would never take a warrior to a exp group in say, BoT.<br />
<br />
What this will do is polarize the 2 main respective healing classes ( which we are not one of them ) Instead of having 1 healer that is better over all and 1 healer that can fill the roll in a exp group, you now have 1 main healer that is pushed out of exp groups and pushed into being the primarily the best raid healer and a descent healer getting a boost in the exp group and pulling closer to the main.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basicly this kinda tool will boost druid main healing in EXP a lot, cause its the 1 and only thing that makes you keep looking for a cleric when you are making a exp group for GoD or Elemental. The &quot;fun&quot; of running back from your bind point makes for frustrating times in a otherwise fun enviroment. It stops the joy of the game dead int he tracks when you gotta wait for someone.<br />
<br />
I can tell you right now, with this ability i would rather have a druid healing my exp groups then a cleric. a druid offers more DPS then a celric, DS, snare, ports, evacs, charms in certain zones, movement buffs, and competant healing. Why did i want a cleric to heal in my elemental exp group again?  Oh yea, they can heal for 10k. Big deal, i got the mob slowed enough ( or the bst or chanter) to where the druid will have no problem, even in GoD exp groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know, we get mad at BST's and think that chanters are over powered with charm and people thing we are ovr powered out of dillusion. But one has to wonder who the favorite class really is. Sit down and look at the druid class, it has always gotten attention and been a true do it all class. This just really puts it into perspective how sickly powerful a druid is, yet they still whine for upgrades lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
hey, gratz to the druid, i dont want anything taken from them, someone has to be the poster child for EQ and gratz to them. I just wish we got a LITTLE freaking attention here. I mean that whole return to corpse thing with no exp rez, wasnt that our idea anyway ?</div></div><hr />

Rez is basically a deal breaker when it comes to deciding between two classes for a group spot.  Leveling the playing field in that respect for the priest classes will help, even if it won't singlehandedly fix the class's issues.  <br />
<br />
SK's face the same problem when comparing to paladins.  The problem is that we have feign death, and giving us rez would mean we would go from behind pallys to ahead of them.  As such, you can't just give SK's rez without creating a similar problem in reverse.  We need a more creative solution to the problem - but something that would constitute equally desriable utility... <br />
<br />
Shamans don't face that problem - you, along with druids, could recieve a simple rez/rez substitute without creating a new balance problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">For me just answering a few simple questions make this painfully clear.. 1. Are shaman part of the Priest Class?  YES!.  Are Druids part of the Priest class? YES!  Are Necromancers part of the priest class? NO!  So why the hell would they get a rez and not the freaking shaman?  Hell, even freaking pallys get rez... Hmm, while theyre at it, give a Rez to SK's, that way when things go bad, they can FD and then Rez!  Yeah thats a great idea...NOT!!!!  Give us a freaking rez!..NOt a damn AA either, a normal spell with a decent percentage..Its all or nothing!..  Its crunch time folks, how many more shaman are going to jump ship for greener pastures..  Were priests, give us better heals and a damn rez...  Do it or the hamster gets it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Necromancy is the art of bringing things back from the dead... sort of seems like a class that can actually justify having a rez to me, especially since it has a punitive component on it.<br />
<br />
By the same logic shaman's, in theory dealing with the spirits (although that really has faded), have a better argument for one too. Although the real reason is that druids are common, are gaining main healing as a role while SOE still isn't sure what a shaman is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actualy thats a great idea. I dont see why at level 70 a SK cant get a rez that costs 1 EE and a necro mancer given a rez AA with no compnet that is a once a day kinda thing.<br />
<br />
I just woke up so bear with me if that sounds nuts. But im thinking, the more classes with rez, the better off the game will be on a fun factor over all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I think the balancing issue is going to be with the necros and their form of resurrection.  They will not be happy if the shaman gets a cheep and easy form of res when they must do a sacrifice to get the same.<br />
<br />
Since I dont play anymore, I wont get into whether or not shamans need rez or not, but necros dont have any place to complain about shamans getting rez. Necros arent even a priest class - shamans and druids are.</div></div><hr />

Yes necros bring stuff back from the dead all the time, but....<br />
The stuff they bring back isnt in exactly pristine condition.  Necro returning a character to 'like new' condition doesn't really make sense.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Gotta say that in some cases if your cleric dies and there's no other rezzer, it can be a total bummer. Deep in Old Seb in the older days, or on a mountain or sewer trial these days, it can mean restarting from scratch, just because one person died.<br />
<br />
If a couple more classes get a low/zero xp type rez I think it'd be a good thing. Making it low/zero xp should stop it from stepping on too many toes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A low/no XP rez (unless an XP rez could follow) would be bad - it wouldn't be a balancing factor for the class recieving said spell/ability, it would be punishment for being a class with a real rez (namely, clerics).  It wouldn't hurt the shaman, for example, because 99 out of 100 times, they'd be getting the cleric rez, but clerics would be *expected* to take large hits to their XP.  <br />
<br />
I don't know about you, but that doesn't seem very fair to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Thus the whole idea behind &quot;summon soul to body&quot; idea.  Nobody here really wants clerics to suffer.  We don't want to displace them in groups.<br />
<br />
We want to bring enough to a group to be attractive on our own merits, but to be able to fill in for a cleric if required.<br />
<br />
At the moment, for late 50s and higher groups -- not even the late endgame stuff that most of the discussion here centers upon -- most people don't believe a shaman can act as main healer.<br />
<br />
In fact, without the best spells, specific focus gear and healing/buffing AAs, there are places where we cannot do so.  If we want to participate in current and level-appropriate content, we tend to be viewed as charity cases.<br />
<br />
It seems to come down to heals that don't suck, and stats that mean something.  If we can't get those, why not a way to summon a person to their body, and allow for an xp rez later?<br />
<br />
Even assuming that Sony provides a 75% rez, giving it to shaman still won't make most folks choose a shaman over a cleric, although it would make druids competitive enough to make it a wash.  Still, 96% vs 75% is what... maybe 10 mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">From an RP perspective, I always wanted for the Shaman Class to have a &quot;rez&quot; or &quot;summon spirit&quot;.  Most shaman races do not have a cleric/pally or a druid associated to them - Froggies are the only race that does.  I think it would be quite natural for a shaman to have the ability to summon a player's spirit back from the OtherWorld ( or whatever you want to call it :D ) being that we are the spiritual leaders for these said races ( again, minus the Froggies - which I cannot understand why in the heck they have shamans as a said class since they have cleric/pally ).  <br />
<br />
Would it help the shaman class overall?  I highly doubt it, but it adds another element to our bag of tricks especially in zones that are not cr friendly.  I like GoD.  I think it is a challenging zone, and I get see what I am really worth as a player.   It is annoying that we have to end our instance because a key class dies.</div></div><hr />
