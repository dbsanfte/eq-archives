<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone recommend a good/new parser utility?<br />
<br />
I want to be able to see the info like dps etc from everyone I was logging not just mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use the one in this thread:<br />

<br />
It is bloody great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yup, EQcompanion is the Shiznat!<br />
You can even add in damage for things like Dot' procs and casts that you do to count their damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That one is pretty nice however it is not showing what I want to see.<br />
<br />
Perhaps someone could tell me how do this.<br />
<br />
What I did was stand right in the middle of all the melee fighting the mob and logged all of their info (talk about spam).<br />
<br />
Anyway I want to be able to look at each of the melee's DPS max min hits etc. Right now it only shows mine and I can't figure out how to change it so that I can see each of THEIRS. <br />
<br />
Help plz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm at work so don't have it in front of me, but EQcompanion DOES have an option to parse each fighters damage separately and give you the stats.<br />
<br />
Dig a little deeper into the options and you will find it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When you open it up and go to Setting --&gt; prefernces--&gt;HTML report is has a radio button for --&gt; include in report--&gt; All fighters.<br />
<br />
However I click that box apply it hit ok etc and it still only gives my dmg etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah never mind I figured it out.<br />
<br />
You have to go the &quot;fights&quot; tab and click on each fight then it comes up with new window...<br />
<br />
grrr ya got to hate no documentation hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks Vis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd like to know if there's a way to total all the melee fights as an average per fighter for the ENTIRE log rather than just by each monster or each fight.  While i love having this it'd also be useful for me to have an entire log average.</div></div><hr />
