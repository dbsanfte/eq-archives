<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dreakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At 57, and a cleric at 55, are there mobs we can do in any PoP zones that I can go toe-to-toe with for good exp, or should we stick with fearing animals?<br />
I havent tried any of the rats yet, just wondering if there are other mobs that we can kill at a good rate.<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Definately need to fear, that is unless you can get a slower in there, they hit like a mack truck and reasonably fast so the cleric will be OOM pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why stick with just animals?  The cleric can fear anything...<br />
<br />
But yeah unless you've got good Dex and a slow procing weapon, a Ranger/Cleric duo isnt gonna rake in the xp by tanking the mobs in PoP.  Well at least at that level you wont...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dreakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the responses, figured it would be this way. Guess I will stick to the 'older world' zones for now, too hard to find a group at 57.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malevant Faeshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dreakkon, try PoJ Sentries.  They hit 136 tops, not a huge amount of hp, and are good xp for the effort.  4 spawn, and by the time you finish with the 4th, the 1st should be back up again.  Can also try Gaolers, but they are a lot rougher, although still not that bad relative to the rest of PoP.  Just don't pull to the zone in/out area, and Harmonerf or Lull Sralm Noramir (iksar prisoner near zone out, he is the only one that agro's on pulls, and the guards like to path past him).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hyppolyta Ironrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is better done with a shammy, who slows and dot mobs and topors himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I do this in PoJ, with me(56 ranger) and a 56 cleric. If I'm doing rats, I have them both attack, since the cleric with Yaulp V and the hammer does more damage in procs than I can do with my 2 1hs',<br />
<br />
If I'm doing guards or something, I just tank them, slow em with swarmy. They really don't hit all that hard or fast, and I've managed to control 2 and a rat at the same time, so it's fairly easily doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>pyewacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I play a 55 Ranger and 56 Cleric.  I fear kite the tsetian flies in PoD all the time.  The flies are about the only mob I can seem to fear.</div></div><hr />
