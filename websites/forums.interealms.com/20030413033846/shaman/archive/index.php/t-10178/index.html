<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry, but I am WAAAAY too tired to find the original post about this subject... but....<br />
<br />
Somewhere in all this mess, was a quest in PoK, that was suppossedly bugged, cause no one could find a Goblin Forged Sword (or something like that).  Was a quest in the library if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I was off soloing/ farming plat/ being bored, in Temple of Droga, and random Goblins were dropping a &quot;Dirty Goblin Parchment&quot; (Hustler for Gobbies I guess)... Anyways, if you read it, it told you how to make a goblin forged sword, using a forge there in Droga, and materials gathered from various goblins.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps this is the sword the quest giver in PoK seeks?  Perhaps Im so tired and mind boggled from endless greenie killing, they I really dont remember a quest needing this item?  Anyways, take it for what its worth, just thought I would pass it along.<br />
<br />
If I'm a day late and a dollar short, just delete this, ignore it, and move along<br />
<br />
Slow</div></div><hr />
