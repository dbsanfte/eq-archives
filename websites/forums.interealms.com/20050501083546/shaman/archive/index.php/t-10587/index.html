<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zabvot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My father and I have started a couple of Iksars on Quellious(sp).  A Shaman/Necro duo.  I am playing the shaman and my dad is playing the necro.  But I got a few of questions.  <br />
<br />
First and foremost, how in the world do you make cash in Field of Bone?  We are level 9(me) and 10(him) now and we are really strapped for cash.  We are having problems finding enough money to buy our spells.  In fact we spend the evening scrounging up enough plat to buy 1 spell each.  There has to be something we can do to make money.  <br />
<br />
Secondly my dad keeps telling me how great of a duo we will be, but I just don't see it happening.  I mean we don't have a tank other than his pet and we get beat down pretty bad.  We tried the fear kite thing, but his first snare sucks.  It doesn't last long at all.<br />
<br />
Finally he is convinced that Iksars are the way to go.  Especially since my comp doesn't have SoL, or PoP, it is an old comp and doesn't have much disk space left after putting on SoV.  Which kind of rules out me playing a Cat Shaman which is what I want if I am going to play shaman.  I don't want to be evil because evil is hated everywhere.  Of course my dad says that when he gets a new comp after he gets his bonus from work that we will both have PoP and it won't be an issue.  <br />
<br />
I guess I just don't see the power behind the shaman and the logic he is using for iksar.  So if anyone can please enlighten me I would appreciate it!<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

Yeah I mispelled my alias for the board.  But figured it wouldn't be that big of a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Snare + root rotting. Dont use a pet. Necro and shaman do make a great duo.<br />
<br />
Gotta remember you are young young young at this point. It sucks being a shaman until at least 24. Then it sucks until 35, then it starts to get better from there. <br />
<br />
Being evil doesnt really matter anymore.<br />
<br />
As fas as making money - collect bone chips, spiderling silks, sell them to higher level players that pass though. For a true untwinked person money is hard to come by. It was for me at least....Just save every rusty longswordish drop you get and sell sell sell to the vendors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You guys are level 10 and can now do kurns.  I love that zone.  Keep all the bone chips and have your dad sell them in the bazaar overnight.  They sell for 1pp each so a stack of chips will get you all the spells you need.  I had an iksar sk that i took through that zone.  Exp bonus is not quite as good as padual but not that far off either.  When I left that zone I had 4 backpacks full of chips and I was only there a couple of days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My advice is to stick it out.  With your regen buffs, stacking dots, and slows, combined with a good dps pet, snare, more dots, etc you can be a truly fearsome duo.  You two will have root rotting options, shaman tanking options, pet tanking options, or fear kiting with the spell lineup you have.<br />
<br />
Stick it out until you get cana, a decent slow, and regen (somewhere around 29 +/- 5 levels).  Your dps and mana regen which translate to exp rate should be quite sick. <br />
<br />
As for cash, collect everything and sell it.  After you've cached up quite a few bonechips for the necro, you can still sell them for pp to PCs occasionally.  Also, don't go for a full spellbook right away.  Prioritize what you buy.  If you never get that uber level 9 charisma buff, so be it.<br />
<br />
When I was a lowbie in FoB, I targetted skeletons carrying weapons.  They could sell for several gp each which will get you to your level 9 spells fairly decently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zabvot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well it figures that he would know what he is talking about.  He has been playing this game long enough I guess.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info on getting money I think I will mention to him to sell some of those chips he has been hording.  He was telling me a little bit about the bazaar.  It sounds like they just moved GFayMart to the moon to me.  I guess I don't understand how you can sell all night long.<br />
<br />
I am going to suggest to him that we find a place that has a LOT of decaying skeletons that we can slaughter.  Is there anything special he needs to do to sell in the bazaar?  He hasn't sold there.  Actually he hasn't played in 6 months and just came back so I am not sure he knows how it works.  And I sure don't.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I was coming up we didn't have the bazaar and people were actually scared of kunark so twinking was out of the question.. so I, like Lyzzt targetted mobs wielding weapons that I could sell :)  I also did the curscale quest a ton of times and sold the armor to merchants and other players.<br />
<br />
To sell in the bazaar you just have to buy enough trading satchels to hold your items.  The merchant that sells these satchels is in the very big building right as soon as you zone into the bazaar.. I don't recall his named but he's like the first merchant you see as you enter the building.  The bags weigh 10lbs so definately not something you want to keep on your character.. but are nice to use to store items in the bank.   Once you or your dad has placed the items in the satchel.. simply go to the 'trader area', type trader, set a price for the items.. add.. and begin trading.. =)  Also, better to go far away from the banks for your selling since not as many people are there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">also remember that now that 1-10 go by like a fart in the wind...<br />
it' can be hard to make money for spells...<br />
<br />
<br />
hell I lvl'd a sk up to 9 (first sk spell lvl) untwinked for fun one day.. and didn't have enough for all my spells... and I looted everything...   keep in mind lvl 9 sk spells = 1-4 necro spells :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
but yeah, necro/shaman will be powerful... just wait it out :)<br />
<br />
Iksar are good a good choice... extra regen and ac never hurt :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Let's get out the old scorecard here and summarize:<br />
<br />
1) Low levels are always broke<br />
2) Iksar are a powerful race<br />
3) Untwinked your low levels will often be painful<br />
4) You don't need EVERY spell.<br />
5) Get thee to Kurns tower.<br />
6) Save and sell EVERY, SINGLE, STINKING bonechip.<br />
7) Once Kurns gets boring, head to Paludal.<br />
8) Shaman + Necro is VERY powerful. At 34 (which seems an eternity away) you receive a huge power boost. <br />
9) Have fun. This, like basic training in the military, will be your   most enjoyable time in EQ. SEE as much as you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You two will be absolutely deadly, but right now you're in the infant stages. Shaman suck ass up until 24, we are low level tanks with SoW, and not very good at that either. With some nifty buffs and a pathetic slow spell. Shaman don't mature until much later like level 34. <br />
You need to tough it out, and get used to being broke for your early levels make enough to buy spells. <br />
And don't forget you picked the best Shaman/Necro combo available...All LEEZARD !!!<br />
Buff his pet and tank with him, or just Fear- Kite and beat the crap out of every mob you see. You will be much more dangerous at later levels, just tough it out for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Necro pets dont tank worth a crap at low levels, i've played my lizzy necro to about 18 and I made a far far better tank than my pet. Course now that I think about it I dont have root either, and shaman dont get it until 14. So tank away for now, buy bandages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">C3 is your friend. Sow and chloroplast won't hurt either. I suggest hopping the book to PoK then to Nexus. Offer to trade bone chips for buffs.<br />
<br />
As long as you aren't wearing 10k worth of gear (and yes, upper level players will be able to tell at a single glance /grin) I would think the sincerity of offering to pay what you can (bone chips) for buffs would be a) truly appreciated by the high level players, and b) a perfectly acceptable alternative to paying in plat which you don't have anyway. <br />
<br />
Hell, if it were me, I'd probably buff you senseless then tag along for a while just for the fun of seeing people learning the game for the first time.<br />
<br />
I've spent many an evening protecting youngbies. (Notice I said protecting, not PLing. If you are truly new, you NEED to learn how the games mechanics work. My rule is: 1 time I'll kill the train. 2 times I'll park the train. 3 times I'll hop on the train. /grin)<br />
<br />
It's a nice break for the upper levels sometimes as long as you're not a l33t d00d or act like it's your divign right to take up their time and mana. And the kindness of strangers landed upon me more than once when I first started playing. It's about half the reason I still play. There ARE decent human beings behind a lot of keyboards.<br />
<br />
The trick is finding them. /wink</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, with shaman buffs on the necro pet and shaman slow, the necro pet makes a fine tank. Been using my shaman to PL my own necro up a bit. <br />
<br />
Granted that there is a bit of a disparity between his buffs and mine, but I think they'll do fine. Its a pretty fun combo, lots of options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>juanmatus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">necro and shaman are THE team to beat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The nec will be doing most the work until your 24.  Shaman are kinda weak up until even as high as level 35, but after that we are just a great class.  At 34+ things will be so much smoother</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Groxb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Interesting enough, my one of my best friends and I do this.  He is an Iksar Necromancer (Iksars make the best Necromancers, hands down - night vision, regeneration, AC, and looks damn scary) and I am a Troll Shaman (JBB with regen!).  Right now I am 40 and he is 37.  We duo exclusively in the Dreadlands.<br />
<br />
Now, we almost always hunt with KEI on (hehe, who doesn't in this day and age) and we pull non-stop.  I pull with Malisement, run back to camp, he snares, we both cast Venom of the Snake, then while I am casting Scourage, he fears.  Both pets beat on the target from behind.  Creature dies about 30 seconds later without either or us (or pets) losing any health.  The best part is, it only gets easier as we level.  :)<br />

<br />
No other race compares. <br />
<br />
Stick with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zabvot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thanks everyone for the info.  He PoK ported to Paineel last night and I made a Eru SK to hunt at the bone chip factory.  After about an hour we had 12 stacks of bones.  We sold 10 stacks for 93p so we are rolling in the money right now.<br />
<br />
We went back to Kurns and I can already see the power of this duo.  We were killing Greater Skelles (red) to us at level 10 with little down time.  The spells made all the difference for me it seems.  He kept insisting me to put Drowsy on it.  I didn't realize it made that big of a difference until I noticed his pets health falling like a rock w/o it.  And pet finishing almost full health w/ it.  We dinged 11 last night.  He is about halfway thru 11 now and says that at 12 we will be even more unstoppable.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for showing me the light!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Kurns is a better bone chip factory then paineel anyday.  As long as a high level is not there for bonechips for iksar faction.</div></div><hr />

Uh, sure level 60+ shaman buffs and slow....hell that makes a ranger a good tank.<br />
