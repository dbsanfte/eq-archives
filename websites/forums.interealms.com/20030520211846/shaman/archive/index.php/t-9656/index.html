<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For some reason, lately I have been wanting to see what kind of solo kills I can pull off.  At the moment, I am looking to see how high up the WW dragon list I can go soloing.<br />
<br />
I killed Yedelma last night, finally got her with only one add.  I tried the next dragon behind her, &quot;Heraldma&quot; or something like that.  She did a AE cold/dispell.  Wasnt ready for the dispell part, no clickies were handy.<br />
<br />
Did they change the dispells to take random buffs now?<br />
<br />
I figure I can use 1: sow boots 2: gobby earring 3: telescope and get me 3 insta clicks, to help lower the odds of it taking virtue/aego.<br />
<br />
The Cold AE never hit for full, usually in the 120ish - 250ish range, so not too bad.  My cold was 144 without working at it too hard.<br />
<br />
My question is, I have a few sites on the WW dragons, but I was wondering if anyone had a &quot;Order of Death&quot; on them anywhere.  And/or some other strats on killing some of them.<br />
<br />
Pull spots, things that worked, resistances... <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am also interested in this.<br />
<br />
I often duo with an ench, and would like to try some dragons.<br />
<br />
Yedelma is easy to kill, we did it without problem...<br />
<br />
about the other dragons...what dragons are doable?<br />
<br />
<br />
is there any dragon dropping a 6+ talisman, doable by a duo like us (btw, ench is 62, I am 59) ?<br />
<br />
we are used to work together, but the lack of tanking may be the problem...ench has his 58 war pet, but it doesn t have much HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had such a link a long time ago.. dunno where it is anymore :/<br />
about the +6 (or +7) talisman.. the third dragon to the left from ToV entrance is doable I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes, dispells are random now afaik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">anyone has more info? <br />
<br />
didn t any of you fight dragons solo/duo/ or with one group and think it is doable to get a 6+ talisman?<br />
<br />
and if you think it is not possible, tell me also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">try the search button at the top of the forum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hechaeva next to Yeldema is prolly the easiest of the aoe (do to his placement).  All the nest dragons in that area are comparable though and all are fire or cold.  As with all of them the trick is fighting them without any adds.  The dispells are usually your first or second buff but can get a random on occasion.<br />
My buffs are usually (in order)<br />
sow<br />
8th ring<br />
acumen<br />
charisma<br />
vsM<br />
horse<br />
stamina<br />
regen<br />
focus<br />
aego<br />
vsF<br />
vsC<br />
There worst part is torpor going into a slot that was dispelled and it getting dispelled too :\  I usually dont bother with getting clarity.</div></div><hr />
