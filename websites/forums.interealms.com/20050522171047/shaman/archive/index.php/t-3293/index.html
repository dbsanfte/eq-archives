<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working my Chardok faction. Killing lots of greenies with a melee partner or in a group is pretty easy. But what about solo? Best I could come up with us drinking a DS potion and using ToP and JBB. I often play with another 60 shaman and we did pretty good doing basiclly that. Anyone know any tricks that I'm missing though?</div></div><hr />

8 hours from max kos to max ally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am no AE expert, but why would an AE group want a shaman?<br />
<br />
For healing I guess?<br />
<br />
Also, without any real AE spells, how would a shaman tag all the mobs for faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Low lvl point blank disease AE, not limited mob amount like torrent.  Can't remember name off top of my head...its like lvl 19 or 24.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ahh, Infectious Cloud I think.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info, it's nice to find uses for old unused spells :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Great info actually.  <br />
But there's an alternative to going ally to chardok.  <br />
It's all for the Spirit Wracked Cord right?  Nice item that.  The 100 hps are especially nice.  AoB is ok too. <br />
<br />
But you don't have to buddy up to chardok to get them.  I went on a quick queen raid for a guildie warrior who just had to have his epic and this named Loremaster in the Library area dropped &quot;Spirit Wracked Cord&quot; which had identical stats as the quest item including AoB and can be worn in like four different slots.  It was also NO DROP and there was a bit of an argument in the raid (open) as to who should get it.  we finally just had everyone roll and this 52 shaman won it, lucky her eh?  <br />
<br />
Anyway, if you and a group of slightly uber friends wish to have a good time and get some nice loot, go down and kill the lorekeeper repeatedly.  I am not sure of his spawn time, but from other raids I believe it was same as other named in that zone.  I guess you would need the named one and I'm sure it's a rare drop.  Other nice loot drops there tho, like nathsar bp and legs and some nice weapons.  Plus it's a kick ass trip and a notch on the old belt.  Only skilled players need apply.  You would want a chanter and a monk tho.  Probably a cleric too.  Warrior, rogue for the last two slots.  Maybe a ranger instead of rogue, sk or pally instead of warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">we don't have any PBAE(point blank) spells.  We have targetted AE spells.  Targetted AE spells hit 4 targets, plus yourself(if you are in range).<br />
<br />
infectious cloud, torrent of poison, tirgirs insects, and poison storm are our AE spells.  They are all targetted AE spells.<br />
<br />
I tried them all when I was doing my own chardok faction.<br />
<br />
I wish I was wrong, if so, please tell me the name of the shaman spell that is PBAE.<br />
<br />
The best method I found for factioning in an AE grp was to have a bard puller.  When they come back with many goblins, use the spell &quot;Fleeting Fury&quot; on them, click it over and over while the mobs get incinerated.   If fleeting fury is flashing on the bard while his/her song pulses then you get faction.  Healing doesn't give you faction in droga.<br />
<br />
Also pulling for an AE grp is a decent way to get faction.<br />
<br />
A less efficient way is to get say a ranger/monk/rogue.  Have then pull 4 or so at a time and use one of our targetted ae spells, like infectious cloud, to tag all mobs at once for faction.<br />
