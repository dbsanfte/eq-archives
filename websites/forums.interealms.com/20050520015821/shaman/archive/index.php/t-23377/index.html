<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ooki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, this may seem like a dumb question but i have a 2nd account and i never bothered to get LDON on it. I thought i might go and visit a few of the GoD zones like riwwi. Can anyone tell me how to get to GoD if you cant use one of the magis at the LDON camps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can zone in to Nedaria's Landing from Jaggedpine forest.  The zone line is behind the waterfall in the gnoll caves near where the Black Burrow portal puts you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can still use the Magus' if I recall, even without LDoN. Otherwise, only way there is to go through Jaggedpine (through Surefall or Blackburrow, Blackburrow recommended, closer), then to Nedaria's Landing, then Abysmal Sea or Natimbi from there.<br />
<br />
I believe the Magus at each camp will work just fine without LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think the LDoN Magi translocate unless you have the Adventurer's Stone. Unless they changed that. <br />
<br />
I remember trying to get the EF Magus to translocate my baby SK while some nasty orcs and skellies beat me down. All I got was a stupid look from the Magus; worked fine after I got my stone, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">but I think it still might spam you in certain zones (home city, PoK) even without LDoN, if you are over 20. So you may still be able to get the stone, even if it's useless.<br />
<br />
However, in all honesty, if you're headed for Gates, I would highly recommend picking up LDoN. I don't care what type of playing time you have, LDoN ensures you and a group always have something available and, in my opinion, despite it getting kinda dull after, say, the first week, is more worth the money than Gates is. Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well said.<br />
<br />
Also, bazaar equipment will not save your arse in GOD (for trials, Vxed/Tipt). You need a set of augged LDON armor to have a chance.<br />
