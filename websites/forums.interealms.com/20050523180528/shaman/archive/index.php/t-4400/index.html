<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Perciville</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for some advice on my new shaman. My main is a 56 Warr and I created a shammy on second comp.(and I absolutely LOVE playin the shammy) I have tried to follow all the good advice here on the AC/Hps route of equipment. Was wondering if some one could give me suggestions to what to look for next.<br />
<br />
 I was thinking of getting some crystal chitin armor, or should I save up for things like a horse or earring of soltice.<br />
<br />
Also lookin for some good exp zones I can solo in, wanna stay away from Kunark and Pauladal is greenin out.<br />
<br />
Thanks alot<br />

btw. some of the stats are off, i cant remeber what they are nekkid, but the gear is right</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Swap the serpent bracer for a Chipped Bone Bracer - cheap and usually available in the bazaar<br />
<br />
Swap the boots for Kobold Hide - same as above<br />
<br />
Unless you are nuking a lot, replace the Cloak with an imbued northman ringmail or acrylia chain cloak - pretty cheap from any decent barbarian smith<br />
<br />
If you want more AC, you can probably get a Jaundiced Bone helm cheap as well<br />
<br />
Also watch for a Dustscryers crystal ball - mana conservation II and usually cheap in the bazaar<br />
<br />
Most of the crystal chitin armor is good, but its rather expensive as well. As for places to go, you might be able to start hunting in Netherbian, South Karana is an old favorite, Mistmoore or Sol A if you prefer dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You may want to find a Mana Conservation 2/3 item for the reason that you can swap it in/out for buffing or casting pet later. This will not lose you ac/hp this way but you'll gain a mana saving on all your spells cast - slows, dots, heals, buffs you name it.<br />
<br />
I would swap the Howling into the primary slot as it will proc stun.. (I used a howling in prim, SCH in range till I got my epic).<br />
<br />
Hmm.. I still think that a little more wis wouldn't hurt but thinking about it further you'll have obscene regen for a level 24/25 shm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try highkeep, pretty good xp and loot to(although i don't think you'll be after that hehe, i'm there and i love.</div></div><hr />
