<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aathanor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just saw this post on the Safehouse, and i thought it was interesting :<br />
<br />
From early indications it looks like the PoP expansion will be short lived compared to previous expansions (Kunark, Velious, Luclin). Previous expansions typically took 6+ months before all zones were explored and the final boss MOB’s killed. It doesn’t look like PoP will last anywhere near that long.<br />
<br />
From early indications, it looks like the top tier guilds don’t need to “gear up” heavily in PoP drops in order to clear PoP content. The top guild on most servers who have been farming Ssra/VT seem to have good enough gear to move quickly through most of the PoP content. <br />
<br />
PoP was launched on Oct. 21st. Only 4 weeks later, the first foray has been made into a Tier 4 zone (Plane of Fire). <br />
<br />
The following PoP zones have been cleared:<br />
<br />
Plane of Nightmare (ponightmare)<br />
Lair of Terris Thule (nightmareb)<br />
Plane of Disease (podisease)<br />
Crypt of Decay (codecay)<br />
Plane of Torment (potorment)<br />
Plane of Innovation (poinnovation)<br />
Plane of Justice (pojustice)<br />
Plane of Valor (povalor)<br />
Plane of Storms (postorms)<br />
Halls of Honor (hohonara)<br />
Temple of Marr (hohonarb)<br />
Tower of Solusek Ro (solrotower)<br />
Bastion of Thunder (bothunder)<br />
<br />
The following PoP zones have been entered, but not cleared yet:<br />
<br />
Plane of Tactics (potactics)<br />
Plane of Fire (pofire)<br />
<br />
Plane of Tactics (Rallos Zek) should be cleared very soon as multiple guilds have engaged both MOB’s. <br />
<br />
The following PoP zones have not been entered:<br />
<br />
Plane of Air (poair)<br />
Plane of Earth (poeartha, poearthb)<br />
Plane of Water (powater)<br />
Plane of Time (potimea, potimeb) <br />
<br />
It is clear that the majority of the PoP content has already been killed in 4 short weeks. My congratulations to the all the guilds working hard on exploring the new content. Unless the Tier 4 planes (Air, Water, Fire ,Earth) and Plane of Time contain some unknown huge timesink or have MOB’s an order of magnitude harder than the earlier MOB’s, PoP could be cleared within several weeks.<br />
<br />
SoE/VI may need to launch the next expansion early in 2003.  <br />
<br />
I would add this : What impact is gonna have lvls 61-65 in the game? Being limited to play in most of the zones because of your lvl... its gonna kill EQ? They are preparing people for the new EQ2 or SWG? ... Who knows... Anyways i got to say that nevertheless, PoP is a really nice expansion! :)<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paluwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, there isn't really any gear in PoP to gear up with unfortunately. While we haven't had a large majority rot ( we have new members usually), we also havent seen anything spectacular like we did towards the end of SoL. So, to say that the top guilds haven't had to &quot;gear up&quot; to get as far as they have is a bit of a misnomer due to the fact that they couldn't even if they wanted to.<br />
<br />
Noone knows how long the end planes will take to beat, hopefully they are progressively difficult as well as rewarding, again, as VT was at the end of SoL. I would say a fair estimate is another 2 months to get to the end especially due to time of year with holidays &amp; such. Personally i'd like to see one of the next planes be more elaborate &amp; difficult with some more various FFA fights. If they layed things out properly in progression there very well may be a &quot;gearing up&quot; plateau we havent arrived at as of yet.<br />
<br />
PoP has been by far a first rate expansion all around, despite what some habitual whiners &amp; complainers have said. Even if the planes are all about the same difficulty level as they have been so far, I can't name one player, in my guild at least, who would be dissatisfied.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">By the time your 65, 90% of the previous zones are green, SoV, SoL, RoK.  What does this mean to the game for most of the players.  Not a thing.  Please remember that only the true Tier 1 guilds well be clearing all the planes in the next few months.  The required flags will hinder the majority of the population and really hurt the casual gamer.  Can you see the casual gamers succeding on the PoJ execution trial the very first time even if they are all 61?<br />
<br />
The flags are a good thing and a bad thing.  They hurt the casual gamer in the extent of getting to the Tier 2 and Tier 3 planes but if they are happy with the Tier 1 planes and just doing AA, they are truly in hog heaven.<br />
<br />
Unless the system requirements are the same as EQ or very small in upgrades, I don't see EQ2 going very far.  If your in a raiding guild right now, and still lag out, just how much are you willing to invest in your computer to play the 2nd version of the game your playing now?  How many times do you buy Playstation 2 upgrades?  EQ2 will really have to blow me away if the system requirements are more than my system can handle now.<br />
<br />
My guild is very happy with the expansion but we will be chugging at it for quite awhile (6+ months at the very minimum).  After that, who knows, maybe I'll hit a gym.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm hopeful that EQ2 will run alot better because it won't be using the old crappy EQ engine.   That way maybe we'll be able to play it without having to all go buy new PCs.  <br />
<br />
I guess we'll find out with SWG cause I assume it'll use the same engine as EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rhone Darkarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Unless they really screw up swg, they will probabaly 'lose' alot of eq players to it, now, keep in mind they really dont lose anything since its owned and ran by the same company.  one thing to keep in mind, technology moves in one direction, and thats forward.  There is no point in making a new game that doesnt take advantage of new hardware, otherwise their would be no point in better computers.  Thats not to say they cant scale back the game via settings that wll allow it to run on much slower systems.  By comparion, everquest only needed a voodoo 1 card to run when it was first released, and personally, I like the change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It' will be a while before it's cleared still... the Elemental Planes are supposedly huge roadblocks. Plus, about Rallos Zek... I don't see anyone but maybe 2 guilds killing him anytime soon, if at all. The encounter is pretty crazy, to say the least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Globin_Shade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rallos is a hos. We are just now killing the lil' zeks (MB is a contested spawn on our server),  They are cake for a post VT level guild, but I dunno how long until we can kill Rallos.<br />
<br />
I assume that you will need to defeat all 4 of the elemental planes before going into PoTA, and then defeat something there to get to &quot;B&quot;. Doenst look like that's happeneing any time soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heh, the Zek twins are yard trash compared to the encounter, can't even compare em.</div></div><hr />
