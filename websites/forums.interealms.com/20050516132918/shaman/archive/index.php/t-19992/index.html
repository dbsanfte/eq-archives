<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I'm raiding I seem to be having a hard time keeping up with all these chat channels I have to be in. Does anyone else have any problem with this?<br />
<br />
Last night this is what I had going:<br />
<br />
1. All the normal channels (/say, /ooc, /shout, etc)<br />
2. There is the default raid channel (/rs)<br />
3. There is the guild's &quot;raid&quot; channel (guess it keeps chatter out of /rs)<br />
4. There is the healing channel<br />
5. There is the Shaman channel<br />
6. There was one more, but I can't even remember what it was for. :)<br />
<br />
Maybe it's my UI setup, I don't know there seems to be stuff to read and respond to in every channel all the time.<br />
<br />
Anyone got any tips or ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haha, I have a similar problem.  Last night I actually encountered the chat channel limit (10 chat channels is the max you can have):<br />
<br />
1. auction<br />
2. serverwide.crucible<br />
3. alliance channel<br />
4. serverwide.necro<br />
5. serverwide.sk<br />
6. another alliance channel<br />
7. serverwide.monklybusiness<br />
8. guild buff channel<br />
9. guild heal channel<br />
10. guild loot channel<br />
<br />
Couldn't add channel 11, guild app channel (where we get to know applicants to the guild).<br />
<br />
<br />
I think what I'm going to do is start deleting channels where all I get are negative vibes.  Like all the necros ever do is insult each other and talk about genitalia.  The SK channel isn't bad, but I'll prolly delete that too because I haven't played my SK alt in forever, hehe..<br />
<br />
<br />
You may want to color code your channels so that it's easier for you somehow.  For instance, all my guild channels are all similar colors, so it doesn't seem like they're three different channels except when I have to type on one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Windows.<br />
<br />
I keep one for /shout, /auction, /ooc. It's small and at the top, left of center.<br />
<br />
I keep one for  my melee - me hitting, missing, getting hit, getting missed. Since I play with sound off, it helps me notice when I get whacked. It's small and at the top, right of center.<br />
<br />
I keep one for my spell damage, just under the melee one. Also has '...worn off' messages for dots.<br />
<br />
Left side top is guild chat and our raid chat channel.<br />
<br />
Left side lower is guild officer chat, /raidsay, and guild shaman chat.<br />
<br />
Bottom center is group, raidbuffchat, and a channel I share with friends.<br />
<br />
Bottom left is everything else, like the app channel and emotes.<br />
<br />
And everything in each window is a different color; bright if others say it to channel, darker version of same color if I say it to channel. This helps when three channels share the same window.<br />
<br />
That may not help your situation, but perhaps it makes you feel better by comparison. :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and one more window for 'others' deaths', so if a flag mob is bugged I can prove that we got the kill message in my /report. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">my setting<br />
<br />
chat window_01 : random craps(spell casting msg, crit hit msg, enrage, mez break msg, spell worn off msg and such)<br />
chat window_02 : /tell, /rs, /gsay and all channels im in(4 or 5 on raids)<br />
chat window_03 : ooc, shout and auction which i dont check at all<br />
chat window_04 : melee dmg which i usually dont check<br />
<br />
channels are all different colors. so it's easy to read  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My channels:<br />
<br />
/ooc, /shout, /auction in a separate small window and small text off to the side kept semi transparent.<br />
<br />
Small window for my melee, getting hit, hitting etc, small text placed above the /ooc and /shout window.<br />
<br />
Guild chat, say and tells in another window. Also use for healing channel if I am required to join.<br />
<br />
Window that is reserved for just the guild's shaman chat channel. When not raiding i set it to be very transparent, during raids I turn the transparency down. Placed above the /gu and /tell window.<br />
<br />
General window for /rsay and /group say and for a separate raid channel if it is used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I only use three windows:<br />
<br />
1 for Tell/Raid/Chat Channels/Guild<br />
1 for Shout/OOC/Auction/Say/Group/Others<br />
1 for Melee/Spells/Skills<br />
<br />
I also make whatever I say a darker version of the same color.  It works well.  Also make every chat channel a different color.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Leave the healing channel. I'm sorry but if you need someone to tell you when to heal, you should roll a cleric and then kill yourself for having zero skill. The only skill you need to have to be the BEST healer in your guild is to be able to target mobs quickly, and hit the &quot;assist&quot; button. You have an assist hotkey, right? Use it, heal the target of mobs that look angry or are where the casters should be, and heal.<br />
<br />
Before I quit everquest I mapped &quot;target closest NPC&quot; and my assist key right next to each other, by doing this I could in literally milliseconds select a monster where it shouldn't be, target the player being hit, and begin casting my Tnargs.<br />
<br />
Healing is one of those few things in everquest that really does get better if you are willing to become skilled at it. If you are just going to Target the main tank and cast kraggs mending every time your name shows up in a channel, then you quite frankly sux.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In our guild the clerics, druids and shaman are asked to join the heal channel. Doesn't mean that everyone is told when to heal or that even everyone one in the channel will be healing, in fact no one is really allowed to call heals in or talk in it except the clerics for their ch rotation or the raid leader to give instructions. Its mainly so all healers are aware of who is doing what, what healers are assigned to what tanks etc and so we are aware if a cleric goes down or goes oom and we might need to jump in with a few patches. I have never been in a healing cycle and never plan on being one, but being in the healing channel is just something I am asked to do in my guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I never have shout turned on.<br />
I never have ooc turned on.<br />
I never have auction turned on.<br />
It's just spam for me.<br />
I absolutely don't care for anything that's said in those channels.<br />
<br />
I have tells and /rs and raiding chat channel going to a window.<br />
I have melee going to another window.<br />
I have spells going to another window.<br />
I have our recruit chat channel, guild chat, says, group chat, and everything else going to main window.<br />
Dump the extra fluff channels that you don't need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Here is my window setup:<br />
<br />
main: say, worn off, tells, debuff, /rs, raidchannel, /g , /gu<br />
chat window: /guild shaman channel, friends channel<br />
<br />
crap window: everthing else/junk<br />
<br />
I never have /ooc, /shout on. And well the channels i need are in the main window, i need to focus when im raiding, i dont have time to keep track of any serverwide channels or auction channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I assume, the ones that use multiple windows have high graphic resolution (like 1600) active, or?<br />
<br />
I tried multiple windows, but with resolution 1280 x 1000 or even worse 1024 x ? i fail to arrange the windows in some optimal way. Most times the windows are getting so small, that even only 3 or 4 messages scroll through and vanish from the visible window  :( . And  a resolution of 1600 is too 'small' to read and look at for my taste.<br />
<br />
I just leave auction and other serverwide channels and try to ignore the ongoing chatter in /gu and raid chat (atleast when focussing on the raid is required). I do join heal channel for the small chance, that my leet healing skills are needed or clerics run oom and need some patch healing.<br />
<br />
Edit: A debuff channel to discuss debuffs, slows and shaman buff responsibilities is active as well on most raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have 4 windows.   3 take up 1/3 each of the width of the bottom of my screen.   The 4th is directly above the middle one.  The 4th has our Debuff channel (bards, enchanters, shaman, etc).  The one on the right has ooc, shout, auction, and serverwide.crucible.   The middle one has /gu, /say, /tell, /rs, and our two raid channels.  The left one has everything else and is basically my spam window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There's a nifty real-time log parser I came across, called EQ Watcher.  It features sound effects... such as, reading any channel or tell to you, or giving any selected sound whenever there's action in a chat.<br />
<br />
It requires some customization, but it's pretty handy.  I have it set up to read tells only, and give sounds for only one channel.  It's also set up to handle all chat channels as one - the joinable chat, has seperate stuff for ooc, auc, shout, say, &amp; anything else I've missed because it's 5:30 am. :p  But you can set up a trigger to recognize individual channels, and do something then.<br />
<br />
For example, I have mine set up to beep at me whenever anyone says anything in the server shaman channel (shaman:shaman, for anyone on CT) - but it's a small crowd, so not usually a lot of action.  I have the rest turned off by default, with only tells being read to me.<br />
<br />
Along with seperate chat colors, and spreading chats around to seperate windows, it helps a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jakanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I pretty much quit around luclin and just came back so my setup is about the same as it was before all this things heh. I have made one other window for combat stuff only and then everything else goes into the main window. Im so used to it that it doesnt bother me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I posted screenshots (note: they're large) with windows 'normal' (transparent) (http://morelight.org/samanna/ss_norm.jpg) and 'dark' (set to darken with mouseover) (http://morelight.org/samanna/ss_dark.jpg) to clarify a few things, including how my channels are set up with the different windows and colors.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just remember how bad it was when there were no chat channels.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That's a lot of chat windows Samanna :)<br />
<br />
I only have 3 atm. 1 for melee, 1 for spells and junk, and one for chat. All my channel are prettu distinctly color-coded so I can distinguish them, and I turn off some channel when I need to focus on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I still only use one chat window. I have had /shout and /auction turned off since they gave us the option to turn it off. When I lead guild raids, I create a chat channel while we are forming up, but once the raid is formed and we are ready to begin, I leave that channel. I tell them all non-essential chat goes in the old channel, so the raid channel is clear for instructions and important messages.</div></div><hr />
