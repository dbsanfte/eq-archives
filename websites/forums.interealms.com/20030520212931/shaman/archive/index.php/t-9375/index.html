<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buddha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which one would be the better partner for a shaman? Both characters will be partnering at low levels to high, and both will be twinked quite heavily. <br />
<br />
I'm having a hard choice deciding between Paladin and Shadowknight. I know that there is better partnering combos, but my brother will be playing the melee char and he wants one of those two.<br />
<br />
Paladin can heal, decent dps, stun, and rez.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knight can lifetap, snare, fear, pet, and do more dps.<br />
<br />
Which one would be the more efficent partner? <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've always had better experiences duoing with a paladin. It might just be the particular people, but I would go with paladin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Holth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've partnered with both classes. My pref go to she SK :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SK = Snare = Ub3r...<br />
<br />
Druids are my favorite partners... as a little 2cp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am going for a SK myself to duo box with, can't wait )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SKs are a riot. I have a 25 lizzy sk alt on another server where my brother twinked him up real good :) With nocti blade, ebon mace, circlet of shadows, SBS and regen BP I just mow down stuff almost nonstop. Hell he has almost as much AC as my shaman lol.<br />
<br />
I tried warrior and monk but I get so bored with them. SKs can tank, solo extremely well and have all those fun utility spells like snare, IVU and invis(circlet lets you invis before you even get the spell) and fear. And of course FD at 30 making them the ultimate melee dungeon crawler. They also have some insane 1handers like the ebon mace.<br />
<br />
The only drawback is the abjuration/divination crap that's the same with a shaman. You get spells that you don't use often so they fall behind in those skills while your alteration and conjuration are easily maxed because those spells are so often used. <br />
<br />
I plan on living in dungeons as much as possible and that's where SKs really shine. Soloing dark blues nonstop in dungeons with xp modifiers is just incredible xp. I spent 14-22 in Kurn's Tower and it went by so fast it was a blur. Got 23,24 and 25 in Paludal on recondites in about 3 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mez think Solariis bez right.<br />
<br />
I would take da sk over the paladin.<br />
<br />
Paly is a cleric / warrior blend and shamans dont stack that great with a cleric.<br />
<br />
SK is a necro / warrior blend and shamans do great with a necro.<br />
<br />
The darkness line of snare spells will be a big help, and the SKs ability to FD will add a massive amount of safty....  If things get realy bad the shaman gates and the SK just FD.<br />
<br />
The paly partner does get the very nice ability to rez at higher levels but that is about the only plus that I would put much stock in.  That healing helmet is nice also for reducing down time.<br />
<br />
Overall I like the fit of shaman sk much more then shaman pal.<br />

ranger is best mellee partner for xping. <br />
<br />
Thats kinda a closed minded statement.  Don't get me wrong, rangers are a pleasure to partner with, and fun to play as well.  But if you want to convince someon, you should elaborate on your answer to give the person posting the question some information as to why they are the &quot;best mellee partner for xping.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyways, since your friend wants to be knight, I would suggest the SK.  The 3 things I always wish I could do with my shaman are Snare, FD, and IVU.  SK can do all of those things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Both are great..but if your just looking for EXPing i would say go for the SK.  Paladins are wonderful vs Undead, especially with alot of AA..but if your not a troll, the SK snare you will love..I routinely partner with an SK and a BL..the BL kills a lot faster, but life is safer with the SK, and i end up having to run WAY more often with a BL .  The exp always comes in faster when I am duoing with an SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">leveled up since lev1 with my shadowknight friend, and its plain rox, i can unload all kinds of aggro'ing stuff when we fight and the mob doesnt even budge their ability to hd aggro very nice, FD rules, snare is bomb, fear is even nicer (fear kiting) ....go sk!</div></div><hr />
