<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Papa G</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering where your AA would do most good.<br />
I have not yet chosen any secondary forte yet also depending on the advice ill get here.<br />
<br />
But which way to go. Work on your Critical affliction with eye on using Bane in groups, other dots are to slow, or do the nuking crits AA with eye for Tears of saryrn and what else we have.<br />
<br />
Hope you guys can clearify it for me.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Just saw this thread : http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19458<br />
Now when people have had a chance to get the AAs now what is your advice ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Critical affliction is definately very nice, I dont nuke much anymore due to waste of mana imho. If I could go back in time i would of never spent AA's in crit nukes. <br />
<br />
Tears is nice, if its not resisted 2 out of 3 times. <br />
But nothing better than having Bane crit a few times for 1k damage.  I dot alot more than nuke so I'm biased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is what I am wondering also.  I usually bane in ele exp groups, but use Tears or VS in LDON.  I also Tears/Torrent on bosses.  Plus, I still have yet to ever see a triple crit from one rain, yet I get lots of doubles .:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tears, like i said is nice, if it lands, but it is very unreliable damage. Whereas Bane, or other dots are less likely to be resisted and reliable on the damage they do. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying that Crit nukes is bad, Im just saying our nukes as a whole are bad. <br />
<br />
I too use Dots in Ele groups/hard Ldon instead of nukes. I see more of an upside to the Critical dots than nukes. <br />
<br />
Only downside to the dots is Aggro issues, but you have the same issues chaining SoT or ToS/ToP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Before GoD, I was not far away from maxing my Nuke Crit AAs, but I managed to save 30AA and get Crit Aff 3. Since then, I have never even looked back at Nuke AAs, especially since a wiz friend linked me a thread from Graffë's that parsed ALL rains (even wizzy lures) to have a hard coded resist rate of 22%. Too lazy to look it up atm.<br />
<br />
My guild is raiding VT a lot lately, and I've been doing some parses with JALP on various DoT combinations. With SCS3, BA4 and Crit. Aff. 3, i am over 100DPS on every mob (if I'm not on ramp heal, which really cuts into my DPS). <br />
<br />
Some of my results:<br />
- AHR last night with just Bane and Anathema: 116.93DPS over 72 ticks<br />
- Twin Blob 2 with Bane and Anathema: 137.71DPS over 82 ticks<br />
- TVK with Bane, BoS and Ancient Scourge: 173.04DPS over 32 ticks. This is not very valid though, as it was post-rez and from about 40% of the mob HP. <br />
- DXXT With Ultor, Pox, Bane, BoS and Ancient Scourge: 167.39 over 76 ticks.<br />
<br />
Of course, not all dots were running all the time.<br />
I realize that the situation on PoP mobs is different due to lower HPS and the greater need for burst damage, but I don't think I could have made a better damage increasing AA investment for my current stage in the game. <br />
<br />
Oh, and I use Bane all the time - in XP groups, raids, soloing, you name it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With Bane and chaining rains, I've gotten 202 dps on blob 1.  It's not as efficient, but it's faster damage overall, even with resists...the chances to crit somewhat offset the resists.  I've never been able to cast a poison dot with any other dot on a raid and not get summoned...so I don't do it.  It's especially bad to stack dots on a raid if you are also doing massive spot healing or fighting elemental mobs that self mem blur.<br />
I only have scs2, so I don't know how much more my dots will &quot;go unnoticed&quot; once it is at level 3, so that might change my mind as well.<br />
<br />
Two disease dots and Bane are the most I will do ever at a raid, and that was only in VT...anymore I never have time to do anything but malos, slow, spot, spot, spot.  I will eventually get the crit dot AA, because I am starting to duo a lot with a necro, but since I already have FoM3, I want to just finish that out first I think...being a completist and all.:)  Even SoT becomes &quot;attractive&quot; if you crit enough.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as a clarification, I also Bane when I do hard LDON, but when doing normal and we pull 2-3 mobs at once, it's ToS all the way.<br />
<br />
Here is an article from the necro forum about CA3.<br />
<br />
http://necro.eqclasses.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=25455</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was wondering where your AA would do most good.<br />
<br />
Shaman dps has its problems in many ways.  In many circumstances it can be quite significant.  In many other situations it is woefully bad.  Our lack of effective dps is an ongoing complaint of the shaman community.  Still, in many cases there are things you can do to hit harder.<br />
<br />
If you are soloing a lot, critical dots will add a significant amount of dps.  Critical nukes will (mostly) not help you here, because you won't be nuking much:  nukes break your root, and you don't want that.<br />
<br />
If you are doing a lot of fast-paced LDoN, critical nukes will add a significant amount of dps.  Critical dots will (mostly) not help you here, because you won't be dotting much:  most mobs die in a little under 30 seconds, so even if you cast Bane on incoming, you won't get full damage.  Plus if you have to root the add, heal someone, or slow -- sometimes you slow in LDoN, sometimes you don't -- then you might get two or three ticks in is all.<br />
<br />
But suppose you are fighting mobs in PoP, or suppose your pace in LDoN is a little more relaxed.  If you are taking a minute or so to kill a mob, you could have one dot, possibly two dots, running efficiently.  Critical dots will make a difference here.  <br />
<br />
Critical dots are new, and I think they will become a strong feature of shaman dps.  Over time I would expect shamans to max this out:  I certainlyl intend to.<br />
<br />
But before Sony added those in, I had found that critical nukes were already making a signficant difference for me.  <br />
<br />
When we are wanting to burn down a mob fast, I'll be chain casting Tears of Saryrn, immediately following with Spear of Torment.  The rain spell does get resisted much more than it should be, but it is still the best burst damage that we have.  Typically, with four chances for my combo cast to hit, I get three.  Sometimes less.  Sometimes none.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, when you cast a lot of nukes, crits show up pretty often.  Double crits happen often enough to be quite noticeable.  And my personal best:<br />
<br />
Macnair hits a Steelslave Surgeon for 1300 points of non-melee damage.<br />
Macnair has delivered a critical blast!<br />
Macnair hits a Steelslave Surgeon for 650 points of non-melee damage.<br />
Macnair hits a Steelslave Surgeon for 1300 points of non-melee damage.<br />
Macnair has delivered a critical blast!<br />
Macnair hits a Steelslave Surgeon for 1424 points of non-melee damage.<br />
Macnair has delivered a critical blast!<br />
A Steelslave Surgeon has been slain by Macnair.<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause.  Then the monk said, &quot;Damn, I got to petition that.  They need to nerf shaman dps.&quot;<br />
<br />
4600+ damage, all landing in about 9 seconds, is something over 500 dps of burst damage.  That's only happened one time in my playing career, and the number of times when I've gotten all resists or mitigates is way too many to count.  (Last week I got a crit for -- hmmm, maybe 34 hp of damage.  A crit.) <br />
<br />
Still.  The one time it did happen, it was really really fun.<br />
<br />
The bottom line for me is:  you want both.  Because you want to be able to hit the hardest you possibly can, in a long drawn out fight:  you want critical dots.  And you want to be able to hit the hardest you possibly can, in short burst fights:  you want critical nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh, and I use Bane all the time - in XP groups, raids, soloing, you name it!<br />
<br />
Bane is a hugely important spell.  I am a big big fan.  <br />
<br />
The critics of Bane, to the extent they suggested this spell sucks, were wrong.  Obviously the recast delay is a handicap, but this is a very nice spell.  <br />
<br />
So, secondary forte in conjuration is on the AA list after I finish Healing AA, and the critical affliction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What difference does 50 extra points of specialization really make? Like 2.5% or so? Big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most everything I fight dies too fast to use my dots effectively, even bane, so I still prefer my nuke crits.<br />
<br />
In ldon normal, stuff dies WAY too fast.<br />
In elemental exp groups, stuff dies too fast.<br />
In raids, everything but the bosses die too fast, and then when its boss time, I use dot's and nukes in combination.<br />
LDON hard and GoD, its a toss up, but I usually prefer to nuke at end after debuffs.<br />
<br />
When I solo, I love the DoT crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Chaining rains is so much less aggro then comparable dot damage, I'm going for crit nukes all the way.  Working on FoMM right now.  Theoretical dps of chained rains is over 200, so if you can reach criticals to even out the resists you're off way better then with dots.  And nothing evens the joy of a triple critical rain ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Darkpaw, the skill was changed.  2nd forte is a 200 skill cap.  The mana savings is about 7.5%.<br />
<br />
Agro is an issue.  I got beat down last night in a tipt trial for going DPS on a mob--bane/saryrn/pox(from ele pants) and I was tanking in next to no time.  Our warrior couldn't hold agro. (crit2)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is that true, Chutoi? The last thing I heard was it had been changed back. Someone in the serverwide channel said their specialization was stuck at 150 or so and had quit going up after a patch. <br />
<br />
Anyone have any proof if it's capped at 100 now or not?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looks like it wasn't changed unless they U-turned in the last week or so Chutoi, in which case I stand corrected. Seems like it's just broken and in line for a retrospective 'fix'...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well, I got SF a few days after GoD was released, and I'm currently stuck on 100.  I got it to this skill the day that the patch was put into effect.  So, I know some people have a skill that's higher than that, but no one that I know of has gotten a higher skill than 100 since the day that patch was put into effect.  So, as it stands, though that worked on the skill beforehand and reached over 100.. they still have there skill above that.  Those that didn't like me, are stuck at 100 max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I bought forte right after GoD release, got to 137 skill.  Then there was a patch.  No more skillups for me after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Id lean towards nukes vs dots. Listing DPS on luclin mobs isnt very useful IMO, since very few encounters past that are anywhere close to them. In general, on exp you want the mob dead NOW. 22% resist on rains isnt too bad considering your dots dont often run halfway through. Doind sewers, by the time i had the mobs malosed and slowed, they lived about long enoguh for one ice storm, so most dots would get a tic or 2 tops. Bane doesnt deal damage till one tic after its cast. I got a BA 4 aug for when I suffer at the PoF tables, or am soloing stuff.</div></div><hr />

(Last week I got a crit for -- hmmm, maybe 34 hp of damage.  A crit.)<br />
<br />
I am a huge fan of crit nukes on rains also, mostly because you can throw one rain per mob instead of chain nuking in xp groups.<br />
<br />
However, I hate to knowingly compare apples and oranges, but to us what is the highlight of our possible damage dealing (critting three out of four casts, for example) happens all the time for a wizard.  That 4600+ point blast would have easily come from a wiz crit and he wouldnt' have even needed a *single* aa to do so because of inherent crits.<br />
<br />
It just bothers me when Shaman end up doing some decent damage, sometimes, with lots of aa, and then people get annoyed that we dare do damage because we should be busy buffing and debuffing.<br />
<br />
On the topic of CA though, does anyone with it notice that in an xp group if you crit the first tick of Bane or something, do you end up with an annoyingly large amount of aggro for the rest of the fight?  One reason I like to nuke vs dot is that I can control my rate of nukes but you can't turn a dot off :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">yeah I would say secondary forte is capped now, I cant get past 100 for the life of me and got it post patch.<br />
<br />
Yes it seems when a DOT crits it generates more aggro. Oh well aggro is nothing new to Shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I went the crit nuke route. Right now I have FoMM 2 and I crit a lot. Its fun to see the crit messages and makes my mage friend jealous. Id say if you do a lot of LDON then go with the crit nukes and just chain the 2 rains spells we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Crit nukes all the way.  I loathe nuking, but there really isn't any other effective way for me to contribute damage while we're clearing to the boss, or even on the boss itself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Winnow EQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This may not pertain to the majority seeking answers on whether DOTs or DDs provide more DPS but after your guild reaches Time, you will probably want to be using Nukes.<br />
<br />
I've got a 6000 mana pool (and that can go much higher) and rarely ever run out of mana.  After you obtain Times Antithesis off of Saryrn II in Time, conserving mana becomes even less important as your Turgurs are fast and free.<br />
<br />
I've been concentrating on maximum speed and damage for my Nukes.  Here's what I've done so far:<br />
<br />
-Obtained Times Antithesis which provides free mana, zero recast time Turgurs.<br />
-Obtained Cord of Potential from Vallon Zek II with Quickening of Solusek focus (detrimental spell haste 23%)<br />
-Maxed Fury of Magic Mastery AAs<br />
-Obtained Barrier of Freezing Winds shield off Innoruuk II with the focus Wrath of E`ci, (Increase damage of Ice Based DD by 35%) (nice regen VII on this as well)<br />
<br />
On raids or in LDoN, this allows me to drop Velium Strike DD bombs continuously with a 6 second cast time.  With the increased damage and crits, I hit for non crit max ~1200 and crit max 2400hps.  Someone may have the stats, but through experience, it seems like I'm landing crits close to 25% of the time with Fury of Magic Master Maxed.<br />
<br />
Even on lengthy God battles I don't run out of mana and help contribute significant damage. Note: of course you can't be dropping DD bombs all the time whenever you're needed for CC, group healing or curing etc.<br />
<br />
In LDoN, with A TA equipped, you rarely need to Malos as slows are free and fast and if you are resisted or interrupted, there's zero recast time and a very fast cast time to avoid being interrupted again by a mob beating on you.  I don't parse myself but someone else said I was doing ~140dps on LDoN raids even before I maxed AA and obtained the Increased damage shield so when people are looking for DPS on LDoN raids you can explain that you are a CC/DPS combo and get more groups : )<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Another reason to max out the Fury AAs is if you have a weapon that procs DD.  If you like to melee you may want to try this out.<br />
<br />
-Max Fury of Magic Mastery<br />
-Obtain Clay Bracers of the Golem in Plane of Earth (permanent 41% haste) in Plane of Fire<br />
-Obtain Staff of Eternal Flames 2H, 50dmg 35 Delay, Procs Flames of Ro 400 DD with -300 Resist Adjust.<br />
<br />
Slow mob, FA yourself and have at it!  The staff procs the 400hp DD like mad and with Fury AA's maxed, crits for 800hps DD damage quite often...several times a fight.  Combined with the 41 haste and even your own SLTW haste, you're doing some serious damage without using mana.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
I realize that this may not help all levels of shaman but it may be something you might consider if looking for ways to maximize your DPS effectiveness.  I haven't used DOTs in the past year or so and have found that mobs just die to fast for them to be effective at the higher levels.<br />
<br />
Mana doesn't seem to be an issue.  I've clung on to my Lunar Fungi Tunic from VT as I used to obsess with regen and with the various regen items I have Base 10/13, Items 28  Total: 38/41 regen according to magelo. Combined with 61 shammy 25hp/tick spell Replenishment, that's 66hps/tick regen all the time before using Quiescence.  I'm not even sure if that's possible.  Someone might enlighten me if there's a cap and I'll unload some regen and pick up some more AC with a new BP.<br />

How?  I thought the ID was added after the crit and only added once to the base damage of the nuke, not before.  That would be (925 x 2 ) + (925 x 35%) = 2173 <br />
With a bard in your group you would get 2312 max.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You are probably right. I put the ~ before the numbers as I wasn't sure of the exact ones and whether bards were in my group or not : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I maxed the DOT AA's and do notice some more aggro from crits.  Stacking DOTs means stacking your chances to get aggro.  Still love it though!  That and my BA4 earring I think help me contribute nicely in tables groups in POF -- besides doggy, SOW, healing, regen, malos, and buff help, that is.<br />
<br />
I maxed DD crits before GoD came out, and don't have the new one.  But I really do like the extra damage a lot, and can chain rains and almost never get aggro doing it if I'm with a tank with reasonable aggro.  I really like chaining both rains, and canni'ng between the casting of each rain.  I can keep this damage up a long time, and it's entertaining as heck to see some nice 1300 criticals on my rains!   I will note, however, that I never once have critted 3x.  I'll definitely get FOMM maxed.<br />
<br />
Mobs dying before DOTs really work their full damage, much more aggro from DOTs than DD's, and the quick power of DD's makes me generally favor DD's.  I have spent a lot of time duoing, too, with my SK, with my monk, and with warriors.  DD's become very practical there, and aggro is more of a problem in a duo or small group than it often is in a raid or full group, so I like the control over aggro I have with DD's better than DOTs for those situations.<br />
<br />
By the way, although DD's do get resists or partial resists a fair amount, I notice time and again that malosinia can really help my failure rate on my rain spells.  It doesn't seem to make quite as much of a difference for my poison dots or my cold DD's, but it's just something I observed a lot with rains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Somewhat on topic, I just landed my first triple crit tonight on Sol Ro. Unfortunately it was with Torrent and not Tears.  Oh well, still cool to see: 1300, 1080, 1080, 1080. :)<br />
<br />
And I just finished SCS3, so Fomm here I come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">(Grats Used!)<br />
Right now, my dots are just more effecient with BA4, Crit Aff 3, and my Crown of Ambivalence, but I will be going for FOMM3 after I finish up CS/ID AAs. <br />
By the time I get there, it's also more likely that I have the focii to make more use of my nukes - have none at the moment. By that time, my guild willl also more likely be hitting Elementals, where my DoTs will be much less useful than they are on VT clearings now. <br />
<br />
Fun tip: Get a bard in your group and taunt the resident Necros (in bardless groups) with your 1.1k+ Bane crits.<br />
Edit: Fat fingers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Max nukes and rains you say! Bah .. Im from the old school of &quot; If you cant hold aggro get off the damn mob! &quot; <br />
<br />
Everything is situational for a shaman, I go full boar on boss mobs with dots. I wait generally enough time to begin chaining dots, usually 85% is good enough to bring the pain.  Yeah sometimes i get summoned around the time the mob dies. <br />
<br />
I throw Bane, Anathema, BoS, BoN, with BA4 and CA1. <br />
<br />
If I wanted to nuke, I would've made a wizard. All shaman are different in play styles. Hell half the raid usually makes bets to see when I'll die, or ask if I'm dead yet. ( I stand close enough to the MT so not to pull mob away ). <br />
<br />
Some shaman love ToS/ToP .. Its situational to me, I dont cast it much anymore. Next Raid ill use ToP/ToS/SoT and i'll see whats my damage comparison to my normal Dot DPS. <br />
<br />
p.s. You'd all love crit dots if it had a fancy yellow highlighted Text!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I do love crit dots! :) <br />
<br />
You know when you mention waiting on DOTS to cast them so you feel safe -- I can often casts torrents almost immediately in raids without messing up aggro, and very early in groups, too.  I've very rarely gotten aggro from DD rains, and when it does happen it's because I crit very early -- but that's all really rare.<br />
<br />
So when figuring out how much damage one does, the waiting time for your dots before you cast them is also a factor.  Someone doing rains might have already cast one or two before your first DOT is on the mob.<br />
<br />
It's all so situational, though, that the best thing is just to get both.</div></div><hr />

Vxed trial is prototypical mob combat for GoD, mobs with insane dps and very low hp's. The burst damage of crit nukes is invaluable as the mob is dead before you can get summoned. When I tried using dots, even Bane rarely runs it's full course. So I suppose it depends on whether you intend to solo with dots or progress through new content more efficiently, imho.</div></div><hr />
