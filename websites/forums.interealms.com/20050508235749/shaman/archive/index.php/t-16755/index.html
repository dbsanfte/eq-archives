<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I did a nice write up on our dots, but I lack the &quot;leet skillz&quot; to post it.<br />
How do I create a table in these posts?<br />
Any other helpful hints?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ow. My brain just broke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just for fun I looked in the FAQ and had a hard time finding any info about posting a table too. I guess Hyperd is surrounded by idiots!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually it was a comment to myself. Up until now my role on the board has been the equivalent of a shaman that doesnt canni, doesnt slow, doesnt dot because he wants to save the time and mana to be able to chain-buff himself with CHA.<br />
<br />
The FAq clearly states that I can use VB code  by using the code tag. It also states that I might be able to use html codes, which by testing I could. Hence the little outbreak. If you read my other posts you will see a pattern...<br />
<br />
Apologies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Use HTML.   <br />
<br />
After you write your table code, if you are getting a bunch of random spaces before and after your table, use this link to remove all the spaces and line breaks from your code.<br />

it's actually a link to ezboard, and you might have to be logged in to view it but it has a handy little script that makes html code of tables in the format that both EZboard and Vbulletin seem to want.</div></div><hr />
