<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ormis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is my magelo. (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=235670) <br />
<br />
I have a budget of about 9k - 11k.<br />
<br />
I have been having problems running low on mana in fights and in groups and would like to increase my mana pool.  I know I can regain mana at a good rate using Cann, but I don't want to have to be doing it all the time like I have to do now and some fights have been close.<br />
<br />
The fungi is on semi-permanent loan from a friend on hiatus from the game.  The AC and ATK numbers on magelo are wrong.  I am pretty sure I want to go with a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang and a Skull Marked Shield which will cut into my budget, but I am curious what you all recommend to help increase my mana pool using droppable items or easily quested NoDrop items.  Also, what about items with focus effects?  Are there any in particular I should be on the lookout for?<br />
<br />
All help is appreciated.  Thank you in advance.<br />

<br />
You may have chosen the wrong class to play :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A bigger mana pool doesnt mean you will cannabalize less.  Only mana or health regen items will help that and not many are available at your level unless you are very very wealthy. With a fungi at 35 Ifail to see how you could be going low on mana.  Buy an Ikky BP if you need to give the fungi back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you do alot of your exping outside, the best upgrade Ican think of right off the bat is a horse.  You'll get the benefits of meddding all the time.  That will run you about 8.5K with good (120+)CHA.<br />
<br />
Id say put the other 2K you've got into a KEI fund and dont go grinding without it.  Horse + KEI = mana flowing out yor ears.<br />
<br />
And yes, I kind of have to agree with Shizbiz though, if Canning is annoying to you now...you will hate your shaman later on.  IMO, untill we get canniV and torpor, shaman are kind of like bards in that we are always gonna be  a little to busy to chat alot, cause of cannibalizing.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ormis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Points all well taken, so let me rephrase my request.<br />
<br />
In a group, I buff everyone as needed and find myself completely out of mana.  What suggestions to upgrade my gear will give me a slightly larger mana pool so that groups don't have to wait for me to Cann back my mana before we get rolling?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Earring of the solstice.  Recommended level is 55, but I have heard the ft1 works at any level.  Probably runs 5-6k for all the pieces now, less if you know good tradeskillers.<br />
<br />
Shissar scaled gaunts are like 1k and have 40hp/mana.  Shadel bandit ring is 55hp/mana.  Jarsath legs have some wis on them.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldn't spend too much working on your mana pool, just live with it for now.  Once you get into your 50's (which doesn't take long nowadays), you're going to want more HP gear, and have to swap all that back out.  Earring of solstice will serve you well into your 60's, but the rest you'll probably get rid of and have to upgrade again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One solution is to stagger your buffs a bit.<br />
I.e. Don't cast them all at once. Cast the most important ones first and then cast the rest a few mins later.<br />
<br />
Also dont caste crap like +AGI buffs or +STR buffs.<br />
Just buff the HP's/STA of whoever is tanking and anyone else who might get snotted.<br />
<br />
Maybe even do a few cana between buff casts.<br />
<br />
BTW It all gets REAL easy later on when you get group buffs.<br />
<br />
One idea you could try though is to get a Thurg Chain Legs MQ.<br />
If you can get one for 11k that is. I have before on 2 diff servers.<br />
<br />
Stats are:<br />
AC 22 10 wis 80 mana 5 sta 30hp - clickable Abolish Disease<br />
<br />
10 Wis and 80 mana would be handy. Nice AC/HP as well.<br />
You definitely won't be upgrading those for a long time.<br />
<br />
Think you need amiable Coldain Faction.<br />
Just make sure:<br />
1) You dont get ripped off and lose your plat - buy from a high level char in a reputable guild.<br />
2) You both have the correct faction (both talk to the NPC first)<br />
3) You hand in the 3 quest gems UNSTACKED and AFTER the MQer has handed in the chain leggings quest piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Make a canni hot key, makes canni'ing alot easier. Mines setup for canni 1 atm and looks like this<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast slot x(wherever canni is)<br />
/pause 13<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
I've had the delay as low as 8 but for some reason any delay under 13 sometimes it won't let me sit. put the macro in your hotkey bank and just hit the corresponding number. I never sit without hitting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here are some ideas that should hopefully help out. Most items aren't that expensive on my server and you should be able to acquire most of them on the budget you have listed.<br />
<br />
FINGERS <br />
Shadel Bandit Ring<br />
Golem Tear Ring<br />
Ring of Winter<br />
<br />
LEGS <br />
Jarsath Scale Leggins (KC Drop)<br />
Gatorscale Legs<br />
<br />
FEET <br />
Tribal War Boots<br />
<br />
EARS <br />
Earring of Solistice<br />
<br />
HEAD <br />
JB Helm (if you can stand the looks)<br />
<br />
FACE <br />
Crystal Spider Eyes<br />
<br />
WRIST <br />
Supple Scale Armband (KC Drop)<br />
Worked Dragonscale Bracer (or any WIS based dragon bracer)<br />
<br />
HANDS <br />
Coldain Skin Gloves<br />
Shissar Scale Gloves<br />
<br />
WAIST <br />
Chitinous Belt<br />
<br />
EDIT: Skull Marked Shield or Prelates Lantern is a great investment in your secondary slot. An Amulet of Insight can be obtained for your neck slot which has an Extended Enhancement III modifier on it to help make buffs last longer. There are also some diety/class based idols you can get for your range slot to give that a small boost. Lastly, check out some of the Acrylia armour... there are some nice pieces that shouldn't cost too much.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and GL. I also agree with the previous poster as well... staggering your buffs will help out as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">But there are a number of things you can get to help out.<br />
<br />
Focus is your FRIEND!<br />
<br />
Get a Mana Preservation II item - I use a Black Alloy Medallion, saves 10% of your mana cost of ANY spell.<br />
<br />
Extended Enhancement - I went with a Drakescale Belt with has Extended Enhancement II on it.  It'll help make the buffs last longer (can't remember how much longer).<br />
<br />
There are a bunch of quest in the PoK library where you bring the NPC an item from each continent/expansion to get a Focus item.<br />
<br />
Take a look at my magelo if you want a few more hints.  Personally, now that I have a few focus items and decent AC, I'm in the process of converting some of my equipment for Hp equipment to help with the Canni'ing.</div></div><hr />
