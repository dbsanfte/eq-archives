Recently we have been troubleshooting an issue with one of our ISP's. This troubleshooting is ongoing. At this time, by keeping this ISP in the mix, we feel that we can no longer provide the quality of service that EverQuest players have come to expect. We have therefore temporarily turned down our connection to this ISP and re-routed this traffic to our other ISP's. Best efforts are being made to resolve this issue. Once we are convinced the solution has been found we will bring this ISP back online. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused and will provide an update to the community once the situation is resolved. <br />
