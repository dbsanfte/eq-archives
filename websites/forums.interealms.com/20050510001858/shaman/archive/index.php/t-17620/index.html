I tried a hard adventure once in a pickup group.  We all died upon zonein.  This was just a normal group.  We went back and successfully did a regular adventure right after it with no problems. <br />
<br />
I hear they are for POT equipped people, and given my experience they are too hard for me.   I have normal/good buyable gear, epic, etc, 65 with 52 AAs.<br />
<br />
If not too concerned about win/loss record why not just try one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">VT or higher gear can do it. Anything short of that is asking for instant death. Pretend you're doing a dungeon full of Normal Assassination targets, because that's about what they hit like. I got carried along by a good group in one, but there's no way my guildmates could have pulled it off with me. However, even if you lose, it's good XP and the nameds drop awesome loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Unei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess what I’m asking is just how hard is hard?<br />
<br />
Group of 65s will fight level 64 and 65 mobs that midigate slow and hit for double 900s.  Malos or tash required to land spells at a reasonable rate.  Plate tank, two healers and mez pretty much required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i'm not fully sure, but i was under the impression the truly hard dungeons require a group with avg level over 63.  And hard just bumps the mob levels up a notch, so your group of avg level 62 will get the normal setting level 65 dungeon.  Or am i wrong?<br />
<br />
Normal setting 65 dugeons are pretty easy..mobs hit around 300s and slow usually lands first shot and nothing is overall too rough.  So if thats what you get, then you shouldnt have any issues.  If you get the 900 hitters, yeah you'll probably lose horribly.  As was suggested, just try it--whats the worst that could happen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks.  I had assumed as much but it’s nice to hear first hand experiences.  I think we’ll stick with normal dungeons for a while yet.  And though I’m not concerned with my win/lose standing, I can’t speak for everyone who might be in our group.  So I’d rather not drag us all to an adventure that will most likely get us killed in the first couple of rooms.  Oh well, I can live with it.  It may take me a lot longer to get the armor I want but I’m having a good time with my friends so it’s not such a bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ruatonim, I’ll make the suggestion the next time I’m grouped with my friends and if they don’t mind throwing themselves on the sacrificial alter we might just go for it. *grins*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The hard adventures are, in a word, hard.  They are certainly doable, but you really do need to have the right group -- which typically means a very high DPS group with some redundancy.  A good group would consist of cleric, shaman, paladin, beastlord/mage, beastlord/mage, ranger.  You do not need to be PoTime (or even elemental) equiped but the better equiped you are the better off you will be.<br />
<br />
I include the shaman in the group because... I'm a shaman.  Realistically, a shaman is NOT a requirement if a) you have a resistance debuffer such as an enchanter or magician and b) have one or more beastlords with their good slow.<br />
<br />
On the whole, I prefer normal adventures.  I fight in adventures for points, and I am rather indifferent to the experience/loot to be found during adventures.  I would personally rather spend 90 minutes and have a guaranteed 102 points than spend 90 minutes on a 50/50 chance of getting 107 points or 0 points.  <br />
<br />
If you're looking for a challenge, or you're looking for loot, hard may be the level for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As was sorta mention there really isn't a hard dungeon per say. There are a bunch of level dungeons ranging from the lowest level you can do a dungeon to lvl 70. What the hard selection does is bumps you up 1 notch on the dungeon you'd get. A group full of 65's would get the 65 dugeon on normal and as was said the mobs hit for about 300-400 don't mitigate etc and you get 52 points pre success. If your getting 30 points for a success that means your group average is low enough that your getting the level 60 missions and if you select hard you'll get the 65 mission which is probably doable by you.<br />
<br />
The hard at 65 (aka lvl 70 mission) is definitely hard. Mobs hit for nearly 1k, mitigate slow and are somewhat resistant. It really is like exping in the elemental planes. Best comparison I can come up with for those not in the elemental planes is either the giants in PoStorms or the frogs in the cave by the zone in to BoT. If your group can comfortably handle either of those you should have a shot at a lvl 70 mission.<br />
<br />
As for the sugguested group I'm pretty sure you'd be handily slaughtered with no feign pulling and no crowd control. Even slowed multiple 1k hitters in camp do alot of dmg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I heard that the actually difficulty also depends on which theme you chose. <br />
The only one I did, MM, was a 57 slaughter and rather easy with a group consisting of bard, pally, pally, druid, shaman, rogue. Finished with 20 mins left, no deaths.  All of us 65, some elemental gear but not much. <br />
No problem with resists, only 1 out of 10 mobs needed a Malos first, all could be rooted, bard had no probs mezzing. They sure do hit hard, up to 1k, which I had the pleasure of experiencing a couple times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I only do hard adventures.  When I started doing hard adventures, at the beginning of I had 300 less hps, 200 less mana and 5 less FT than I do now.  (Profile in sig) My groups have no Ssra/VT or Elemental gear...Just a mishmash of skyshrine armor, ornate, bot tower, ldon, bazaar and under 20 person raid quality stuff, though I think our gear is solid.  Out of a total of like 35 adventures we have 5 failures, one because of LD.<br />
<br />
Mobs in hard at 65 just plain hit hard.  They can triple + bash/kick and some can hit for 1030 though generally its 988(i think, I get hit alot, i should know).   They are all MOSTLY slowable, there is no other kind of mitigation than that.   If you do assassination, watch out, we have had nameds that hit for 1490.  The regular nameds that drop loot are also hard hitters, though I don't think they are as hard as the assasination nameds.<br />
 <br />
My group uses a bard for our pulling, but lull has some reduced effectiveness because of resists, but he still does well.  Multiple pulls are deadly, you need a good puller.  I'd recommend a good cleric as well, preferably one with divine arbitration aa.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I believe that hard adventures are certainly doable without super uber gear. Probably more rewarding too, since you can actually use the items that drop as loot in them.  They are quite challenging and you will lose some, but they are much more entertaining than sleeping through another adventure on normal.  Myself and most of the other folks I group with, at least the core of myself, bard, cleric have over 200 aa, and never less than 50aa though and that might make the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bubkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I tried one yesterday. We had a 62 SK with 6000hp and 1200ac, myself 65 shaman, 64 cleric 65 Mage 65 bard, and a 62 wiz. We were able to stay alive, mostly. We killed 10 mobs in 20min, had the sk and cleric die once on us. The mobs were hitting for 900 damage a pop. Cleric was burning through his mana very quickly trying to keep the SK alive. He would go from 100% to 40% health in one round of attacks. I helped spot heal where I could but 1300hp heal covers a little over one hit. :) The bard was having some bad resists on lull's so we got a couple of double pulls which isn't cool when they hit for 900damage each. :) <br />
<br />
We gave up, and went back to normal, and owned it. :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The important part in hard is a top notch puller.  Bards are best in my opinion, since they can mez the occassional double pull.  I would also look for slaughter missions only until you are very comfortable on hard.<br />
My ideal group is tank, tank, dps, cleric, shaman, bard.<br />
Bard preslowing on pull helps a lot in preserving cleric mana since you HAVE to malos in incoming.  And still will get about 20% resists (this is when you hope your tank is a pally to stun the mob off you fast:)).</div></div><hr />

Biggest problem you had there was your tank. An sk can tank in hard mission but they need to be higher level and probably better geared/aa'ed that the tank it sounds like you have. From what it sounds like i'd probably have made a better tank than the sk you had in that group (7k hps buffed, 1500ac and maxed defensive aa's). With our usual tank for hard missions (10khps 2kac, maxed defensive aa's) I can fairly easily keep him alive once things are slowed. The mobs dps is definitely alot more managable on a nice big tank. We still take a cleric with us on all our missions but we could probably do just fine with a druid most of the time.<br />
<br />
I'd guess your cleric was probably not that high on the aa's/focus/ft so that didn't help any I'm sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yeah that tank was killing ya Bubkuk.  I can beat those stats myself, raid buffed.  I know too well how I tank mobs on hard, which is badly.  They tear me to pieces.  Small, bloody pieces... ouch.<br />
<br />
You don't need Taraddar's 10k tank though, the tanks I've worked with in hard adventures have something like these stats (could be off a bit, we dont always have hybrid buffs):<br />
<br />
Warriors - 2 of them, with 8000-8200hp/1550-1700ac.<br />
Paladin - 7200hp/1500ac no defensive aa (/sigh)<br />
Monks - 2 of them that clock in at about 6700-7000hp/mid 1500 ac, full defensive aa.  <br />
<br />
I really value my healing AA in hard adventures.  I know that there are some people who believe that shaman aren't really healers, but when I pound out 4 3000+ heals in a row, saving the puller, the cleric, and then the warrior while the cleric is DB, I feel like one hell of a healer.  As I said earlier though and as Taraddar pointed out, a good cleric is a must.   My usual hard adventure group cleric flat out rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I did 1 hard and never cast malos more than 3 times.   I think the resist rates tied to what theme/dungeon you get.   I'm not sure on the resist rates in other dungeons cause I always malos'd.  So in short you may want to test the waters without malos.    It works sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>zyzygy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">resists in hard are the same as normal.  i'm almost 100% sure.  i never malos in hard adventures except when we have a mezzed one off to the side (usually i have a bard CC'er, and apparently bard mez gets resisted a lot, so i was asked to malos to help mez stick).  other than that, i slow any mob w/o malos fairly easy.<br />
<br />
as for diffculty, i also tend to agree with the difficulty relative to the theme.  i think ruj/ef are harder, and when i do slaughters, they have both asked for 50.  when i did bb, slaughter, i got slaughter 57.  so it seems like the easier ones ask you to slaughter more (bb was easier than the other 2).  but in general, they hit for 990 around, and basically any non tank gets eaten quicklike.<br />
<br />
hards are fun.  i almost hate doing normals now.  they're SO damn boring, and the XP sucks.  in hard, i almost get an AA each adventure.  if anyone has a group that can handle hard, even with some difficulty, i would see no reason why they would do normal ever again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The important part in hard is a top notch puller.

<br />
100% agree with this statement.<br />
<br />
Hard adv in my experience is all about the pulling.  Controlled mobs = win.  Bards are imho the *best* pullers because they can lull/fade to pull, preslow the mob on inc, and mez if the pull isn't single.  So they're chanter/monk/minishaman rolled into one.<br />
<br />
Going back to the original question - once you're all 65 you may be able to do them but your bard is going to get lots of lull resists in the mean time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">VT or higher gear can do it. Anything short of that is asking for instant death.<br />
<br />
I've succeeded on several hard adventures (every one I've tried, in fact) with guildies who are mostly Ssra/BoT equipped - they're not that tough.  We do have fairly high AA levels, though.  (I tend to be lowest by far on AA with 125.)<br />
<br />
Crowd control is definitely the key, you don't want to be offtanking things that hit for 950 very often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I believe hard scales to level.  I am interested in getting my twink ranger in a group of other twinks to try it out.  Sadly, it is hard to get 6 twinks in the same level range of a reasonable class mix (not 4 monks a ranger and a wizard) to try much of anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't think the equipment is the main factor to win a hard adventure. It depends a lot mor on the AAs of the members (puller / tank). I wouldn't do any hard adventure without a tank with maxed defensive AA. If you use a mage and / or chanter for charming he should have maxed defensive AA too. I did a hard once with a none-guild chanter. He died everytime when charm broke. He had no defensive AA skill at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I did over 20+ hard missions, never had to Malos a mob, infact I beleive that hard mobs have less resists than their counterparts in regular adventures.<br />
<br />
You need however either a necro charmed pet or an enchanter charmed pet. Without them, don't bother doing hard because they are going to be too long. Unless you want loot.<br />
<br />
As a shaman your main role is to keep Malosinia on pet, slow as soon as it breaks, cure it when recharmed and keep chanter alive. Hard to say no to 700+ DPS.<br />
<br />
Mezzing is pretty much a must, plate tanks too. I prefer paladins. Nothing beats slowing mob on pull and seeing it run towards you then 2 meters before you stun lands and it turns on paladin.<br />
<br />
Gear wise you'll need probably VT+ level. Mobs hit hard 900+, named in the 1400, when you get 2-3 of them in camp, every ounce of HP counts. Not to mention you need also good DPS to be able to finish some long maps. We won an adventure with time/elemental gear group with 3 min left, we lost a flawlessly executed run with same group, chanter couldn't find anything to charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">In all honesty, if your group isn't all strong level 65's, you are going to fail in hard mode.  You might be able to support one weak toon or maybe even two if everyone else is uber, but hard really is hard.  You don't all need to be in full EP gear with 300+ AA, but it definately helps.  The most important thing is to have a strong tank.  If your tank sucks, he's going to die or lose aggro, then it is all over.  You will also need a competent ench who is capable of taking a few hits.  Other than that, the other toons need to be attentive and capable of doing their jobs well.  They don't necessarily need to be uber, but I would say that being 65 and having above average gear is a necessity.  Also very important: Don't use idiots.  I can join just about any ldon normal group and unless it is just absolutely horrible, I can pull them through to a win.  A hard mission, though, everyone needs to be a good player.<br />
<br />
If the ench uses CoD, it will help your DPS a lot.  The better your ench, the better your charming will go.  A very uber ench has a chance of being able to survive a charm break when his pet is duel-wielding and hasted (i.e. quadding for 980), but a normal ench won't.  Usually when I do hard, we leave the pet unhasted and without weapons.  More than that and the risk isn't worth it.  The most important thing you can do is keep the pet sinia'd and watch for the mezz break.  When it breaks, slow the pet ASAP.  Just use abolish disease to remove turgur's once it is charmed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The guys telling you it can be done with less uber equipment, and groups without XX, etc. are doing you a disservice.  Mobs double hit for 990 on the level 65 hards, and they mitigate slow.  If you get 3 in camp (not uncommon), can you take that kind of damage while you get them sorted out?  No?  Don't do hard.  That simple.<br />
<br />
Nameds on hard hit for 1150 and quad I think, if I'm remembering correctly.<br />
<br />
I really don't recommend doing hard without some form of crowd control--bard or chanter.  You can get by with a GOOD necro in an undead-type dungeon.<br />
<br />
Some of the dungeon types are harder than others.  Guks hards are HARD--lots of multiple pulls because you can't target around those sharp corners.  ECs are pretty easy on hard level--lots of single pulls and lots of room.  Nro isn't too bad, but there are a lot of big rooms where you can get LARGE pulls.  Pacify on hard level is not particularly safe--it gets resisted a lot.  Mistmoore isn't too bad on hard.  Everfrost is hit or miss, depending on which theme you get.  Some are hard, some aren't too bad.<br />
<br />
I've done some hards with some non-traditional groups.  I did a hard with a paladin, warrior, cleric, mage, wizard, and myself (shaman) in mistmoore.  We finished with literally 1 minute left.  I wouldn't recommend doing that unless you have a STRONG guild group--people used to working together.  They're doable if you want a challange, but I really really recommend getting some crowd control.<br />
<br />
Have fun with whatever you choose!  Forget the win/loss thingie and just enjoy.<br />
