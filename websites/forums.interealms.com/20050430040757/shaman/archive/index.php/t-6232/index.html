The artist, Thomas King, has created an AWESOME set of spellbook and spell icons/gems art.  There's a spellbook that's nice for shaman (the &quot;spirit&quot; book), and several of the others are really really nice as well.  The spell gems take a little getting used to and might be a little difficult to see on high resolutions, but they're beautiful if you can handle them.  I would also recommend checking out Remelio's mods, there's a link on T.King's page.  He has a really nice graphical mod of the spell-gem bar, as well as a few other nifty goodies.  I'm using several things from this page, and I would recommend that anyone check out his stuff, if only to see some beautiful art.<br />

Edit: This has probly been posted elsewhere, as I see some others of you have used some of Remelio's mods.. sorry if it's a multi-post, but Master King's art is too awesome to miss ;)</div></div><hr />
