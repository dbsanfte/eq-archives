<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Curse of Sisslak (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5412&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
Looks like they changed the mana cost from 612 to 609 and the damage from 546 per tick to 577 per tick.  Getting better at least :)<br />
<br />
Farrel's Companion (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5389&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
Changed Extra from SpiritWolf242 to shaman_wolf_67_ <br />
Looks like they may have fixed our pet from the carbon copy of the 61 pet to the right spell!  :)<br />
<br />
Spiritual Serenity (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5416&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Increase Hitpoints v2 by 455 per tick&quot; to &quot;Increase Hitpoints v2 by 820 per tick&quot;<br />
And they fixed our HoT to be a nice upgrade from BoT!<br />
<br />
I am pretty happy with these improvements, what do you all think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds good. DoT should still be more however. I am not jumping for joy over 3 mana and 31hps. I could actually care less about the mana really, just make it do some honking good damage. And fix DoT aggro damnit!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I heard that certain DoTs and HoTs no longer stack.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm/deny?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1337 changes on testLol that's awesome cause it's literal!<br />
<br />
But looks like DD damage got a cut across the board, wizard &quot;small nukes&quot; got a bit of a bump, all class's &quot;Big nukes&quot; got cut by a bit, except for shaman and necro nukes which got a bump upwards. and all DoT spells got a nudge up, except the nec curse which got dropped (and I bet they won't be happy about).<br />
<br />
Overall, looks good :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seems to be a problem with Vindictive Spirit:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5400&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
50% PBAE slow but lasts 3 ticks (18 secs) and has a 30 sec. refresh?<br />
<br />
Ack!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">also of note: Vindictive Spirit is still flagged Beneficial meaning that shaman have the most useless spell in the game, AE 50% slow for all people in the raid!<br />
<br />
Lions Strength is still near enough identical to Spirit of Might</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Spiritual Serenity (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5416&amp;source=Live)<br />

<br />
Woot, healing chart (http://samanna.net/healing.html) updated.  YAY!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the puppy is still a copy of our 61 spell, they change it to the shaman-pet-67 ages ago. <br />
vindictive spirit doesnt do anything yet, you cant cast it on pc, but does nothing to npc. and no recourse.<br />
<br />
serenity is better though</div></div><hr />
