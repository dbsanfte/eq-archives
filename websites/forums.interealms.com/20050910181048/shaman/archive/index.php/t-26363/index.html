We currently have 2 active shaman including myself, and another afk while on a month long business trip.  Ideally we want five total, and hope to see at least four per raid.  Because I'm a college student at a university (Michigan State) I plan on having my play times cut down dramatically coming this summer, so that I can experience the college life, so I'm really looking for someone that has high play times that can kinda replace me (not so much as the leader, just more so as another shaman)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To the best of my knowledge, NONE of the top half dozen guilds on Bertox are recruiting shaman. I'm sure Phantom Raiders isn't, Dragon Council isn't (and since I'm the recruiting officer for that guild, I'm pretty sure on that one :) ), unless Prophecy has recently reopened it they haven't been (but they've had some attendance issues lately, so you might want to check with them first), Blazz just said Omani isn't, I have friends in Goldenhearts and they haven't mentioned being open. <br />
<br />
Add to that the Karana influx and I think its safe to say that at least from the Bertox half, joining a guild beyond mid-tier PoP as a shaman isn't easy at the moment.<br />

Raid Times: 5:30PST/8:30EST until 11PM PST/1AMEST, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Guild members are very active on offnights as well, so there is always something to do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Reviction (http://www.reviction-guild.com/main.htm) , on Morell-Thule (soon to be Erollis Marr), needs a few more shammy. We raid weekdays during Eastern Standard Time (usually starting at 7pm EST) and Sat afternoon (usually 2pm EST).<br />
<br />
We're in Tacvi (still got 2 mobs to defeat there), working through DON (still need to kill Yar’Lir, Kessdona, Vishimtar), and working on MPG trials for CoA. We're killing the RSS royals, most of Tacvi, and all the other unspellable GoD stuff.<br />
<br />
You should own GoD, OOW, and DoN expansions and plan on sticking with EQ1 for the forseeable future.<br />
<br />
Requirements? Well, a sense of humor, a desire to kill strange creatures that have never done you wrong, and a strong tolerance to shouting hobbits are essential. Being level 70 w/ about 200 AAs is nice too, and the ability to raid at around 4 times a week (although more is better, of course) is good to have too. Persistance and a good attitude is more important than gear - after all, we can always kill stuff and get more gear.<br />
<br />
Check out the web site at www.reviction-guild.com<br />
Read through the old news (don't get thrown by the April Fools update) to see if this sounds like the sort of folks you'd like being with and the sort of stuff you'd like raiding. Read the &quot;About&quot;, check out the Roster, and then fill out an Application if you're interested.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My own guild Affliction (http://www.afflictionguild.com/eqdkp/viewnews.php) on the Erollisi Marr server is currently recruiting. Our server recently merged with Morrell Thule.<br />
<br />
I've been in Affliction for nearly 5 years, I love it. It's the perfect guild for those of us who are time-starved, hard core players - those of us who would play more if we could, but real life constraints keep us out of game.<br />
<br />
Our guild is first and foremost a raiding guild. We all love to raid. I've been in Affliction nearly since the beginning - back when the guild was doing Fear/Hate raids. Affliction rarely does anything first (although some of us still talk proudly of our server-first Master Yael kill!!) but we always do everything - I was there the first time we cleared Sky, our first VP raid, NTOV raids, Velious king raids, Emperor, Lord Seru, VT, tackling all the obstacles in the elementals, figuring out GoD (currently reflagging some new fols for Qvic - redoing Ikk 7 and Uqua) getting into Qvic and I can't wait to see what we do next. <br />
<br />
We are one of the oldest, consistently raiding guilds on Erollisi Marr with a lot of long time players.  We raid every night we have numbers/targets. Our big raid day has always been Saturday mornings (dating back from the Hate/Fear days when the earlier you got up, the more content you could hit!). Since I live on the west coast, I used to hate the early Sat raid hour, but now I love it. I get up while John is sleeping in, I get in a good 4-5 hour raid and then I have the rest of the day free to do weekend stuff! I could never raid on a Saturday night, that's date night!<br />
<br />
Members are required to raid if the guild is raiding and members are required to meet 40% of raids in order to stay active (I'm a working PST adult and I've never found the 40% attendance requirement to be a big hardship). We do have a point-based bidding system.<br />
<br />
Our shaman team is awesome - Gardeltron and Solemneyes are frequent posters to this forum. Most of the shaman have been in the guild for over 2 years, so you could expect a good raiding team who knows how to work together.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SSrecruiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hail and well met!  Does your social calendar consist of “EQ 5pst-10pst” 7 nights a week??  Is your chair “form fitting” even though it wasn’t intended to be??  When someone says “what do you do in your spare time?” do you just reply with “ummm”??<br />
<br />
We’re Sanctus Solum, a brand new Anguish level guild with a whole new philosophy.  We feel that raiding 7 nights a week is passé.  We can kill the same Anguish/Tacvi/DoN/MPG trial targets in 3 nights time.  All we ask for is your undivided attention for 12 hours a week:  Mon, Wed, Th., 6pm – 10pm PST.  As a Sanctus Solum member, you won’t need to turn on the TV or surf the web during our raids, we move quickly and efficiently, keeping our members well occupied.  You may wonder what we do the other 4 nights a week.  Some of us go out and worship the glowing orange orb in the sky, but we still have a few enthusiasts who enjoy off night raiding.  That’s why we’ve developed a dkp system for both off night raids and our 3 night a week mandatory raids.  You get the best of both worlds, regardless of how much time you can spend in game.<br />
<br />
Yes, we’re recruiting.  But we’re not just looking for anyone.  We want folks who love our raid times as much as we do, who’ve had their fair share of grueling raid schedules, but most of all we want talent!  If you’re level 70 with several hundred aa and your struggling to find a balance between EQ and the real world.  Send saryrn.Swabby, Gordas, Freja, Exdio, or Aonodorus a tell to find out more; or, visit our website at http://www.sanctussolum.com !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Felstaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">For something different...<br />
<br />
I've grown bored with the xp grind on my moderately twinked alts, just trying to get them up to a level equivalent to that of their Bazaar-purchased gear where I can begin the fun part - questing and adventuring for items that are actual upgrades. I've tried starting fresh on a new server, but it's tough going if you don't have others to play with who are of the same mindset or in the same boat.<br />
<br />
That said, I plan to start a &quot;no twink&quot; style guild with all new characters, preferrably on a server that is new to as many of the charter members as possible. The core concept of this guild would be the idea of being self-sufficient, doing for yourself and for your guildmates, while avoiding the pitfalls of outside shortcuts and other practices that tend to detract from the game in the long run. I know, I know, people have different ideas of what constitutes twinking, so that would be up for discussion, but some of the few core rules might include:<br />
<br />
- No purchasing of weapons or armor<br />
- No extravagant gifting of weapons, armor or items<br />
- No farming beyond supporting your own tradeskills, faction or questing<br />
- No inappropriate-level buffs<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be nice for many more of the mobs you kill to have the chance to drop actual gear upgrades for you rather than what you now consider vendor trash? This would be a great opportunity for like-minded people to get together and maybe once again experience the satisfaction of obtaining that Shiny Brass Shield or Forest Loop. So much of the game would once again be opened up and enticing to you. It would also be a fantastic environment for new players, providing them a more even playing field, while at the same time giving them the benefit of the experiences of veteran players. It would give us an opportunity to get out of the rut and re-visit some old world content that some of us may never have even seen the first time(s) around.<br />
<br />
Naturally, it would be expected that most people would continue playing their mains on other servers, so this would be considered an &quot;alt&quot; endeavor, at least initially. <br />
<br />
Obviously this won't appeal at all to some people, so it'd be cool if we could just forego any criticisms in favor of positive dialog.<br />
<br />
If you're interested, please drop me an email at Rumbledor@Hotmail.com. Once we get enough people, I'll arrange some sort of informal meeting to discuss some of the finer points.</div></div><hr />
