<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BelegurthValar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been working on Breakdown quest recently, and hit a touch of a snag.  I have been unable to locate  spawn points for named in the two above mentioned zones for the pieces.  What I was wondering was if anyone knew of certiifed named locations where they could pop in the first couple of rooms (I Just duo this with a boxed Pally) so I could sit on the spawns after killing the 20 or so mobs it takes for them to spawn.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

They hit for ldon normals?  Ah, if getting hit between 400-900 a swing is ldon normal, maybe.  The best I can describe the sewers is this:  if you can do ldon hards, you should be alright in the sewers.  There are some that are easier, meaning mobs do not hit has hard, than others.  The first trial, you pretty much need a solid group to handle.  Pools ( I think it is the third trial ) is pretty gimp.  I group with a Time Ranger a lot, and we had no issues pulling toward zone in and killing crap with me healing.  <br />
<br />
Usually, our normal group configuration is:<br />
<br />
65 WAR ( Time Geared )<br />
65 RNG ( Time Geared )<br />
65 ROG ( Time Geared )<br />
65 CLR ( Time Geared )<br />
65 SHM ( Time Geared ) - me<br />
--FREE SLOT--<br />
<br />
Sometimes we have a druid take the role of healer, or I box a 65 Time Geared Pally.  We try to fill in any missing spots as possible to have a complete group if we want to farm named for BiC quest pieces.<br />
<br />
If it is not too hard of a sewer ( mainly not going for named - he is only 61 and no SoS yet :P ), I would bring my rogue to box.<br />
<br />
Lair is a pain in the ass.  DO NOT fight in the water!  I repeat.  DO NOT fight in the water.  You will wipe.  Also, sometimes it is better to let a non-rezzing member of your party die than to wipe the group if invis drops.  Doing a cr for one is a lot easier than a cr for all.<br />
<br />
In Barindu, there is the High Priest in which you can get exp's from.  Also, there is a nihil that is in the far corner ( to the right ) after you come out of the tunnels from Qimini zone in.  The npc is standing near the wall, and when you hail him, you will get a list of the four sewer areas.  Just pick the one you want and have fun.<br />
<br />
Thr RNG had no issues tanking named in the Pools Sewer.  We burned them down pretty fast with RNG, ROG, and SHM.<br />
<br />
In Lair, I tanked a named with the 65 Pally.  Wasn't too hard.  I think it max hit me in the 500/600s, but I was stupid and forgot to turn off attack during enrage.  :(  Nonetheless, a druid kept me up alright.</div></div><hr />
