None of the ornate/elemental headpieces do.  I was especially pleased becasue she doesn't look like a bombadier riding on the wing of a bi-plane anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">why i would use a trashy chain coif?<br />
<br />
well i am in a small guild,about 20 for raids (we never try ntov)and maybe not ready still.<br />
<br />
what would be better than the ornate coif? and i could  buy.<br />
<br />
atm i got:<br />
<br />
 <br />
 Slime Covered Rubicite Coif<br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Slot: HEAD<br />
AC: 16<br />
AGI: +6  HP: +65  SV FIRE: +4  SV COLD: +4  <br />

<br />
ornate has more ac,about same hp (whit the stamina) and other stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Off the top of my head, I cannot think of any better buyable helm that is reasonable to attain..  Slime Covered Rubicite Coif is pretty crappy.  Kylong Darkmail is decent.  Ornate is much better than both of those.  White Dragonscale Helm is obviously much better, but those sell for about 200k on my server, and anyone in their right mind would rather have the boots, anyways.<br />
<br />
The only other good helms I can think of that are from the pre-SRT stage of the game are:  crown of king tormax, VT stuff, the IH4 helm off of protos in POI, the ft2 helm from BoT towers, and the ft2 helm off of MB.<br />
<br />
I'm still raiding bot towers frequently in hopes of getting a helm from there, but so far it just isn't working out.  Until I get one, I will be wearing ornate.  Do you have a better suggestion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Antifrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Slime covered rubi coif isn't crap.  With the gear available at this stage of the game most folk, especially ogres &amp; trolls, have no problem reaching the stamina cap buffed.  Even if not the return on sta over 255 is only 1.5hp per.  I'd value direct hp more than sta in most cases.  The worst thing about the slime coif is its graphic on new model trolls - an ugly spike mohawk, maroon colored if you don't/can't dye it, for those who don't know.  I'd stay with it, maybe take a look at other slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">the ornate helm didnt look half bad.  and the effect is pretty niffty.  sure we get acumen but nothing beats seeinvis/ultravision all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you arent in a hurry you can get this:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Are you sure that quest results in a head item? From what I saw on Allakhazam's it was a mask.  I was just thinking of trying this quest myself and am curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As you can see in the link I posted there are various rewards depending on which released slave you talk to. The hat is from a sarnak and the mask is from an iksar.<br />
<br />
They are all pretty decent items if you are not totally uber but the 3 items you need from non-named mobs in Nurga will probably take you a loooong time to get. But if you are level 60 you will get very decent exp there at the same time - just remember to buff your resists a bit.</div></div><hr />
