<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am a lvl 34 troll shaman and just got my dog.<br />
<br />
I give him Talisman of Tnarg and his hp bar doesnt seem to move, does it not cast on him?<br />
<br />
Also I have slam, does slam have a chance to stun past lvl 20? I have mashed that freakin button and I don't think I have ever seen a message - you have stunned mob x.<br />
<br />
Thks all.</div></div><hr />

HP spells will land on your pet as dose haste, which I recommend..but stat buffs do not..i.e. Agi.<br />
<br />
Our slam never dose more than 1 damage, but as far as I've been able to tell it will stun(rarely) and interrupt your opponents casting from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cast it on him when he's at half and I think you see his hitpoints move up. It does affect hitpoints, total and current. <br />
<br />
Slam does have a stun component. Use it on a runner and you'll see him stop for a few seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You're only seeing his HP %, not his actual numbers.  So if he has 1000 hp and you add 200, now he's got 1200, but is still at 100% health.  As someone above said, cast when he's at half (500 health), and then he'll have 700 / 1200(58%), which is a higher percentage than 500/1000 (50%).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The primary point of using slam is to interupt casters. You can still stun, but by far your best chance is to slam from behind - i.e. when the mob is running away</div></div><hr />

Actually, it appears that some stats do have an effect.  While AGI and STA don't have any apparent effect, STR and possibly DEX appear to be worthwhile.<br />
<br />
According to another post I read here, our strength buffs can increase the DPS of our pets by a bit (not huge, but it's still extra damage).  The post for this can be found here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=14330) <br />
<br />
As far as DEX is concerned, if you check the Beastlord Pet spells on Lucy, you'll find that the ones that add a DD and aggro proc include a +DEX component to help them proc more frequently.  It would be interesting if someone had the time to actually run some tests of pets with proccing weapons and various DEX buffs to see if the procs went off more frequently when the pets had their DEX buffed up.</div></div><hr />
