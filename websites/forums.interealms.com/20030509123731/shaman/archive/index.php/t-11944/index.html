<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i can't seem to go anywhere without running into another shaman. not that i'm complaining, just it makes getting groups harder in PoP. on my server , it seems that thier are more shaman out there than even druids these days. i know PoP has been the reason that most people have started shamans (mobs must be slowed), but i can't believe that shaman got so popular , so soon. the question is &quot;is this a bad thing?&quot; unfortunatly i think it might be. a eq guide friend told me that one of the reasons monks were nerfed was that &quot;they were too dam popular, everyone had one twinked out, and they tanked too well.&quot; while i hate nerfs of any class, i never am suprised when a class gets hit with the nerf bat. could shaman be the next victim if they get &quot;too popular?&quot;<br />
<br />
what's everone's view of the most popular and least popular classes today.<br />
mine view is<br />
most pop...<br />
sham<br />
dru<br />
monk ( many have quite so they prob aren't in top 3 anymore)<br />
<br />
least pop.....<br />
cleric<br />
enchanter<br />
bard <br />
<br />
thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree.  I cant walk through Halas anymore with out getting begged for money/items/buffs from at least 2 new shaman with names like Suprslowr and Drgnsolor.<br />
<br />
Its a pain to sit in the Nexus/bazaar for longer than 10 secs because of all the frogs hopping around.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Just like the monk craze, this too will pass.  VI will continue to give poor upgrades and lukewarm support, and all but the truly dedicated will eventually move to the next &quot;neat&quot; class.  <br />
<br />
My money is on that next class being Beastlords.  Ive already seen some shaman here say they are gonna go to the darkside, so its only a matter of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">on my server there seems to be a huge shortage of clerics. I'm not sure what it is but it's like they all dissapeared. Whenever I form a new group, I usually have to wait like an hour just for a cleric to come online who will join, regardless of where we're going or who's in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haha, this is really quite annoying, in my guild (UK) we had a period of having a horrifying number of shaman turn up to everything (Most raids were 6+ shaman and at a few we actually broke the 10+ shaman mark) and it basically brought me to the brink of quiting through pure boredom at raids as I had maxed h2h was tempted to bring along tradeskills materials so I actually had something to do.  Instead I took a short raid afk and leveled a cleric up so I would have a useful backup character to play, lo and behold, I get the cleric to a raid useful state and suddenly we have 101 bloody clerics and the guilds suffering from lack of shaman.  I should have pl'd a wizzy instead =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hiho,<br />
<br />
maybe you see so many shamans in those zones because we are all stuck in like 4 zones to get XP in. At least after you hit lvl 62+.<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Seems like every time I blink another lv65 shammy runs by that I have never seen or heard of befor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My guild, too, Sebazy.  For a while we were treehugger heavy (druids, rangers), then tank heavy (wars, pals, with a few sk), but now it seems we/they're all shaman.  Which isn't a bad thing, per se, but it kinda makes you feel useless.<br />
<br />
But hey, at least I'm capping all my melee skills...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The shaman class has always been popular on Karana, especially barbies. It's even worse today because of all the froggy shaman. I swear at least 50% of the peeps in my guild have a froggy shaman alt now in their mid 20s and leveling rapidly. Most of them have melee mains who get tired of LFG for hours on end and have seen how shaman are both excellent soloers and always wanted in groups so I kind of understand why they are doing it. Especially if you can twink a shammy with nice equipment and have the funds for KEI making you a great soloer from day one.  I sure couldn't solo very well back in the days of crappy equipment till I was 40ish.<br />
<br />
However Leetlords are slowly getting more popular too hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Been noticing this too...Seems like shaman is the new bandwagon class. PoP brought a greater &quot;need&quot; for shaman and it seems they are easier to twink now with all the new shaman wearable items. I'm not crazy about all the PLing, but we will have to get used to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Come to Stormhammer. We don't have enough Shaman. Really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">in my guild we have more 60+ beastlords then shamans<br />
and we have like 40 druids lol.<br />
i think it's just the frog thing, you have to pick one class and a lot of people picked shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I semi retired my monk - changed to shaman - and am extremely happy.  Very balanced and strong class no wonder it is popular.  I too see a lot of shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have noticed this.  What concerns me is that there will be more Shaman chasing after still too rare resources.<br />
<br />
On the up side is that many of these Shaman are PLed and not very good.  This makes the skillful Shaman look that much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Genine Goosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My guild is a small guild, probably 20 ppl average. 7 of them Shaman level 50+. I have noticed on Karana there is a severe lack of enchanters willing to do anything but sit in nexus selling KEI. I can't tell you the number of raids that have been cancelled because of the lack of enchanters around. They are either level 20 or all level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I picked up a couple of upgrades - at about 10% of the going prices - from a naked 49th level frog shaman vendor.<br />
<br />
Probably see more of this as people get fed up with their froggies.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How did PoP bring a greater &quot;need&quot; for shaman when Turgur's<br />
was nurfed (half the time it's either partially or totally resisted)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">pretty much all pop group exping requires slow, mitigated or not. Shamans are still the best at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">on the upside: maybe we'll get some of those whiney druids changing to shammy's &amp; getting us some nice long awaited updates<br />
<br />
on the downside: maybe we'll get some of those whiney druids changing to shammy's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Seems like every time I blink another lv65 shammy runs by that I have never seen or heard of befor. <br />
<br />
I hear that.  Tho I wonder how many are name changes of ebayed chars that have been around forever?  Shaman isn't the easiest class in the world to PL.  Not unless you have access to a high level necro or enchanter or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've also noticed a few new higher level shaman running around all of a sudden ..</div></div><hr />
