<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Casters Realm has a post on HP Regen rates,<br />
<br />
Has SOE or anyone else posted anything on mana regen rates?<br />
<br />
Sitting/Standing/Race/Class?<br />
<br />
Thks All.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I read a post on this the other day, I have no idea how true it is though. from this post 13834 it says med skill X .08 thats while medding im guessing =P no idea on standing. /shrug no idea if thats right or not, but its the only info I know of</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds about right, around 20/tick with max skill.<br />
<br />
Standing meditation is 1mana/tick (not counting horse nonsense) at any level, from 1 to 65.  All races and classes have the same innate mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i heard, dunno if true that at 65 its 2 mana a tic standing.  also i thought was closer to 25 a tic medding at 60 or 65 but who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i heard, dunno if true that at 65 its 2 mana a tic standing.  also i thought was closer to 25 a tic medding at 60 or 65 but who knows.<br />
<br />
<br />
But if all thats true, then it's gonna take agaes if you've got like a 3K mana pool. It's going to take 3 thousand ticks- thats 300 minutes!!! Can that really be right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">True, if you are standing up (no horse) it will take several hours to regen your mana pool at 1 mana/tick.<br />
<br />
But a nice thing about Clarity, FT items, AA, is they all add to both your standing and sitting mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It would be nice if they would ever give a numerical reference to players' mana pools in game. Like how we have that big number for HP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Long, long ago, Verant explained that they wouldn't ever add a numerical reference to a player's mana, because they wanted to steer the game away from calculations and just let players learn the &quot;feel&quot; of it, or something to that effect. Now that Sony's adding percentages and whatnot, perhaps they'll change the hidden mana numbers, as well?</div></div><hr />
