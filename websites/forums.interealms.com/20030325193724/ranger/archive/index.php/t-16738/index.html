<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">according to lucy, its not a vendor spell, but Swarm of Pain is</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok so where is/are these spell(s) anyway ? I haven't had a chance to log in yet because of work in RL. But would like to be able to go grab them when I get a chance to log on tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arynduil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I checked the usual suspects, the Ranger/Druid vendors in Shadowhaven and all of the Pathfinders in the Library, to no avail. Perhaps this emergency downtime (10:00 pm EST) addresses this, perhaps not.<br />
<br />
If not I'll have to have a look in Kelethin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beronhelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its not in kelethin or surefall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galerian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Perhaps in Firiona Vie, with our other 50+ spells? Or perhaps in East Commons? Anyone checked them yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmmm...from the looks of things there can be only 1 of 2 options :<br />
<br />
1.   It's NPC dropped; or<br />
2.   VI totally forgot to put the spell in and hence the patch later on.<br />
<br />
Oh wait there can be a third option, i.e. VI is just teasing us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lorinnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Before any emergency patch last night, I checked Kelethin, Rivervale and Firiona Vie ranger guilds, also the ranger vendors in PoK Library and the guy in EC that has Cinder Jolt etc.<br />
Nothing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Check the merchant in EC near Shady?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arynduil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">2. VI totally forgot to put the spell in and hence the patch later on. <br />

Betcha dollars to donuts...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Might want to check some of the druid vendors at the rings as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Beronhelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No luck, anyone?  Anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tinolan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">bump!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kalvarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I checked EC, FV, PoK, and the druid vendors in Steamfont, Butcher, and Lavastorm.  No luck.<br />
<br />
Anyone check the Jaggedpine vendors to see if there's a spell vendor there now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yumanea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The new cleric spells are not in game as yet either, the clerics have collectively checked every known spell vendor. There is a rumor on the beastlord forums that these will be quested spells.</div></div><hr />

There is a rumor on the beastlord forums that these will be quested spells. <br />
<br />
I heard the same rumor in-game yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ulaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yep, don't forget option 3 - it's a quest spell. Recast is 18 seconds, same as Call of Flames, and to be honest the spell just seems a bit too good to be as easily obtained as buying it. At higher levels Calefaction will be outdone by this, which doesn't make sense for a  52nd level spell unless it's the result of some quest so it at least takes some effort to acquire. Regardless, once I find out where/how to get it, I'll be doing what I can to get my hands on a copy.<br />
<br />
Indeed for Calefaction to even compare in any way at 65, it would need at least a 0.5 longer casting time (so as to be affected by our innate spell haste), have its recast reduced by 5-10 seconds, and cost 25-50 less mana. Otherwise Icewind will cost 70 less mana, cast nearly a second faster, and yet only do 90 less damage, while having a recast delay less than half as long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>DharlFarstrider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I heard something similar from someone claiming to have an &quot;inside&quot; source.  These new spells that are showing for all caster classes will be neither Mob dropped nor vendor sold.  Which basically leaves quested for although that was not specifically said.  This source also claimed that even though these spells are showing as live, they are actually early in testing and development.  Expect to see them change before they are available and don't expect to see them too terribly soon seemed to be the message.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>TheRiov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">we tried hailing all the rangers in the library?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kimexe Calmbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">hmm, in case Icewind is quested spell, how about start official quest thread for Icewind ;)<br />
I'll check every 'new' NPC in Kelethin/Crushbone/L.Faydark/Steamfont when I'm home. (camping Joleena now heh)<br />
Also, I want to try every Ranger trainer across the world.<br />
making hot key... 'what about Icewind'...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">try Halas, its cold there hence Icewind</div></div><hr />

Don't expect to see these spells till you pay your 20 bucks for LoY.  Probably quested, and no drop.</div></div><hr />
