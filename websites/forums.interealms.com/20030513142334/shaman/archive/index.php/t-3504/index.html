<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Muddie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok , here's my dilema. During my Dire fur hand in I was attacked by 2 tigers and a raptor , now after running them afair distance out and rooting them I proceeded back to the Sentinel Spirit. Sometime during all my typing , my roots broke and I was promptly beaten down by 3 very angry animals. I reappear in Ecoms finding that not only was dying not fun but I hadn't finished talking to the Spirit (I had gotten the boots but was killed at the &quot;'How can we rub it out?&quot; part). Now here's my question , because I died and missed getting the book or whatever it is , does this mean I will have to do the test of Wisdom and Patience over again ?<br />

All you need to do is go back to the spirit, hail it and go through the motions again.  The fact you died (which happened to me as well) should not affect you receiving the book at all.  Good luck on your epic :)<br />

Same thing happened to me.  Got my boots, but the spirit died in the process, as did I.  I was unable to get him to respond to me when I returned.  I had to redo Black Dire's pelt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That zone drove me nuts trying to get all the turn ins done. Lots and lots of see invis and undead mobs. Be very careful! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I ran up to him, turned in pelt, got boots and ran off excitedly...totally forgeting about the rest of the conversation...I picked it up again right where I left off a month later</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, there's a couple old threads with folks that have and haven't had a problem getting the spirit to talk to them later.<br />

I believe that it is still possible to do Ghiosk's books a 2nd time to make up for the faction that the reports would give you.  You should still be in the &quot;appropriate faction range.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Won't work. Until you do the reports, you don't have the faction needed to do the books.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can pick up the booklet after you've collected the 6 reports; I find that easier. Then just walk up to the spirit, maybe target him, and say &quot;tell me how it all began&quot; to get your booklet.  Combine the reports and hand the item back to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I also had to run off after getting the boots.. When I was ready to try again, I hailed the spirit and press my hotkey which said &quot;tell me how it all began&quot; and got the book. I ran my happy troll butt out of there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got very lucky with my turn-ins. I did kill black dire before ever talking to the spirit in EJ. I also got the reports before getting the book to combine them. I would just have the opening conversation and then do the turnin. The key for me was to set up hot-keys with the proper phrases so that I could minimize the time speaking with the spirits. I was lucky in that during my turnins, only one tiger strayed near while I was in the ruin with the spirit but I had just invised so was okay. If you stay near zone walls, you should be fine. The occasional mob will stray near, but mostly the ones that don't see invis. If you just run straight through the zone, you will most likely run across a skellie or ape, which sees invis. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I followed the walk through and scripted the conversation out in hotkeys. I labeled them 1, 2, 3, and so on. Took all of 10 secs to do the conversation and I was out of there.</div></div><hr />
