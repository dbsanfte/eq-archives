<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dinbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, first off I'm no stranger to the shaman class, having played one to 55 on the Rallos Zek server.  Unfortunately, that was a few years ago and I've only recently picked up EQ again (to play casually).  I played my original barb shammy pretty much the healer/dotter/kiter type, which while good for xp, was crappy for fun factor.<br />
<br />
Wanting to see what all the hype was about, I created a level 1 barb shaman on Xev, and outfitted her with gear purchased/hunted-up by my 35th druid.  Nothing spectacular, and the weapons are a bit slow, but I wanna have fun hitting and tanking for a while:<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=383428<br />
<br />
If you can't get to that link, here's a rundown:<br />
<br />
1)  Base wis is only 90<br />
2)  A bit of wis and a lot of HP added with Giant Scalemail gear, modified wis is 102<br />
3)  415hp added through gear, that's 440hp for a level 1 char<br />
4)  Base STA is 110<br />
5)  A few focus items, but nothing huge<br />
6)  Weapons are Groaning Mace (2hb), Centi Warhammer/Stone Etched Velium Mace (1hb) and Thunder Runed War Spear (piercing)<br />
<br />
What's the general plan of attack?<br />
1)  Buff up and regen<br />
2)  Pull with slow<br />
3)  Channel a dot onto it<br />
4)  Melee like a freak<br />
5)  Recover with heals</div></div><hr />

Are you two boxing with the druid? <br />
No, they're on the same account.  I did play the shm to 4 in about 45 minutes, and found the 23/44 weapon way too slow.  Gonna find an orc shovel and use my Stone Velium Mace for 2hb/1hb practice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're gonna play a battle shaman, make sure you keep defense raised! So much of your ac will come from that alone. I never had much success at low levels root/dotting since root was so unreliable, so I was always in melee range (unless I was exercising the &quot;better part of valor&quot; ;) ). [I did keep root memmed, so that if necessary I could step back and heal or at least get a good head start.] Go for items with decent ac such as JB gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keladwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My advice for a fast lvling shaman is troll shaman. For one you have the regen so canabalizing is faster. Also the 3rd best shaman item in the game actually VERY easy to get it's a lvl 30 quest called Regent Symbol of Innoruk. CLINGING DARKNESS. which helps a bit kitin those mobs around with the pet barshin on it. i am not a troll but i wish i had changed my mind at around lvl 20 on my barb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Keladwen,<br />
<br />
Remember, trolls have a 20% exp penalty. Ogres 15%, barbarians 5%, Iksar 20%, Vah Shir 0%. Technically, a Vah Shir levels the fastest, but i for the life of me can't figure out HOW they afford spells past level 1. So much no-drop crap...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">since when do barbs have a exp penalty ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Probably since release, lit.  :D</div></div><hr />

Vah Shir mostly afford spells from player sold stuff. Even now, you can get enough for spells by selling shadeling silk, chitterling barbs, hq hopper hides, etc. You can also tailor backpacks, basic armor, etc. Doesn't sell for alot, but gets you enough for spells. ;)<br />
<br />
And the quests are some not so bad armor for lowbie shamans with no mains to sugar-daddy them. Some of it has HP on it, and the ac is not horrid for those levels. XP in Paludal is awesome from level 9-25. Not all bad, although I will agree that you have to work harder to sell stuff to players than you do to merchants.<br />
