<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since last patch i have problems with Fo7. Yesterday I casted it several times in PoD and it would not hit my group. Today the same in PoE. On the 5th try my group got it. <br />
<br />
On both occasions i was riding a horse and was shrunk. Maybe it is some Z-Axis problem.<br />
<br />
Did anybody else experience such a problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had a similar problem in PoE yesterday, had to cast group haste 3 times for all memberst to get it,  i was on a mount ans shrunk too btw.<br />
<br />
Other thing i noticed when we rolled for a named drop was that nobody saw my rolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had this happen twice tonight on a  Corniv hit in PoW. Got a tell for fo7, /rt, /cast and go about my normal duties...Couple minutes later I'm fielding tells from a couple groups that expected Focus and didn't recieve it.  <br />
<br />
Can say with certainty, being in Water, no horse/lizard was present.  I was... probably, maybe double shrunk at the time.<br />
<br />
That's a big chunk of mana to be tossing around  on  bffs that don't happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've seen this in some zones too, particularly TimeA for buffing up. (I wasn't double shrunk then if it helps.)<br />
<br />
It seems to be connected to a problem where /target or /rt won't work too. I could target someone with the mouse and single buff them with focus, but group buffs didn't seem to hit. It wasn't just me, either, an enchanter had a similar problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">my druid bot is getting the message &quot; you cast on drogalog but he is protected&quot; when i try to DS him. Its pretty freaking annoying and it seems random. Actualy seems to happen mostly in the water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Same thing happened to me in timeb the other night, we were at p4 and i got a tell for focus, casted it and i didnt get the message &quot;so and so feels focused&quot; so i shrugged it off thought i was maybe oor of the message. Anyways about 10 mins later he sends me a tell asking for focus saying he never got it... Also happened when i massed TOT in phase 4, it didnt hit anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its from people sinking into the earth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Same thing happened to me with Blessings of Replenishment, 3 times.  It kept hitting my group, though the target toon for it was standing right next to me.  I wasn't on a horse, though.  <br />
<br />
There is a thread on eqlive dealing with this, so just keep /bugging it  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was on the non-receiving end of this problem last night. I was in NToV goofing around with some people and when VoQ was cast on me, I didn't receive it. I was not shrunk, nor was the ench who cast on me. We were both at the same Z-axis, on a flat surface, no hills or mountains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think there is (also) a height (z-axis) issue.<br />
<br />
Used to be, if I slowed or malosed a mob who was too far away or much higher/lower than me, I would get feedback on a bounce (resisted) but not on a stick (yawns, uncomfortable).<br />
<br />
I noticed yesterday that I got no feedback at all, even from malos, if the mob was too far away or much higher/lower than me.<br />
<br />
Same for buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I know targeting is all fubar and a few guildies have been complaining about mobs being half under the earth etc etc. Dx9=the suck, its slowed down my graphics, caused me to lock up, screwed with eqw etc etc. The only reason sony is using it is to have us beta eq2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was in PoEarth double shrunk on horse... same thing happened.  I loged to char select and came back, which fixed the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, I was double-shrunk on a horse as well, come to think of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Was 2-box farming stuffs and I could see one of my toons sunk below land (does a bobbing up and down dance). On the screen of the character bobbing everything appeared normal. It was on the screen of the other toon that I noticed the character sinking/bobbing.<br />
<br />
Point: if it is happening to you, you likely are not seeing it on your screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Having the same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In Fear raid and the chanter was MGB'ing KEI and guess what..it didn't hit me even tho she had me targeted...2 times..first with the MGB and then with TGB on and targeted on me. A chanter from a different group finally got one to land on me. Also, I could not hit the MA with Sta to save my life... another shaman had to do it. My group buff got everyone else in his group except him and he was standing next to me. I also was on my drog and shrunk once. I also got &quot;feared&quot; and instead of running away, it turned me upside down then right side up twice and i got the message that char had ben thrown under the world and was taken to a safe spot. Thankfully , that spot was next to the raid.<br />
Piwacket Magicat =^.^=<br />
P.S.  We got 10 epic pieces to drop for 1 SK, 1 War, 1 Wiz, 3 shaman, 3 bard, and 1 chanter  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've mgb'd Fo7 this past week and i got no messages about it landing .. but according to the raid .. it did hit .. which i thought was odd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brrakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have the problem when buffing people as well.  In PoI single target buffing.  Also noticed when running thru starting areas, skeletons and other mobs were flying up in the air.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have the problem when buffing people as well.  In PoI single target buffing.  Also noticed when running thru starting areas, skeletons and other mobs were flying up in the air.....<br />
<br />
I was two boxing.. and I notice on one of my pc's the mob was up in the air and the other it was fine.. <br />
<br />
I think it has to do with the graphics card..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">WOOT, glad its not just me having these friggin probs.  In PoE on ledge camp (which line of sight there is messed up as it is up higher than the rest of the area), i wouldnt get an uncomfortable/yawns messege OR a resist OR a you %t is oor OR you cant see your %t.  I got nothing.  buffs were being a pain in the butt too, land on some not on others IF it casted at all.  being shrunk not shrunk, on mount , off mount..didnt make any difference.  I tried to re log, didnt seem to help either.  Oh well, hope the next patch 'fixes' it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Same here, none of my group buffs would land in PoV.  Very annoying.  I would also not see any slow messages.  I kept having to ask if the thing was slowed.  Really really annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Realy bad in Kod' Taz on a horse.  Can't land spells, can't loot, get LoS errors on mobs in the floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I have had this problem with all group spells.  <br />
<br />
Zoning fixes this but it can be a real challange when you have to rebuff a raid far from any zone line and all your group buffs no longer hit any others in the group.</div></div><hr />
