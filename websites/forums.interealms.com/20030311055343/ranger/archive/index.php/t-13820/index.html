But this is unbelievable:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree that it's a load of bull****. If you spend the time to create your name, and the GM decides he likes that name, makes it on a different server, and then screws you from the name you have had that long, it would piss me off too. I have a slew of names backuped, but, still, it's a crock of ****.<br />
<br />
He's built his rep, earned his friends, and done this for that long, only to have some two bit chump with a customer service app come up and rip it off. That's the biggest load I've ever heard. I'm pretty sure all of my friends would be pissed if I had to change my name by now, at level 43. I mean, Christ, we've known each other for 20+ levels. Back in Unrest.<br />
<br />
No Customer Service representitive should force a paying customer to change their name unless it violates the naming policy in a bad way other than &quot;Mommy! I want that one!&quot; and that is basically what the GM did in my eyes when he picked that name for his GM. I've met that GM, too, on Lanys. Now I realize why I felt I shouldn't speak to him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh, I was pissed enough when I found out some rogue took my surname.<br />
<br />
I would be real pissed if a GM took my first name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mortec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Smokes!<br />
<br />
That should NOT be allowed to happen!<br />
<br />
I'd blow alot of fuses if that happened to me. Hope VI looks into this and learns some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">surnames are kinda iffy.  I have seen a few ppl with Starwolf as their last name but i dont get pissed at them, i may joke that i do but thats another story.  <br />
<br />
as far as first names go, i would really pissed if i saw someone else with my first name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KaninZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sounds like a GM needs an attitude adjustment :&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mridule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This almost sounds too rediculous to be true.<br />
<br />
If it is I agree its 100% crap and that GM should be sacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RangerRobyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah..  it is utter and complete crap... <br />
<br />
Reminds me of how people in authority in many instances in life think that the same rules of all don't apply to them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NinadeneBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Taking some ones name after they've spent years developing a reputation is just wrong. Especially after all the times Sony/verant have stated that our reps/names are important.<br />

P.S. .<br />
robyn .. why are you wearing a dress? your a ranger not a monk, get with the program sparky =)<br />

SITUATION RESOLVED!!!!!!!<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 I just recieved an email from Bruce Economy - (Lead Game Master Kriggan) about 5 minutes ago that stated this:<br />
<br />
Hello Rocky,<br />
I am Bruce Economy, a supervisor here at Sony Online Entertainment. I received an email this morning regarding the changing of your character Zapheus' name. I <br />
have investigated the situation and I would like to apologize for the treatment you received. I have removed the X from your name, so you once again are known <br />
as Zapheus on Brell. I assure you that we will be resolving the issue on our end per our policies.<br />
Again, I apologize for the way you were treated and I bid you good luck and safe hunting. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Bruce W Economy<br />
Lead Game Master Kriggan<br />
<br />
<br />
THANK GOD!!!! I sent him a big thank you return email immediately. I was just in the middle of posting an update <br />
of what /logs i had from talking to Guide Khash and Senior Guide Maltyn from last night and the fact that when I got home<br />
there was still no response and my name still had an x on the end. But before I end this post, I AM ABSOLUTELY FLOORED by the amount of public relations hailstorm you guys have whipped up ten ways til tuesday on every forum, tradeskill site, class site, server boards, etc, etc ad infinitum. I'm eternally grateful for ALL of your support in this matter. I think I'm going to go on an all night buffing/rezzing spree in everyzone I can get to like I did last night. Again. THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH. I'm literally shaking at the massive publicity this has recieved.</div></div><hr />
