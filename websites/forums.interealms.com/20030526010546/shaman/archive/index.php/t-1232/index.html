<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kafeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Keep in mind I am only 25, so I am sure this will change later.  But, when I am soloing, I am not sure if it is worth the mana &amp; time to debuff before I slow/dot them.  Does -20 really make a noticable diff on the mobs at these levels? <br />
<br />
Also, if I am trying to debuff so that I can land a slow, should I be using my disease debuffer since slows can be cured with disease or should I be using my malo-something from level 19?<br />
<br />
Thanks =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kafeen, any of your slow spells is a check against magic resistance (MR).  The cure disease is ONLY to get rid of the slow (ie a mob slows you).  It was implemented because, prior to the change, the only way to remove a slow was to dispell it (along with all of your buffs).  Since slow is particularly crippling for melee, and no one could get rid of it, they made it cureable as a disease.  Again, that is ONLY the cure.  To LAND the slow, it checks against MR, so a disease debuff will not help you land slow in the least.<br />
<br />
As to debuffing the mobs, my only comment is this: if you are having trouble landing slow (resisted a lot) you might consider debuffing. Otherwise, I'd conserve mana and accept the occasional resist.  I didn't solo much as a young shaman, but when I did, I all but never used debuffers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't bother with debuffing at your level when soloing.  BUT, you could partner with a mage or Wizzie and they would love you for Malo...they have reported to me that they hit for Max damage more often. <br />
<br />
Slow's are still Magic based, even with a disease counter. So stick with Malo and don't worry about Insidious Decay (or whatever disease debuffer you have).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've never used resist debuffs when soloing, except for a few cases where I had to fight white or almost-white MOBs. When grouped with other casters, however, I frequently use them, as essentially we're getting more &quot;bang for the buck.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only nice thing about DR debuffers is they are a relatively low aggro, long distance, relatively low mana, fast casting pull spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have never debuffed (other than slow) while soloing. If a mob gives me a lot of magic or cold resists, I either just switch to poison spells or switch to another mob to solo. It is very rare to find a good solo exp grind mob that is MR and CR and PR. If they have all those resistances, I'm not going to be very efficient soloing them anyway.<br />

Exactly.  As you get higher in level though, it's worth it to debuff a mob if you're using JBB.  It's worth that extra mana to make sure that your nuke hits for 263 each time.  I couldn't solo on velious without malosi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Poorboy Shaman here... No JBB for me... sigh... I can certainly see why you'd want to MALOx with a JBB.<br />

At one point had saved 20k for it, but couldn't find one for sale over a 2 month period hanging around in NFP. Decided to screw it and bought an Ikky BP, REIF, Acrylia studded cloak, dragonwing mantle, diamond/blue diamond resist gear and a few miscellaneous items. I hate NFP... of course it's much easier now with the new channels.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The only time I use MR debuffs is when I'm fighting a named.<br />
Like when I duel-comp my 54 shammie and 60 rogue on  Named Golems out in The Grey, for instance.<br />
<br />
If I don't land a slow pretty damn quick on An Ancient Shissar Servit its time to head to the zoneline.....<br />
<br />
Normally I'll try to land the (level 34?) Malisement before hitting it with Turgors, just coz my shaman will get the puss beaten out of him before my rogue can get aggro back (hasted 60 rogue w/epic).<br />
And yes the shammie's gone all out for AC/HP gear... thank god.<br />
<br />
Also I noticed after they &quot;fixed&quot; the slow aggro last week that shrooms in FG seem to resist slow more now, sometimes 3 times in a row!<br />
I've since started bouncing the baby 19th level Malise off them first just to make sure they resist less without wasting too much mana. This may just be my bad luck though... Must... get.... 60...!!<br />
<br />
As a side note: Lowering MR decreases the number of times my rogue's LSoEE's +5 magic damage is resisted. 1HS 21/29 is a lot sexier than 1HS 16/29.....<br />
And the lowered CR of course can't hurt for my JB Bracer nukeage ;)</div></div><hr />
