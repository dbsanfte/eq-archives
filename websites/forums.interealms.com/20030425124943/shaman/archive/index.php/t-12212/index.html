<br />
<br />
I'm level 58 and am really wanting to upgrade some of my equipment.  Some of it is ok, some of it I have had for almost 30 levels now. <br />
<br />
I am in a small guild, and am unable to attend most of the raids because I work 2-10 M-F and they are almost all in the Eastern time zone.  They did go up to Fear to try to get me a tear last week for my epic and I got home just in time to drop Cazic Thule.  <br />
<br />
I also don't have tons of money, I think 8k was the most I ever had at one time, and I spent that on my horse:) <br />
<br />
Given these limitations is there anything you can suggest for me, or am I pretty much stuck with what I have?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Couple of super-cheap upgrades you can make are about 100-200pp each for a spider fur belt (10ac 5dex 5agi 40hp) and a tattered mantle (12ac 20hp) - or if you have a little bit more money laying around, one of the mantles from WW - I have the 13ac 45hp/mana one, paid 2k iirc.  If your playing hours force you to solo mostly, buy an aego &amp; KEI, and go farm PoG for cash.  There are plenty of threads about PoG on the crucible.</div></div><hr />
