<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">the whole brevity thing escapes me. i beg you to give this a read and spare your time/insight to craft a reply if you are feeling generous. i would sincerely appreciate your thoughts.<br />
<br />
started playing eq late in the beta w/ a friend's account. loved it. screwed around, died, explored and laughed when my friend claimed he invented quadding. played a lot, eventually raided with what was, at the time, a guild that could claim hardcore status.<br />
<br />
played ranger and wizard. dicked around w/ warrior a bit as well. kunark came out, and like the rest, i threw together an iksar monk. loved my monk, despite never really learning how to play him properly.<br />
<br />
played through kunark, played through velious and loved every minute of it. luclin turned me off and bloody real life started owning me a bit. left eq for a spell. nota bene: never properly raided luclin or anything after.<br />
<br />
back to eq after a long break, around the release of ldon. futzed around on ranger but was looking for a change. had a solid bank of cash and items, so stripped ranger/wizard/monk and created warrior.<br />
<br />
leveled up warrior primarily doing ldons. while some hate the expansion for find it trite, i adore it. it appeals to my time issues and my obsessive-compulsive nature. you start, you accomplish a task, you win. i like i like ... warrior was geared reasonably well all things considered. set of ornate. blade of carnage. aggro augs. i stopped at lvl 60 because i'm not a fan of pop. for better or worse, i'm a kunark/velious kindaguy. call me crazy. i'd lead new people around howling stones every week and smile behind the monitor as they expressed their pleasure w/ the zone.<br />
<br />
gates of discord came out and i could see that my casual warrior wasn't going to have the hp/ac to be of any real value in the new content. and playing on an older server, i'd grown accustomed to bards in top guilds mocking my hp. bards ...<br />
<br />
school started and i took another break from eq.<br />
<br />
i love eq. i mean that. it's a great game. it appeals to me on a fundamental psychological level. the time invested in return for fauxrewards revs my inner self. call me crazy. ldons because of the win/loss record really get me going.<br />
<br />
i'm coming back. i've never seen oow and god is greek to me. hell, pop progression isn't something i'm familiar with or comfortable.<br />
<br />
down to a single account that still contains my warrior. he's a legitimate ldon tank--i'd like to think--but i don't think he'll ever be more than that. i don't think i have the time or the will to make him a serious raider. more importantly, i don't think i have the will to be a serious raider again.<br />
<br />
but i want to play. and i want to ldon. and i know that's crazy, but that's me. i'll be casual, no doubt about that, but i'd still like to progress--in terms of ldon wins and aa accumulated. not gear and maybe not even levels.<br />
<br />
so the quandary is this: which class suits my goals? i'm not asking you to pick for me, i'm asking you to ... consider ... what i want and examine my rationale and perhaps point out some holes in my logic. or make a suggestion. or pick for me if that's your bag.<br />
<br />
a little help here, basically ...<br />
<br />
what i'm considering and why:<br />
<br />
warrior. he's geared and has the fun aa. he's damn sexy. he needs work to be anything more than a ldon tank, but maybe it can be done w/ the word casual thrown in there. i'm not sure what kind of hp/ac are reasonable goals for a lvl 60 warrior that doesn't aspire to reach time should be. and given the decline in server population, is this a viable class for the casual gamer?<br />
<br />
ranger. i love the ranger. and it's been awhile, so perhaps i could start anew and enjoy the leveling process again. headshot @ 62 and the mines of nurga beckon. i could seriously enjoy myself doing whatever ldon i was asked to do and soloing in nurga until my eyes bled.<br />
<br />
monk. iksar look cool. let's not joke around about that. but from what i've read the class has been futzed w/ to the point of extinction. still a valid dps class or second rate now?<br />
<br />
cleric. i have a lvl 10 cleric. he's a gnome. winwin. i'd like to think i could create my own ldon groups if i provided the healing.<br />
<br />
druid. god, the horror of even mentioning this ... i've done ldons w/ a druid as the primary healer and it worked. and a druid, i believe, could solo while i looked for ldon work.<br />
<br />
shaman. my favorite class. but one i've never played myself. i've always respected the class for it's utility and flexibility--which from what i've read are now drawbacks in the age of specialization. more importantly, and i assure you this isn't a burst of sycophantry, the players behind the shaman characters have taught me more than any other. the shaman players understand the game mechanics and couple that with a blue-collar attitude that floats by boat. my concern is with the viability of a new shaman in the current game. can a shaman legitimately primary heal a ldon? can a shaman solo in old world spots to his/her heart's content gathering aa?<br />
<br />
i'll end before i make your eyes bleed. thank you for your time. again, i would sincerely appreciate any feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Luddaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as the class your asking ive only played a Bard and a Shaman. Personally I like my bard more, but that could be a phase since its something new to me.<br />
<br />
However since you like LDoN alot, there is (or was, not sure how they are fairin') a guild on Brell called Dungeon Inc. That was a guild that did LDoN's. Maybe you could look into seeing if there are any guilds on your server like that.<br />
<br />
Also since you like the Old School content you could also look into joining an Old School guild on your server as well.<br />
<br />
But back to the class question. for LDoN I find a mage to accualy be very good, though I think every class has its advantages/Disavantages in LDoNs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you'd have a ton of fun leveling a shaman or a necromancer in pre-luclin eq. Neither class is incredibly gear-dependent. I can speak for myself on ldons &amp; say that at lvl 69 with what's considered &quot;mediocre&quot; gear &amp; aa's they are fun as the main healer. With lvl 70 &amp; 3 more months of upgrades from Time, GoD &amp; OOW, they might be trivial. They aren't atm &amp; I really enjoy slowing &amp; main healing ldons. With a druid in the group I can slow, CC &amp; back-up heal them. Not trivial, but stimulating.<br />
<br />
I have taken plenty of long breaks in my career since i started playing in jan '00. I havn't played as many classes as you though. Gravitating towards skill vs. gear dependent types is my impression of your play-style. Without a doubt, I'd suggest you stay away from the warrior &amp; cleric. The few alt classes that I have played, in addition to boxing a friends chars reminds me that a shaman is where I want to stay. I love screaming at my monitor because I can do anything that my groupmates might fail to do, albiet not as well :) or at all in the case of evaccing !<br />
<br />
A shaman can turn the tide of a battle as well as, or possibly better than, any other class in the game. You can play conservatively or balls-to-the-wall. The most fun is the latter, obviously. You could level a shaman to 60 in Kunark zones &amp; gear &amp; feel god-like. Those were our salad days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You should play a necromancer. Least group and gear dependent of any class.  Can also be a good puller in ldon, as well as the slower in the undead ones.  Can rez the cleric when he dies, can solo like crazy, etc..<br />
<br />
I think, no matter how much you believe ldon suits your playstyle, you'll eventually get bored.  Necromancer will allow you to play a much wider range of content, without being too concerned about gear and advancement.<br />
<br />
Druids have some of the same benefits as necro's.  With their animal charm, snare, and CH, they can do a lot of solo work, but its limited to outdoor zones mainly.<br />
<br />
Shaman, while having an incredible diverse set of tools, are actually really gear dependent.  The higher you go, the more you'll be tanking mobs if you wish to solo.  In groups, gear isn't as much of an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shlob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would have to disagree with you ung on the having to tank. shamans will have ot tank mobs as much at necros and druids. sure they dont have snare but we have root. what ever you guys snare and kite we can root and rot. sure every great once in a while i take 2 maybe 3 hits. some i choose to tank while i solo others i root and rot. theres not much of a difference imo on what necro's kite and what we root and rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Through the use of various tradeskilled OOW armors 'Magnitized' and various tradeskilled OOW augs ... You can have a &quot;casual&quot; type warrior that dosent suck .<br />
If you are fully geared up out of LDoN &quot;full augs , ect&quot; that is a good enough point of gear that with High aa you can hang respectably well in prob 90% of exp zones .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would have to disagree with you ung on the having to tank. shamans will have ot tank mobs as much at necros and druids. sure they dont have snare but we have root. what ever you guys snare and kite we can root and rot. sure every great once in a while i take 2 maybe 3 hits. some i choose to tank while i solo others i root and rot. theres not much of a difference imo on what necro's kite and what we root and rot.<br />
<br />
No difference as far as what you kill but there is a huge differnece inthe rate of kills. I love my shaman very much but my necro will out solo him for pure exp any day of the week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I will put in my 2 cents for the Shaman choice. Heres the thing about Shaman. This class is LARGELY about spells and skills. Gear just helps us do &quot;more&quot;, but you can take a Shaman wearing Banded and duo him with a decent warrior and be just fine. The opposite isnt as true, a goddly geared Shaman wont REALLY help a poorly geared tank succeed as much. <br />
<br />
Another nice thing about the shaman class is that its easy to do almost anything. Its easy to solo. Its easy to find groups. Its easy to be a GREAT shaman who really fufills his role as &quot;Slower/healer/debuffer/buffer/little DPS/little CC&quot; etc, or you can just be a lazy BOT shaman who slows, buffs, heals a little, maybe drops a DOT. Its all good. <br />
<br />
Versitility is the shamans clas &quot;defining role&quot;. Saddly, EQ has been heading toward a game geared more on specialization than versitility, but regardless, the ability to wear MANY MANY hats in MANY MANY situations is what has kept me playing this character over the years. There is even now a lot of cool raid content that make shaman REALLY valuable. Wanna go into Uqua withour a few? Or tackle Quarm? Doubtful. Almost as required as Warriors and Clerics in some spots. <br />
<br />
Of course, I am totally biased. I used to twink a lot. Now, I have stripped most of my toons, and just play the shaman. Even my original character, the class I play in almost every game, Paladin, is sitting in dry-dock. Goten him about +300 hp/mana/50 AC since OoW, and not played him more than 2 hours since the expansion came out. I play a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anyway as to the original poster I'd say the necromancer is probably best suited for you since your limited on play time. Necros are finnally begining to be recognized as a very useful class to have in groups for great sustained dps and some versitility (not as much as shaman but still pretty good). <br />
<br />
But the fact is the shaman just can't keep up for pure soloing exp with a necro and this is what's going to allow you to play casually. Plus post 60 a necro can really solo for exp as well as a casual group the same can't be said for a shaman (well cept for POFire I suppose).<br />
<br />
Love my shaman and necro very much I can't really choose between either of them for which is more fun to play but if your goign to play casual the necro is gonig to give you many more options in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Twinked shaman solo to 56 in three weeks, all old world~<br />
<br />
With Spear of Fate in hand and JBB in.. wrist.. shaman are nuts solo in the 50s.<br />
<br />
For LDoN, yes, shaman can be main healer up to level 65.  Can after 65, but not without a raid-geared tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;I would have to disagree with you ung on the having to tank&quot;<br />
<br />
I said the higher up you go.  As soon as mobs start summoning, say good bye to root rot.  <br />
<br />
In terms of pure content that is available to solo, necro's have it hands down.  FD alone allows a necro to single pull mobs out of groups that my shaman wouldn't even consider, and he has twice the hp's and mana as my necro.  Add to that undead mez, undead lures, pet pulling with pet FD, lifeburn, much higher dps, etc.. <br />
<br />
Not to mention, if things go poorly, a necro can run back to the zone, summon his corpse, rez himself, and try again.  <br />
<br />
It just depends what direction you lean.  If you want more solo power, necro is the way to go.  If you want more a more group friendly character, with some solo ability, shaman is the way to go.</div></div><hr />

summoning corpses isn't going to be an issue anymore with the upcomeing expansion.  necros solo faster for xp, but what have you found that a necro can solo that a shaman in equal gear can't?  i would say shaman outsolo necros on &quot;tough&quot; encounters any day of the week.  by tough i mean named, nonxp type mobs.<br />
mobs that come in groups of 3 or less aren't that hard to deal with as a shaman especially by a zone line...  <br />
as i play a pally + a shaman i am always looking for undead to xp the pally on.  it is a rare day to find anything worthy of killing past crypt of decay that is undead (caves in WoS and mistmoore now i guess...)<br />
<br />
it sounds like a necro or shaman would be the class for you to pick.  at least from how you describes his play habits.  it really comes down to how versitile you want the class you are playing to be. necro will xp faster and maybe safer, shaman will be able to take on harder mobs and is more friendly if you want to do groups.  (btw at 65 on the shaman i was partnering ldons normals with a 65 ranger.)<br />
<br />
to be honest, i am suprised that people on these forums are telling you to play a necro. i would choose a shaman any day of the week =p</div></div><hr />

Only comment would be that your thinking of the game pre ToM for the necro. Since then they can tank those summon mobs as well a shaman. Out of curiosity has a shaman soloed Venril yet? I don't believe so but I could be wrong. Since PoP has come out a necro has been able to solo those tough mobs that a shaman has been able to do for awhile and now some that they can't.<br />
<br />
I think the shaman is more fun overall but the simple fact is having a character that can exp solo better is going to be much more useful to a casual player. Which is who we are supposed to be helping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The problem with Necro is that they have a stigma of being &quot;non-group-friendly&quot;, which is totally wrong these days, but which still exists. Sure they have a few more soloing tools than Shaman, but not many people NEVER EVER group at all, and of the &quot;soloing classes&quot; I would say Shaman has the best chance of getting groups. Not due to any factual basis, BTW, but simply due to the mindset of players in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats true to an extent. It's really starting to dissapear for necros though. A lot necros get tells even if they aren't lfg for groups becausep eople are starting to relize that as far as casters go we put out some of the best sustained dps in game. Plus in omens pretty much anything is wrackable so we can pass the mana around nicely. <br />
<br />
This stigma is starting to fade a good deal. Still some days will wait around lfg a good amount but for the most part it's really begininig to fade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have to say I have been surprised recently that in about 75% of random pickup groups in OOW lately, group concensus always defaults to necro to fill an empty spot.  I love the little buggers but I never remember them being that &quot;popular&quot; to fill empty spots in groups.  It's cool, they have some nice versatility that reminds me of...well, me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">when Im building a group after I get the cleric and a beefy tank the first thing I look for is a Wizard, Necro, or a rogue, preferably all three.  I LOVE having Necros in my groups and have since about Luclin release.  Its only been in the last year though that more and more people have come around to the dark side though and started looking for necros to fill group slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Is the necro bug/feature whereby all Oow mobs are mindwrack-able still working?  That alone made necro's more desired in groups in Oow.  And difficult corpse run zones, like Riftseekers/mpg made their emergency FD and rez the cleric valuable.  <br />
<br />
And despite the new expansions guild summon corpse feature, the necro summon corpse has the advantage of summoning in zone, not all the way back to pok.  So a necro can FD/invis into a tight situation, dragging a corpse, like a mage, rez him, and let him coh a group past tons of content.  Still very valuable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Most mobs are wrackable in oow not all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i actually thought of VS after i his the submit reply button lol.  off the top of my head i can't think of any special solo stuff i have done recently that a necro may not be able too...maybe PoW /shrug... <br />
still, i would say a shaman has an edge on tough encounters where tanking is involved especially if there is no kite room.  i say this purely because of slow.  necros can heal themselves and pump out better dps, but they don't tank as well due to their silk classedness and their inability to slow anything not undead.  also, you have to remember we are talking about bazarr geared casual play styles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Shaman can single pull, too.  The pet trick works just fine for us, it's only a tad more perilous since we don't have the FD get-out-of-jail-free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">No question the non-group-friendly attitude toward necros is diminishing. Personally I love them, especially in OoW, where I think many mobs were given mana to &quot;wrack&quot;, even if they didnt cast, intentionally to make necros more group friendly. The necro has a GREAT grouping package now. Pulling, strong pet, damn good DPS, FD, rez, the list goes on. Glad to see it too, necros had a bum rap for too long in this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healing? Yep. Not great, but can spot heal.<br />
DOT's? In spades.<br />
DD? You betcha.<br />
Mez? Sure can.<br />
Slow? Yes. Granted it's (or was) limited to undead only (VERY useful in old MM LDONs), but they can slow.<br />
Tank? No, but they have a pet for that. <br />
Mana Regen? Oh yes. Self AND group.<br />
<br />
REZ? Hey, group / raid went to crap? Well have the FD'ed Monk drag all the bodies to a central pile where the FD'ed Necro can rez the Cleric.<br />
<br />
The only thing a Necro can't do well is buff. Unless you like the bobbing motion.<br />
<br />
I was in an LDON back in the day (when they weren't trivial), with a Druid, Enchanter (me), three Necros and some form of tank. (He was extraneous tbh).<br />
<br />
Good lord. The looter had trouble keeping up.</div></div><hr />
