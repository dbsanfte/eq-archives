<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok about to take my Networking + exam. Personally I think I am close to ready.<br />
<br />
My main source is the Sybex guide, Network +, Version and exam number 10-002 written by Dave Groth.<br />
<br />
My secondary source is Networking Essentials by MS press. This book prepares you for the 70-058 exam. It is also copyrighted 1997. (And shows, for example there is no mention of mesh topologies.)<br />
<br />
Ok a couple of technical questions.<br />
<br />
1) Under  Common Ethernet Cable Types  FDDI is said to use a MIC connector.<br />
<br />
What is a MIC connector?<br />
<br />
2) Under protocols is NETBEUI a Transport or Network layer protocol? (The books conflict on this. I am further confused as NETBEUI has no routing capability but is said in one to exist at the Network layer)<br />
<br />
3) Insofar as the TCP / IP suite:<br />
<br />
3a) FTP operates at the Session layer and ABOVE? <br />
3b) TFTP operates at the Session layer and ABOVE?<br />
3c) IMAP uses TCP? UDP? Which port (if any) does it use or is it a local host only function?<br />
3d) ICMP uses which port? And since it is a major part of 'ping' I am guessing it uses TCP?<br />
<br />
4) This may sound stupid - but why does Novell client for Win 9x/NT offer more services or is more robust than MS client for Netware Networks?<br />
<br />
5) SLIP. This protocol can KMA as I missed two questions on the pre-test.<br />
<br />
5a) SLIP can only operate on serial connections (per book). Isn't connection defined by the plug and BUS of the computer?<br />
5b) &quot; When using SLIP to connect to log in to a remote machine, a  terminal mode  must be configured after login. <br />
<br />
Are they talking about TELNET? (Port 23, TCP)<br />
And why is SLIP not compatible with DHCP?<br />
<br />
6)  I think the book is wrong on this next question:<br />
<br />
&quot;Which type of Firewall checks for a current communication and the next packet needed&quot; <br />
<br />
I said Dynamic Packet Filtering. The Answer was proxy.<br />
<br />
Am I right or is there something I am missing?<br />
<br />
7) This was another conflict with the book:<br />
<br />
 Which series of books does the DoD publish to deal with  Network  security.<br />
<br />
I said Red book. The answer was Rainbow. Perhaps my answer was more specific than it needed to be.<br />
<br />
However, the same book says that &quot;You will find the evaluation criteria for  DoD computer standards (called the rainbow series) at www.radium.nsc.mil)<br />
<br />
8) Under Clustering / Fault Tolerance / Fault recovery this was a question:<br />
<br />
What technology does  VMS  use to asllow multiple servers to access the same resources to provide load balancing and fault tolerance.<br />
<br />
The answer is Clustering. Got that right.<br />
<br />
What the heck is VMS? Virtual Management System?<br />
<br />
Thanks much for your time in reading this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tibbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just a comment here from my experiance.  Unless your company is requiring the plus exam, don't waste your time with it.  If you are going to burn yourself out on network topologies and other stuff, get a CCNA.  80% of the CCNA (one test) is basically the old MCSE Network Essentials.  The CCNA is worth 2 billion times more out in the job market than the plus exam which really only matters to companies who run call center tech support.<br />
<br />
If you really want to step into IT, go for the big certifications.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zixor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't help you with most of those but look here for info about VMS: http://www.openvms.compaq.com/wizard/faq/vmsfaq_001.html#faq_general<br />
<br />
Basically its an OS that was designed by DEC (bought by Compaq, bought by HP) that was used mostly on their VAX mainframes. VMS stands for Virtual Memory System.  Interestingly, Windows NT has its roots in VMS, I believe they were designed by the same person, and the acronyms VMS and WNT are related.</div></div><hr />
