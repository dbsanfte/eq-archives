<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im level 52 now, self buffed at about 2.7k hp, with Virt jumps to just under 4k, raid buffed about 4.5-4.7<br />
Mana pool consistently at about 3.5k<br />
No FT items =(<br />
Have + 4 regen from items.<br />
<br />
Now with all that said, what should i be trying to increase? Hp, mana, or stats?  Where do i get all these yummy FT items at?  And as far as the HP/mana, am I doing ok for my level?  Im still a noob, been playin since Nov 04...lots of stuff I dont know about yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">this should probably have been posted in the equipment forum but, from my limited exp. real quick:<br />
solstice earring (FT1).<br />
<br />
while the fabled are around for another week, head to FM and look for Fabled Eldak in giant fort tunnels. He drops ring NON-LORE 90HP plus other stats. You will need help with him but he's fully slowable and lvl 55. Hit my 62 monk for around 300 max. a lvl 60 bard was getting hit for 500, so you will need a healer+tank<br />
while in next door in BW is a wurm that drop sFabled Mithril Amulet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What should be worked on for improvement most is level :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">gear-wise HP Mana STA WIS in that order.<br />
<br />
I consider FT to be a bonus, and really shouldn't be a primary focus on what gear you wear, as there are many augs that have FT now.<br />
<br />
but lvl&gt;ALL, but strictly from an equipment upgrade standpoint HP should be primary concern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hang out in the old zones and try and pick up some fabeld gear for later, I got some decent upgrades while running around karnor's, Burning Woods, FM, and Sol B.<br />
<br />
check magelo for fabled stats, ring x 2, Gloves, shoulders, and BP</div></div><hr />
