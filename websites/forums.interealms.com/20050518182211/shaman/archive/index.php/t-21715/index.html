<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I for the life of me can't figure out how to end billing with the new ui. It makes you go to the eqlive site and sign in, but it won't accept my password for any of my accounts. I must be missing something but what is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try sending an email to accounts@soe.sony.com ... might take a few days (or weeks) for them to respond hehe, but they will help ya out eventually.  Also, when you get to the login screen, there are options for retrieving your Username/Password.  If that doesnt work, contact Livesupport maybe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dunno how to end billing witht he new UI myself, havent tried yet, but those would be the steps i would take if I was having trouble.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">your not missing anything.  they ended my billing without telling me on one of my characters and i tried to log in to reset it but wont take my name or  pw as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So the new UI wasn't just to give us a fresh new look? It was to hide the end billing and switch the order Omens buttons around.<br />
<br />
Let us know what you find out.</div></div><hr />

When entering my password it appears to refresh the screen and asks for it again. Annoying as hell when you need an emergency password change, which, guess what, I cant do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not being an anti-SOE prick here, but is anyone really surprised?<br />
<br />
A new UI, or a new trick/gimmick?<br />
<br />
I know which of the two seems more logical to me =/.<br />
<br />
****ing ****bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sadly I have 6 accts and can't access any of the 6 on the website. All are paid by my debit card, so its not like I can just cancel my checking acct to end billing. I seriously think they messed up something when they did the new ui cuz I can't log in to buy anything either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Launch eq, let patcher run, click play, accept ToS, enter, enter, click account button - it's right below login, second one down - it will launch a web page with the url where you enter station name and password.<br />
<br />
Bookmark for future end-billings :)</div></div><hr />

Last time, I had to clear totally the folder (files and cookies) to finally log on EQLive.</div></div><hr />

Tried that with eqw instead of eq, will try with regular eq patcher running. Hope it works. <br />
Edit just tryed it, didn't work yet. WIll try with cleaning out my temp folder next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Alright just tryed deleting all my temp internet files, and then rebooting my computer. Still didn't work on any of my accts. This is really annoying, spending money i don't want to spend on this crap and I can't figure out how to stop it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you can't access a end billing, and if they don't respond, can you call your credit card company to cancell? Or at least to make a complaint? Enough of that and maybe the credit card company will bill them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Slowd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Edit:  Post was to suppose to be its own seperate thread.  <br />
<br />
NA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think if you have changed your password for EQ it doesn't automatically update your station password.  I could be wrong on that.<br />
<br />
Try the original password(s) you started with.  I have no problem logging in, not sure what the deal is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you can't access a end billing, and if they don't respond, can you call your credit card company to cancell?

<br />
Well, I guess that's ONE way for them to stop the exodus of players.  Maybe they're hoping one of their massive-sweeping-changes patches will convince you to stay before you can manage to get your account turned off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can log into the station just fine, thing is when i click on acct info it asks me to re-enter my password and there it doesn't take it. And I tryed it with an acct thats about 6 monthes old and has had only 1 password ever. So the updating password thing isn't the problem either. Looks like I'm going to have to call my bank and explain the problem, not paying $78 a month just because they won't let me end billing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Aside from having to look for the button I had no actual difficulty ending billing on 4 accounts in the past few weeks. <br />
<br />
The only thing I can see that might be different is the fact that I use mozilla as a web browser. One that I highly recommend at that. <br />
www.mozilla.org (http://www.mozilla.org)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Wow, how are you paying $78 a month?  Thats way too much in the first place hehe.  I know i paid for a 2 year subscription (up in about 4 months now) and paid it in full at the time i purchased it.  So in essence i paid 300ish dollars at one time, and havent payed anything monthly since.  But again, i suggest you send an email to them,  accounts@soe.sony.com , and see what they say.  I was able to get some of my problems resolved very fast about 3 weeks ago with them.  Just keep sending emails till they respond (squeaky wheel gets the grease theory).  Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I don't see what's so hard.<br />
<br />
-Start the patcher and get to the screen where it has the button that says &quot;account&quot;, click on that.<br />
-It takes you to the sony site, you put in your password and you choose the button that says view/edit subscription.<br />
-You then have a set of new buttons and one says cancel account.<br />
<br />
Voila.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The problem is just that Gund.  Stolastorv cant login on the website that it redirects to.  If it was working he probably would be able to figure that out and cancel.  <br />

Well then since it's likely his computer that is the problem, see if maybe he can load basic eq onto a friend or family member's computer and try it from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Turned out it was a problem with IE, used netscape and canceled what needed to be canceled. Only paying for 3 accts now thank god. <br />
As far as why i had 6 accts, good question lol, especially when I barely play anymore. Thanks to everyone who tryed to help me, thats what I love about this board.</div></div><hr />
