<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korabor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I put a feedback in that our epic should have an Alchemy mod on it (so should the rogue with poisonmake) I suggested in the feedback that maybe the 1.5 have a 10% mod and the 2.0 have a 15% mod, this would help out more on the OoWar augments seeing as the philosopher stone doesn't drop anymore and hardly anybody wants to do VT anymore for the 15% range item (Umbracite Swarm Orb I think its called). In my opinion, the epic would be useful even if you had a better primary that you equiped. Anyways, was just wondering what the communities response to this would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That would be a nice bonus. <br />
<br />
However, I am in no way dissatisfied with the 1.5 as it currently exists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wouldn't help rogues at all either since they can already get to 250 skill and thus reach the hard cap with only a 5% skill mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korabor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">but they wouldn't have to skill up as far to reach the cap, and I fully agree with you Samanna, I am more than happy with my 1.5, just be nice to get another way of getting a nice alchemy mod better than the trophy or geerlok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would honestly rather focus my attention on trying to get SOE to make the &quot;Individual Class Items&quot; from Time (a 2 year old expansion) inventory clickable (Shaman TA, Chanter slow stick, Druid arms, etc) so I can equip my epic full time, instead of swapping TA and Epic in and out. It seems the times I MOST need the additional stats and the &quot;lower aggro&quot; effect of Epic are the exact times I need to keep TA equipped (lots of adds, all needing longer term slowing).<br />
<br />
Of course, I may be biased, since I have the Swarm Orb, and +TS skill mods dont stack (only the best is used). And I realize that not everyone has a TA in the first place. But I think that overall, this kind of energy can be put to better use.</div></div><hr />

Well since it's shaman only you'll either see it drop and get one or wont. Odds are there won't be much choice involved unless you've got lots of shaman. Just luck of if it drops at a raid your at or not.</div></div><hr />

Sorry Blazz but epic 1.5 is not really aimed at your type of player it is meant more for the likes of me and Samanna (sorry) etc.<br />
For all you know Epic 2 may make you want to destroy your TA as the effect may be so overwhelming.(There again judging by SoE's past performances probably not :)).<br />
Also from what i understand a TA is basically a game altering piece of equipment so should they really make it even more game altering ?<br />
<br />
As for an Alchemy mod on 1.5 thats an excellent idea.<br />
<br />

Hardly game-altering anymore. Balance of Nihil is still my top slow. Clicky slow is great if I have mana issues, or multiple mobs, but in 90% of all single-XP group situations, TA is bagged for me, but in 90% of the raids I do, I equip TA because I need the longer slow available (saves a spell slot). <br />
<br />
And I disagree that Epic 1.5 isnt aimed at players like me. Its a goddly item, even if you never, ever put it into your primary slot, for the clicky effect alone. I would just like to be able to wear it full-time, for the enduring effect, rather than being relatively FORCED to equip a piece of gear from a 2 year old expansion (granted, TA is a bit MORE than &quot;just a 2 year old piece of gear&quot;, but thats not really my point)<br />
<br />
Also, remember that with the new changes to the flagging rules in Time, a LOT of people who may never have been able to get items like TA might just get a shot at them. I know if my guild had one rotting, we would probably try to find someone in another guild to come loot it. Yeah, yeah, alts and buff-bots are gonna scoop up some, but I honestly think there is a chance for non-Time flagged guildmembers to get &quot;out of the blue&quot; tells &quot;Hey man, come to the Time portal ASAP, theres a TA rotting, we can 85% you in to loot it&quot;. Maybe I am way off here, who knows, but there is still that chance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bladefury~fennin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Btw Sama.... make sure you guild DOES the mob that drops the orb.... i know when my guild was doing VT .. we skipped him for another mob.  See theres a point when breaking VT where you can choose 2 directions... you choose one.. (which is easier) you skip the orb droping mob.. or the other (harder path) and get him..... and you dont have to clear him to get to Aten so guilds can skip him constantly and it wouldnt effect raid at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Soo... for a little more detail --Diabo Xi Va Temariel -- is the mob that you need to kill for the swarm orb.  And trust me they more than likely wanna get right to Aten Ha Ra instead of going the LONG way and killing a mob they dont really have to... and the problem with when you skip it.. if you wanna go back and do him you have to do all that breaking again...<br />
<br />
sucks.. but your guild might be one that will want to clear all mobs instead of rushing to aten as fast as possible.<br />

very difficult, since you'd have to get the whole raidforce back into time a before you could raiddrag someome in from PoTr, then move everyone into b to drag into b.  Same problem excisted with Rathe in PoEb, you couldn't just add people without PoEa flag even if they had a PoEb key.</div></div><hr />

Oh man, I hope this isnt going to be the case, otherwise its going to be a MAJOR PITA. Went through it in Sol Ro and his chamber, HoH and HoHb, Earth and Earth B, and now this? Man I hope Time A and B are &quot;tied together&quot; for raid purposes. Otherwise, adding new people to the raid if they arent flagged is gonna SUCK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well thats not entirely accurate. There are 2 times when your clearing threw vt that you can go one of 2 ways and kill one of 2 possible mobs. The first is right after the first blob. You go one way and you get to diablo xi xin. You go the other way and you get to diablo xi va. After you kill one of those you then continue on to diablo xi xin thal. Either one of the 2 will allow you do to continue on and almost no one does both.<br />
<br />
After diablo xi xin thal you then move onto thall va kelum. After him you can either go left or right. Left leads to Diablo Xi Va Temariel. Right leads to Thall Xundraux Diablo. You have to do one or the other and then get to port to Va Xi Aten Ha Ra and continue on with the 2 blobs and aten herself. You could do both but pretty much no one does. My guild almost always did diablo xi va termariel which is the one who drops the orb. We felt his loot table had less crap in it than thall xundraux diablo. You can't skip them but it is a one or the other situation.<br />
<br />
Since we normally did the orb dropper we got several orbs and it was just a matter of having a shaman there who needed one to loot it. If you alternated or did the other more it could be rare.</div></div><hr />

I agree that there is much need to get items clickable from inventory, and not simply class specific ones either.  I disdain the fact that I MUST EQUIP any newer illusion mask to trigger the effect.  Seriously, what are the dev's attempting to accomplish by doing this?<br />
<br />
If we can use the effects of the item by swapping, then in a lot of the cases, why do we need to equip items for such frivelous effects.</div></div><hr />

I agree, a couple other examples off the top of my head: Spiritstones, Gate Neck from PoP, Gnome Invis device (how many of you have seen Paladins still carrying this in their secondary slot while fighting, LOL), etc.<br />
<br />
One of the very very best clickables in the game, the Invis crown for Necros and SKs, is INVENTORY CLICKABLE insta-invis. Come on. If THAT item isnt &quot;must equip&quot; then there is NOTHING that should be considered &quot;unbalanced&quot; by being clickable from inventory, certinly not items with cast-times, like Spiritstones and Invis Devices.</div></div><hr />

nope, you will not, it works when your raidforce is in TimeB as well (worked several times yesterday).<br />
<br />
Apparently the flag-items drop in P3 only, at least we didnt have a single one on any of the p4/5 gods and quarm himself.</div></div><hr />

Most guilds go the DXVT route rather then TXD due to always getting Bows off TXD. <br />

Also, in regards to gimping, we took a non-flagged time person, added him to a group (not raid) of people flagged for time and he was able to zone into TimeA while the rest of the group was in Tranq.  It seems that gimping has been VERY liberalized.  Gimping can be done on a group level so 1 non-flagged person can get in if the other 5 have it, it works no matter who is in the zone, and getting the perm flag is very simple.</div></div><hr />

Wow, this is quite a bit different from the old way. I am glad though, the whole double-85% thing was SUCH a drag, especially in the Sol Ro days. <br />
<br />
So watch for those rotting TA's you shaman! LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Burrlee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Samanna,<br />
<br />
My guild has cleared VT 7 times so far, always doing DXVT on my insistence for a rare item, and the orb has dropped once on our 2nd kill of DXVT.  The previous guild in VT before us got 1 orb to drop in like 2 or 3 months.<br />
<br />
Considering the new alchemy augs, I am SOO glad that an orb dropped for me.  It also has clicky group shrink which is so nice to avoid loading at the start of raids or groups.  Many shamans that are farther along in progression still drool about the orb, even before the new augs debuted.  <br />
<br />
Now, using 230 skill on triv 271 augs, I rarely fail the aug combines with AM3.  I have failed the minor combine once in 10 or 15 combines.  I have failed the major/pure combine like 2 times, but at least the minor aug is not lost.<br />
<br />
I am so happy that I have my orb, though I may not equip it when I get the ft4 range item from MPG. I would begrudgingly love to retire my Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl, but cant afford to lose the FT3 right now.<br />
<br />
In short, it is really worth it.  Get it!  <br />

P.S. For the record, ask your raid leader/pullers to plow SOUTH after TVK is dead.  Right or left gets tricky when you consider that south is a left turn from where you click up to TVK, but is a right turn (usually) after the TVK fight, depending on where you choose to fight him.  South is south.</div></div><hr />
