Level 51 here and taken to KC to group for the first time last night.  One question.  Why in the name of all that is holy and good would anyone go here for xp grouping???  <br />
<br />
We had a nice group, killing 4 - 7 mobs at a time consistently.  Was here for what seemed like forever (probably more like 4 or 5 hours).  Levels of the group were from 46 - 51.  We had a full group.  <br />
<br />
I can go to CoM and get double the XP -- I'm guessing here -- with none of the trains or headaches or adds.  I know that there are a lot of loot drops in KC, but when you are just hunting xp, what is the attraction?  Did I miss something?  Heck, I've been doing Frost Giants in GD for CoV faction and got better xp than this without really even trying.  <br />
<br />
This is more of just a bit of insight for those poor folks who got roped into the &quot;Kunark Trail.&quot;   Personally, I hate DL (except for Plaguebones), OT, KC, FM, etc...  <br />
<br />
With the right equipment -- no JBB required -- you can go explore the innumerable zones and get better xp.  But outside of the xp, it's just more fun than sitting in an overcrowded zone for no real reward. <br />
<br />
I caved in last night and followed the path of the majority into KC and boy was I dissappointed.  And the more I talked to people in KC, the more I realized that there are a lot of folks who just don't know any better.  So, I implore everyone to go explore, learn about the game, don't be a sheep! <br />
<br />
And that's my 2 coppers.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">KC is popular because its easy to get to, easy to get a group and has an experience modifier. <br />
<br />
KC is also very frustrating because you can get a lot of crappy groups here too which is a big waste of time.<br />
<br />
With a good group though you can spend all afternoon in a spot like RCY and make good xp and pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well said orgak  /applaude<br />
<br />
at 51 u can solo the single spawn noble on 3rd floor of hhk, and get better exp than KC ! Infact at 51 thers 2 mobs on 4th floor and one in jail area u can camp too- thogh the lvl 37 necro would be a hard fight if ur not twinked.<br />
<br />
tbh 51 maybe best in echo caverns, camping the gnomes or beetles.<br />
<br />
COm is more fun tho, esp if u got horse, or after epic drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I was in KC, I considered trains to just be one less pull I had to go get.  :)<br />
<br />
I duod my shaman/ranger in KC for a while to great effect.  My secret was to get the left courtyard and well camps, and setting up shop in the well area.  Trains don't go through there because it's not a &quot;track&quot; so I was pretty safe.<br />
<br />
I was able to keep both areas clear, about 16 mobs I think, plus have spare time to pull from the level above.  Loot was pretty weak, but the exp was actually pretty good for both characters.  Most of the mobs were still dark blue to my ranger at 57, all dark to my shaman.<br />
<br />
KC is a crappy zone if you are planning to join a pickup group.  They often exhibit poor time-management and have sub-par pulling ability.  I never saw why people would need a full group in KC, my two characters did incredibly well on their own.  The one time I was trained on a pull, I ended the fight with 8 dead mobs on the ground: 5 from the pull and 3 that popped during the 12-minute fight.  I had no assistance from any other players... it was definitely a rush.  If I added more people, it would have reduced my exp gain unless they knew exactly what they were doing.  That's rare.<br />
<br />
The zone is good, it's the players who make it bad.  Avoid them and you'll do just fine.  :)</div></div><hr />
