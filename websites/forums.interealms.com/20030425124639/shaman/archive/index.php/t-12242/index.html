<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry to bother you all, but i am without clues on how to get further at the moment so i turn to you brothers of the shaman community.<br />
<br />
I have maxed my factions through the bonechip quest to try to do the cudgel quests.<br />
<br />
I got the 3 skulls for the first upgrade quest.<br />
<br />
Then i made an iksar shaman and drank an illusion iksar potion  so i could mq the first cudgel (I thought), and when i tried to give the cudgel to Hieropahnt Oxyn he said he didnt need it and returned the cudgel to me. I then thought i didnt have enough faction on my new shaman so i did the mudcrab quest and still cant turn in the first cudgel to Oxyn.<br />
<br />
Am i doing something wrong or have they changed the quest.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be much appreciated<br />

<br />
New characters start with a Guild Summons note, which you need to hand in to Prime Hierophant Vek. Vek gives you an Iron Cudgel of the Petitioner which is what you hand to Hierophant Oxyn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry i wasnt clear enough in my first post. It is the Iron cudgel i have tried handing in, not the wooden one you start with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You're sure it was the Petitioner? You're sure it was Oxyn? Cause I just tried it and it works fine. The log file of your iksar mule might hold a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rodain1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have just done this quest too.  worked fine for me but i first made the mistake of turning the items to the shaman on the bridge and found out that is hte incorrect person.<br />
<br />
just 3 days ago i have had no problems when i was in iksar form but i turned in the cudgel from my newbie levle 1 shaman then turned in my skulls second and i got the clarviont (sorry for the misspell)  on my level 62 barb shaman with out any difficulty.  thought this would be more difficult than it was<br />
