<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi peeps, simple question.<br />
<br />
What is considered good experience at levels 58 and 59, I am testing an experience spot and want to make sure its decent.<br />
<br />
I just turned 58 now and I am currently doing 1 blue about an hour, is this good? bad? average?<br />
<br />
What is considerd good exp per hour in 59?  I havent got their yet but curious on how much of a hell level it really is. Is it like doing level 58 2 times? 3 times? &lt;cringe&gt;<br />
<br />
Also I came to the conclusion that 56 is sort of a hell level as well.  At 56 I was doing the same thing I am doing now at 58 and making 1 blue per hour, at 57 I was making 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 blue per hour, I also have others who agree with me on this experience table.<br />
<br />
Also might as well ask how bad is it getting exp in 60 while iam at it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 58 I get about a blue an hour when grouping (so far the only place i've grouped is upper dogs in velks).  I get about a blue and a half in an hour when I'm in my solo whore spot.  Of course, after about two hours in my solo spot i go insane from boredom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">blue an hour is fairly reasonable, depends to a degree if you doing for solely xp or for some loot as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well new CT is very good exp. 1 hour in CT ~= 4 hours in seb.<br />
<br />
Shaman are highly needed in CT since those lizards have to be slowed or they rip you a new one. Also PR/DR is needed b/c of the rain AE's and lizard slow is DR check. You can also cure the slows with your legs freeing up the cleric and or saving yourself a spell slot.<br />
<br />
Dunno how well pickup groups do on your server of course but there are usually 20-35 peeps in CT on my server at any given time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bah, keep hearing not to go into CT until 60. ;/<br />
<br />
btw, where do you LFG for there?  Outside in Ferrott since the entrance isnt' safe to sit in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only reason the entrance would not be safe is if someone trained...just like the old days.<br />
<br />
AoF TO ZONE !!!!!! hahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Blue an hour ok in 58 but what about in 59?<br />
<br />
and why mez at it how about in 60?<br />
<br />
<br />
Like Broder Scurg mez not asking for hunting spots but rather what to expect as &quot;normal&quot; blue bar movement.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zzing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">May I ask where you are hunting for a blue an hour solo at 56+?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hrmm this post didnt end up as I was hoping. <br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zzing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok.  To answer *your* questions..<br />
<br />
A blue an hour in lvl 58+ is quite good!(I was averaging around a blue per 1.5 hours with my wizard)<br />
<br />
A blue an hour in lvl 59 is awesome! xp (I was averaging around a blue per 3-4 hours with my wizard)<br />
<br />
And finally, lvl 60 seemed extremely easy to lvl up compared to the previous lvls 58 and 59.  Somewhere around 1.5 - 2 blues an hour if my memory is correct.<br />
<br />
<br />
My question is where are you hunting to get a blue an hour at lvl 58?<br />
<br />
Would you answer my question please? :)<br />
<br />
If you do not wish to post it, please send it in a private message :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">CT is really good if your the only one not 60 :)<br />
<br />
Once I was in CT Sewers at level 57 a whole day (11 hours.), cause they needed a shaman early in the morning (lucky me). The loot is excellent there. I even got a roll on the FT3 boots that dropped. The mosquito leg earring that goes for around 70k also drop there. Not to mention, I dinged 58 there too. Got about 14 blue bubs of xp.<br />
<br />
Now you are prolly going to ask; did I do a good job or was I merely powerleveled? In fact I did my job as good as any shaman without malo or torpor would do. I had around 3700hp buffed, so that helped alittle as I often got spanked. We had only one wipe, and that was just cause the chanter and me got just a bit too many resists on a big pull(3 mobs). At one time we managed to survive a 3 mob pull even when the chanter pummeled to the ground in less than 3 secs(He tried AE stun, Doh). I admit I had a bit luck with turgurs then and slowed all before anyone else died.<br />
<br />
All in all, CT is excellent even for a non 60 if you know what you are doing. It's just that all groups will prefer a level 60 over a non 60. So you might have to get up early to have a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">for solo I got average about 1 blue per hour for 54-58, I consider it is good exp rate since grouping may take 1.5 hour per blue for good exp group;  59 is 2 time harder so I get about 1 blue every 2 hour for solo; lvl60 is similar to 58 againa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Get a monk partner or warrior or ranger or someone really dont matter what sorta melee u get as long as they are fully committed to exp.  Then go to permafrost basement.  Exp till u get completely sick of it.  WHen yer done you won't believe how much exp u just got.  This is a zone with old world non-caster mobs that aren't too hard and can be single pulled at 57-60.  Only downside is that 3 uber people can kill every mob in there before repops.  2 if they are really uber.  So if its camped yer SoL.  <br />
<br />
The way to get outta basement is to go tag Vox provided she's up.  Just run up the ladders and ramps and drop into her lair . . you'll get a port outta perma before you can blink!</div></div><hr />
