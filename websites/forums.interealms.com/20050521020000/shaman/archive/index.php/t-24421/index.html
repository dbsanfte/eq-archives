<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iso2202</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know for some people getting the GoD runes just kinda... Happened; But for people not in guilds with an abundant amount of capable players on, at the time, GoD was ROUGH. The point in time when I first decided to try to get Geomancy Yiktu to the Second  time I finally looted it from the smoldering corpse of Sludge-Eating Fly... it was an interval of about 5 months of constantly trying to get people to do the sewers; I missed chances of getting Yiktu time and time again, but FINALLY got it with a pretty rag-tag group; Druid, Paladin, Necro, Warrior, Me, and an empty slot where the cleric WAS before he went LD and never came back; Since then I have found Balance of the Nihil to be the best thing since Q; And Balance remains the best slow (In terms of shorter fights) even with all the new OoW stuff. I kinda veered off topic, Gratz!</div></div><hr />
