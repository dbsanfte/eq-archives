<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>keen17</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Jaded Dissent is a close-knit guild of like-minded Everquest players on the Morden Rasp server. Jaded Dissent is what you might call an &quot;old school&quot; Everquest guild. We are limiting ourselves to old world items, zones and content up to and including the Kunark expansion.<br />
<br />
We will progress through the old content of classic Everquest at our own pace. The leadership of Jaded Dissent understands that even EQ players have a real life...and that life should never revolve around the demands of a guild or a video game. We are here to have fun and simply re-live some of the glory days of Norrath's past. <br />
<br />
At the moment, our levels will be capped at 51. We realize that old EQ had a level cap of 50. However, we feel that letting our members go ahead and hit 51 and bank their AAs is the fairest thing to do. When enough of us have hit level 50 and have beaten most of the &quot;end game&quot; content from Original EQ, we will then open our level cap up to 60 and again progress at our own pace through the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Jaded Dissent is NOT and never will be a &quot;power gamer&quot; guild. If you join our ranks, you will not be required to play x amount of hours per day or per week. All that we require is that you play within our set of rules pertaining to content, zones, items and levels and that you treat your guild mates and the rest of the server community with respect. Above all, NO DRAMA will be allowed. This applies to guild chat, /ooc, /shout, etc. We want to earn and keep respect for our unique approach to how we play.<br />
<br />
Jaded Dissent is primarily made up of mature adults, although &quot;mature&quot; doesn't always go hand-in-hand with age. If you are a L337 Do0dZ0r or are concerned with phat lewtz!, I can assure you this is not the guild for you. If you live for raiding all day everyday, this is also not the place for you. We WILL begin raiding on a regular basis as we progress in levels, but we are not a &quot;raiding guild.&quot; <br />
<br />
We realize that the idea of forsaking all the new content available out there in favor of re-living some of the golden years of EQ will not appeal to everyone. In fact, we don't want to appeal to everyone. We want a tight-knit guild of friends who has &quot;been there and done that&quot; and wants to go back and smell the roses that Norrath once had to offer. If this sounds like an adventure you would like to take with us, please stop by the recruiting section and tell us a little bit about yourself. =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>keen17</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">*bump*  Our first wave of recruiting was such a huge sucess that we had to hold on recruiting for a while to settle in with our new members.  Well, after a few fun events and lots of leveling, we are ready to open the doors back up to those interested.  We actually had a waiting list while the doors were closed.  <br />
<br />
This wave of recruitment will be for levels 1-30 of any class with preference given to clerics, rogues, druids, warriors and paladins.  <br />
<br />
Remember, we are looking for mature players who aren't intersted in the power gaming aspect.  We are basically a group of &quot;Oldies-but-Goodies&quot; who have experienced the high end of the game and want to re-live the &quot;olden days&quot; of EQ.  We have found that our guild doesn't appeal to the &quot;younger&quot; crowd or those new to the game and who are interested in quick results instead of smelling the roses.  We are very laid back without any demands on play time.  We are basically here to have fun without the high end/loot baggage that comes along with the uber raiding guilds. <br />
<br />
With that said, if this sounds appealing to you please take a tour of our site www.jadeddissent.com. <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You might want to consider allowing members to hit 52 to give yourselves a better shot at Vox and Naggy.<br />

I like your idea and respect your moxy.</div></div><hr />

Naah. If your point is to run around in banded with FS weapons then yeah, knock yerselves out.<br />
<br />
But if it is to maximize the &quot;fun&quot; potential of old world encounters, then for goodness sakes, give yourselves the best chance at those encounters.<br />
<br />
Trak is gonna be very interesting at 51. I will be very impressed if you take him out.  Same with VS.</div></div><hr />

1.  Not everyone considers minmaxing (like getting maximum level for minimum risk with vox and naggy is) the most fun.<br />
<br />
2.  Trakanon and Venril Sathir are Kunark mobs.  Kunark introduced level 60.  The idea here is to use that phase of the game's standards to defeat that phase of the game's content.<br />
<br />
Most of us are past the point where min/maxing is enjoyable, at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>keen17</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey there, to answer some of the posts above, we opened up kunark so we could have more gear and zone options.  We won't be going after kunark mobs right away, we will be concentrating on naggy/vox and old world content before we move on.  We will probably hit the kunark mobs after we raise the level cap since kunark is at 60 =).</div></div><hr />
