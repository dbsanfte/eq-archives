<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">causal player doesn't have a good definition...  If you think its going to take a long time to level up, and are mostly going to solo I'd probably go troll so you get hp regen and can quest the snare necklace.<br />
<br />
I'd also be tempted by the iksar because of the regen and ac bonus. (though you can't use the infamous jbb ifyou go iksar).<br />
<br />
The stats really dont matter a whole lot.  I picked barbarian because my friends wanted to start characters over on the qeynos side of the world and we already had an eru wizard and a barb warrior ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eltai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I went the path of the Iksar.  I wouldn't turn back....neither would my RL friend who also plays an iksar shaman.  The regen is just sick, especially at lower levels.  Yeah we don't get a spiffy snare necklace &lt;Please note that the spell on the necklace gets resisted a lot in higher end&gt; nor do we get the JBB &lt;Now just a fun toy for some people.....practicality is not what it used to be&gt;.  Iksar also receive much easier than any other race the Iksar Cudgel Quests.  Although it takes a lot of work the 7th Cudgel http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11713 and the 8th Cudgel http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12497.  As you can see the stats are nice and the clickable on the 8th is great as well...The link to the quest beginning is http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=202.  I hope you join the ranks of the iksar shaman....<br />

<br />
2. what is the regen of troll and iksar to begin with and at 65<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Play what attracts your interest, there are no bad shamanic race/class combos.<br />
<br />
Barb - well rounded very common<br />
Ogre: - unstunnable from melle from the front is as close to overpowering as a racial ability gets, rare, can't fit through some doors w/o shrink, exp penalty <br />
Troll: Regen rocks at early levels, nice quests (snare necklace) big exp penalty, rare<br />
Iksar: Regen and AC bonus same exp penalty, forage, uncommon<br />
Vah Shir: Well rounded, safe fall, great quests, semi common<br />
Froglok: not great, not bad, only small shamanic race, good set of quests, will date the age of the toon<br />
<br />
What else do you need to know to find a race that might be fun?<br />
<br />
I absolutely adore Kror, just wish barb shammies weren't so common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The reason I went ogre shaman<br />
<br />
I wanted to be an 800 pound, 10 foot tall character running faster than all those other short races<br />
<br />
Never regretted it, I think I have been stunned less than 30 times over 65 levels and 100aa's :)</div></div><hr />

jbb is a clickable nuke, does about 200-300 or so damage. You can use it at like 46 or something, cost is pretty high. I didn't miss it. <br />
<br />
2. I don't know what the regen is. Sorta sad me being an iksar an all. I used an ikky BP in my early lvls and my regen was kickin' ass!<br />
<br />
3. What is it, 5%? Whatever, in the long run it doesn't matter as all the lvls take a long time.<br />
<br />
But what do I know? The only characters i have over 50 are both Iksars. <br />
<br />
That's because they kick ass!<br />
<br />
Be an Iksar! yea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eltai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">JBB=Jaundiced Bone Bracer, It is right click 8 or 9 sec cast time Winter's Roar<br />
Regen:http://eq.crgaming.com/misc/pages/regen.asp<br />
<br />
Exp penalty I was under the impression was 10% for ogres and Trolls and 20% for Iksar.  Yeah it does add up.  But the abilities that Iksar get are worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">20% xp penalty for trolls too ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
xp penalties<br />

Barb - 5%<br />
Ogre - 15%<br />
Troll and Iksar - 20%</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If I had it to do over again I would go troll all the way. Troll because they can use a JBB and iksar can't. That club quest can be done by anyone, just got to faction some. I choose barbarian and now I look like everyone else. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I choose barbarian and now I look like everyone else. :(<br />
Chain graphic helm and a 2 hander will help.  <br />
I look like a Zerker, but no one plays barb zerkers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I had to do it again, I would go Ogre due to the frontal stun immunity.  Stun immunity is much, much more useful at higher levels than regen, which is of small benefit due to the high regen spells and items you get.<br />
<br />
JBB and troll regen (which is much better than Iksar regen) was amzaing at lower levels though.  I practically leveled with JBB alone from 46-50.  Its a very good amount of free dps at that level range.  <br />
<br />
One problem you'll face with Iksar, is you'll be KoS everywhere. Nobody likes a lizard hehe.  Trolls are much the same, especially since you'll want to pick Innoruk as your deity to get the snare necklace quest.<br />
<br />
Troll:  Highest regen + jbb + night vision + 20% exp penalty<br />
Iksar: good regen + innate AC + cudgel + night vision + 20% xp penalty<br />
Ogre: front stun immunity + night vision +15% xp penalty<br />
Barb: fast leveling, no night vision<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm happy with troll.  Even at 65, I still use the snare necklace.  But, there are many times when stun immunity would have saved my life when tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Barb: fast leveling, no night vision<br />

I think VahShir level faters and I believe they have night vision (cat's should)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes Frogloks have Ultravision...Bear form always drops it to infravision though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What you have listed as &quot;Regular&quot; is actually infravision<br />
Regular is what Barbs, Humans, and erudites have<br />
<br />
You forgot:<br />
Iksar forage, innate swimming and AC bonus<br />
Frog innate swimming <br />
Vah Shir innate Safe fall</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Qeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes Frogloks have Ultravision...Bear form always drops it to infravision though.<br />
I always thought that humans and barbs had regular vision, which was terrible. Iksar trolls, and the like have some sort of better vision so they can see in the dark better. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't pick on who sees best in the dark though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ya...I picked one because they are damn sexy :p<br />
<br />
As opposed to all those hairless apes running around...oh wait I guess Barbs are not that hairless though.<br />
<br />
I tried to convince my guild to set my Public Note as Baker, Alchemist and Supermodel...for some reason they did not go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">For Vah Shir, you missed innate sneak and safe fall.<br />
<br />
Not game breakers, but I have always loved that I can sell and bank places where I am KoS. Safe fall has saved my furry butt a couple of times in 65 levels and 80 aa's, but not enough to worry about. heh.<br />
<br />
Over all, I chose kitty because I liked the look, and I never regretted it.<br />

<br />
Benj</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I probably would have picked kitty or froggie if they had been available at the time.<br />
<br />
I chose barbarian mainly because the penalty wasn't as high and I could travel more easily since I wasn't KOS except in a couple places.  That and I didn't wanna be evil.<br />
<br />
Today there are so many zones to hunt in that faction isn't as big a deal.  <br />
<br />
Pick a race based on what you like and your play style.  Like to solo, consider a troll or iksar.  Want to fight, consider an ogre.</div></div><hr />
