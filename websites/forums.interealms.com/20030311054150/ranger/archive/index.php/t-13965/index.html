<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apachi teh suk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there anyplace to bow-kite for a 55? Or even solo at 55? I just am sick of getting in groups. I have awesome equip for my level (40% haste + a right click Eye Patch of Plunder) Tox axe, a nice bow ect. I just need to find a place to use it. Also, a zone with nice loot would help too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kalvarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If your equipment is truely up to snuff you might be able to take the Geonids in Wakening Lands.  Good solo exp for me at 57 (nothing compared to PoP of course) and the loot is solid (Velious quest gems, vendor jewerly, diamonds, blue diamonds, etc).<br />
<br />
The biggest key there is being able to slow them, if you have Earthcaller or even Swarmcaller if you have non-swifty haste you shouldn't have a problem.  Just root and step back to heal if it gets close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Apachi teh suk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, my gear only outdoes yours in 2 spots or so, plus you are 2 levels higher than me so I dont think I will be able to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bangzoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Stonegrabbers and Sambata tribals (when the Rockhoppers aren't up) in DSP are what I've been bow kiting at 55. <br />
<br />
If you're not KOS to the Sambata, you can just waltz in and grab the dark blues, then run them outside. There are two you will always be KOS to, but it's a cakewalk.<br />
<br />
Oh, and the Gnolls in JPF that don't cast are good for bow kiting, too.<br />
