<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nikkei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The topic says it all, exept that i´m a lvl 65 shaman :)<br />
So im lookin to raise coldainfaction but i dont know where in kael i can take my SK to get the faction up.<br />
<br />
Or is it to early for him, maybe i should grind a couple more lvls on him?<br />
With shamanbuffs and virtue he has 4600 hp and 1100ac, any ideas on other places to hunt would be greatly appreciated, gettin tired of the same old pop zones :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kirenaaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, if yuo're just after faction, I'd concentrate on pulling from EW zone to icehouse (plate cycle area) to the area across from there and kill as many per round as you can. I did it with my 36 paladin and 65 beastlord and got from base faction to high enough to get armour in under 6 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You could hunt at the landing between the nobles, bank and commoner building.  Very safe to pull there...the only tough wanderer (and you don't need to agro) would be the captain Bvellos(sp?) - he's not that tough but naturally he summons and has a whack of hp.<br />
<br />
The other spot you could do is at the top of the ramp that leads to the arena section.  Mobs are a little tougher there - more hp and there's few casters.<br />
Either spots are a good choice unless someone is training from the arena - which at times can be a common occurance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The bank area and up the ramp to the arena.  You can solo it.  Having extra DPS will be really easy.  Use your pup and just pull with slow.  Let it whack on you for  afew till you get agro with SK then keep him healed with Trushar or Qui.  You may get some Stuff to turn in armor in Thurg or you if you already have better let people in zone loot or what ever.  I gave a robe away the last time I was there.  That was one happy Magi = )</div></div><hr />

If you are a 65 Shaman &amp; moderately equipped it is my experience that you can pretty much survive anywhere in Kael except for Vindi &amp; the AoW cycle mobs.  I typically fight my way to the Arena solo, starting from the EW zoneline.  On the greenies I generally don't even slow them - I just cast Blood of Saryrn &amp; sic dogdog, then keep moving to the next mob.  Be sure to loot all the giant warrior helms &amp; frost/storm giant toes for faction turn-ins later.  Anything light or dark blue should be slowed. :) <br />
<br />
Honestly if you are duoing I wouldn't even bother with the plate cycle area or mobs by the bank. Head straight to the Arena instead, and just kill &amp; move everything there that you see.  Remember that most of these giants are rootable, so as long as you don't damage them they aren't going to summon you if you park 'em.  In the arena, pull with Malos from max range, then sic dogdog while you are casting Turgur's.<br />
<br />
If you have more hp than your SK, I'd just treat him like another pet. :D   Don't forget to alpha both your pet and the SK's with mage toys, they make a big difference on your DPS.<br />
<br />
Be sure to inform your friends and guildmates to move their twinks over to Kael, and park them there to loot the NO DROP pieces.  Believe me, you will rapidly fill your inventory with that junk otherwise (or it will just rot).<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You should be able to kill pretty much all coldain faction giving giants from EW side to the little village (opposite the giant fisherman) in one respawn. Still seems coldain faction is the slowest to raise.</div></div><hr />
