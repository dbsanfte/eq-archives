<br />
The irony of the cleric thread against shaman receiving a bigger patch heal is very evident in the druid thread where druids are arguing for improved healing.<br />
<br />
Clerics are very very very territorial about thier healing monopoly.<br />
Yet its painfully evident that Shaman, Druids, and Clerics are NOT well balanced.<br />
<br />
Clerics on Raids are a HUGE problem.  You want 2-3 minimum clerics per druid/shaman.  I bet on most raids you have 5/6 clerics per shaman even.  We had 14/72 Clerics on our first Quarm Kill.  2 of which were brought in to sit other people in a full raid.  Why is it clerics are so so much important to the raid then any other priest.  Why is it if enough clerics don't log in that day, guilds call XP.  Why is it almost every upper end guild has cleric recruitment listed as &quot;permantly open&quot;?<br />
<br />
Another problem is that against upper level content.  Clerics are far far too required.  You want to do a Vexx/Tipt/Kod+ run you MUST have a cleric.  95% of all LDON Hard Groups won't go without a cleric either.<br />
Even in elemental Groups with high hps tanks where a druid (Maybe Maybe Shaman) can get by.... even here the healing is so so less efficient that the groups XP would go up if you replaced the healer with a cleric.<br />
<br />
Clerics usually combat this arguement and say well in LDON normal, and other lower content, Shaman/Druid heals are sufficient.  And since sufficient +other abilities, they are vastly better than Clerics here.<br />
While this might be true of bottom feeders (Time Groups doing LDON Normal) it is not true for the average bazaar joe in BOT.<br />
<br />
Clerics also tend to combat this arguement by saying that the other priests (Shaman/Druid) have way more utility then them.  Druids have Evacs/Ports/Snare/DPS.  Shaman have Malos/Slow/CC<br />
<br />
What clerics refuse to recognize is that the other priests have &quot;lost ground&quot; in thier other core areas.  <br />
<br />
Druid's have lost a lot of utility over the expansions.  Sow/Soe/Porting is not the advantage it once was with books/camps/aas/horses.  Evac is almost useless in the GOD Crawls.  You think a group wants to crawl through tipt for 2 hours and evac at the end to do it again?  snare is just too common really.  And Druid are NOT DPS classes like they once were.  Druids would be among the lowest sustained DPS classes of the 15 classes.  Druids simply put are NOT getting slots when its &quot;Group looking for DPS.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Shaman's likewise have lost a lot of ground in their area speciality CC.<br />
The addition of another slowing class (Bst), Slow mitigation have made having a Shaman to slow not as necessary as it once was.  Almost all groups due to slow immunity/mitigation + charm + mez will prefer a chanter to handle CC by a huge margin.  As such many groups are looking for a Slower, are starting to be looking for Chanter, or on lower end content a BST (since they slow enough + dps)<br />
<br />
Clerics have also refused to acknowledge that while Shaman/Druids have lost utility/advantage in other areas.  They have consistantly picked up advantages.  Ranging from the difficulty of CR making Rez required in GOD.  to the fix of Pacify which can make them a good puller.<br />
<br />
I am honestly not against Clerics getting some more dps/tricks for trivial content.  So they can contribute more at lower ends of the game.<br />
However, they so dominate raids and upper end content in a way that is far from healthy to the game.   Most guilds are even looking at preferred combo for Ikky Trial as Clr/Clr.  not even Dru or Shm for backup, but a 2nd cleric.<br />
<br />
All in all, all the priest classes are out of whack.  <br />
Druids need thier 64 ICH fixed in Mana Cost as 600 is insane.  They need to be closer to Clerics in spots so that they are roughly 80%ish.<br />
<br />
Shamans need thier 64 ICH back.  They too need a better direct heal.<br />
<br />
Clerics on the other hand need something else to spend thier mana on vs trivial content.  Some contribution that a group will want them roughly equallly to the shaman or druid when healing is sufficient.</div></div><hr />

I say let's give 'em disease dots equal to ours if they want them.  I have nothing against allowing a class the ability to solo if they want to.  Hand them something equiv. to Breath of Ultor, Pox of Bert, and whatever the new one we just got is - heck, give 'em a full line of 120 second dots all their own with a built in resist debuff.  I'm cool with that if it means I can at least keep a group alive as a secondary healer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I'm pretty sure druids aren't hurting for DPS output, I'm absolutely not against clerics getting something for fun if that's what it takes to improve our healing or DPS (or some other new thing).<br />

<br />
You all think more deeply about the game mechanics than any other group I have seen represented on the net.  <br />
<br />
And why in the heck is Corlathist's rep box gray?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There is a valid point to clerics worrying about too much improved healing for Shaman and Druids.  Pre-GoD, clerics aren't really as useful in a group as either of the other two priests.<br />
<br />
The druid fast heal should be a result of the turn-in in Kod'Taz (maybe it is, hell if I know) and likewise shaman should get a 1650-1700hp heal from their turn-in.  BoT should replace the useless DR DoT.<br />
<br />
This would put the upgraded heals in the hands of those that really do need them when they need them.<br />
<br />
In addition, SOE really needs to re-evaluate these single group trials.  The named mobs in Vxed and Tipt should probably be tuned down SLIGHTLY so that they are more reasonable to tank by a knight OR by a warrior with just one cleric and no backup healer.  <br />
<br />
Ikkinz needs some serious re-evaluation IMO.  Single group trials are much to reliant on massive healing and super tanks.  Meanwhile the Ikkinz Raids are relatively a joke.  This is ass-backwards.  The trials should be difficult, but not impossible with a knight tanking or with a druid main healing(perhaps with a shaman backup).  As is, this isn't the case (barring perfect execution and a fair bit of luck).  i.e. If I have a Time level Paladin tank, I should be able to complete the single group trials with a Druid and Shaman in group.  Between the Paladin, Druid, and Shaman I should be able to compensate for the lack of a cleric.  Similarly, I should be able to get by with just a cleric and the paladin or an SK.  With a Warrior, their mitigation bonus and discipline should fill the gap left by not having a paladin able to patch himself.<br />
<br />
The raids that I've seen in Ikkinz so far were far from impressive.  Boring is the word that comes to mind mostly.  I must admit I've only seen the first two Ikkinz raids so far, but from the bits and pieces I've heard all the raids are pretty damned easy when you compare them to the difficulty of the single group trials.<br />
<br />
A suggestion I'd make to SOE:<br />
If you are designing encounters and have decided beforehand that said encounters should be challenging to a guild at X level in the game, Then get people from an actual play guild at that level in the game and invite them to playtest the encounters for you.  To be balanced, take groups from several guilds at that level and get all their input.  Open Beta based on who happens to be online when you announce to check the website is useless.  Refine your beta test and you could easily avoid the majority of these post release problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Disagree with augs being the fix for shaman problems. Disagree with the spells needed to bring shaman back in line as both priests and viable healers dropping only on high end GoD encounters.<br />
<br />
GoD is the pinnacle ... the peak ... that highlights the downward spiral shaman have taken as a class with XX abilities and XX skills requiring a game design that no longer exists.<br />
<br />
Step back and focus. The argument that shaman can heal effectively in LDoN normal is a misleading. A 65 shaman should be able to heal effectively in LDoN normal. They are priests. Can they heal as efficiently as a druid? Can they heal as efficiently as a cleric? No to both. The only thing that allows them to heal is being able to either slow the mob first or chain cast inferior heals ... sometimes both. The gap is still there between the amount and efficiency between shaman healing and druid/cleric. There should be a significant gap between cleric and shaman healing; no argument there. Closer in line with druid, given content change (mitigated/unslowable mobs) is necessary.<br />
<br />
Lastly, can a 50-60 shaman fill the same role in a group of peers? Can that 50-60 shaman be main healer in LDoN normal? No. They do not have the healing tools and their other duties, required at these levels, will not allow them to keep up with mana requirements. Yet a 50-60 shaman is still a priest class ... with even greater limitations when compared to clerics and at the higher end of the spectrum (58-60) with druids. Keep the focus, shaman problems as a priest class are not just faced by 65 shaman.<br />
<br />
The advent of slow mitigation and unslowable mobs negates the class imposed balance of slow + reduced healing = unslowed + cleric/druid CH/superior blast heals. There is no getting around that. Shaman cannot compete when the criteria for doing their job as designed has been removed from the game causing shaman to not be able to do their job.<br />
<br />
This did not happen in GoD. It began in PoP. GoD has taken it to the extreme. Yet, just dealing with it in the extreme cases does nothing to bring shaman back inline as an effective healer. It is part of what a shaman is ... a priest.<br />
<br />
Here is where I am confused about perception. Once a mob is slowed then my heals can effectively maintain the tank for the fight (I know, somewhat of a generalization here.) If the mob cannot be slowed, my heals cannot keep up. Cleric heals can. With the exception of GoD, druid heals can also keep up on an unslowed mob. Mine can't. As a priest class I cannot perform a base function of my class in a setting where other classes can not only do it but do it well. The key to the encounter is the unslowability of the mob. Game design prevents me from doing one of my jobs (slowing) while also preventing me from adapting and adjusting to the situation (healing) to recover. How is this not nerfing?<br />
<br />
My goal, request, insistant stance is this: give me the tools to do the job my class definition claims I can do. I am a priest, let me heal enough to be a priest. Not THE PRIEST - that is cleric. A priest - like druid, relatively speaking.<br />
<br />
This balances shaman in direct relation to the nerf shaman incurred when slow mitigation and total unslowability were introduced. Shaman are not asking for something new. We are explaining the effect of game design on a class and defining what the fix for that change is. How simpler can it get?<br />
<br />
Changes to balance shaman in abilities as a priest since PoP are on the table. Not just GoD high end content. PoP changes affected shaman negatively without compensation. There is no way that negative change can be called class balance. It was added to enhance game content. That the enhancement simply causes druids and clerics to revamp tactics (read: cast heals more often) while negating shaman healing further simply highlights the unequal balance between the 3 priest classes.<br />
<br />
That shaman who reach 65 can satisfactorily heal in early PoP zone encounters (BoT the most common zone) does not mean shaman healing is balanced. It means they are too high to be in those zones ... but that is where the xp is. That is where everyone grinds aaxp. Clerics are there too and if you talk to them, rarely ... rarely ... are they putting a dent in their mana pool while maintaining healing. Why? Because a prerequisite in a BoT group is ... a slower in the group.<br />
<br />
Shaman, as main healers/debuffers/slowers in the same encounters are cast and canni fools ... as it has always been. So don't presume because we &quot;can&quot; fill a main healer role in BoT that we are comparable healers to druids or clerics. Presume instead that the content is trivial for a group of lvl 65s grinding out aaxp.<br />
<br />
Once again folks ... don't lose the focus and think only in terms of GoD content and finding a spot there. The problems go deeper and those problems are about class balance swinging away from shaman based on game design changes we have not been compensated for in a return to ability as a priest class. There is nothing in the changes being asked for that negatively affect either druid or clerics.<br />
<br />
/boggles me that the simplicity of the shaman argument flies so high above the heads of so many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sciek, the trouble with that idea is that an encounter that is challenging for a knight MT would probably be trivial for a warrior MT, likewise one that was challenging for a druid or shaman healer would be trivial for a cleric healer. That being the case, people would simply use those classes to pass everyone through the trials, like they do at the moment, the only difference being that they would do it in a week instead of a month, and you would have a whole lot more people doing it. The only way to balance something like that would be do give different trials to different class make-ups, and that would involved a tremendous amount of development work on the part of the producers. That in turn would result in far less content, and people would be screaming about being ripped off. Not only that, balancing stuff like that would be extremely difficult, and would result in some classes getting easier encounters than others, ie we would be in exactly the same situation as now. Again, people would be screaming that Sony hates class X, no developers have ever played class X, class X has been stealth nerfed, all the usual stuff.<br />
<br />
Part of the basic design of a high end expansion is to place a succession of more difficult obstacles in place so that people can progress into the content without finishing it in a week. As things stand these encounters are designed for groups to do. Last time I looked any class could join these groups. You just have to develop a strat that works for you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Someone in the cleric thread did have one good idea though: have significant druid/shaman only healing focus augs drop in KT or early Ikkiniz (have it type 8 just to make sure as well).

<br />
<br />
Helping 10-15% of the population that all suffer from the same problems does not, in my book, clasify as balance or as a viable solution toa problem.  If anything, higer end shaman (elemental/time+) suffer less of a problem than the great majority of the class because of superior itemization.  The insane amount of focus effects and straight out +mods on elemental/time equipment makes a big difference in the abilities of a shaman.<br />
<br />
But what about the shaman that are in Bazaar gear or slightly better?  What about the shaman that do not have access to the Focus effects because of limmited play time, small guilds, and small bank accounts?  Do they not face the same problems with healing  and overall effectiveness that the uberest of ubers do?  Of course they do.  They face the same problems without 15FT, Kodiaks hightened Focus, Marr's gift, Conservation of Mith, MP4, IH4,  and the slew of mana regen effects that is slathered all over Time gear.  Many dont have the hundreds of AA's that can make a HUGE difference in shaman abilities.<br />
<br />
I am one of those Bazaar shaman.  I am unguilded, and unlikely to join a raiding guild because my work schedule (12 hour days Mon-thursday) is not conducive to raiding.  I have all my spells except malos because of the extreme generosity of a few friends that ARE in the elemental guilds where the Glyphs rot picked up a gouple for me.  My mana pool is of meduim size (3.5K), and I can function as a really crappy main healer in tier 1 and some teir 2 zones.  LDoN I have tried, and every time I usually get a few people killed because my 1300 fast heal is too small and my &quot;big&quot; (f**cking hillarious) Ich is too slow and too small.  Quiscience is nice as a self heal but not big enough to be of serious use to tanks, though it works ok on casters.  The &quot;upgrade&quot; to Q is a spell that I shall never see, and it seems doubtfull at this point that we as a class shall be seeing any serious upgrade to out direct heal.<br />
<br />
So yes, trying to fix broken things through rare drops in upper end zones will help salve the problems of the lucky few that have the time, resourses, and ability to get them.  Meanwhile, the bulk and majority of the class will still suffer the same problems and voice the same complaints, only to have those that have recieved the upgrades to already fabulous gear tell us that things are fine and we are whiny.<br />
<br />

No - not if said encounter involves more then a single MOB and/or involves something else then just melee DPS. That is exactly the problem in GoD. It is all melee DPS, all single MOBs, for 99% of the entire expansion. Of course warriors shine in those situations.<br />
<br />
likewise one that was challenging for a druid or shaman healer would be trivial for a cleric healer.<br />
With the healing disparity being what it is this is not a surprise. Of course if knights could tank these encounters and clerics could keep them up then maybe a warrior could be kept up by a druid.<br />
As is a druid + shaman team cannot outheal a cleric. When you need 2+ clerics on a defensive warrior in some of these encounters it is not surprising that you cannot make do with a druid in the group.<br />
<br />
That being the case, people would simply use those classes to pass everyone through the trials, like they do at the moment, the only difference being that they would do it in a week instead of a month, and you would have a whole lot more people doing it. The only way to balance something like that would be do give different trials to different class make-ups, and that would involved a tremendous amount of development work on the part of the producers.<br />
Or, heavens forbid, just put varied content in the same zone. Currently MOBs scale by DPS and by slowability. Thats not a whole lot of variance.<br />
<br />
That in turn would result in far less content, and people would be screaming about being ripped off. Not only that, balancing stuff like that would be extremely difficult, and would result in some classes getting easier encounters than others, ie we would be in exactly the same situation as now.<br />
That is just silly. Even if some classes had it half as hard as others the content would be more balanced then now. When you need a warrior and two clerics and an enchanter and at least one pure DPS class in a one group encounter said encounter cannot be balanced.<br />
This is not even a case of class unbalance. You need the best tank+2 of the best healer - that means you could instead get by with a knight and about 6 druids, except that you can only bring 6 people. Simply rebalancing content would go a long way towards rebalancing classes.<br />
<br />
Again, people would be screaming that Sony hates class X, no developers have ever played class X, class X has been stealth nerfed, all the usual stuff.<br />
And people do not do that now? Have you looked at knight boards recently?<br />
<br />

What strategy do you propose for killing a single extremely hard hitting unslowable MOB who has enough HPs to outlast riposte disciplines?<br />

There is no way to deal with it but healing+tanking and using the rest of the group's spot for damage.</div></div><hr />

At the level of gear we are talking about making adjustments for you do LDoN normals in 15 minutes, beastlords or rangers can heal in them and clerics are better DPS then rogues because they can cast AE spells.<br />

You simply cannot balance classes on challenging content and expect them to remain balanced on trivial content.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying that any old knight should be able to tank the trials with whatever cleric comes along.  It'd be quite possible to make these mobs challenging for a knight/cleric combo and keep the challenge there for a warrior/cleric combo as well, albeit the warrior would obviously tank better.<br />
<br />
Think outside the DPS box.  procs aren't mitigated, hence lowering the melee DPS and adding Procs that put spikes in makes a mob difficult for anyone to tank.  The warrior still has a bonus due to his better ac/hp and mitigation bonus as well as disciplines but it's not so massively tilted.  Procs also make the fight less predictable thus making it more interesting.  You could use AEs to increase the challenge as well.  There are a lot of different ways that you could make these single group trials VERY difficult for the ideal group combo and still doable for the non-perfect, non-trinity groups.  THAT was what I was getting at. ;)</div></div><hr />

Defensive hasn't been nerfed. Mobs don't &quot;hit through&quot; defensive, it doesn't work like that (the 5% mitigation bonus that warriors get works in exactly the same way as defensive btw - thats why max hit is lower for warriors than other classes). There are some scenarios where evasive is more effective (where you have a high relative min hit, or where the mob atk is low enough that it min hits most of the time for example). If your tank is knowledgeable they might know which disc is more appropriate. If a warrior can't tank it, a knight is going to get pulverized, and what is doable for a knight would be trivial for a disced warrior (from a tanking perspective). There are not many scenarios where a knight would be superior to a warrior against a named target, the only one that springs to mind would be a situation where a mob was procing a single target slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Heh, I knew I wasn't stating my proposition clearly enough.  I'm not saying that any old knight should be able to tank the trials with whatever cleric comes along.  It'd be quite possible to make these mobs challenging for a knight/cleric combo and keep the challenge there for a warrior/cleric combo as well, albeit the warrior would obviously tank better.<br />
<br />
Think outside the DPS box.  procs aren't mitigated, hence lowering the melee DPS and adding Procs that put spikes in makes a mob difficult for anyone to tank.  The warrior still has a bonus due to his better ac/hp and mitigation bonus as well as disciplines but it's not so massively tilted.  Procs also make the fight less predictable thus making it more interesting.  You could use AEs to increase the challenge as well.  There are a lot of different ways that you could make these single group trials VERY difficult for the ideal group combo and still doable for the non-perfect, non-trinity groups.  THAT was what I was getting at. ;)<br />
<br />
Don't quote me on it, I'm not sure, but I think NPC procs (unlike PC procs) are dependant on weapon hits. They can't be mitigated, but they can be avoided (using evasive or by slowing a mob for example). In most scenarios a warrior would still be a lot better than a knight. And I think that is true for most healing and CC based encounters too, making them more complicated in fact favors the specialist classes more so than the diversified ones, as they have more specialized and powerful tools to deal with the situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">As for itemization....<br />
<br />
NO.  not unless it was something automatic.<br />
IE you kill tipt boss and a vendor mob spawns with healing all/all aug<br />
or spell.<br />
<br />
Having to camp for balance on the whim of random = no thanks.<br />
Having to proove you are at the level of the game requiring this = chintzy but livable.<br />
<br />
That would be fine. It would have to be some sort of named in a Kodtaz event, or in Ikkiniz (IK is probbaly more appropriate, since you can force someone to actually do the even themselves in order to loot it). <br />
A trial like Tipt is simply too easy once you know the tricks. Hell, the nameds in there could probably be tanked by naked toons wielding decent weapons if the proper strat was followed ;). I think that would be appropriate since, if I understand what the ubers are saying, shaman, and to a lesser extent druid, healing is largely irrelevant in KT+ due to the massive dps from mobs there. That would correct that issue but at the same time not unbalance content for folk in earlier stages of game development. I suppose that you could equally well do it with a spell rather than an aug (both would work though), as long as the spell was similarly difficult to obtain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Helping 10-15% of the population that all suffer from the same problems does not, in my book, clasify as balance or as a viable solution toa problem. If anything, higer end shaman (elemental/time+) suffer less of a problem than the great majority of the class because of superior itemization. The insane amount of focus effects and straight out +mods on elemental/time equipment makes a big difference in the abilities of a shaman.<br />

          Ubber don't understand (don't want mostly) ,that if they can heal ,it's because it's trivial for them. I can't heal on ldon hard (well some mob but no way all the mission) ,but if i had potime gear ,oh well may be it would be very easy . And no way hard ldon are designed for potime gear... And it's the same for all thing ,if we can heal ,it's because it's trivial for our group(and us).</div></div><hr />

Sure LDON content is trivial to a LOT of people.   And balance isn't on trivial content.<br />
<br />
But clerics do need some more things to do in groups where they are facing trivial content.</div></div><hr />

Why would they? Since anyone can cover healing with only a fraction of their capabilities you are doing damage. Druid damage shields become pretty nice when you have 6 MOBs in camp. Clerics outnuke us, Druids outnuke us, and DoT spells are just silly on 10 second MOBs.<br />
And both clerics and druids have AE nukes - and pulling trains is about the only way of making LDoN normals fun if they are trivial for you.<br />
<br />

What more do they need to do then being able to outdamage rogues? Not that I would mind giving clerics something more to do on LDoN normals, but why would they want to stop nuking for 7600 a shot?<br />
<br />
Sure, if you are going to pull singles on trivial content clerics are going to be bored - just like everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I hope they give us better heals so we can replace clerics in ALL content...even raids.  Then they can just switch all clerics to shaman and discontinue the cleric class.  If we were interchangeable with clerics nobody would ever group with a cleric again.  Why group with a class that can only heal if you could group with a class that can heal and do many other things...<br />
<br />
Have you that want to be able to heal as well as clerics ever considered just abandoning your shaman and starting a cleric?  Probably not.  And why is that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. No. No and no. We do not want to replace clerics. We want to be able to function as backup healers in GoD. Can you see the difference between those two functions? There's quite a gap between a 1550 heal+460HoT and the healing package that clerics bring. <br />
<br />
Some shaman would like all priests to be interchangeable in a group setting. Interchangeability goes both ways, think about that before you reply. If the heal upgrades we receive render clerics undesirable in GoD due to lack of secondary non-healing cleric abilities then that is a cleric vs content problem that needs fixing. Not a shaman problem. You don't keep one class on quasi life support by keeping another dead. Same goes for old content to a lesser extent.<br />
<br />
However, I will personally eat my original EQ box, including the manual (not the staples tho) and post pictures of me doing it, if the heals we receive put clerics in such a position as to be unwanted group members in GoD before the expansion has been conquered.</div></div><hr />
