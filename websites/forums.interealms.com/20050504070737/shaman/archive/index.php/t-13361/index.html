<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beoldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I quit playing the game about 2 years ago.  I started up again the last weekend in April.  I am currently level 52, and have been since I started playing again.<br />
<br />
I was really excited that my pet was stronger after my long hiatus.  Every one I summoned (using the level 49 spell) was dark blue to me.  Since the April 30th patch/mini-patch (I don't remember the exact day), every pet I've summoned has conned light blue.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed the same thing.  I thought that pet summons were fixed in level, but maybe they changed something I'm not aware of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a while back they made it so that no matter what pets where the highest lvl, no more needing to chain summon to get the good on.<br />
<br />
so yeah you just havent been around</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you even read his question, Thrall? hehe<br />
<br />
I hadn't noticed my pet being lower level since the April 30th patch, but then again, I haven't tried conning him.  Could be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have you leveled since then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beoldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was level 52 both before and after the most recent patch.  Dark blue pet before, light blue pet since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So level to 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pet is now light blue at 56, at least it was a couple days ago, I accidently conned him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mmm, at level 41 the 39 pet is now light blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well the only time my pet con blue  to me was when I got the lvl 61 pet spell.<br />
<br />
Other than that, all the pets prior to this was LB or green to me. Not was was blue heh.<br />
<br />
Too bad that even our lvl 58 pet is not a match for green mobs without our help.<br />
<br />
Oh well, lucky I can tank well lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lethis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It has been my experience with every pet up to the level 55 one that they con light blue after the level you get them. I.E. the 34 pet cons lightblue at 35, the 39 cons lightblue at 40, etc. Although, the level 55 pet cons lightblue at 55. /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have never had a DB pet.  Every pet I have ever summoned has been LB.  This over the course of a year playing a shaman.  I never re-summoned to try to get good pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This is currently seems broken, and/or changed to scale with the player.  My baby necro constantly summoned even con pets at 12, and again at 13 (dblu after 13).  <br />
<br />
They originally said that it would summon the highest pet we could, scaling it by level kinda makes sense.</div></div><hr />
