what next clerics get turgurs as an aa ? divine malo ? wow, we get no new abilities besides a new pet swarm and some pet crits to our GIMP pet.<br />

Probably because they just copied the entire listing and haven't changed it?  Hell it may not even buff the same things when they are done with it.  Its most likely just a set of place holder information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally I think divine avatar should be a targetable divine aura spell....<br />

18 seconds of complete immunity for the target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think this is already a cleric class AA:<br />
<br />
Bestow Divine Aura: (1 skill level - cost 6 skill points) - This ability gives the Cleric the power to cast the spell Divine Aura on another character without the memorization of a spell or the expenditure of mana. The Refresh Timer for this ability is 144 minutes (two days of game time).<br />
<br />
Pennyantics - do not use punctionation/spacing and other tricks to circumvent the language filters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Correct Gloriana, although it's about as popular on the list of cleric AAs as Rabid Bear is on ours tbh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Unfortunatley i hold no hope for usefull aa's to the shaman class with the new expansion.  I hope to hell i'm wrong.  But in the end we will get the shaft and sony dosnt care.  I predict beastlords getting a very nice upgrade and taking over some of our duties, ie) healing spells, dots, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The simple fact is, and its been stated by absor smash (or some other SoE person, I forget), that SoE considers the shaman class balanced.   Many posts here contain pages of l00k h0\/\/ ub3r w3 4r3 fanboy crap flaming everyone who points out how marginalized the class has become.  Sony reads this and thinks, well, lets just give them more of the same since they are so balanced and adjust other classes up a notch.  <br />
<br />
Cleric's won't get avatar.  The devs are not that silly.  Of course if they had to buff something that lasted 6-9 minutes with a one minute recast, they would hate it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Apparently its self only Avatar which is not so bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm totally fine with clerics getting a self-only avatar.<br />
<br />
Makes good sense, and it's a creative way to up their melee, which is also fine.  Although I wish we would get a double attack AA or something though....  It's not like it would make our melee matter or anything. <br />
<br />
I would like a group FA; otherwise, the more they offload FA the better.  Casting it all the time sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It has to be either self only, or just plain wrong in spell.dat.<br />
<br />
There is no precedent for Clerics getting a massive ATK, let alone stat buff even.<br />
<br />
That would be like giving COTH to Rangers in an AA out of left field, its just not consistent with the other things the class has gotten/done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've looked through the listings of the AA's that have been floating around.  And I must say that Im very disappointed.  As I've said before and someone else said here, the Class has had its heyday.  Our last upgrade was in Kunark, with an honorable (maybe) mention in Velious.  Since then, its been the same old same old.  Outrageously high mana costs because of our mana regen (which isnt NEARLY as spectacular now as it once was, even with Cannibalize AA), gimped healing (because of our slow, which in 70% of encounters is now mitigated to a degree) and no upgrades in power/ability above what we were handed over 2 years ago with Velious.<br />
<br />
I'm just glad Im having fun with my cleric and rogue ATM, because while I still love Thor and the shaman class it has become very disheartening to log into him every day.  At least hes good at farming cash for my twinks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree that needs to be self only to make sense.  As a self-only buff, I don't really think Divine Aura is out of left field for clerics.<br />
<br />
It's consistent with the attempts to develop secondary roles for clerics through melee damage with their hammers.  Upping their melee through Avatar is a way to increase the dps in a controlled manner without monkeying around with adjusting more fundamental aspects of cleric ability.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully it won't be too gimped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Can we start a petition for a FA button for us already? And grp quiesence of 500 a tic? And something useful? Maybe then we wouldnt gripe when others get upgrades heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Did you also notice that there are 3 spells?<br />
Divine Avatar<br />
Divine Avatar II<br />
Divine Avatar III<br />
<br />
All with the same stats.<br />
<br />
It's still a bit early to be getting bent out of shape over nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. Either make FA 100x less tedious to maintain (like the ranger ATK buff line) or give every class the Divine Avatar AA. If I never cast FA in its current incarnation again it will be too soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There is no precedent for Clerics getting a massive ATK, let alone stat buff even.<br />
<br />
Actually, there is. The Yaulp line starts as an AC + Str buff, then becomes an ATK + Str buff, and finally evolves into an ATK + Dex + Haste + Mana regen buff. Level 65 Yaulp VI is 60 ATK, 90 Dex, 30% haste, and 12 mana/tick regen. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think it's probably bogus info in the database. If it does go live as a cleric ability, well whatever happens happens.</div></div><hr />

If you want to let our class-defining abilities get raped from us, and then sit on raids all day just casually tossing in a velium strike, you can go for it. The only fun I get out of everquest is the satisfaction of knowing I contributed to a raid or a group, made them kill faster, more efficiently, and with less fatalities.<br />
<br />
I'll defend every ability our class gets, regardless of how &quot;annoying&quot; it is to maintain. Shamaning is already easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree with your sentiment in general, I think in this case your anger is misplaced.<br />
<br />
There's no skill in maintaining an FA rotation. It's just pure, unbridled tedium brought on by the long recast and short duration of the spell. Keeping FA up all the time won't make you a good shaman (but it is part of being one). I'd rather not have my skill as a shaman defined by my ability to use a stopwatch, though.<br />
<br />
The Avatar line has already been whored out in so many ways, anyway. Primal and prismatic weapons. The BL Ferocity line is similar to but better than the Avatar line in any case. This ability just isn't that unique to shaman anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Cleric's won't get avatar. The devs are not that silly.<br />
Sithrax just pointed out the BST spell Ferocity and I'll make another mention of it.  The spell is better than FA.  Never underestimate the gall or stupidity of SOE.<br />
<br />
That being said I think it's a little early for the flames.  Let's see what happens when it's live.  Personally I won't be buying GoD, but it has nothing to do with this (or any other) upcoming feature.  We don't know the specifics of the AA as it stands now, and even if we did it's subject to change before (and even after) release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Clerics will get it, sony IS that stupid.<br />
<br />
And again the shm lines blure...<br />
<br />
Can we at least get something related to being master slowers?  Like a unresistable slow?  Theres already slow immune mobs in game.  And make it uncurable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">wish this was avatar for them, casting avatar sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">on a serious note..Do you ever have anything positive to say Penny?  Every post I see from you is nothing but a rant/whine fest about class envy. &quot;/cry Clerics get an atk buff, Imma gonna delete myself&quot;. Maybe that ain't such a bad idea heh<br />
<br />
I understand that you enjoy playing your shaman, really I do...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'd encourage you to do a little more snooping around my post history - I make plenty of positive posts. Of course there has been a frenzy of negative ones associated with this excuse for an expansion pack. I'm just tired of having no representation at sony, you should be too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">PA - Wildaar is a BL.  He doesn't need any more luv from Sony. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why?  He's a beastlord, the golden children of EQ - even over paladins and bards!  <br />
<br />
:p<br />
<br />
Anyway, the more they offload this ability, the happier I'll be.  Rebuffing folks every 9 minutes over and over and over is not what being a shaman used to be about.  <br />
<br />
Clerics having a self-only buff form makes perfect sense to me in the vision of clerics they are trying to create.  The more they increase a secondary role of some sort for clerics, the easier it is to justify healing increases for other classes.<br />
<br />
Clerics need to be fun to play, like any class, and not reduced to cheal buffbot drone status.  They need more flexibility, and a little less specialization.  <br />
<br />
Just a bit, but enough to matter.  <br />
<br />
This change impacts shaman not at all.  Zero.  You guys cast FA on clerics?  I don't.  <br />
<br />
It's a perfectly legitimate and smart change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Clerics already got a huge melee improve with their summoned hammer, yaulp and bash skill.<br />
<br />
Did the other priest got an inch for their melee ? No... but they don't really needed it as they are able to solo without and the clerics needed it imo.<br />
<br />
Now Clerics got some kind of Avatar, not really my prob in some way but...<br />
<br />
if it's not self only, I wonder why it's an AA when we are stuck with a spell to MEMORIZE. In this case, the only Avatar response I will do will be : &quot;ask the clerics, no spell gem for FA&quot;. Anyway we have more cleric in the guild than Shaman so more Avatar avaible for melees :p.<br />
<br />
If it's self only, as Lucy show it, it's an aa with a 1 minute recast. So Cleric got a HUGE melee self AA every minute and we are still stuck with our HUGE melee self AA every 2 hours ???<br />
<br />
Do you still think it's a &quot;perfectly legitimate and smart change&quot; ? Me not.  :mad: <br />
<br />
Giving Avatar to clerics doesn't bother me honestly, but this way ? It's unacceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Correct Gloriana, although [bestow divine aura] about as popular on the list of cleric AAs as Rabid Bear is on ours tbh.<br />
<br />
Dumb clerics then. My old guild, most of the clerics had BDA, and used it to great effect in a whole variety of circumstances. It is tremendously better than rabid bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Agreed, BDA insta casts, its very useful indeed, has saved my clrs hide several times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Apparently its self only Avatar which is not so bad.<br />
<br />
Fudge that. I am sick of requests from meleeing clerics for infusion, haste and whatnot so that they can melee with their hammers (oops, look how late that last cheal was on the MT). <br />
<br />
There is absolutely NO reason for clerics to get any form of avatar from a game standpoint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">What I found really funny were the clerics that wanted to be able to double attack too. <br />
<br />
They're already better at melee then us because of they're little hammer and some of them want more? <br />
<br />
Just for fun I've been meleeing with both my shaman and cleric lately. <br />
<br />
Shaman using avatar + SoV + 41% haste item and Delightful orb was doing about 12 DPS including procs.<br />
<br />
Cleric with Yaulp 6 was doing about 30 DPS including procs.</div></div><hr />
