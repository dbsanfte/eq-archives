<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i am nearly 51 and due to the genorosity of a friend who has quit EQ and now i have 18k....<br />
<br />
The gear i have is ok i would say<br />
<br />
Huth's Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148754) <br />
<br />
I have created an alternative profile as to what i was thinking of getting, i am trying to spread it as far as possible and from current bazaar prices i can afford the items in the profile and have some changed and a few items to sell...and maybe have another 4k on top of the 18.<br />
<br />
The REIF in my inv isn't so that can't be sold..<br />
<br />
Anyway let me know what you think, the advice on this board has always been second to none and i am glad its back up.<br />
<br />
Cheers  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say your gear is pretty good for level 50, actually. You have some nice +hp items, which is good.<br />
<br />
My advice is that the best single item you can get with that cash is a horse/drogmor. It's a lot of money, but you won't believe the difference it makes until you try it.<br />
<br />
It will take a bit of getting used to, but in every outdoor zone you're in, you will be medding while casting, while JBBing (if you get a JBB in the future), and while standing around - no more landing that slow and having to wait until you can sit down again to med because of sit agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a few other suggestions, I won't put price tag to them, because prices vary so much according to server, etc:<br />
<br />
Back: Cloak of the Wise (+7 AC +7 Sta +7 Wis +7 Int +7 Cha +45 HP +45 Mana +0.80 Wt)<br />
Range: Orb of Unidentifiable Pulp (+8 AC +7 Dex +7 Wis +15 vsDis +45 HP +35 Mana +2.00 Wt)<br />
Feet: Barbed Dragonscale Boots (+19 AC +9 Sta +30 HP +2.50 Wt)<br />
<br />
Depending on your server prices, it might be worth checking out Tae Ew Chain too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Buy a Jaundiced Bone Bracer.  <br />
<br />
Then buy a Horse.<br />
<br />
Then buy a Fungi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey<br />
<br />
The first thing you do is go and buy a 9kpp horse or that new thing. No other piece of equipment will match the value you will get out of it from all the exping you will do in outdoor zones and pop that is really nice exp in is mostly outdoors.<br />
<br />
Secondly I would get a few friends and go and camp the entrance in CT and hope for a few tae ew blood vials to dropp. If you get a few of those you can easy buy the rest that is needed and find a 250 smith and hope for the best. You can get a Tae ew shield, Tae ew bp and if still have blood vials over try for Tae ew legs. You can find the info on what is needed and trivials and such at www.eqtraders.com .<br />
<br />
Then I would go to the bazaar. Type bazaar and then open up the inventory. See what pieces you do not like and as a shm you should aim for HP first and formost imo then if they have aditional stats that is just a bonus. Then just pick shm as class and the slot you want to upgrade and then search all the other slots you want to upgrade and you will find out that you can get quite a few upgrades prob, and from there pick out the pieces that will get you the most out of your money.<br />
Since the economy is so diff from server to server this is the best you can do or ask a high lvl shm on your server.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok looks like i'll be getting a horse/lizard then..a friend says the same thing.<br />
<br />
I know the horse/lizard will give you sitting down mana regen without the sitting down but do you get the HP regen too? Just wondering how canni dancing works on a horse.<br />
<br />
Thanks for everyones advice so far..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for everyones advice so far..<br />
<br />
Canni dancing on a horse is very relaxed... You just sit there and cast canni over and over - works a treat. Canni + horse + KEI means more mana than I can use, usually...<br />
<br />
Other gear suggestions <br />
<br />
- Circled Toe Bones - awesome for 2500 :)<br />
- a Rust Encrusted Bracer from Dulak or some new LoY zone - generally about 1k... <br />
- Enshrouded Veil/Crystal Spider Eyes...<br />
- Decayed Chain Links for legs (about 1k for me on Mith Marr)<br />
- Talisman of benevolence (quested, so free!)<br />
<br />
Umm, any other gear in my Magelo might be nice, though there is a fair amount of overlap...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, you get sitting down HP regen as well. When you're on a horse you get *all* the benifits of sitting down, without the Aggro. So, you can swap spells as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I believe mosley is wrong about the sitting down hp regen.  Everything I have read says otherwise.  I havent checked it out but I am pretty sure you dont get sitting hp regen.</div></div><hr />
