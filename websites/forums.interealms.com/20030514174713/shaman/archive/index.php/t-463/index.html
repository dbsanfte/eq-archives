<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been at this point for over a year now... just too lazy to get my epic but i guess i'll do it now.<br />
<br />
Here is my question:<br />
1. Do Neh and Rak spawn every time?  <br />
2. How hard is Neh (what basic force is needed?)<br />
3. Am I wrong or isnt it typical that you do Neh and Rak at the same time?  But that leads me back to the question of if Neh and Rak spawn every time or if i'm wasting my friend's time killing Reavers till they spawn.<br />
<br />
Please any info is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes they spawn every time I think, unless someone has recently killed them. You can't keep doing them over and over.   Each spawns from a reaver.  You have to kill the reaver between 1 and 4 times usually to get them to pop out.<br />
<br />
Neh isn't that bad, getting to her is harder than killing her.  I did it with 1 group, don't get too many or you'll have problems getting through the castle.  Someone who knows the way and can pull it well is a must.<br />
<br />
A lot of people do them at the same, time, but it's not necessary.  If you just wanna do neh before you have stuff ready for rak, or if a few mages don't show up, may as well do neh while you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You'll definitely need to take a 200+ lockpick rogue to get to Neh.   Each of the named (Ghiosk, Rak and Neh) spawn from a specific reaver, every time. (unless they are already up when you pull their reaver, then they will not spawn from their reaver).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Much appreciate the info.  This is just what i thought but since i really do not want to mess this up i wanted to hear what others had to say that have done it :)<br />
<br />
Thanks once again for all the info.</div></div><hr />
