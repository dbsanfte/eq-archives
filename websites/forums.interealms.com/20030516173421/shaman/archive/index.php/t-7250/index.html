<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phibrizzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks:<br />
<br />
Does EQ still entice you?  I thought I would say goodbye to EQ two years ago when I logged on for one last time.  Since then I had not touch anything related to MMORPG and got into a respectable business school for my finance degree.  Recently I'm thinking that maybe I will resume my playing habit once I am done with my degree and get a job, but I'm not sure if that's worth the effort.  <br />
<br />
Little background about myself.  I played predominately a barb shaman (also a human paly, but he was more like a mule).  When I quited on summer of 2000, I was one of the three level 55 shamans in my server.  Needless to say I wasted a LOT of time to hoard plat lewt.  If I am going to play EQ again after I graduate, I don't want to go back into my old habit of waking up at 4 AM and looking for a group.  But deep inside me I like to play online RPG, and I love being a shaman as my alter ego.  <br />
<br />
My questions to you: Are there any significant enhancements and / or changes in the shaman class?  What do you enjoy and hate the most about the game in general?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The game is still cool fun. I went to a mate's place and watched over his shoulder as he killed stuff in Plane of Gnomes or something. all clockwork. It would be EXTREMELY easy to get back into the game. But in your position, I would hold off and wait for EQ2... =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EQ still entertains me. I keep playing because I want to see more of the game, am still finishing up a handful of different quests (and am seeking more), I enjoy the people in my guild &amp; friends I've met in game. When I find myself getting bored or burned out, I take a small break &amp; come right back with a fresh attitude. <br />
<br />
This game is so versatile, it satisfies a wide number of folks' interests. Whether you like to roleplay, quest, level, or be uber, this game will make you happy (to an extent). <br />
<br />
As far as why I like to play a shaman, we're very important to groups. We're definately sought after on the Planes &amp; any raid force. I love the subtle power of the shaman. We can make or break a fight. We can partner extremely well with just about any class, just in case you have a hard time looking for a group. A number of shaman do very well solo, as well. <br />
<br />
As far as significant changes? I've been playing my shaman since 4/01. I haven't seen any significant changes to the class itself. <br />
<br />
The last expansion, PoP, was a wonderful addition to the game. Great graphics, new fights, et al. I'm sure you can read a thread or 10 on PoP alone. <br />
