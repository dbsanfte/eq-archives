<br />
A fast question. Is the lighthouse in Gunthak the only place in LoY where I can bind?<br />
I have tried some other places, and get a message that I should try in a town instead. I just wonder whether there are some places where I have not tried that would work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you can bind yourself, then you can bind any where in the Gunthak zone, I have got the &quot;try a city&quot; message in Nadox, Torigan, and Dulak, I haven't tried Hates Fury yet. So bind yourself in Gunthak, but any where in the zone works.<br />
<br />
If I am hunting in Dulak, I would bind myself in Gunthak at the Dulak zoneline, for example.<br />
<br />
If you are a melee clas, I believe that the lighthouse is your only option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as I know the only LoY zone you can bind in is Gunthack. I personally wouldn't bind at the Dulak zone line, as it's trained a lot. I'm currently bound in the lighthouse, good for selling, &amp; everything is less than a 5 minute run away anyhow. If you're level 51 or over, get a <br />
spiritstone (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=spiritstone) or a soulstone (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20148) if you're a froglok. that will transport you to the zone outside your home city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe. I had tried to bind in Dulak, Torg-mines and Nadox, but not in Gunthak.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the fast reply.<br />
