<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Charthiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm trying to pick up this spell so I can make some Rallos Zek cultural armor, but am having trouble finding it.  Is there anywhere that it is sold other than the shammy vendor in Grobb? (never been there and have no clue where anything is.. also using a barbarian shammy and would prefer friendly vendor)<br />
<br />
Any information would be greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I thought only those shaman who's god was Rallos Zek could cast this, thus meaning only ogre/troll shaman. I know I got my copy in Ogguk back at lvl 29ish, and never used it until 60ish with some private tells of ppl wanting me to imbue 20 jade for 400pp or something.<br />
<br />
You might be stuck asking an evil shaman to do it for you, sorry to say.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Old Imbue spells (aka 29th lvl ones, NOT the pop ones)are deity related and you cant learn one not from your deity. So as a barbarian you wont be able to learn imbue jade, but only Imbue Ivory.<br />
<br />
But it is possible for an old player to cast it since like 1year ago, you could learn all imbue spells. Yes it has been nerfed. (i still ca cast them). So just ask an old player or a shaman of the appropriate diety to help you out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Charthiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you guys very much for the information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jade &amp; Rallos Zek = Ogre<br />
Amber &amp; Cazic-Thule = Iksar, Troll<br />
Ivory &amp; The Tribunal = Barbarian<br />
Sapphire &amp; Innoruuk = Troll (broken)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">About once a year, one patch or another breaks the deity check on imbue spells. The deity check is done only when you scribe the spell, not when you cast it. So, my barbarian shaman has imbue ivory, imbue jade and imbue amber spells scribed.<br />
<br />
Imbue sapphire is a cleric spell.<br />
<br />
So, what you can do, if you are a tradeskiller, is to obtain the spells you cannot scribe due to deity, and after each patch, sit down and try to scribe it. One of these patches will break the deity check again. At that time, all druids should run to get the imbue spell that is from the other religion, and occasionally, clerics will get imbue spells (there are a lot of those). If you notice the check being broken, and you have some clerics in the guild, get the imbue gems for the rarer faiths to make tradeskilling easier (bertox, quell, prex, rodcet).</div></div><hr />
