In a nutshell, the department is part of a major reorg. &quot;W&quot; is losing about 50% of his responsibility and gaining probably another 10% from someone else. One of his directs (L) is now his peer and is gaining about 45% of his responsibility. My immediate manager (S) pulled me into his office after the meeting and told me that I would now be reporting to &quot;L&quot;. All of my systems and all of &quot;S&quot;'s other systems using the technology I work with are being transferred to &quot;L&quot;. However, nobody else from &quot;S&quot;'s group is going with me. Looks like I'm probably going to be in charge of all of those systems now, approximately doubling my current responsibilities. But wait! It gets better.... I designed and taught a class in that technology to a group of my peers a few weeks ago. Most of the people that were in that class will now be reporting to &quot;L&quot; and working with that technology. Since &quot;L&quot; is now a director for a new department, she is going to need to establish a new management team. &quot;W&quot; and &quot;S&quot; considered that while they were discussing whether or not to transfer me to &quot;L&quot;'s group. . . .<br />

&quot;Excuse me, sir. Seeing as how the V.P. is such a V.I.P., shouldn't we keep the P.C. on the Q.T.? 'Cause of the leaks to the V.C. he could end up M.I.A., and then we'd all be put out in K.P.&quot;<br />

Funny thing is, if it works out, I'll become a V.P.</div></div><hr />
