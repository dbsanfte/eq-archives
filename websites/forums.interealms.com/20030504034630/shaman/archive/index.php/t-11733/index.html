<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Miktar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ello all I just regesterd and was looking for some assistance.... as a shaman what line of spells should I specialize in I have heaed alteration but am still not sure.  Any help would be great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did alteration since my primary task in groups has been slows, buffs and heals. However, I did neglect evocation (aoes) and abjuration (group buffs) which is hurting real bad. Please do yourself a favor and keep all your casting skills up as you progress. <br />
<br />
Maybe someone else has another suggestion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I asked this a while back and got one of the few unanimous decision I have ever seen on this board.  Alteration all the way!<br />
<br />
Only other possible choice would be Conjuration for a totally offensive shaman but it's a poor second choice to alteration.</div></div><hr />
