<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Knottah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a little lvl 6 troll shammy and I am having trouble.  I plan on heading to Kurn's at lvl 8 or so, but getting there is excruciatinly slow.  Since trolls have been moved to Nek Forest I have to share mobs with the little inkies and finding mobs that will yield decent xp is rough.  Any ideas on other zones would be great!<br />

Field of Bone is probably your best bet though.  Also Shar Vahl is a good starting place.  I personally like blackburrow at those levels, but I started EQ in the qeynos area and know it well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I headed to Steamfont. The Kobolds arent too tough (just watch out for the Kobold Shaman, cause he'll buff/heal them, so wax him first if he's around) and they are all quite content to sit there and watch their buddy get beaten into the ground. The teeth and golden hides sell decently in the PoK as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you can stand the 24/7 public channel bitchfest, 'booking it' to Shar Vahl and going into Paludal from that end is doable from about level 5 onwards and is insane xp all the way to early/mid 20s. If you can stand it that long, of course... Kurn's is nice xp aswell if you do stick with Plan A and, if so, Steamfont is one of the easier ways to do it.</div></div><hr />
