All ye of the 61+ level can take this advice for when LFG in PoV and no one is at OC.  Solo the fiends.  Yes... the fiends, their HP is much like that of a CT lizard... they just hit 3x harder &gt;=).<br />
<br />
Anyone can do this at my level... because I did it ONLY with Malosini, Immobilize, Bane of Nife, and my Epic and self buffed &gt;=).<br />
<br />
Pulled with Malosini (if resist, run, cast, run, cast, zone if still resists), Root... slow, just in case (was only hit once though), And proceed to apply Bane, possibly E-bolt, and epic... make sure to *gulp* sit down to med when you can ;). Surprisingly... Bane only broke root twice in the fight.  <br />
<br />
I did this with only Self buffs, Focus, Agi, Sta, regen, and SoW. That's it. Everyone in serverwide.crucible said it was impossible without Pox, and even more impossible without Malo... well.. I have one thing to say...<br />
<br />
&quot;I GOT  'chyo ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Did it while waiting on a rez... Thanks to some lag I aggro'd some Undead Vessals without knowing it til 30 seconds later when I was dead =p.<br />

Anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dunno why they'd be any tougher than the golems, really.<br />
<br />
And I took the golems this weekend at 61.  Finally decided that the key was relying on Epic and Pox, with Bane only when I was just sitting around, to cut down on the number of potential root breaks.<br />
<br />
I hear the 62 root helps a lot with that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grats man,<br />
<br />
but who ever said it was 'impossible'<br />
<br />
I could probably solo a fiend at lvl 50... it would just take me like an hour of kiting it and can dancing if i had my epic...<br />
<br />
My guess it took you at least 15-20min to take it down if not longer which really doesn't make it worth it, that's why I stopped soloing and just try to get in a good group or duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well... constantly BoNing.. it took 7 of em, along with Epic dotting and E-bolt.<br />

Took 5 min, max.<br />
<br />
Canni V only popped once after using it near the beginning and near the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Worgulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did something like that this evening, I was with a group of Guildies killing in PoI Factory when I just thought it would be cool if I could solo a golem.  Of course my guildies were getting out the cleric epics to rez me since they didn't think a lvl 61 shaman could solo these golems that have wiped a full group.  So the monk went and grabbed one and I ended up soloing it boy did I make them amazed lol, although I wouldn't do it without a monk puller because of the adds hehe. <br />
<br />
But anywho, Gratz to you man I hope to try some soloing in teir 2 sometime aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have actually soloed quite a few fiends at 61. Was soloing the larvaes, but sometimes GY is trained from outer/inner. After I got malo and Pox it got much easier :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, it amazes me how some people will argue a point when they are dead wrong and can't use simple addition to see it.<br />
<br />
Here let me prove you wrong:<br />
<br />
Using the PoV guide from http://www.vgnation.net/talk/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=15&amp;t=11&amp;st=0 as credability a PoV fiend has the following stats:<br />
<br />
Name : A Razorfiend Subduer; A Razorfiend Subjugater<br />
Level : 62 - 64<br />
HP : 20 - 32k<br />
Hits for : 500s<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll give you the benefit of the doubt here and say they have 20,000 hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Now here are your tools:   Epic, Bane of Nife, and Envenomed Bolt<br />
<br />
Even with an extended affliction III item the max for each of these is:<br />
<br />
Epic:    1200 in 1.2min or 72seconds, cast time: 9 seconds.<br />
<br />
Bane of Nife:  1862  in 42 seconds, cast time:  5 seconds, recast time: 2.3 seconds.<br />
<br />
Ebolt:         1226.4 in 42seconds, cast time:  6.1seconds, recast time: 2.3 seconds.<br />
<br />
I'm also assuming that you at least malo'd the mob, i'll assume for all intensive purposes you have malo (even if you have a lower version) the cast times and durations are all about the same.  At lvl 62 you wouldn't have a prayer of landing 1/2 of your dots without malo and even then some of them would be resisted as I get resists on the fiends at lvl 65 even after malos.  (this would be especially true for you because lowest these mobs would be is level 62 which would con white to you... meaning about 30% your dots would bounce).<br />
<br />
Malo is a 5second cast with a 13-14 min duration.<br />
<br />
You probably slowed the mob as well as any smart shaman would but again I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you are so l33t at rooting yellow con mobs that you didn't even bother slowing it.<br />
<br />
For simplification I'm going to just say whatever root you used wether the lvl 14 one or higher up takes about 3 seconds per cast as well.<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
So how did this all pan out in 5 minutes? ... Answer:  It didn't<br />
<br />
Here is the fastest it could have gone with NO resists and NO root breaks as we all know is 100% impossible on a yellow con mob when using dots poison dots that have a DD component.  I will also assume you cast the dots exactly as they wore off, timely them perfectly.<br />
<br />
Task                                                                 Time<br />
 <br />
Pull with malo                      -                                5 seconds<br />
Root                                  -                                3 seconds<br />
Cast epic dot                      -                                9 seconds<br />
Cast bane of nife                 -                               5 seconds<br />
Cast ebolt                          -                               6 seconds<br />
<br />
(please note there is delay between casting each spell but i'm not even going to factor that in...again giving you the benefit of the doubt)<br />
<br />
So so far we have about 30 seconds to malo,root, and dot up the mob.<br />
<br />
Now you wait about 50seconds till the dots wear off:<br />
<br />
Reroot                               -                                 3 seconds<br />
Cast bane of nife                 -                                5 seconds<br />
Cast ebolt                          -                               6 seconds<br />
Cast epic dot                      -                               9 seconds<br />
<br />
Now we're at about 105seconds and you've so far done about 4.5k of damage and reapplied your dots.<br />
<br />
Wait another 50seconds<br />
<br />
Reroot                                    -                            3 seconds<br />
Cast bane of nife                      -                           5 seconds<br />
Cast ebolt                               -                           6 seconds<br />
Cast epic dot                           -                           9 seconds<br />
<br />
Now we're at about 180seconds and you've so far done about 9k of damage and reapplied your dots.     <br />
<br />
3 minutes and the mob isn't even 1/2 dead... <br />
not even factoring in the numerous root breaks you'd have <br />
<br />
AND the recast time in between spells waiting for the spell gems to refresh AND I honestly doubt you timed all of your dots perfectly <br />
<br />
AND I highly doubt you had 100% no resists on a yellow con mob <br />
<br />
AND the fact the mob also has a certain amount it regenerates while just sitting there so you actually didn't do 9k of damage to it... more like 8500....<br />
--------------------<br />
I somehow do not understand how you did this in 5 minutes MAX as you say because after 3 minutes you don't even have the thing 1/2 dead assuming you pulled it all off with all of the benefits of doubt I gave you which you and I both know would never happen.<br />
<br />
So i'm really not gonna waste everyone's time in calculating out the rest of the fight.<br />
<br />
My guess is it took you at least 15minutes, yes a good solo, but I'm only ragging on you because you come in here thinking you are the l33test thing since single sliced cheese and your information is so far off from the fact I had to put you in your place.<br />
<br />

<br />
p.s.  7 bane of nife would be 7 X 42 sec = 5min right there not even counting, malo, root, slow, epic, resists.... bleh =-P .   Also I just noticed that you said you used can 5, which I'm assuming you'd have to have healed yourself up after using it the first time so how you pulled this off with no kei (you said you were waiting for a rez) is also commendable I suppose if really true.<br />
<br />
7 banes (425mana X 7), a malo (350mana), a few roots (at least 10 i'd say - lvl 14 root 30 x 10 = 300mana), say 3 or 4 ebolts (320mana X 4) we are talking about (2970 + 350+ 300 + 1280) = 4900 mana not counting resists, and heals, and slow if you used it.... that's some l33t horse riding, and canabalizing...<br />
<br />
In your own words: &quot;I GOT 'chyo ass!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When I dot solo, I overlap my dots (except epic) to make sure they stay up.  i.e. I recase Bane before it's finished.  I am good enough at timing it that it sometimes runs out DURING my cast, I'll bet it's never more than a tick away.  If you're doing that, you can just look at dots as constant DPS - DPS that takes place EVEN IF ROOT BREAKS and you need to reroot.<br />
<br />
So what's the DPS?<br />
<br />
Epic averages around 15dps, including cast time since you don't want to overlap epics (epic damage is heavily back-end loaded).<br />
<br />
Bane around 44 dps.<br />
<br />
Ebolt around 30dps.<br />
<br />
Total 89dps if you can keep everything going at the same time perfectly.  At that rate, it would take 3.7 minutes to kill a mob with 20k hp.<br />
<br />
Now there's 30 seconds of applying debuffs and dots at the start.  And there'll be times when two dots are off at the same time, yadda yadda, so add 25% to the theoretical max time to cover that (that's pretty generous IMO, at least the way I solo).  I won't factor resists into account because you'd be an idiot not to put Malosini on them after Malo, and I rarely get resists after Malosini.<br />
<br />
3.7 minutes * 1.25 + 0.5 minutes = 5.125 minutes.  That's ignoring any damage done in the first 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
In my book, 5.125 minutes is pretty darn close to the claimed &quot;5 minutes max&quot;.  Okotona might be off by a bit on his claim but not much.<br />
<br />
<br />

Here's where I come up with a scathingly witty comment to put msatchmo in HIS place.  But I'm not going to, because I don't think msatchmo's attitude furthers the purpose of this board and I don't want to encourage it.  OK, Okotona came off a bit cocky in the original post, but there's no call for the tone of msatchmo's reply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wulfson Soulforger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Um, I say grats for doing it period.  Time I think is skewed even if the previous posters math is wrong.<br />
<br />
A cycle of 5 BoN, Epic and Ebolts onlz adds up to 17k of damage.  Which is pretty respectable DPM after the first minute. 3k a min is good using those 3 spells.  Sure you didnt throw Plague in there?  That'll skew the table a bit more in your favor DPM wise but cost you about what, um, 1200 more mana total.<br />
<br />
No dogdog right at the end?</div></div><hr />

Oh, I forgot this part.<br />
<br />
He said he was waiting for a rez but had his epic, so I'd assume he had full gear and self-buffs, perhaps other buffs like Virtue but not KEI.<br />
<br />
My lvl 62 has something like 3300 mana unbuffed (and I'm far from uber).  That means he'd have to Cann up 1600 mana.  I don't have Cann V, but it's only 4 Cann IV's per minute.  Doesn't sound like a big deal to me.<br />
<br />
If all heals were with Torpor, add 1-2 cann's per Torpor cast to recover mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weiss, exactly... so if he is can 4'ing and torporing he isn't going to be able to keep his dots over lapping perfectly like he'd like to...<br />
<br />
also maybe you missed the part where this is a white con mob... maybe you havn't fought much in pop but please... go to outter and start soloing some of these ok?   You will notice a lot of resists even after your malo and also every ****ing time you cast a dot with a dd component it is going to break your root... so repositioning yourself and rerooting every damn time you cast.. there is no way it took only 5minutes... especially if it was white con,   you won't even see many lvl 65's who have the bigger dots that don't break root making those claims, that is why i posted all of this.   <br />
<br />
Theoretically you had a good idea, but it is just that, a theory that wouldn't work because of resists and the fact he'd be rerooting like a mofo... also if he did manage to get hit he'd have to heal even more thus burning more mana.   <br />
<br />
BTW I really don't care if you don't like my attitude, I always come on strong it's my nature.  I'm presenting all of this because:<br />
<br />
1. Bringing up solid soloing information for shaman who care to know all the details of their spells and soloing.  I would hate to see people waste their time soloing this stuff based on false information possibly resulting in their deaths, etc because someone came here to gloat and make up stuff.   I overexaggerate my stories as well, I'm just clarifying some things so others don't go hunting based on false info.  (please note i'm not saying he didn't solo this, i'm saying it took him more like 10-15minutes, if a 62 un-kei'd shaman could solo a fiend in 5minutes then why the hell wouldn't we all be camping them for phat AA exp... i'm guessing that'd be 8-10% a kill equaling out to about an AA every 45 minutes if the original poster was correct which he isn't and that's why no one is there soloing this non-stop)<br />
<br />
2. I'm bored as hell at work, i'm just an intern and both of my bosses are not in today and I've already done all the stuff they left for me so i'm killing time.<br />
<br />
peace and take care guys, happy hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Also to keep dots that only last 43 seconds on a constant rotation, with spell recast times and rerooting and moving around, you'd be casting the dots almost non -stop with maybe only time for 1 can4 in between each one which would not be enough time to generate enough mana for the whole fight.<br />
<br />
and p.s. weiss your mana pool is quite good for most shaman, you are decked in full spirit callers with other good loot that the average lvl 62 shaman would not have unless he was in a good guild and had been in it for awhile to gather up that stuff.  So unless he's in full ornate his mana will be equal to or my guess less than what you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">OK, you're making fun of his 5 minutes saying its totally impossible, and I'm saying 5 minutes is at least THEORETICALLY possible with reasonable root breaks, so why are you raggin him so bad?<br />
<br />
There is plenty of time to cann/torpor between casts with spells running a minimum of 42 seconds.  Every 42 seconds you spend 10 seconds refreshing bane and ebolt, sometimes 9 seconds refreshing epic, still leaves you half to three quarters of your time to reroot/cann/torpor.<br />
<br />
A root break only costs you 3 seconds to reroot, 2 more to reposition yourself.  Stay at max cast distance to avoid getting interrupted.  Even assuming a Bane needed refreshing right then 5 seconds reroot + bane cast time of 5 seconds (less if you have focus item) is less than 25% of the running time of Bane, and 25% is the fudge number that I used.<br />
<br />
And as far as root breaks, he already said he got lucky on those and only had two root breaks due to Bane.  The RNG is streaky enough that this is possible, although I would definately not count on it as a rule.  If you are saying that this is impossible, you can try to make that argument, but it's stated in the initial post, so you either have to factor it in to your calculations or flat out say you don't believe it.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying he DID it in 5 minutes, I wasn't there and don't know one way or the other.  I'd be much more prepared to believe 7-9 minutes, personally.  But the numbers are not as far out of whack as you seem to think they are.  (and 8 minutes is a lot closer to his 5 than your 15 :-)<br />
<br />
Put it another way.  What do YOU think is a reasonable 'fudge factor' to account for recasts?  I chose 25% - what do you think, 50%?  At 50% you're looking at around 45dps, so you're looking at 7.4 minutes plus half a minute to get up to speed, around 8 min total.  So where does your 15 minute figure come from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok i'm not going to argue with you...<br />
<br />
if you think it's possible that 7 bane casts + epic + ebolts only broke 2 roots on a fight with a white con mob then you are just as ill informed about your class than the original poster.<br />
<br />
Even with roots alone the best one he could have at level 62 would have been greater immbolize which only lasts 60 seconds assuming it didn't break before that because of damage.  Or maybe he used  level 56 paralyzing earth you say? that has a 3min duration....wrong... that spell has such a low damage check you so much as do anything but park the mob and it is going to break that root.<br />
<br />
So with 1 minute duration roots he had to reroot at least 6 or 7 times that fight.  No way in hell it was only twice.<br />
<br />
On top of that it takes more than 2 seconds to reposition yourself after a root break, we don't have bard speed and you have to come to a complete stop after getting enough distance on these mobs so you don't interupt you root... i'd say more the 5 and that's if you are jumping and it's often more than that if you get a resisted root, which these do resist about 20% of the time.   On top of that the fiends are pretty quick mobs... not quite sow speed but those bastards hop over fast and last time i checked we didn't have snare (cept the troll newbie one that doesn't last long enough to make it viable in this situation).  So often you have to stop your casting as soon as root breaks and run while jumping far enough a head to reroot it... it doesn't take just 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
be back after lunch...<br />

if you think it's possible that 7 bane casts + epic + ebolts only broke 2 roots on a fight with a white con mob then you are just as ill informed about your class than the original poster.<br />
<br />
<br />
...and then lots of other arguments that you aren't going to make :p deleted.<br />
<br />
Do I think it's possible?  I think it's highly unlikely, and in fact I did say<br />
<br />
I'm not saying he DID it in 5 minutes, I wasn't there and don't know one way or the other. I'd be much more prepared to believe 7-9 minutes, personally. But the numbers are not as far out of whack as you seem to think they are. (and 8 minutes is a lot closer to his 5 than your 15 :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
So the point I'm waiting for from you is not a treatise on what roots are available, but some information on why you think it would take 15 minutes when IMO it's closer to 8 and this guy claims 5.  Or to close with one final quote, <br />
<br />
LOL, it amazes me how some people will argue a point when they are dead wrong and can't use simple addition to see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My main point is that he was very wrong.  Next up the timing.. I was estimating about 10-15minutes as previously mentioned...<br />
<br />
at lunch I went home and logged in.  I have decent gear for a lvl 65 and I loaded up the exact spells he used... However I used the lvl 64 root which is better than whatever the hell he was using guaranteed.<br />
<br />
Still following?<br />
<br />
So i run up to Outter spawn... to make it even more fun , I kept my kei and pot9 that I already had on...<br />
<br />
anyways i fought sorta like a noob but first off root broke everytime i casted bane of nife but once...<br />
<br />
and yes I got hit a lil, when the mob was at 30% I was totally oom and didn't have Can V up so i had to finish it with jbb and rooting...<br />
<br />
the point is it took me 7minutes doing exactly the way you spoke of and the mob was at 30%... i have extended affliction III and I was 65..  i didn't get resists but a 62 would on a white con.<br />
<br />
That is how I factor 10-15minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Happy reading:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Good information, thank you.  Based on this it looks like it IS possible to solo a razorfiend in around 5 minutes (remember, it's not the particular fiend you were fighting that matters, but the lowest HP fiend).  You did around 20k of damage in 5:12, and could have done almost 22k in the same time with a slight tweak in your battle plan.<br />
<br />
Duration:<br />
[Tue Jun 10 11:54:29 2003] You begin casting Malo.<br />
...<br />
[Tue Jun 10 11:59:41 2003] You say, 'oom mob at 30&amp;PCT;'<br />
<br />
Elapsed time 5:12, not sure where you came up with 7 minutes.<br />
<br />
In that time you did around 12000 points of Bane damage (estimated based on dps due to a bit of overlapping, nice job timing those btw), plus 4900 in EBolt damage (four EBolts, none overlapping).  Unknown amount of epic damage - it's really not a good idea to overlap epic dots because the most damage is done in the last few ticks.<br />
<br />
If the epics added up to at least 3k despite the overlap, then you're right at the 20k mark for damage.  Or alternatively if you'd cast one fewer epic but let all of them run to completion you'd have done 4800 points of epic damage, total 21800 in 5:12.<br />
<br />
Since the mob had 30% health left after your 20k, it looks like that particular fiend had around 28k hp, which is on the mid-to-high end of the 20k-32k range you cited.  This gives us a partial validation of the damage estimates since that number seems pretty reasonable.<br />
<br />
Edit: on the other hand I'd love to get a copy of his Root spell that doesn't break on DD's  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My main point is that he was very wrong.  Next up the timing.. I was estimating about 10-15minutes as previously mentioned...<br />
<br />
at lunch I went home and logged in.<br />
<br />
Well now, let's check the numbers. <br />
<br />
Assuming Msatchmo only lives 15 minutes away from work, traveling<br />
there and back takes 30 minutes. Now add in booting his comp,<br />
starting EQ, waiting for it to check for updates, logging in, getting<br />
to the character select screen - another five minutes. I'm sure he <br />
wasn't camped in Valor, so he had to run there. Giving him the doubt of <br />
benefit, he had to be at LEAST 5 minutes away. The fight took 10<br />
minutes, according to his log. Add in 5 minutes for buffing before the<br />
fight, and that only leaves him 5 minutes to get AND eat lunch. <br />
<br />
<br />
Clearly this is not possible. <br />
<br />
 :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Weiss,<br />
<br />
good call on adding it all up.  Like I said i'm not totally disagreeing that this isn't possible i'm just saying you'd have to be damn lucky to do it, especially in 5minutes.  Most of the ones you will pull don't have 20k hp and even if they did, I did this at 65 with an EA 3 item (not hard to get...just do coldain military bracer quest), and I had on kei and pot9.<br />
<br />
If you notice I was a retard and didn't slow the mob in the beginning of the fight either, I was in a hurry to get this done and get back to work so I wasn't thinking.<br />
<br />
The thing is, if these were white con to me I'd be getting resists and I don't get where he said only 2 root breaks because my root broke everytime I casted.   Yes I Know about the epic overlaps but in the spam of getting beat up a lil I just reapplied it anyways so I could time my ebolt/eb overlaps a bit better since those are the main damage dealers.<br />
<br />
Fact is, yes this might have been done in 5 minutes MAYBE but everything would have had to been PERFECT and a huge amount of luck on pulling like the lowest level fiend and having no spell get resisted on a white con mob.  <br />
<br />
The whole point of the post is to say if you go here at lvl 62 with those dots, prepare for it to not be worth your trouble and to have your ass pounded if anything goes wrong.   These fiends are actually about jboot speed so I did have to jump my ass off just to get in front of them to root and often got beat up a lil every few roots.<br />
<br />
gg<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt;  for most of these fights the average lvl 62 shaman will end up oom and dead (or have to zone) and that most of these fiends will take 10-15min to solo and just didn't want people to get the wrong idea cuz these things really are a bitch to fight (not hard just lots of hp)... plus you have to watch for that damn bug where if you have a rooted mob too far from you they can just insta regen to 20 or 30%.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Some of Satchmo's mana issues may be attributed to the lack of Cann V, which Oktona used twice during the fight. Oktona may also have used a slightly more efficient Dotting strategy than Satchmo used, meaning that it's entirely possible for him to have done 20k damage in around five minutes. Either way, the timing is certaintly closer to five minutes than the original 15-20 minutes that Satch claimed. <br />
<br />
This isn't to say that Oktona pulled it off in exactly five minutes or that it wouldn't require a great deal of luck to replicate. Just pointing out that it is conceivable.<br />

also I do admit I didn't do this fight perfect but I laid the 2 poison dots almost always damn near close, i only over lapped epic maybe once so how much more efficient you could do it ... i'd seriously like to know... also if he can 5'd that wouldn't solve all the problems because he's have to sit and wait for torpor to heal him and if root broke anytime during that he = dead guaranteed unless he had VP to save him which he never said he had.<br />
<br />
Also I think you forgot the fact I am lvl 65 and this is a blue con vs lvl 62 and this being a white con, there is a big difference or have you never solo'd a white...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">LMAO...<br />
<br />
Jesus fekkin' CHRIST lads...<br />
<br />
I was only estimating the time it took! I canni V'd twice throughout the battle, Replenishment constantly going, canning and medding when I could. For the sake of Mana efficiency, I used Canni V followed by Kragg's every time it popped. And since I used Canni V twice in the battle, and it didn't pop by the end of the battle, I thought 5 minutes, max. Might've taken 6, maybe 7, the point of the post is that it could be done. Self buffs, nothing but Focus, Agi, Sta, Regen, and Regen.<br />
<br />
This was WITHOUT Torpor or Malo... biotches...<br />
<br />
err.. umm. sorry.. I take back the biotch part ;)<br />
<br />
But I'm still searching for both... missing only one research component for either one, too, hehe.<br />
<br />
If it's that big o' a deal I'll just fekkin do it again, except now I'm 62 hehe, they're only white cons now. This time I'll /log on the whole thing.<br />
<br />
PS Necros are kick ass partners for these... their snare has their HP at 85% by the time they're out of the cave (O_o)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Leading with epic probably isn't your best bet. You will miss at least one tick of damage while casting it, so you'd want your other DoTs grinding away during those nine seconds. <br />
<br />
As far as the level thing goes, it is entirely possible to land a spell the first time on a white con mob... just not as likely as as it is on a blue. Thus it is possible that Okotona encountered minimal resist problems on this one mob. Remember, it's a small sample size that we're talking about, so the law of averages may not catch up to you: monks have been known to tank effectively for one or two mobs as long as they block, dodge, and riposte well over a short time span. Also, remember that we're presupposing that root only breaks twice during the engagement, so Torpor healing is acceptable.<br />
<br />
As I said before, it's not something you'd want to do for exp, because it depends so largely on luck and the RNG, but I do believe that it may well have happened once. I don't think anyone is claiming that Okotona's experience is the norm... just that it's conceivable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">After Malosini, the only resists I can recall are 1 or 2 at MOST from roots, never from DoTs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">ok law or probabilty whatever... fine fine ...<br />
<br />
all i'm saying is there is no way in hell you wouldn't get at least 7 to 10 root breaks in that fight.  It happens all the time I've soloed over 20 of those from lvl 63-65 and it's not worth it that's all i'm trying to say.  In the original msg Okah is recommending shaman 61+ go solo these things when they can't find a group which is a very bad idea for 90% of the shaman playing.  THAT is the reason I went into so much detail and why I am still posting on this.<br />
<br />
Also Dev now he is claming he did it at 61...meaning a yellow con... meaning you are gonna get resisted a lot.<br />
<br />
Conclusion it was claimed that this is easy to do at lvl 61+ and can be done in about 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Truth, BEST CASE Scenario it would take about 6 or 7 minutes, expect more like 10 and if anything goes wrong at all you are probably gonna die.<br />
<br />
So this is NOT a good thing to do for a 61+ shaman unless you have your higher level spells.  It's all just a pissing match and who cares if you can solo a razor fiend like I said I could pull that **** off with a 50 shaman it would just take me an hour to kite him.  <br />
<br />
I'd do it naked with a jbb,root, and a kei.<br />

Speaking of which, I DID slow the fiend, AND used spirit call when the fiend was at 30% health.<br />
<br />
To my surprise, the SC'd pets lasted the whole 60 seconds, but only if slowed. Learned that they're not invincible when I SC'd an unslown one a bit afterwards ;).<br />
<br />
Now I summon a pet, give it weaps and haste, and when the mob starts to run, ~12-15%,  I melee it and sic puppy &gt;=)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">and to you all who think i'm raggin on Okot look at his last damn post, everything he says never adds up.<br />
<br />
First he says:<br />
<br />
Did it while waiting on a rez... Thanks to some lag I aggro'd some Undead Vessals without knowing it til 30 seconds later when I was dead =p.<br />
<br />
/gloating off.<br />
<br />
<br />
then changes to:<br />
<br />
<br />
Spider add aggro = unrootable = the reason I was looking for a rez when I first Solo'd the Razorfiend.<br />
<br />
Funny you said that...<br />
<br />
<br />
so if you don't want people to question what you say, make sure you know *** you are saying and stick to a story...  Either that or you just word stuff weird and you actually died twice in like 10 minutes, leading me to believe you arn't as skilled as you think you are.<br />
<br />
p.s. fiends don't start running till 10% and i'm still waiting for you to link the thread where people said it was impossible to do this without malo or poxx...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Damn... you caught me lmao...<br />
<br />
I died from Undead Vessals from Lag once... and from spider aggro while solo. This happened in one night. Sorry for getting the stories mixed, how I died wasn't what I remembered the most... it was the adrenaline from the fight &gt;=).<br />
<br />
I believe I got a rez ~5-10 min. after the vassal attack. That was a totally different occurance.<br />
<br />
Sorry about that, <br />
<br />
I'll go work on that log now, since none of you believe me lol...<br />
<br />
PS<br />
<br />
Also to keep dots that only last 43 seconds on a constant rotation, with spell recast times and rerooting and moving around, you'd be casting the dots almost non -stop with maybe only time for 1 can4 in between each one which would not be enough time to generate enough mana for the whole fight.<br />
<br />
and p.s. weiss your mana pool is quite good for most shaman, you are decked in full spirit callers with other good loot that the average lvl 62 shaman would not have unless he was in a good guild and had been in it for awhile to gather up that stuff. So unless he's in full ornate his mana will be equal to or my guess less than what you have.<br />
<br />
Yes, Root DID break a ton of times during the fight, but, I used Immobilize (now I use Greater Immobilize at 62) when I needed to Canni V.<br />
<br />
And thank you for the compliment on the gear... even though it's not as great as you say it HAS to be for me to solo a friggen mob.<br />
<br />
I wasn't sitting at my desk with a calculator during the solo session, I was too busy killing it =p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was a unanimous agreement that fiends were unsoloable at my level without Malo or Poxx in the Crucible chat channel, which I understand is not always filled with people from the boards, but it is filled with shamen.<br />

About the timing, maybe, about anything going wrong and you dying... SoW outruns these by alot.<br />
<br />

<br />
About the high level spells thing, the only lvl 60 spells I have are Khuras and Focus. I'm missing Pox, and as I said, because I'm missing so many spells is the REASON that almost any 61+ shamen should try soloing these if they're bored off their ass waiting LFG.<br />
<br />
About being lvl 50 and soloing it with JBB... I wouldn't know about that, I'm an Iksar =p.<br />
<br />
I'd do it naked with a jbb,root, and a kei.<br />
<br />
263 X 76 right click casts manafree = 20k damage ;-p<br />

LMAO... that's wonderful, but then again you aren't doing it self buffed with only Bane, E-bolt, Epic, Immobilize, Root, Canni V, and possibly SC at the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the record, I'm 100% in agreement with msatchmo that level 62's shouldn't flock to PoV to solo Razorfiends.<br />
<br />
As for what's possible and what's not, I'd sure as heck like to see the log where 7 banes and some odd ebolts landed without breaking root, but I'll admit that sometimes the RNG is pretty streaky and it's possible to get lucky.<br />
<br />
In any event, grats on the nice solo kill.</div></div><hr />

Where do you people get this from?<br />
<br />
Not to be an ass, but I said even myself that &quot;Root broke a TON of times&quot;.  Not a big deal when it's only 30 mana, /shrug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this likely?  *shrug* Never been to PoV.  I'd back up my opinion if I had been to PoV, as I'm pretty sure that Luclin mobs don't have the same resists as PoP mobs.  Personally, I've been on that solo-high, so I know where he's coming from, and I honestly believe he did it.  Not in 5 minutes, but maybe a few more.<br />

I regret saying it took only five minutes MAX to kill it... that was an estimation, and now I have people calculating how unlikely it is. To me, it's not always about the xp, it's also about fun. I even let another shammy replace me at WW camp so that I could solo these. <br />
<br />
Hehe... It feels like I said &quot;I'd kill for Torpor&quot; and now I'm being charged for murder.<br />
<br />
After churning it in my head, I'm willing to say it took 6-7 minutes, because I rooted, and applied BoN, E-bolt, slow, and Epic before Canni V'ing.<br />
<br />
But... After that, Canni V only popped once more, and I almost immediatey used it (applied immobilize instead of Root for safety) and Canni V needed a minute or so to re-pop after I killed the fiend.<br />
<br />
Will post the log when I get a chance to play EQ again... going to work in less than 8 hours.. then the night of our glorious patch I should be able to post my log.<br />
<br />
On a final note... it's odd to me that the community talks about our great mana regen, but when is suits Msatchmo's cause, he believes I didn't Canni IV or V.  /bizzlesmack. Doublestandards, gotta hate em =p.</div></div><hr />

all i'm saying is there is no way in hell you wouldn't get at least 7 to 10 root breaks in that fight <br />
 <br />
I must be Jesus then.<br />
<br />
Ok what is that about?  In the post right above that you just said you had a ton of root breaks… like I said make up your damn mind….I think the reason this thread has gone so long is because of your 8th grade communication skills.  <br />

About the timing, maybe, about anything going wrong and you dying... <br />
<br />
SoW outruns these by alot.<br />
<br />
True, however, sow does not outrun stun and considering these can double attack and bash you for over 1000 damage in 1 round of attack and the fact that if you don’t get the kill as fast as you’d like your slow could possibly run off and you WILL get wrecked by these if they are unslowed and catch you.   Even at max spell casting range you have JUST enough time to get that 2.5 or 3sec cast root off and if it is one that is resisted you = dead.   Most shaman at 61 or 62 have about 2.5k self buffed.<br />
<br />

On a final note... it's odd to me that the community talks about our great mana regen, but when is suits Msatchmo's cause, he believes I didn't Canni IV or V.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never said we didn’t have great mana regen.  My argument is that if you are indeed can IV’ing and Can V’ing and you are using the 43 second lvl 14 root you will not have time to be cannibalize dancing if you think you can kill it in 5 or 6minutes (which would involve non stop casting your dots, re-rooting, and doing a **** load of hopping around to get ahead of the jboot speed mob to repark it in a limited space such as the area around the Outter spawn.  That was my point I never said we sucked at regening mana.  It appears not only is your memory and how you tell your stories ever changing but so to is your recollections of what you read.    If you were using Can V etc to get mana back that’s fine… but then you are still going to have to reroot the mob, torpor yourself and wait for to heal you back up which adds to the time.   <br />
<br />
Like I said 80 times this whole purpose of my posts is to tell shaman to expect a much tougher encounter than you state in your boa****l posts because you over exaggerated , you were corrected, but then you continued you argue your point even though you were wrong.  Expect a fight of between 6-10+ minutes on these assuming nothing goes wrong.   6 minutes being if you have spirit call, possibly a pet up, and most of your spells which most shaman DO NOT.  At least the ones that would find the exp they get from these plausible (aka lvl 60-63 shaman) above that you are better off trying to get flagged and hit up BoT or FoZ because spec parchments do not drop off normal mobs in PoS/PoV and most of us don’t have the 10-50k a pop to buy all of our spells.  You’ve been corrected, it’s fine, I wasn’t exactly right on all of my details but I got my point across to save other shaman wasted time and effort.  Being able to solo them was never the issue it was it being worth the time, effort, and risk and no it is not for the 61-63 shaman you were recommending this to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I took what you said to mean that I couldn't survive having 7-10 root breaks, I did, therefore doing something impossible, supposedly. When have I ever said I didn't get many root breaks?<br />
<br />
Even at max spell casting range you have JUST enough time to get that 2.5 or 3sec cast root off and if it is one that is resisted you = dead. Most shaman at 61 or 62 have about 2.5k self buffed.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a good thing we all have the choice to prepare for root breaks by outruning them, and then casting root from a very safe distance. I have 2,461<br />
hp self buffed.<br />
<br />
I never said we didn’t have great mana regen. My argument is that if you are indeed can IV’ing and Can V’ing and you are using the 43 second lvl 14 root you will not have time to be cannibalize dancing if you think you can kill it in 5 or 6minutes (which would involve non stop casting your dots, re-rooting, and doing a **** load of hopping around to get ahead of the jboot speed mob to repark it in a limited space such as the area around the Outter spawn.<br />
<br />
In my original and latter posts I said I was either using Immobilize or Immobilize when I wanted to Canni V, for safety's sake. That's a 2 minute root, I believe... <br />
<br />
The area around the outer spawn is huge, and you can kite it all around the edge where the trees are safely. Frogs don't aggro, larvae don't, and I have yet to accidentally run into Undead Vassals.<br />
<br />
That was my point I never said we sucked at regening mana. It appears not only is your memory and how you tell your stories ever changing but so to is your recollections of what you read.<br />
<br />
Sorry for that, I wasn't writing everything down, like I said, I was too busy killing it, very excitedly too. <br />
<br />
If you were using Can V etc to get mana back that’s fine… but then you are still going to have to reroot the mob, torpor yourself and wait for to heal you back up which adds to the time. <br />
<br />
I STILL don't have Torpor... I shouldda spent some of my 52-60 days in Sebilis, but I was in HHK or in the planes the whole time =p... Kragg's Mending works just fine, each time I canni V and use Kragg's I profit just a bit over a bubble of mana. Takes what... 12 secods for the whole deal? All while my DoTs are doing damage.<br />
<br />
Like I said 80 times this whole purpose of my posts is to tell shaman to expect a much tougher encounter than you state in your boa****l posts because you over exaggerated , you were corrected, but then you continued you argue your point even though you were wrong.<br />
<br />
One of the basic points I was trying to get across is that spell-wise, I'm ghetto, yet I did it relatively fast. I only used spells that every 60+ shaman should have... Bane, E-bolt, Epic (easy quest, but I acknowledge those without the force to complete it), Root, Immobilize, and Canni V is optional as long as you have Epic. Although if OOM you probably will drag the rest of the fight out a bitwith roots/epic.<br />
<br />
 Expect a fight of between 6-10+ minutes on these assuming nothing goes wrong.<br />
<br />
That's a good expectation. Except I believe you could hit the 6-10min mark even with a few root breaks during casting.<br />
<br />
 6 minutes being if you have spirit call, possibly a pet up, and most of your spells which most shaman DO NOT.<br />
<br />
I have none of our spells that cost upwards of 15k... VoTB, Malo, Torpor, Pox, Avatar (yes... seen avatar for sale alot at 15-30k =p), etc. As for 61-62 spells... eths rot or are used for alts for much of what I've seen in PoV, and I've been able to buy any missing spells for 30-600pp each.<br />
<br />
At least the ones that would find the exp they get from these plausible (aka lvl 60-63 shaman) above that you are better off trying to get flagged and hit up BoT or FoZ because spec parchments do not drop off normal mobs in PoS/PoV and most of us don’t have the 10-50k a pop to buy all of our spells.<br />
<br />
I've nevah had more than 25k in my bank account, and saving it for Torpor... maybe Q if I hit 63 without finding a good deal on it. I'd recommend doing a group over these to shamen, I guess, it's just 10x more fun to me.<br />
<br />
You’ve been corrected, it’s fine, I wasn’t exactly right on all of my details but I got my point across to save other shaman wasted time and effort.<br />
<br />
I, on the other hand, was trying to encourage shamen to explore their potential. As for being corrected, that's fine, just that your general demeanor about this gave me an itch to debate this till the end ;). And no, it's NOT FINE! I'M ALWAYS RIGHT! NEVER WRONG! Nevah nevah nevah! *stomps his foot obstinately*. Ahem.. sorry.. had to get that outta there.<br />
<br />
Being able to solo them was never the issue it was it being worth the time, effort, and risk and no it is not for the 61-63 shaman you were recommending this to.<br />
<br />
Hmm... I thought I was the one who started this thread... huh.. guess not. I thought it was cool doing something everyone else said was impossible, and getting decent chunks of xp for it. If I wasn't 3 yellow into 62 I'd de-level for ya and do it again. As for the 3 yellow since this happned, Mountain Dew does wonders &gt;=).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Do what you want I'm still telling you that you got lucky and these arn't worth the time and effort with the gear/spells/level you have and that anyone with similar characteristics will find the same results and if you should happen to pull the one with 32k hp, you will probably be zoning, and if you chose not to, expect about a 20min fight to finish it with epic.<br />
<br />
I only got on ya cuz I use the same tactics as you in a different area that is much easier and way better exp and slightly different spells (disease dots vs poison dots because you have to cast them less and they don't break root as much)</div></div><hr />

This is every instance of the epic dot mentioned in your log...incomplete of course because you didn't post the whole thing.<br />
<br />
I see 3 overwrites in just the part you posted. And not little ones either. The first overwrite left 46 seconds --more than half the run-- of damage behind, the second left 34 seconds left, the third was fairly decent, only leaving 17 seconds worth of damage.<br />
<br />
You really screwed yourself on epic damage, if this is the pattern you maintained through the fight. I doubt that first application did even 200 points. Thankfully, this kind of thing can now be confirmed with the visible dot damage patch.<br />
<br />
 i'd seriously like to know<br />
<br />
Unless you can run a 90 second timer to get it more precisely, I'd let the dot run out before recasting. The epic dot is one where you SERIOUSLY ream yourself over by overwriting even a single tick.<br />

Note: This took 7 min 45 seconds.<br />
<br />
Not 6-7 as I thought, but not 15-20 minutes either... the fight ended with me having 40m, thus the reason I decided to start nuking.<br />
<br />
ALSO! I deleted about 20,000,000 'You haven't recovered from casting...' mesages.  I didn't realize I had such an itchy trigger finger!<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't go around spouting those kinds of jokes to people I think won't agree with. I have friends that are both formal mormon and h@rdc0re atheist. I understand that there are people varying in sensitivity that browse these boards. <br />
<br />
You don't really know me, but I understand that in this environment you don't need to hold back any feelings or thoughts that you may have. Thus your saying I should grow up is expected but not true under the circumstances that we both lack a common knowledge of each other.<br />
<br />
Behind this shroud of a jackass that I wear is a very sullen young person, high analytical, and aware of himself and his environment. If jovial foolishness is the opposite of maturity, than I hold within me a balance of each. I can be both mature and it's antithesis, but I always analyze what I do before going through with it. <br />
<br />
In the case of the commonly taboo baby jokes that involve inhuman acts towards them, this was in accepting response to Krakster's humorous remark, which I'm sure he didn't mean seriously, merely as a hyperbole, a rhetorical hyperbole, made to draw attention to something so unaccepted in common society that surely it would grip someone to post a response.  <br />
<br />
I personally thought this was funny, not the thought of a living human child being chopped to puree, but the thought of posting such a subject.<br />
<br />
My honest opinion is that this world is not perfect by almost all humans' perception. Therefore, you will encounter things that you don't agree with. My belief is to acknowledge these things for what they are, not evil, but manifestations of the environment in which a human mind grew.<br />
<br />
That said, there's some messed up crap that I think should be kept from the public, due to people freaking out over it. For example, I've seen a picture once of a small demon screwing the skull of a crucified Jesus on a devil-worship board (I was bored and curious, the board, not the pic =p), I don't think it'd be fair for that to be posted on a billboard outside a church. Nor do I think it's nice to have bumperstickers that say we will suffer eternal torment unless we accept Jesus into our lives.<br />
<br />
*sighs in contentment*<br />
<br />
I now proclaim myself, king of topic drifting!<br />
<br />
To clarify,<br />
<br />
1.) I'm not a sub-human creature that enjoys the torment/insulting of innocent creature/people.<br />
<br />
2.) We always are growing, but I took offense to your comment saying that it's time for me to grow up. Now look at what you did... you made me bust out my large vocabulary and 'mature/intellectual' side. I mean, come on, hardly anyone like to socialize with the guy that sounds like he knows it all :p.<br />
<br />
In other words..<br />

I think I like you now.  Sorry for argueing before I was just having a ****ty day at work and needed something to pass the time.  By me posting like an ass on these boards I prevented myself from killing at least 3 people in real life :-)<br />

     &quot;You don't really know me, but I understand that in this environment you don't need to hold back any feelings or thoughts that you may have.&quot; <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but I do not agree with that statement... I feel that whatever we say on a public board should be worded in a manner that is not offensive to the readers.  You can express any feeling that you may have, but it should be worded with the readers in mind.  (BTW, your last posting was VERY WELL written, and you made you points very well.  You have my respect. (if it matters to you))<br />
<br />
I may have misunderstood your meaning when you gave your age at 17.  If I did that, I appologize.  ( I was assuming you ment that because you were 17, you could post whatever you wanted, MY BAD)  I did not find the baby joke offensive because babies grow up, my real beef againt the kind of humor that degrades the mentally handicapped, is that the mentally hadicapped can not stand up for themselves.  If you ridicule a &quot;Black Person, or a Jewish Person&quot; odds are they will either make a degrading comment back to you, or beat the snot out of you.  The handicapped don't always have those options.<br />
<br />
Please do not think that my rant was against you in any way, the only thing that I have found offensive was that &quot;Picture&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Oh good... I like not having enemies. If you ever need to argue I know plenty of topics to debate on... send me a message if you're pissed off again, lest you defame thineself yet again ;).<br />
<br />
You have my respect. (if it matters to you))<br />

<br />
YESSS!  That's all I care about &gt;=).  You win. And about the quote from me you posted.. I was saying that due to the anonymity of the internet, you are allowed to express yourself totally, and no one can stop you (unless it's really dirty or sumthin, that's where the moderators come in). I'm 16, going to be 17 in mid-July, btw.<br />
<br />
I can FINALLY let this whole thread die =D. .</div></div><hr />
