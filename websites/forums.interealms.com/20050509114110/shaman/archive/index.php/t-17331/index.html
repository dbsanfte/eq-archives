<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello<br />
<br />
Long time ago, levels like 30, 35, 40, 45 were hell levels which required double amount of exp to get out of. As far as I know, that has changed so the levels under 50 are more even, but how is the situation between 50 and 65? Are some levels a lot worse than others, or just the normal story where each level requires a little more exp than the previous?<br />
<br />
I am asking because I found lvl 57 slow, 58 slower and 59 really slow. I fear that the next 6 levels will be ven worse.<br />
<br />
Before somebody mentions the Search function - I have tried to use it (looking for hell + level), but after scanning the first 20 of 263 hits, I gave up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A hell level was previously where the experience multiplier for a level was increased. Because of the way it was applied in EQ, instead of simply making one level harder than the next, it worked out that the experience needed was equivalent to making all the previous levels the same amount harder, and lumping all of that into one level.<br />
<br />
That meant in effect, that the experience required to complete a hell level was more than double that needed for the previous level.<br />
<br />
This applied to 30, 35, 40, 45, but also to 54 and 59 -  the levels before title changes.<br />
<br />
The pre-50 progression was smoothed out first, but the post-50 progression was also smoothed out some time later.<br />
<br />
However, each level post 50 does get progressively harder than the previous level. 59 is still slow, as you've observed, but take it from me, it's not as slow as it used to be. I levelled my ranger to 60 pre-change and my shaman post-change.<br />
<br />
You can always take comfort from the fact that 60 is a breeze. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks you for the reply.<br />
<br />
Knowing that 60 is a breeze, makes it almost bearable to know that I am still missing 85% of lvl 59  :) <br />
<br />
But how about 61-65? Worse than 59?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I wasn't going to mention those - was trying to give you some hope!<br />
<br />
After 60, 61 is tough, but bearable in tier 2. I'd say it's probably around the same as 59. The levels after that get slightly harder, but not a great deal, and go fairly quickly if you're regularly grouping in tier 2/3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye 61-65 are pretty similar to 59 really. I imagine they actually require a higher amount of xp, but because you're often fighting in harder zones by that stage it's less noticeable and feels about the same. 60 will go by so fast you won't even notice it. Seriously. You'll clear it in a morning if you're with a decent group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">59 sucked.  I did 61-65 in less time than it took me to do 59-60. 60 took about 2 hours to get through in PoV.  61-65 was a mixture of HoH. Potactics, and LdoN with a few days of soloing PoI thrown in.  <br />
<br />
Only thing that sucks about leveling that fast through those levels is spells.  Eth parchs were plentiful, specs were harder to come by.  Ended up having to buy a few spells and depleting about 20 levels worth of saving to get them, and still dont have Malos or Q yet.  (Dont care about FA yet and dont have 60+ dots yet; I find I do ok with nukes and rains at this point.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only 1 that seems to be especially tough post 60 is 61 dont know if you do need more exp for it than 62 up or whether it just seems so after the insane exp you get in level 60.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Irks me that by the time you get the proper level for places like BoT, no one wants the ethereal parchments that drop unless they're for twinks.   :mad:   Would be nice if specs dropped more in tier 2 and 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">61 takes some time to get through, but I found 62 to be the longest hell level I had.<br />
<br />
I was 62 for almost 3 weeks.  :(<br />
<br />
63 was a snap given I spent that time in BoT, but 64 took me some time (LDoN just came out, nobody wanted to grind much anymore).<br />
<br />
Now that I'm 65, I've noticed that xp flows pretty nicely.  I keep my AA set for 10% xp and my xp bar still moves noticably after a few hours of grinding.<br />
<br />
Of course, deaths keep pushing it back (dang LDoN wipes), so I'm kinda hovering in my second yellow bubble.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tuibumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was 62 for almost 3 weeks.  :(<br />
<br />
Given the time it took me to reach level 60, this amuses me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bah anything after 59 is a breeze.  It took me FOREVER to go from 56-59, but then 60, 61, and 62 have all been cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">60 isn't that slow...just don't die! The &quot;death penalty&quot; at 60 is insane :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I saw a set of numbers somewhere, don't recall where it was that said how many experience points were needed for each level. The numbers I'm using are not them, but a general approximation from memory, and may be missing a zero or have an extra zero<br />
<br />
57 ~460000 exp points<br />
58 ~580000 exp points<br />
59 ~770000 exp points<br />
60 ~520000 exp points<br />
<br />
I was 58 at the time, and didn't pay too close attention to 61-65, but I'm thinking that 61 was about the same as 59, and 62-65 scaling up along a pretty simple steady curve without any big jumps in it<br />
<br />
Death at 60 seems to cost more because it takes signifigantly less points to get through it. You still lose same amount of exp, but it's coming out of a smaller point pool, so looks like a larger loss. Conversely, your rezzes seem to get you more exp back for the same reason</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hello Abividad<br />
<br />
You are writing:<br />
&quot;Death at 60 seems to cost more because it takes signifigantly less points to get through it. You still lose same amount of exp, but it's coming out of a smaller point pool, so looks like a larger loss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before I started my shaman, I played a cleric for 2 years, and my experience is that you are wrong here. When you die, you loose a fixed percentage of the experience you needed for the previous level. So dying in lvl 60 will cost you a percentage of the huge amount of exp you needed for the lvl 59 hell level. Getting a res at lvl 60 will thus also give you back way more exp.<br />
<br />
But you are correct when saying that it looks worse because it is compared to the smaller amount of exp needed on the current level. <br />

<br />
I wish you well</div></div><hr />
