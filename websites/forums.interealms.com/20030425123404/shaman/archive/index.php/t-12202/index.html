<br />

farina<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
nice item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Farina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thank you for replying solairs,<br />
<br />
so would you say that 100k is a good price?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's no drop .. doesnt look like it is quested.  I smell a scam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Might just be selling loot rights and I would think it is worth 100k if it can truly be equiped in the range slot.<br />
<br />
The dot is only 35hp a tick and that is not great but it is free damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i thought they took the range off of that?<br />
<br />
anyways...sounds like a scam to me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not only is it a no drop item from the High Priest in Ssra (not a quest) it is also exceedingly rare.  My guild has killed the High Priest many times (for example, we have 4 of the moderately rare shields) and we have never had the bone drop.  This definitely sounds like a scam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The first time my guild did HP bone dropped. We only did him a few times after that and never got another. Unless he the seller knew HP was weilding it it must be a scam. But I thought you couldnt see 2handers. And yes it still goes in range slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">darn good range slot. Obviously its not worth taking out your primary and shield slots though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's fun to pull it out of range and bash stuff with it when I am pharming smithing supplies.<br />
<br />
Max hit so far has been 226 :)<br />
<br />
It looks awesome btw (BIG-ASS Groaning Mace graphic on it).<br />
<br />
Only downside is I can't equip it as a weapon AND my 41% haste shield.<br />
<br />
Think I might have to get to go buy a 36% haste item to use with it.<br />
<br />
I agree its pretty damn rare. Out of maybe 10 High Priest kills I have only seen one drop.<br />
<br />
Click dot is handy too for soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dennman007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">out of the 13 kills my guild did we only got 1 dropped. I was the lucky winner<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">or maybe it's just that he plays on the FV server.  I'm not all that familiar with the rules on it, but this might be one of those items that aren't no drop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's a dropped item not a quest, if he's selling MQ rights to it for 100k, he's trying to run a scam.  Simple as that.</div></div><hr />
