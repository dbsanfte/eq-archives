<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goku999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know how to get it? I know it involves a cycle in the corners of the FM, but i haven't seen any posts in other places regarding the names of the mobs that start the cycle. Any help would be appreciated, the extended affliction 3 wud be nice :)<br />
<br />
Info I need:<br />
1. Names of Mobs of the cycle<br />
2. General Area (loc would be nice) in each corner<br />
3. What kind of mob (goblin, giant, etc)<br />
<br />
I know goblin dustscryer is part of cycle, just wondering what the other guys r</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sordar Spiritrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Omg, i saw trhis things go for 10k. Ext. aff. would be real nice, but 10k for that pos? yea right.  Info would be appreciated here too, would like to camp it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my estimate is items with III effects will go up 1k, II will go up 500, I will go up 50-100</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just gave away a damn dustscryer's ball to a low lvl not that long ago too, hahaha<br />
<br />
if you have any friends with tracking willing to help you out, the dustscryer's ball is a pretty common drop in the FM cycle</div></div><hr />

The secret of the cycle...... <br />
<br />
ok.. i know this cycle by heart, and with danger of inflation of this items.. (I hardly do it anymore anyways :)here it is: <br />
<br />
The cycle includes the 3 corners of the zone, SE (fort), SW (BW ent) and NW (droga ent) in that order... Track is almost a must. First thing is to patrol the 3 corners, preferably bind at SE corner to be able to speed up travel time. <br />
<br />
The mobs thats in the cycle are: <br />
<br />
SE corner: blugtugin/A goblin raider/goblin herbcollector/Rockwolf/wandering stonehealer/goblin trailblazer/goblin chieftain/goblin iksar slayer <br />
<br />
SW corner: Joojooga/mountain giant hillock/mountain giant prospector/Goblinstomper/overseer Miklek/gromlok/(krenlek(might be sarnak cycle though.. havent dont it in ages)) <br />
<br />
NW corner: Dustback/a burynai miner/Burynai grand cenobiter/gemeye/eboneyes/burynai treasure seeker/stonegrinder <br />
<br />
usually the next one after the kill is on top of track in the next corner (as its the latest spawn), so its easy to pinpoint it even if its a common mob... <br />
In the cases that theres no special named mobs on track its usuallly the raider, hillock or bury miner that are up... In the case of the gob raider in the se corner make notice that the one in the cycle are spelled &quot;A&quot; goblin raider in comparison with the others that are without A in front... burynai miners are common in zone, but not in nw corner... if u only got one on track standing close to nw corner that prolly it (as a druid... im not sure of the trackrange of rangers and (bards))... The hillock is the tricky one.. it doesnt stand out from the rest in any ways... but if you just kill of the 2-4 hillocks in the area around the spawn&quot;pit&quot; in SW corner you prolly got him, and can proceed to NW corner... <br />
<br />
and voila.. youre in the game... happy huntin <br />

I knew I had seen that post somewhere, btw guess who's druid has a crystal ball in range and have been too lazy to upgrade it for the last 56 lvls :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What level is the mob? FV server has TLC soooo if hes green to me i would have to get someone else to kill =/  but longer dots is pretty darn cool.</div></div><hr />

Took about 5 casts of Ebolt to get the Dustscryer's Crystal Ball to trigger. Works the same for Root for some reason, with some casts triggering it, and some not. <br />
<br />
With Turgur's it seems to work every cast. <br />
<br />
<br />
I think all focus item have aren't 100% and have some %chance to trigger the effect, this make focus item isn't as good as it advertise</div></div><hr />

<br />
Check the first post.   You really need track to do this cycle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just gave a DS ball away 2 days ago...grr.<br />
<br />
Oh well, it went to a guildie's twink so I don't really mind, but I sure could have used the money :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't feel too bad - I bet this is one of the items that's getting toned down.  Hopefully, Necklace of Superiority will be getting bumped up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Way back when, I had a mage - and when I was in my high 20's - someone shouted &quot;dustcryers at etc&quot;  I went over and he GAVE it to me.  I remember that thing having basically some decent resists and that was about it.  <br />
<br />
What has changed on that item such that it's worth 10K?  It wasn't a great item by any means...<br />
<br />

*EDIT* I can't check allakhazams at work - it's blocked :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The FM cycle is easy to do, but nevermind...<br />

the ball is now mana save II.</div></div><hr />
