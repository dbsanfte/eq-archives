<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raravis123</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking about purchasing a Fungi Staff and have some questions.    First off, does it stack with the Fungi Tunic effect?  And what I really wanted to know is, I realize it kills your sow, but what about if you have a horse?  Does it make it disappear?   Or do you keep your horse and not lose any movement speed?  <br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It stacks with the tunic.  Your horse is unaffected.<br />
<br />
In fact, horsies seem to make you immune to a lot of movement  changes.  Just like when SoW'd/Eagle'd you still move at horsie rate, I've been snared and could still move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haven't tried this in a while but if you cast SoW and then regen(regrowth etc) you can then use the fungi staff to override sow and actually have 2 regen spells up. Was pretty fun when soloing in DL, mad HP regen with that and a fungi tunic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It got &quot;fixed&quot; several patches ago.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried it since they just redid all the spell stacking &quot;rules&quot; last patch.  It's worth trying again...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fission</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just because i like being 100% sure about things, the effect on the staff does not stack with anything in the regeneration line, correct?  <br />
<br />
I know it used to, but was told it was changed.  Would love to know, was thinking bout buying one, but wont bother if there's no stacking.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Think it doesn't stack anymore, but I still find the fungi staff very useful for coming back after a raid wipe-out or just after any rez.  I get some regen going immediately to help me cast that first torpor, which can mean a lot, and then it doesn't hurt to have regen as I try to get the rest of my mana/health going.<br />
<br />
It even takes up a junk slot while waiting for rez effects icon to drop so I can keep my focus of spirit icon further down.  Good for people who can't do canni 5 without focus -- I hate having focus right at the bottom of my buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Back when I had fungi staff/tunic combo they stacked just fine. But thanks to gouging prices on torpor back then, I had to sell my fungi that I earned camping the thing myself..before the exp bonuses and major drop rate nerf. Paid 93k for torpor... omg I'm poor now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ACtually, the staff does seem to affect my glue factory horse.  With staff on, it can only walk.  However, even with staff on the fastest horse runs at top speed (I keep glue factory for color choice on raids...)</div></div><hr />
