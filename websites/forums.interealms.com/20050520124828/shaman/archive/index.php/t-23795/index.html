<br />
Follow-up Patch <br />
------------------- <br />
There were a few items we inadvertantly left off the initial patch message. We apologize for any inconveniences. <br />
<br />
Mob Level Limits <br />
------------------- <br />
As we did with the dragons in the old world, we have decided to implement a level cap on certain high-end creatures in other expansions. The following should and will always remain raid encounters and will not be accessible to players over level 65: <br />
<br />
Trakanon (no more 30 hp vp key)<br />
Venril Sathir <br />
Gorenaire <br />
Severilous <br />
Talendor <br />
Velketor the Sorcerer <br />
Klandicar <br />
Zlandicar <br />
Lord Yelinak <br />
Dain Frostreaver IV <br />
King Tormax (this is BS)<br />
Derakor the Vindicator (this is BS X2)<br />
<br />
<br />
PoP Corpse Summoning <br />
------------------- <br />
Following a death in any of the Planes of Power zones, you may summon your own corpse to the graveyard by selecting your character and using the /summonself command. <br />
<br />
<br />
Cross-zone Corpse Summoning <br />
------------------- <br />
You may now have your corpse summoned across zone lines. The summon will work with existing corpse summoning spells, but will require a star ruby for a regent along with the appropriate coffin. A corpse that is summoned across zone lines cannot be ressurected. <br />
<br />
<br />
Plead Command <br />
------------------- <br />
If your character gets aggro from an &quot;intelligent&quot; NPC, you will be able to use the plead command. This command would be equivalent to someone pleading for their life. This command will only work if you, your group, or your raid did not attack the NPC you are pleading with. If the NPC grants you this plea, you will be given temporary good standing faction with all factions the NPC is aligned with. During this 30-second period, you will not be attacked by, nor can you attack any NPCs with those factions in that zone. The plead command will not work if you have maximum bad faction with the NPC. The plead command will not work with non-intelligent NPCs such as spiders, wolves, etc.<br />

<br />

I doubt highly that its a real patch message, but if it is, tha tmakes it 10 times funnier</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, let's apply a little logic here.<br />
<br />
1.  It's September 18th or 19th or something right now.<br />
2.  The patch message says 14 September.<br />
3.  Do you recall seeing this patch message four or five days ago?  If yes, go to step 4.  If no, go to step 5.<br />
4.  Stop smoking crack<br />
5.  There's your answer.</div></div><hr />
