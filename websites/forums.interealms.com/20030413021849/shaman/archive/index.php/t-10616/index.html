folding bearskin bag (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3788&amp;source=Test) <br />
<br />
Yay and stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ZernSaintwinter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">are these spells? or items you buy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">so these are in game? test server? or just their lil ol database?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For spell effects, if they're in Lucy's database then they're in EQ's database (and vice-versa).  There may not be any working recipes or any vendors with the items in question, so we may not be able to get our hands on them in game, but they exist.  <br />
<br />
If you look at the top left corner of the Lucy page, you see that there's a link titled Live Servers and the words Test Server in bold next to that.  That means that you're currently looking at info for the Test Server.  If you wanted to search the Live Servers you could click that link.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My guess is that there will be a tinkering recipe for this added soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Should be an Alchemy crafted item, not Tinkering.  Or even better, dual effects on our Grandmaster token - might make it worth getting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well - the &quot;upgraded&quot; rogue GM assasins vial - has summon the 10slot combine poison bag thing... <br />
<br />
Maybe we get a quest this time to get a similiar item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">omg! its on lucy's live section now! i know while the effects got patched on live servers doesnt mean the items themselves are &quot;live&quot;. but i know i am gonna start looking!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Smokejaguar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I heard these were live now, but the recipe is as yet undiscovered.  We need to threaten those little gnomes to try harder at discovering the formula.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The spell is live, the actual tradeskill item may not be live yet. I can't for it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At last.  Post the recipes asap so we can get making them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">BUMP!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">bump!<br />
<br />
any info on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Check the tailoring part here: http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/LoYrecipes.htm#tailor<br />
<br />
Yes they're live and they can be made pretty easy too!<br />
<br />
Also there is now a &quot;geerlok alchemy set&quot; just under Tinkering!<br />
<br />
With the new potions (especially Illusion and gate probably) it *might* be worth doing alchemy again, but we'll have to see how prices will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">FYI the Wormwood ingredient cost 78p plus some change.  Trivial is greater than 155.  I successfully made Essence of Ogre and Human.<br />
<br />
The folding bags are a pain in the arse because the ribbon you need to make them is no-drop :(  It's tailoring skill btw.  Only place I know to buy the ribbons is Gulf of Gunthark at the Lighthouse.<br />
<br />
Sigh.  Coulda been fun.  But true to form, overpriced.<br />
<br />
Dye's on the other hand are about 30p to make and can be done with Pottery and Alchemy skill.  Dyes are trivial under 155 for alchemy.  Pottery trivial is relatively low too I  believe.  Similar fail rate to alchemy tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shakurae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The foldable bags are NOT working! I am getting &quot;you cannot combine these items in this container type!&quot; I have /bug'd it. I hope they fix it soon.<br />
<br />
*edit - I made the bags myself and that worked fine. It's the actual potion combine that is not working. Couldn't make Null Potions in the Medicine bag. Had to use my old bag. Then couldn't make a 10-dose potion in the Bearskin Bag. Had to use my old bag here also. Glad I didn't sell them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm, they weren't working for me on Test, but I posted a message to EQTraders and was assured that they were working for people on production servers.<br />
<br />
I tried to combine 10 sow potions in the folded bearskin bag, no go.  Tried to make a sow potion in the folded potion bag, no go.  So far for me, they're just a way to summon bags to put stuff in... but it sounds like most people on production servers don't have this problem?<br />
<br />
*EDIT* Is working for me now.  But others posting at EQTraders are having this problem, no idea why only a few people run into it so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They aren't working for Kilva's Skin of Flame.  I just destroyed my bearskin bag, so now I'm stuck.  Grrr!  Don't they bother to read the reports from test before they go live with this stuff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Per Niami at EQ Traders, who heard from the folks in charge, next patch should fix the non-LoY recipes in the folding bags.  Link is here (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=4458).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What is the advantage of these over the standard ones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">when they will be fixed.. :)<br />
<br />
you will be able to save room if you do multiple tradeskills. no need anymore to have all bags in bank.. just have the folded ones in 1 bag and unfold them when ya need to use it.<br />
<br />
you will just need to have one or 2 free slots in your inventory.. unfold the bag you need for you tradeskill, then destroy it after..</div></div><hr />
