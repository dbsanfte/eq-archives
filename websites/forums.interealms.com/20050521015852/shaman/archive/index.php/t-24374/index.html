<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Still trying to identify any specific buffs/discs that spirit of might has a stacking issues with. I know there was a concern that might and champion are icon stacking but not actually adding when parsed. Also have seen champion drop off when a rogue used a disc while might and champion were on. We've been unable to reproduce that (so don't know if it was a bug or not).<br />
<br />
searched for &quot;might&quot; on all the threads but couldnt find anything listed, think someone brought this up before, but have seen nothing else on it since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stacking from Lucy data (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/stacking.html?id=5404&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
While might and champion stack (in the sense that they dont overwrite each other), the largest of the effects probably is the default setting. Haste pretty much operates in the same way, you can have as many as 3 different haste spells on you at any one time, but only the largest one takes effect, the others dont have an effect even though the buff is still on you. It's not a bug, its just the way the spells work.<br />
<br />
According to the Lucy data champion will only be overwritten by one of the monk discs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just seems odd to make champion our 4th 70 spell and might our 6th 70 spell if they were never meant to stack. sorta like, why is there even a 6th spell then?<br />
<br />
just curious for any discs or buff stacking issues ppl have seen or observed. the rogue disc was a 69 disc that caused the issue, could have a been a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not really, might is intended to last a long time whereas champion is short term. I suppose the thinking is that you would have might up for trash and champion for the named. If that is the case, then you dont really want one overwriting the other since it would mean that you would have to rebuff after champion faded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You've got a talent there, Tugela. You see good things in everything.<br />
<br />
Tell me that duellist killing might is a good thing too, please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Whats your point Giac? It's just one of those things I guess, people using those discs need to make a strategic decision as to when they are going to use them so the maximize damage, thats all. Of course it would be more convienent from a re-buffing perspective if the buff used a slot outside the first 6 (then it would be negated by the higher disc, but not overwritten). Maybe it was an oversight, maybe it was done like that delibrately to introduce a judgement call aspect, who knows. just work around it, its not a big deal. Use Druids to redo the buff if you dont want to ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">currently there are one big stack issue with Spirit of Might, because it don't stack with melee best dps disc, that is : <br />
Innerflame Discipline(monk) - 100% damage modifier<br />
Fellstrike Discipline(war) - 100%damage modifier disc<br />
Duelist Discipline(rogue) - 100% damage modifier disc<br />
Bestial Fury Discipline(beast) - 100% damage modifier disc<br />
Blind Rage Discipline(berserker) - 100% damage modifier disc<br />
<br />
well, it is ok if the effect don't stack with above disc, but worse part if above disc will dispell Spirit of Might, that mean all above melee will ask for SoM buff everytime after a disc fight, it is really suck since how can a disc pell off a buff. and SoE only care when they received 1 millions feedback</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So far the only use I have found for might is to buff my pet, can't use it on other's pets b/c it blocks their buffs.  And I dont use barky the wundermutt often.</div></div><hr />
