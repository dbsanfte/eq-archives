<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>newbranjah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why is it tracking can not be used in Alphabetical order?  Was it deemed too easy for rangers and druids to farm named using it that way?  It just seems like a huge hastle to go through 90 blues looking for one damn name among them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Peatnallie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ahh, you get used to it in time. After tracking for over 4382748329 million times, my eyes sorta adjusted to finding names on the list :\. If it were alphabetical, it would only make it slightly easier, but not by much. It doesn't take me more than 30 seconds to search through 100 mobs for a mob, call me crazy if at times I repeat the name of the mob I'm searching for :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">tracksort by con when doing this. It tends to group same-named mobs in the same vicinity, and makes it a lot easier to skip over them as a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tracking's never been usable in Alphabetical order.  Although I've wished for it many times.  Just give thanks that you can sort it at all, or see more than 20 mobs at a time! :)<br />
<br />
Although when going into an empty zone that's not been farmed, use /tracksort normal.  Mobs will group together alot that way.  If it's been farmed or hunted in a lot then that makes it more difficult...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tracking in ssra sucks major donkey parts.<br />
Just wanted to spit out that bit of randomishness here. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rezz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tracking indoors is irritating.<br />
<br />
If you constantly read the track, you begin to be able to flip between a couple of settings and get a general layout on what is up and what isn't AND where it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>magimix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If I could make a tracking wishlist (it would be a fairly short list admittedly)  I would add (as well as the alpha sort) the ability to get feedback on how distant a mob is to you.<br />
<br />
You can sort by distance yes, but that nearest mob could be miles away, or just behind the hill you are next to.  It would be nice if you had some text strings that indicated distance relative to the width of your tracking area maybe.<br />
<br />
Something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
The tracks are very new - the target is close.<br />
<br />
...all the way down to...<br />
<br />
The tracks are very faint, you can barely read them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sorronn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tracking by distance seems to fail to account for Z axis differences. I say this because I get some screwy tracks in Ssra where a templar might be 20 paces in front of me by a named is on the next floor somewhere and shows as closer. And I know the vertical distance is larger than the horizontal distance in this case.<br />
<br />
The net result is that in multi-story structures like Ssra, tracking yields less than optimal results.<br />
<br />
Now Verant probably wants it that way for &quot;balance&quot; reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lucor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think it would be nice to be able to track a mob, a NPC or PC, by typing its name in a dialog box instead :)<br />
