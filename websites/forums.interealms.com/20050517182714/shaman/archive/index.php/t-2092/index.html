Greetings Adventurers!<br />
<br />
Open up new solo gameplay possibilities you've only dreamed about. Got two computers? Use the free account key provided in this email and your existing software to start a second account and play two characters together -- at the same time! How cool would it be to build a cleric or druid of your own and have them at your fingertips for buffs, healing and more? Or better yet, get a friend to join you by giving him or her this free account key. Now your friend has no excuse not to come adventure with you. Or even better still, invite a family member. Remember, the family that plays together stays together.<br />
<br />
Whatever direction you choose to go, you can't go wrong! Below is an EverQuest Trilogy account key that will open a new EQ account for a FREE 30 DAY TRIAL. Take advantage of this opportunity to enrich your EverQuest experience before this promotion expires on June 30th, 2002. The enclosed account key is good for a free 30-day subscription (regular account charges applicable thereafter) and requires the EverQuest Trilogy software.<br />
<br />
Your EverQuest Trilogy Account Key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br />
<br />
Internet Connection Required; players are responsible for all applicable internet fees. Valid credit card or unused EverQuest game card required for registration. For this limited promotional period (until June 30th, 2002), we hereby authorize you to use, or make one copy of, or loan your EverQuest software to one person -- together with the account key referenced above -- to open or enable another to open one new EverQuest account. All accounts, including the new account permitted herein, are subject to the EverQuest User Agreement and Software License.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well, if its from someone @sony.com its prob very legit<br />
<br />
if its from xoxo@iwantyourmoney.com then i wouldnt trust it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It shows from @station.sony.com no links in email except to terms of service, nothing to download, just an account key for old world, velious and kunark...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I recieved one as well...appears legit, and pretty tacky, if you ask me.<br />
<br />
How cool would it be to build a cleric or druid of your own and have them at your fingertips for buffs, healing and more? <br />
<br />
Translation:  Have your own heal-monkey or port-b*tch.  They make the perfect class to 'bot'.<br />
<br />
I can only imagine how the Druids Grove will (rightfully) go through the roof on this.<br />
<br />
Or even better still, invite a family member. Remember, the family that plays together stays together. <br />
<br />
How old was the ad exec that came up with this crappy jingle?<br />
<br />
I'm disappointed.  Guess that means I'm getting uber. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can anyone using EQW to play 2 accounts on one computer advise me if:<br />
<br />
a) it's a feasible way to play 2 chars? (shaman + monk/sk/ranger...etc)<br />
<br />
b) it would run ok on a P3 650, 64 Gforce II, 512 mb ram box?<br />
<br />
Been thinking of doing this for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeh i have been slowly building up a second PC with views to doing this at some stage.  <br />
<br />
I don't think you would have too many problems running EQ on a box with the spec's you have listed there Darj :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey Wal :D<br />
<br />
Should clarify: I meant using the one box to play 2 accounts at the same time. EQ runs ok on my computer, but can be laggy in SoL. I'm wondering if i will be able to run another account at the same time using EQW with my current setup, or if i will have to wait for an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kappy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yeah, a few suggestions. First off take off velious\antonica\kunark retextures, second take off new models.<br />
third, if its still to laggy, uninstal SoL. Takes about 5 mins to reinstall without textures, so just install it when you have to go there. If you spend more time in SoL than non SoL, not really a viable option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The way *I* look at it, there is not a snowballs chance in Hell this is legit. Call me the doom sayer, but I can not see Sony giving away account keys just for laughs. I am not sure who is scamming or why, but I highly suggest you report it =\<br />
<br />
Also, it is very possible the @sony address is a fake, as crafty internet people can easily make their email address look like one that isn't theirs... check the full email header to find out where the actual originator is.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just a note, though I would wonder how they got your email addy, it would be funny if someone was just feeling very giving......hmm..... nah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm pretty sure this is very legit because http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4315  I think its an excuse for them to get more accounts going for people who didn't want to buy the whole cd's just for the cd codes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I guess you showed me =P  I am quite surprised, to say the least......hmm<br />
<br />
Oh well, I already run 2 accounts, and I certainly don't need another ;-)  But thanks for the correction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is no free lunch.<br />
<br />
Maybe they want to attract ever more folks to duo boxing to get even more cash. Duos are so damn common these days. I guess the legends server was a correct move from VI all duoers have proven that without pain folks would pay twice the regular already...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">well it is only for a 30 day trial account.<br />
<br />
I would still send an email to sony or the dev boards to confirm.<br />
I never believe it when people send me &quot;free&quot; anything, there is always a catch or scam involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah it's the 30 days that its a catch. They trust that you get hooked in 30days of freetime to double boxing or having some real family person or friend/relative try it.<br />
<br />
But if they write You got two computers? It's not many that have 2 computers at home (which are both able to run this resource hog game), but many have machines that can dual box with :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Could be either<br />
<br />
But my mate also has a CD with EQ on it which he got from a computer mag with a months trial free on it.  Only has the old world on.<br />
<br />
Gotta watch Emailed stuff tho as there are alot of scammers around there just looking to rip off your other accounts and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If they're giving away 30 day free trials on magazine coverdiscs, I guess it's more cost effective for them to give away 30 day free trials via email too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Brog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Basically, all they are giving away is the $29.95 they charge for the Trilogy box set. When you buy the box, you get 30 day trial free. If you want Luclin, you still have to buy that expansion.<br />
<br />
Asheron's Call is including a free copy of the game and 30 days free inside boxes of Dungeon Siege. Its basically marketing. Give up $29.95 (Of which you split with the store, distribution house, manufacturing, ... and Sony ends up with like a dollar or two) and gain a new customer at $12.95 a month, and hope they stay for a long time.<br />
<br />
What better way to advertise than with the currently hooked people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The first hit is always free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sounds legit to me. The reason I don't think it's a scam is because it doesn't do any of they typical things a scamm would do to benifit the scammer. IE email your acount info somewhere etc. If it is a scammer all they could do with this is waste a bit of your time by getting you to try and activate an account with a bad cd key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Shoot. This is the smartest thing they ever did as far as making more money for themselves. People who want 2 accounts already do it anyway. So they took the attitude of &quot;let's embrace it and make more money off of it&quot;.<br />
<br />
You get free 30 days. Get hooked on the extra Evercrack and now you buy 2 things of Evercrack every month.<br />
<br />
Sony is not the big dog on the block for nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have a second account already, but it does not have Velious or Luclin.  My primary account has Velious and Luclin already.  Does anyone know if I can use the free code to add Velious to my existing second account?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">yes it should work tarelan.</div></div><hr />
