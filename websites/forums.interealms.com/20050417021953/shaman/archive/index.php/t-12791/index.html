<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pleh1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got a friend who just came back to Eq and so he's doin warrior and i'm goin to try helpin him get up in levels... (Currently our circle of friends is runnin a Ranger who's the tank, and how we wouldnt love a warrior (61st Ranger, Cleric, Enchanter, Druid, 52nd Shammy).<br />
<br />
So since i'm only goin to be the one helpin him plvl for a few (52nd shammy), wondering where you would recommend for the best exp, most mobs (hate waitin on camps) and where a shaman could help him lvl best.  He's an ogre (so faction is some issue).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">wats his lv (war) <br />
well anyways ill drop some of the places i pled my char<br />
<br />
1-7 newbie grounds<br />
7-15 ish warrens<br />
15-26 paladual (usually over camped though but super fast exp)<br />
26-30 GD tizmaks<br />
31-40ish tofs (need keys usually open)<br />
41-50ish (l guk usually camped for facation hits...but great)<br />
50-53 velks<br />
53-60 pon/pod/poj<br />
60-65 planes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1-7 newbie area<br />
7-25 Paludal Caverns (start at Shadeweaver's side and move to Shadowhaven)<br />
25-40 SolA, Anything that moves, but the higher into lvl30 you get you'll have to do Clockworks and Gnomes <br />
40-50 Dulak's Harbor, Anything that moves - have him help you do your Stoicism Quest, if you haven't finished it already<br />
<br />
Just keep him buffed and healed.  He'll level so fast that you wont be able to keep all his skills up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pleh1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He's 24th now.<br />
<br />
Been doin MM atm, pullin stuff from down the tunnel leadin to the House...<br />
<br />
Great exp really, mobs easy (HP no where near the hp of other expansion mobs).  <br />
<br />
Never really thought of Lower Guk... Guess about 40th there would be good or would you instead think that doing Sol B would be better?<br />
<br />
Biggest thing I guess I might have to worry about is just the option for trains... (gosh i hate em)....  So in MM i pull cuz I can single pull em with Drowsy (20 mana and small slow so helps him tank), where as in later zones Some will be blue and thus more mobs will come.<br />
<br />
Appreciate the help</div></div><hr />
