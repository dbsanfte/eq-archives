<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes... but with the requirements to get to a position where one can acquire the upgrades to Cani and Q, I am sorry that I bought it. I'm only glad I maxed alchemy while I had the chance. And no, I'm not gonna flood anyone's market selling potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no<br />
and damn glad I didnt spend the cash on it either, the rave was much more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bought it for the hell of it........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I didn't, I don't see what's in it for me.  I currently have no plans to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a couple of accounts...I bought it for my warrior to get the HP AA. I haven't bought it for my other 2 accounts and probably won't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Didn't buy it not going to!<br />
Nothing at all for the casual player. Besides I am currently regretting I bought ldon</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a casual player and I was pissed about LDON for a bit up until recently.  I have gone on a few adventures and its actually quite fun and it only took an hour.  Give it another shot...you may like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yes, but only because of Sony sneaky little purchase without a confirm button upon login. I was not paying attention and all of a sudden I got a you will need to restart EQ to run Gates of Discord message.... evil bastages</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep preordered it.<br />
<br />
Day after it went live i was 1 of 100's of people who got the &quot;Problem with billing&quot; email.Got a weeks grace from SoE to reorder it so in that week got my Alchemy maxed out those last 10 points explored Natimbi and thought &quot;nah **** this i dont need this expansion&quot; and never bothered reordering it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">GoD is part of my guild's progression plan, so I purchased it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah i bought it.  Disapointed? yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did... and have been to the GoD zones ONCE.  Waste of money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It could be really good for highend if they took a extra TWO months made the quests/progression work! Every step forward is another discouraging bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes and no.  I didn't buy it, but a well meaning wife did.  I installed and thanked her.  I might be stupid, but I'm not crazy.<br />
I've not seen any reason to go yet, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes here as well, only got it to finally max Alchemy and only got it 'cause Circuit City had it for 20$ and no shipping and handeling :D<br />
I am also going to go do a few trials in the coming weeks, I still have a lot of LDON stuff I want to round out before I head that direction.<br />
<br />
Didn't buy it not going to!<br />
Nothing at all for the casual player. Besides I am currently regretting I bought ldon<br />
<br />
LDON is made for the casual player, look at my magelo, at the beginning of LDON I was level 61, had 6 AA had crap gear, and usually 2 boxed a rogue or duoed with some RL friends, now I am 200+ wins, 11k+ adventure points, all the Incorp Chain pieces I want and currently grinding away at augments that I want....and I am as casual as they come, I usually play 3hrs a day never play weekends, and while I play I have my 6 month old sit on my lap laughing at all the pretty colors :p<br />
Check it out, it really is worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes, from a guild point of view the raids are a lot of fun and have some unusual boss encounters.<br />
Loot is very impressive, with some pieces from kod taz equal to quarm.<br />
However for single kt group farms and trials all they have achieved is an enforcement of the holy trinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bought it for 1 out of 3 accounts, went there for snare potions, found out they dont stack, left, haven't been back.  If our new heals go live though, I suppose I'm going to have to start spending time there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes, and i like this extension</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">yes and i regret it ,i hate the holy trinity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">GoD is part of my guild's progression plan, so I purchased it.<br />
<br />
Ditto.  My guild is doing trials there and wants to progress there, so I have to have it.  I got my alchemy from 145 to 200 and I have nothing else to show for it but a couple aa of exp from trials and many, many wasted hours fighting difficult and boring encounters and losing on loot.  <br />
<br />
I liked LDON, and PoP...  in fact, I've liked most of the expansions, though I'm not a big LoY fan.  But I just hate GoD so far.  I really don't find it to be fun in any way, and I don't care what kind of loot drops there if I am not enjoying myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bought on after a friend told me he raised his alchemy for like free almost. Glad I maxed alchemy before it was &quot;tuned&quot;.<br />
Been there maybe 3 or 4 times. We went after Weapon Master Vtiink Vzaan, and like the good shaman I am died before I got the flag =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Bought it, been 3 times. If I had it to do all over again (knowing what I know no), wouldn't have purchased it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Winterfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">And I'm glad I did. When I'm not raiding I'm spending all of my time in GoD expeditions. I've won every sewer trial and am working now on the vxed and tipt trials (hoping to be flagged for Kod'Taz this weekend), and the sense of accomplishment is quite satisfying.<br />
<br />
The action is great, it demands the very best play from every member of the group, there is very little margin for error. The environments are gorgeous, Barindu is kind of CT'ish with mayan temples and flowing vines and there's danger in every step, the tension is palpable. The missions are a nice change of pace from the bland generic missions of ldon, and offer some interesting tactical options. I think I've won the first sewer trial about 3 different ways and each time is an improvement on the last. I can win trial 3 in 30 minutes now with the right group, and the discoveries that led to that point were very fun to sort out. Even the apprehension associated with with just *getting* to an expedition alive is welcome, it's a thrill every time. I love to hate that roaming see-invis dog in the Barindu hallway, and I've got the run to Ferubi zone hard coded into memory now from the times that invis has dropped in the courtyard or an archer has waltzed by. Hah!<br />
<br />
Are there things I don't like? Hell yes. CR is a pain in the butt, it should *never* be the case that a wipe = game over, it's so discouraging. I don't like that they gave big raiding guilds an opportunity to completely bypass the sewer trials in order to advance to the mountain trials. Make everyone pay their dues, I say! The sewer environments could have been a lot less repetitive. I certainly agree with most of the sentiments expressed here that the &quot;enhancements&quot; for Shaman class are flimsy (I don't see myself buying any of the GoD AA's for a while, if ever). In fact, it's hard as hell to get any kind of rewards, the drops are so scarce. The kill-reward ratio truly sucks. There is very little to be excited about if your main hope was enhancements to your class or easy new loot.<br />
<br />
But for me, the bottom line ultimately is the action. I came to play, and GoD offers me some of the most satisfying game time I've experienced in a long time in this game. Hah, I dont' think I'll ever be able to go back and sit in the HoH basement for 5 hours grinding again. Why should I, when I can get better experience having the fun I'm having in GoD expeditions?<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm glad I bought it.<br />
