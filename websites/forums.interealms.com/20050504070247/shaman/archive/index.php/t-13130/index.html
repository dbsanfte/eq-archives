<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I was playing the other night and was kinda bored and figured I could try to see if any &quot;fun&quot; targets were up.<br />
<br />
I took my 65shm and 65wizzy, twoboxing, to check on phinny and someone beat me to it then I figured maybe lodi would be up but nope.<br />
Then when I sat in IC looking at all the snow and trying to really think of fun targets I could check and see if they were up for a challange or just for a chance at some cool loot.<br />
<br />
But just couldnt come up with any so I ended up going to SF and killed acouple of GWs......well that was not fun actually really boring :)<br />
<br />
So what kind of targets could I check on when I am bored and dont feel like exping in pov or bot or whatever. Targets I could take with my wizzy and shm or maybe get a few friends together, nomore then say 4 or 6 ppl max tho.<br />
<br />
Here are my two magelos so you see what I could and not could do if that is needed for harder targets......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dozekar, 6 people.  Always fun, but a long ass fight.<br />
I'd love to try Rumblecrush too(with 6), you'd have to get him slowed before anyone even thought about engaging him.  Though I think I remember seeing him rampage, so that might make things a little harder.<br />
<br />
Radir and Tawro were always fun 1 group things when SoL came out, might be worth a shot to see if you could drop either one of them duo now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get Rumblecrush debuffed (either bard, malo line or tash is good) then slowed immediately after when he's at pull spot. Then start running! Get all debuffers zoned out to clear rampage while the MA gets agro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Adds to the spice =)  1 dt every 60 seconds (first one on inc), so you're guaranteed to lose someone, you'd better kill him before a 2nd goes off or it's gonna go downhill.</div></div><hr />

I believe that zoning will not remove you from the rampage list.  only thing that will is killing it.<br />
<br />
As for targets, VanDyn in AK is doable by 6.  Restless burrower used to be but not sure what is there now.  There is the Rat guy in the PoD caves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From experience, it does :)<br />
I've successfully done so and rezoned immediately without any problems with agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From experience, it absolutely DOES NOT.<br />
<br />
Rampage is imprinted. Even camping out will not remove you. The only things that will are memblurs or your death. Unless you become MA I guess :) <br />
<br />
If you were on rampage and then lost it, I suspect you moved out of melee range of the mob and stayed there.</div></div><hr />

Must have just been a fluke the 3 or 4 times we did it then....I may have been out of melee range but the bard who oosed first then zoned out and back in again certainly wasn't ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
He may not have rampaged before the bard zoned, the list isn't set until rampage goes off the first time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then run fast to get the method I said earlier to work, never seen it fail before.</div></div><hr />
