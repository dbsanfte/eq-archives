<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello friends!<br />
Lately I have been thinking about begining to lead raids, ive done it before (If any of you remember my epic worrys I posted I lead a very successful fear)  However I noticed that on BristleBane the BB raiders have apparently pretty much died and no one really does it anymore.  A guy named &quot;Ammek&quot; led a terrific Grummus raid, everyone had a great time and we were gonna do Paffa but he was elusive.  Anyway I have wondered if anyone has some KEY tips/pointers to leading a PoP raid, I dont have much experience and would love to lead em to let the peoples of BB get flags and any loot.  I have noticed there have been none of these so as I said I would love to begin to lead em against things like Grummus, Manaetic Behemoth etc...   So if you have any good feedback please let me know, I would love to hear all of your input and if you got any links feel free to post em, thanks friends!  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're talking about regular raids for the community, perhaps consider setting up a forum for it and making it a more organised thing. I've helped with this on AB, the organisation is called Scarab. We've not done much in PoP beyond PoI dragon, PoN maze, PoS giants (for BoT access) etc but a similar idea should work.<br />
<br />
The key thing for us is that it runs across all guild boundaries. The downside is that those who know how to raid tend to be in raiding guilds, and may have to leave at short notice, but we get lots of our members from smaller family guilds which just don't have the numbers/levels for raiding and they really gain a lot of fun from it all.<br />
<br />
If you're just talking about the odd open raid, then the biggest problem is probably keeping the idiots from causing a wipe. There's normally one or two on most pickup raids, you either need to identify and kick em, or put them in a group with someone you trust can keep then out of way of trouble.<br />
<br />
Try to get a class-leader for key classes (cleric, shaman, druid, pullers, tanks) that you know and trust, and don't be afraid to delegate tasks to them. Don't try to do everything yourself. Get class leaders to arrange channels for their class, to coordinate buffs, debuffs, MGBs etc.<br />
<br />
Forming groups can be a nightmare. Just assign group leaders (pref. people you know) and tell them to grab a balanced group including a healer (but not more than 2). Then just tweak afterwards if required.<br />
<br />
Channel discipline is important too. Setup a channel for people to chat in, and keep a channel seperate for raid orders from yourself, pullers, MA etc. Possibly consider a channel for group leaders but be wary of channel overload! Too many and it gets confusing.<br />
<br />
Give clear and simple orders, repeat them often, and don't hesitate to state the obvious. You'll be amazed how many people don't know what an MA is, or how to /assist, or not to heal the monk just before he FDs on a pull. Sad, but true if you're doing open raids with different people every time.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps somewhat, good luck! For specific mob stats see the SoW site Stolas linked - its very useful.</div></div><hr />

BWA HAHAHAHAHA!<br />
<br />
Sorry.  Not exactly a fan of Seaotter-led raids.  Being on any event led by him almost made me quit EQ forever out of sheer disgust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't agree with the group makeup suggestions on that thread.<br />
<br />
MT group is usually 5 warriors + 1 bard.  You need 3 things on your tank, all of which a bard provides:<br />
Resists maxed (Psalm of Veeshan)<br />
Overhaste (Rizlona, Muse, or Trusik)<br />
Damage Shield (Warsong of Zek and Psalm of Veeshan)<br />
<br />
Certain fights benefit from 5 clerics + 1 Necro (Ofossa the enlightened, Arch Mage Yozzanni, Time Terris/Saryrn where there are nearby caster mobs that can be mind wracked).  try to put a druid or paladin (or extra cleric) in every group. In certain fights (Baltador the cursed, Tantissala Jaggedtooth, Quarm) you want to put DPS classes with a shaman, so you can quickly cure the AE with Blood of Nadox.</div></div><hr />
