<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's a bit embarrassing to ask but probably more embarrassing if I never knew ;)<br />
How do I target a group that i'm not in so that I can cast group buffs on them?<br />
I don't mean like with MGB where I do ALL the groups around me, I just mean one group at a time.<br />
Need to know for raids and somehow I can't figure it out, I tried just selecting their group leader but it didn't work :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Isnt it /tgb on to switch on, and cast on group member of group you want to buff?<br />
<br />
then /tgb off<br />
<br />
I think thats it from back when i played my cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Great thanks :)<br />
I figured it was something fairly basic I just didn't know what :o was starting to look silly on a tov run with me single buffing everyone with sta and agi hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bamkum_tz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">haly, remember you have guildmates for such questions !<br />
<br />
dont be afraid, papa bamkum wont eat joo ! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Originally posted by Mingh <br />
then /tgb off<br />
<br />
Why?  I've have /tgb on for over a year now and suffered no ill effects...  Seems like a useless step to me, just keep it on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Good point, Finaljustice.<br />
<br />
Never really thought about it, keeping it on wont hurt, as long as you remember to get the right member of the party with the buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks all :)<br />
And Bam when I needed to know it that second there were barely any shamans around I knew well enough to ask a silly question to ;) I'll ask you next time I have something silly to ask :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I too leave tgb on.<br />
<br />
If I'm buffing my group, I always cast on myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wordan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A good idea is to announce over channel for group leaders to send you a tell when they are ready for group buffs. You can than type /rt and they should be targetted (if relatively close).<br />
<br />
Otherwise you get 3 people from the same group asking for buffs.<br />
<br />
In most cases, people will not send you tells but instead use say, guild, raid, ooc or whatever. Shoot these people.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Something else about /tgb that wasn't immediately obvious to me: the area that the spell effects is centered on the caster, not the target.  I had to train myself to move the the middle of the crowd before casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That's what happens already on raids Wordan :) Just didn't know how to do the group buffs hehe, would have thought it'd be as simple as targetting their group leader but ah well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Fortunately, we now have the raid window.  When I see a group form, I slap their buffs on them, starting with the cheap ones (in case they're not all in range).  I make sure only group leaders send me tells, and my guild is trained for this now.  But back when we didn't have the raid window, I'd look to see who my buffs landed on, and if I had several tells from the same group, I'd Go Polar (tm).</div></div><hr />
