<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Going to run an upperlevel DN raid for 2 groups for fun, experience, quest gems and possible loot. (If the loot gods are smiling that night). We will be smacking dragon constructs, phase spiders, and paebellas. <br />
<br />
Meeting place is the Otherman camps in CS at 645 PM CST.<br />

<br />
All are asked to bring some dots for the chanter/cleric<br />
<br />
*Edit*<br />
Wow.. given the response, I think it is possible to form 3 solid groups and we will have the opportunity to go downstairs and do some rat extermination.. :)<br />
<br />
If anyone is unhappy with the 3 group format, please post and let me know.. <br />
<br />

<br />
Well.. I have been giving this some thought.. We have 17 and a possible signed up.. <br />
<br />
What is the general consenses about running 2 groups in and have a group doing the zone line? I have done the zone line without a full group and it can be hard, but challenging. We spanked several dragon constructs there and also bagged spiders. Trick is to keep the puller sowed. <br />
<br />
At this point, after talking to Sinfutura, Eisherz will be making an appearance. This gives Sinsem a chance to get some much needed barshing. :)   <br />
<br />
We have some time.. what does everyone think of the 2 groups together with one group doing the zone? I would hate to trim this fine list down to 12, but will do it if I have to..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Fine with me. I am up for anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm in if there's still room )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ludaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you go with 3 groups, I'd like to request that I not be placed in the zone line group.  In the 3 times I've been to SN, twice I never made it past the spiders.  The spiders are great fun, but I'd like the chance to explore a bit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Kly,<br />
<br />
Just read this post now and you can have me if you want me. If need be I can hang with the zone line group, ungrouped as a one stop chanter buffing station. <br />
Just let me know your thoughts,<br />

<br />
Knarlz Knerfed<br />
55.57th lvl cleric</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">We are go for raid. Arrangements have been made to have 2 clerics on the raid. In addition, Knarlz might still be able to make it. <br />
<br />
A reminder that we are meeting at the Otherman camps in CS at 6:45 CST. Please be on time. <br />
<br />
Also a reminder to bring some dots for the clerics and chanters as well. <br />
<br />
Check the lead post for the standby list and we can go there..<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing everyone there tonight.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who made a big effort to come last night. <br />
<br />
The raid went very well and we wound up in Rat City. I have seen more drops before, but it went ok and several weapons were handed out. <br />
<br />
The CC last night by Aliera and Mishlan was top notch and everyone did an excellent job. The raid had one death all night, once we got into DN. Before hand was a bit different story.  (Do you know the Othmir do not like illusions and the WFP guards have been known to kill people? :) )<br />
<br />
Thankyou also to everyone who bought dots for the clerics and chanters. I think we all sometimes underestimate the cost of them doing business. <br />
<br />
At any rate, all three groups got to see the yellow text bug on a semi-frequent basis and the eve wound up on a high note by killing the Warlord (level 60 mob) and a wild fight that saw us deal with 8 to 10 rats. <br />
<br />
I think the biggest thing was all had a lot of fun and that should be the objective of any raid.. :D  ;) <br />
<br />
Again, thankyou.. :)<br />
