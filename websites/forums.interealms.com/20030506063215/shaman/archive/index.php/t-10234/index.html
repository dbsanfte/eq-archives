<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, i'm level 39 atm and i was looknig for a new place to hunt after getting canni 2 (whoop!). My guildie told me to do specs near PoF ent in Feerott, they were a bit hard and only 1 single pull so a bit slow. Then i decided to hit EW and do ulthorks. BLAM! These things are an uncamped gold mine. They are better exp then DSP imo and theres loads of em to pull plus they drop 4pp average and ulthork drops and the ulthork tusk quest(look it up in allakzham and someone did a post about it so trying searching for it) which will give you a random gem for every 4 tusks handed in. I am doing this right now with C3 and its non-stop pulling, pullnig 2 sometimes jsut to see my mana bar at 70 at the end of the fight and HP at full(ikky BP). They are found on the north coastline in Eastern Wastes near the giant fort thing(marked on www.eqatlas.com/velious/easternwastesmap.html). Basically pull with slow and slap on Scourge(venom of Snake seems to fizzle a lot cuz its a new spell). Tank for dogdog and keep youself hasted and SoWed aswell as the dog. Also keep bearform and chloplast on for canni(or canni2). I think this place will be good till 44. BEtter than DL and DSP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">intresting , ive heard this place tossed around ebfore , i think i might try with my 41 SK , kaesora is getting boring.<br />
<br />
thnx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's a great camp if you can get it but I found that all to often one quad-kiting druid was there ruining it.  It's almost perfect for them so it is camped a lot.  I hope you get lucky and keep it away from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hunted Ulthorks quite a bit in my low 40's and with my druid from 31 to 44 (tried to be a considerate quadder, hehe).<br />

Some tips -<br />
<br />
The cliff by the Coldain camp to the east is free of roamers, as is the cliff/beach to the west.  Pull the ulthork out of its habitat into these areas to avoid any chance of adds.  Quadders who know what they are doing will pull into these areas, but they are pretty big and there should be room for 3-5 people.<br />
<br />
Ulthorks drop tusks, rarely.  Keep them.  When you get four sets of tusks, go to Cobalt Scar and find the otter chief.  Give him all four sets and get back a gem or sellable item worth, on average, 125-175 plat.  You will often see people offering you 10-15-20 plat per set of tusks, don't take them up on it unless you really need the cash right now.<br />
<br />
Make room in your bags and reduce your weight.  These guys drop lots of Ulthork hide armor and coin loot, as well as Walrus Tooth piercers.  Just selling the armor to vendors will net you 3-5pp per piece.  You WILL be overburdened quickly and will have to run sell.  Thurg is pretty close if you have good Coldain faction, Kael if you have good Giant faction.  You'll be making that run every hour or so, so I'd advise binding in Thurg/Kael so you only have to run it one way.  Just selling the dropped loot to vendors and pocketing coins netted me 100-150 plat per hour, IN ADDITION TO the loot from the Ulthork tusk quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm in EW right now, soloing the Ulthork hunters and the seals here. All are even or yellow to me at 30, and I get 3% per kill.<br />
<br />
Strange thing is I decided to try a red con Ulthork Warrior--pulled with slow, rooted, smacked on some Dots, nuked until root broke, then tanked until it was time to re-apply slow, to get defense up--and they only give 2% exp per kill. Less than their yellow-con brethren  :confused:</div></div><hr />

Another suggestion would be pok since the book is close to EW zone, will try this out later, sounds good.</div></div><hr />
