<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am going to post a rather long analysis here, please dont post in between the posts until after 'summary'.<br />
thanks  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I will take a look at what the shaman class brought to a group back in Kunark and what it brings to a group now. <br />
I will also list what other classes are capable of in these areas and what upgrades these classes received to form a baseline of what is acceptable in term of power increase.<br />
<br />
Several factors, like spell recast time are left out. This should not affect the validity of this analysis as I am only interested in percentual increases.<br />
<br />
I will NOT suggest any changes, nerfs or upgrades for other classes. If you play something other then a shaman and are unhappy with what your class gets please make your own post.<br />
<br />
If you find something I have missed or cannot reproduce my numbers please post and I will correct/explain them.<br />
<br />
I also stole a few suggestions from other threads and don't remember their origin. If you know please post the author so I can add them.<br />
<br />
Please note that this is a comparison of the upgrades shaman spells have received and the upgrades other classes have received in these areas. I am not analysing spell lineups, class DPS, class power or any of the like.<br />
<br />
Edit: Clarified the intent of my analysis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A shaman brings the following to a group:<br />

<br />
Conclusion<br />
 The comparative increase in shaman mana regeneration is pitiful, especially when you consider that shaman mana regeneration is active and thus only useful during downtime - and downtime has been decreasing steadily with every expansion.<br />
 Every caster has some form of mana regeneration now. Also shaman only give mana to themselves, to be spent on inefficient shaman spells, while every other class except rangers and paladins that can grant mana regeneration gives it either to the group or is a specialist with highly efficient spells themselves.<br />
Proposal<br />
 Give shaman an improved cannibalize spell like: casting time 3.0, recast time 6.0, 400 HP for 250 mana.<br />
 This will put shaman mana regeneration to 111 per tick, a 164% increase over Kunark values.<br />

 - Stamina                       120<br />
<br />
Conclusions<br />
 The increase in shaman Hitpoint buffs falls right between druid and cleric increases, but the increasing numbers of characters to cap their stats is a concern. Hybrids all get a massive boost, in some cases outbuffing their parent class.<br />
Proposal<br />
 Add the following instead of shaman stat buffs (or create a separate spell line): Strength - Strikethrough, Dexterity - Combat Effects,  Agility - Avoidance,  Constitution - Stun Resist.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Melee Buffs<br />
<br />
(In % of extra damage, counting 10ATK as 1% damage. Not counting Strength as it didnt do much back then and now most melees are capped.)<br />

Beastlord                       69<br />
<br />
Conclusions<br />
 Shaman buffs got a larger relative increase then enchanter buffs due to Ferine Avatar. Beastlords come alarmingly close to shaman/enchanter buffs with Ferocity. Bards got a massive boost.<br />
Proposal<br />
 Give shaman a group Ferine Avatar that lasts 20 minutes, so the numbers presented here can actually be reached.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Conclusions<br />
 Shaman healing efficiency was upgraded much less then that of the other priests. The least increase went to Torpor/Quiescence, which only got upgraded indirectly by AAs and Foci. Shaman heal speed is downright inadequate if MOBs are not slowed immediately.<br />
Proposal<br />
 I am going to assume the lesser efficiency of shaman heals was part of the priest balancing and thus not propose an upgrade to Kragg's or Tnarg's efficiency. A faster heal speed (at the same efficiency) is needed to outheal an unslowed MOB. Torpor however should receive a true upgrade, especially with MOBs now hitting much much harder then during Kunark.<br />
 New Torpor: 300 Mana, heals 550 per tick, slows by 50% and snares by 50%. Cast time 6 seconds, no recast.<br />
 New Tnarg's: 25% more mana, 25% more healing.</div></div><hr />

Druid               33 to fire                  97      + 194%<br />
<br />
Conclusions<br />
 Resist debuffing capabilities have been slighty increased over the board, with the exception of druid fire debuffing capabilities which got tripled on top of getting a -200 resist adjustment on the main resist debuff. Slowing abilities have not been improved for the top classes but Bards and Beastlords can slow effectively now, for many practical purposes negating the slow advantage of the shaman due to cast time. This is compounded by slow mitigation.<br />
Proposal<br />
 Give shaman a 300 mana, 75% slow with a -50 resist adjustment and a 2.0 cast time. Recast time and duration are fine as is.<br />
 Alternatively add a way (AA, buff, innate ability) to give shaman the ability to reduce slow mitigation by one step on targets no more then 5 levels higher then the shaman (i.e. most raid targets).<br />

<br />
Conclusions<br />
 The shaman dot lineup is in need of a serious upgrade. The Necromancer main DoTs got lowered in run time, got a 120% DPS increase and a 40% efficiency increase on top of a lowered resist adjustment on the poison line.<br />
 Druid DoTs got a DPS boost of about 60%. The efficiency increase is rather modest.<br />
 Meanwhile the main shaman DoT line (poison) got a lesser efficiency increase and not even a third of the DPS increase of necromancer DoTs while the disease line actually had it's duration increased.<br />
Proposal<br />
 Add a -50 resist modifier to the poison line. Add an additional tick to Blood of Saryrn.<br />
 Add a -100 resist modifier to the disease line. Up the damage per tick on Breath of Ultor by 30%.<br />
 Make the Curse line unresistable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">SUMMARY<br />
<br />
Over the last expansions the shaman class has gotten less upgrades to their primary spell lines then other classes got in that area. If the shaman was remotely balanced it is now severely underpowered, especially in the mana regeneration and damage dealing areas. The advantage shaman once had in slowing is steadily decreasing due to more classes getting slows and slow mitigation.<br />
In addition shaman buffing and healing power has decreased by outside factor, buffing power by stat caps and healing power by the hard hitting low HP MOBs of PoP and LDoN.<br />
<br />
Thus small upgrades to the slow line and medium to large upgrades to the healing, nuke and DoT lines are needed.<br />
The buff system would probably be best of with a change in focus to non-capped stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As far as pets I've parsed dog dog vs my wifes chanter pet. I don't have the parses anymore since they were on the system that lost the hard drive. I do remember however:<br />
<br />
The chanter pet hits for like 3 more max damage and innately dual wields. It does about 5 more dps then dog dog does with weapons equiped. <br />
<br />

It demonstrates the concerns in numbers and may be the point at which one of the Devs will do something. I haven't proposed any changes, since I am only 56, I have no voice as to the high-end game. But, in current groups, I do see clerics meleeing at FM while I'm constantly Canni'ing to regain the 30%+ mana I just burned slowing mobs. Heh, my wife plays a cleric and last night in 2 consecutive LDoN groups, she was sitting at FM most of the time and meleeing to her heart's content (I still wouldn't give her haste tho =)) The group (me, 56 SHM/53 CLR/54 MNK/57 BST/51 MAG/53 SK) was pulling 4 at a time and mowing through them while I slowed, Canni'ed, and Stoic'ed myself over and over again while running at about 45% mana. Not complaining as it keeps me occupied. But I do see it as a problem if that's the same thing that happens in end-game... I had done maybe 1k in damage over the whole night (including good ol' Speedbump) Sorry for derailment...carry on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a masterful and comprehensive analysis that points out exactly what has happened to shamans since Kunark.  Well done!<br />
<br />
All of us agree that shamans were very powerful after Kunark, both in their spell line and in the equipment they got.  Some would say overpowered.  Your analysis implies that the the benchmark used by designers in creating upgrades for shaman since Kunark was that shaman power needed to be scaled back relative to other classes.  If true, it appears that they have been overly efficient.<br />
<br />
What is really missing in these comparisons is the increases in power of NPC mobs with each expansion.  If other classes were increased in power relative to the increase in power of the mobs they are fighting, then shamans would be extremely deficient in encounters in the most recent expansions.<br />
<br />
PS (edit) - I wish you had done some nice graphs for the benefit of those shamans who love to see &quot;pretty crayon drawings &quot;.</div></div><hr />

Gardeltron--  As far as shaman being overpowered back in Kunark, well, that's really not fair.  If you were a shaman that had access to mobs that dropped Malo, Torpor and the JBB, then, yes, you were a force to be reckoned with.  Let's not forget that a very large majority of us never got to see those nice items, or had to save up massive amounts of plat to purchase them, if we happened to see them for sale (pre-bazaar).  I never had a JBB, and had to spend over 150K for my copies of Malo and Torpor, because my guild couldn't kill Kunark Dragons, or the royals in Chardok.  We sure as heck never made it to VP.  I'm betting there were a lot of shaman in the same boat as me, back in the day.</div></div><hr />

I would suggest going with top two shaman DDs as well, adding our POS poison DD to Velium Strike. I have a suspicion our numbers would drop even lower, given what a POS that spell is, even if you happen to have the elemental focus item for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Talking about mana regen, Rangers and Paladins don't really have the option to med between casts when melleeing.  A Ranger can sit on a horse/drogma while using archery for the med bonus but the biggest benifit to using archery is to stay out of AE range which probably puts the mob out of spell range.<br />
<br />
Using the top two Ranger nukes is simply to get over the LONG recast delay.  Assuming that the mob is not either fire or cold resistant, it is not uncommon for a Ranger to chain cast Brushfire and Frozen Wind.  This basically means a nuke is coming every 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
Comparing the spell casting of hybrids to true casters is going to be a very inexact process because they play the game differently.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Have to agree with the analysis and disagree with most of the followup posts on nuking...<br />
<br />
First off the analysis is very valid, in that most mobs die in 30 seconds at least in LDoN/PoP<br />
<br />
now as a shaman you are maybe, if your lucky, gonna have time for one nuke before the MoB is dead...and your probably casting Velium strike...7 second cast time...<br />
<br />
in that time, the ranger can nuke twice...and basically do the same damage...<br />
<br />
Does he get to nuke every mob...no...<br />
<br />
Do shaman get to nuke every mob...no...unless he is not slowing (rest of the group is asking...'Why did we bring the Shaman again?')<br />
<br />
And I agree...either cut the casting time...(4 secs would be adequate) or up the damage.  Frankly while I can understand clerics nuking undead for more than we can nuke, I think its ridiculous that they can out-nuke us on regular mobs and out heal us by such a huge margin...<br />

I am almost never LoM or OOM.  Our mana regen is just fine.  If you don't have voq/9 up, then something is wrong.  Cann5 will keep you going a long time.  Ignoring Cann5 in your analysis is unrealistic.  It is the most powerfull AA in the game.<br />
<br />
The real deficiency that Shaman currently have is our loss of prominance as the main debuffers.  With BL's and Chanters able to slow nearly as well as us, we no longer are unique in that regard.  There is a solution:  Remove the mitigation for shaman only.  Keep the mitigation in place for BL's and Chanters.  This would restore our prominance.<br />
<br />
We have never been nor will we ever be expert at either healing or dps.  We are not supposed to.  That isn't our role.  Our heals can help, our dots can help, but that isn't what we are there for.  Asking for a boost in either or both only dilutes our main purpose in a grp/raid.<br />
<br />
Our buffing abilities also have dropped off.  Time lvl players don't need our stat buffs anymore.  Focus doesn't really give as many hps as it should.  To fix it, either remove the stat caps, or maybe remove them for shaman buffs only (not sure if that would work), and give us a better hps buff.  And, give us a better atk buff...FA sucks, having to recast the damn thing every few minutes.  PITA, IMHO.<br />
<br />
Just my point of view.<br />
<br />
We will do better to focus on one or two specific areas to address, rather than asking for everything under the sun.  For me, I'd be happy with better buffs/debuffs.  Let the druids/clerics heal, and let the int casters do the damage.<br />

I would have to disagree there. Cann5 is very powerful, but I think DvA is probably the most powerful of all. A completely agro free, &lt;1 second cheal every 3 minutes is unbeatable. I love my Cann5, but DvA makes a much bigger impact on gameplay overall.</div></div><hr />

Necromancerss don't run out of mana either. If you are talking anything below an hour noone runs out of mana these days, especially time flagged characters with 300+ AAs.<br />
<br />
The real deficiency that Shaman currently have is our loss of prominance as the main debuffers.  &lt;SNIP&gt; There is a solution:  Remove the mitigation for shaman only.<br />
You are not seriously suggesting shaman should be able to slow almost every raid encounter in PoP by 75%? As much as I hate the implementation of slow mitigation the basic idea was good. To throw it out now would mean a complete reworking of every single raid encounter. There have been some decent suggestions on this board. Personally I like the 'Reduce shaman slow mitigation by one step on all MOBs up to lvl 70' version.<br />
<br />
We have never been nor will we ever be expert at either healing or dps.  We are not supposed to.  That isn't our role.  Our heals can help, our dots can help, but that isn't what we are there for.  Asking for a boost in either or both only dilutes our main purpose in a grp/raid.<br />
Ignoring the fact that we used to be both healing and DPS . . . if every class gets their damage doubled and shaman get a 20% improvement that means that we get nerfed, relatively speaking. If you look at my numbers again you will notice that shaman get the least increases in everything they do, compared to what they used to be able to do.<br />
If shaman were indeed never a healing or DPS class we are now much less then we were before. Upping our DPS or healing would not make us heal better then clerics or nuke better then wizards, but it might make us heal like a paladin or nuke a cleric.<br />
<br />
Our buffing abilities also have dropped off.  Time lvl players don't need our stat buffs anymore.  Focus doesn't really give as many hps as it should.  To fix it, either remove the stat caps, or maybe remove them for shaman buffs only (not sure if that would work), and give us a better hps buff.  And, give us a better atk buff...FA sucks, having to recast the damn thing every few minutes.  PITA, IMHO.<br />
Agreed. I suspect removing stat caps for shaman only is not feasible, hence my and other's suggestion of adding effects that to my knowledge are not capped.<br />
<br />
We will do better to focus on one or two specific areas to address, rather than asking for everything under the sun.  For me, I'd be happy with better buffs/debuffs.  Let the druids/clerics heal, and let the int casters do the damage.<br />
Debuffs don't stack. Damage does. Healing does. If we ever want to make it worthwhile to have more then one shaman on a raid shaman DPS or healing needs to be better then it is now, preferably both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Great Job!<br />
<br />
I know you left recast and cast time out for a reason.  But IMO, Shaman could be improved without over powering them quicky and easily by simply reducing the cast/recast times on their debuffs like Malo and Malosinia lines.  If not that then reduce the resists on the slow line.  Perhaps an AoE Malo or Malosinia.  Something to help us be more useful DURING the fight.  If we could debuff and slow faster, we could increase our DPS without adjusting the DD spells.<br />
<br />
I Do agree that the Disease line is silly.  I cant remember the last time I used it in a group situation.  I dont even load it on raids.  I just cant see 3-5 Shaman in a raid taking up a spell slot on a boss mob for 2.5 min when a necro could be using that slot for real DPS.  Kinda leaves us only our poison DoT and long casting low damage nukes.  Heck, I have seen VT named bust loose after slow has worn off and dang near wipe out a raid simply because the mobs spell slots were jammed with long duraton spells like Curse of the Spirits and Pox/Ultors.<br />
<br />
Even patch healing for 1300 is kinda silly with mobs hitting 2x/4x for almost that much. (in some cases, immune to slow) /sigh<br />
<br />
I would like to see the Curse line easier to aquire.  I raid most of the time when I am on and to get enough time to rack up 650 points in Raj Adventurs isnt realistic.  It reminds me of the old days where class defining spells for the current expansion were out of reach for most Shaman until the next expansion or beyound.<br />

Maybe I'm wrong, but I would imagine that, by cycling through their top two DD's, they narrow out that 30 second delay mentioned already, thus maximizing their nuke DPS, which, I imagine, any Ranger that got it in their noggin to nuke would do. <br />
<br />
However, if you alternate the top two DD's of classes WITHOUT a 30-second delay, you lower the DPS calculation - You can't cast two spells at once, after all.<br />

The only other comments I have, other than an overall &quot;great work&quot;, are in regard to stat buffs.  They've obviously decided to go with a dmg mod increase (which I understand many feel should be larger, and wouldn't disagree) instead of strikethrough for strength, and I think it may be an easier battle to get them to boost the mod than to change it to strikethrough.  For stamina, I'd honestly prefer something along the lines of an ND type effect to stun resist, and it would be in line with what they're doing with agi (avoidance), dmg mod (strength), and the suggested dex modifier (combat effects), basically providing a direct buff to what the stat *supposedly* does.  <br />
<br />
Overall, outstanding work, but I think I can speak for most of us in saying that we have no interest in putting the debuffs back on the Torpor line, and in fact they're putting in/have already put in a superior HoT spell to the one you're asking for (in fact, 300 mana/500 hp per tick is about what Quiescence is now, 280 mana/420 hp per tick).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The shaman nukes do not have the same recast problems that rangers have.  Ours are extremely slow casting, but don't have any recast beyond the spell gem refresh.  We can chain VS or chain Spear, or do one after the other, but it doesn't substantially change our answer.<br />
<br />
Ironically, our piece of poop poison nuke is MORE dps than velium strike (though barely).  Due to it's quick cast time, you can chain for higher dps.  I think you can (potentially, ignoring fizzles and any lag between casts) get up to 104 dps chaining poison nukes.  Velium Strike is about 92 dps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">You sure did alot of research for this Murtak and for that I /applaud.  One glaring fault is that in alot of the cases you show this GIGANTIC upgrade for others since Kunark and they are still below what we currently have.  Can't you see it from the other side of the coin man?  If they had to upgrade all of the other classes so much to come close to us in some cases, don't you think we were OVER balanced and they took that into account by raising the abilities/spells of other classes to be more inline with the power we already had?  Percents are great for people that need a quick glazed over look at something.  For instance You have 100 people who live on your street and 5 of them get murdered.  You lost 5% of your streets population.  Go to a bigger street where 1000 people live and 49 of them are murdered thats only 4.9% of the total.  So it must be better to live there.</div></div><hr />

A fellow gamer I know asked &quot;I don't understand this. Especially the shadowknight row. What is he trying to describe? 10 what? Mana? Per what unit of time? Single increase? Or do we get one mana per 10 groups?&quot; Since I can't answer for him, and he's unlikely to post here to come look for the answer, can anyone explain so I can forward the information on to him? Because frankly I don't know. I'm too knew to the game to get it. I just slow things, take their stuff, and do the happy dance when I don't die. :)</div></div><hr />

It's not an argument, I made a statement.  If the dev's had to upgrade everyone else so much just to come close to use in many of the areas we were over balanced.  Balance is to make us as equal as possible with other classes.  You have Best Healer, Best Nuker, Best Meatshield, best CC, best DPS etc etc.  Then you have a few can nuke, can heal, can blah blah.  Hence the jack of all trades classes.</div></div><hr />

Did you ever consider these possibilities?<br />
- shamans were in fact balanced in Kunark and simply did not get the upgrades everyone else got<br />
- shamans were more powerful then other classes but not to the extent that SOE we were - thus only some of these indirect nerfs were warranted.<br />
<br />
And how does that murder analogy relate to this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I dont think anyone is suggesting that we were not at our most powerfull in the kunark era.<br />
<br />
What we are saying is there is no way that we were THAT much better than everyone else.<br />
<br />
If they were nerfing us by not upgrading us on purpose, they did way too much of it and now we are SOL.</div></div><hr />

Appreciate your work.  Percentage analysis of course does not tell the whole story -- but it does lend concrete numbers to things that folks have been observing and giving anecdotal accounts of all along.  <br />
<br />
We should not expect 1 post to be the last, final, and complete critique of the shaman position.  This does enough of the job in that it expresses the reasons for shaman dissatisfaction in a new format, fleshing out the complaints a bit.<br />

edited to add a bit more to my comments and to remove resist buff info/comment -- misread &quot;resist debuff&quot; as &quot;resist buff&quot;.  *BONK!!*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">For instance You have 100 people who live on your street and 5 of them get murdered.  You lost 5% of your streets population.  Go to a bigger street where 1000 people live and 49 of them are murdered thats only 4.9% of the total.  So it must be better to live there.<br />
<br />
Actually it would be better to live in the area where 49 people of 1000 were killed.  Equating the murders per capita to your probability of being murdered means you'd want to live in an area where you have a less chance of being murdered at any given time.  It doesn't matter if more people were murdered in a location.  Your overall chance of being murdered among a population of possible victims is what you should be concerned with.<br />
<br />
Your point is that percentages don't paint a full picture sometimes, but your example didn't show that really.  Murtak's charts do illustrate valid points though.  If we were considered too powerful in Kunark and we were neglected in the next expansion (and beyond), it's time to stop that legacy and increase our power again at a greater rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">A couple things, in response to the origin of the thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In Melee Buffs section, Ranger melee buffs were not included.  They can add nearly as much ATK as FA with SoP &amp; SoT . . . in the interests of completeness it would be wise to include them.<br />
<br />
Insofar as healing goes, even if we &quot;buy&quot; the holy percentages (I don't, but still) then Kraggs should still heal for more.  It is underpowered with regards to the &quot;formula&quot; that SOE seems to want to cram down our throats.<br />
<br />
Your proposed upgrade to Torpor . . . not only is it not really needed . . . you are proposing to make it heal more than Q.   :confused:<br />
<br />
As DoT's go, aggro issues, particularly on Poison line, *must* be addressed.  You can give all the resist adjusts, run increases or damage upgrades you want . . . but if we cannot cast them due to the aggro they generate then they are still just wasting space in our spellbooks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Once again, this is comparing Kunark spells to today (well, to 6 months ago). Rangers did not have those spells in Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">BeastLords didn't exist in Kunark either.  But they exist in that particular section of your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">One thing that may also help with the numbers - especially on healing is to show the absolute increase in values.<br />
<br />
78% increase of crap = more crap<br />
167% of good = very good (if not excellent)</div></div><hr />

And second, druids have a cold debuff to toss in there E'ci's Frosty Breath I think is the name. And both their debuffs also lower AC, if there's anyway to account for it.<br />
