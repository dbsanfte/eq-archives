Ave zem is 75% * mob exp = exp recieved per kill.<br />
<br />
ie most outdoor zones have NO zem modifier!!<br />

Certain zones have ZEM modifiers-<br />
<br />
HHKeep  75% !!   =  150% * mob exp <br />
<br />
all cities have 25%  = 100% * mob<br />
<br />
Hole  25%  =  100% * mob<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That is good stuff to know. Anyone have a link, or maybe can post a listing of ZEM ratings per zone? I'd love to have one I could print out and check up when deciding where to go.</div></div><hr />

That or the mob is just worth more xp, or is a level or two above the warrior type mob for instance.  I wouldn't think mob specific zem exists, just an overall zem for the zone + xp gained for mob killed (particular mobs have designated xp worth).<br />
<br />
There used to be a site I visited in the past that had all this info - eqatlas.  But it's since been changed by SOE and thus removed from EQ Atlas :(.  Was nice clickin on a map and finding out what (if any) the xp modifier was there.  I wonder if other places have this info now.</div></div><hr />

nadox is a good example of this with its elementals. The trolls don't give near the exp that they do in the zone.</div></div><hr />

Very true, though they are actually called &quot;elements&quot; not &quot;elementals&quot;. The elements are much lower level than the other mobs in zone, and though they have pretty much all gone lb to me at 60, they still give more XP per kill than any of the other mobs in zone (except maybe some of the named mobs). Any compilation of mob XP rates would be pretty extensive and very difficult to put together. I've seen links in the past of zone ZEM rates, but on different boards, and not for quite some time.</div></div><hr />
