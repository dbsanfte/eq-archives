<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone else noticed a bug that lets some of your casters have 50 pages and others only have 32?  My druid had 50 pages after the patch but my shammy only had 32, both were using the new UI.  A latter patch during the day reduced the number of pages my druid had down to 32 and randomly placed any spells that were on pages 33+ into empty spell slots in my book... heh it took a LONG time to re-organize.<br />
I just wanted to give a heads up for anyone else that might find they have 50 pages with the new UI (3 peeps in the zone I was in did), you may want to move those spells before they get randomly re-organized for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I notice that the old book had 50 pages times 5 slots, or 150 spell slots.  The new version apparently has 32 pages at 8 slots per page, or 256 slots.<br />
<br />
yeah, I would expect this to be an issue for me when I log on tonight, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last I knew, 5*50 was somewhat more than 150, but I just can't be bothered to do the math atm. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I had 32 pages right form the start, and all my spells were kinda smooshed into a big mess right from the beginning.  Was kind of annoying, but I used it to completely redo my spellbook, and it's much nicer now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shamans have about 193 spells in all.<br />
Cleric 178<br />
Necromancer 186<br />
Wizard 203<br />
Magician 205<br />
Druid 223<br />
Enchanter 229<br />
<br />
Sure wish they'd have kept 50 pages (or more) to enable spreading out spells by category, but darn I guess that would require coding for two bytes instead of one.</div></div><hr />
