I need to raise pottery up a bit too, it's only 165 now.  The trivial for sealed poison vials should be enough for a first attempt.  A reusable self port to everfrost is pretty cool.  I just hope it doesn't take too many attempts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does it put you in Halas or still in Everfrost?<br />
<br />
If it's Everfrost I don't see the point of it.<br />
<br />
If it's Halas it's a small time saver, and might not be worth the effort.<br />
<br />
Someone enlighten me.</div></div><hr />

That is right, shamans get a SELF ONLY port to their hometown with 30 sec casting time. Now that simply blows, remove all the use for Alchemy and gate potions directly! By the looks of it so is every priest class getting a similar port to &quot;their&quot; temple.<br />

I should imagine the vast majority of shaman have given up on alchemy as it is, I know I have so I just can't bring myself to be angered or disapointed by this except maybe to mourn the loss of all that plat in the past like Mojokyn :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well you never know what will turn up for alchemy. As this is self only i don't see it affecting gate potions at all, except you now have the option not to spend 160~pp to get to Everfrost if you want to carry a 20wt idol in your bag.<br />
<br />
Personally i didn't master alchemy so i could port to Everfrost. Far more useful to get the nongaters out of zones when ports are not available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wow we can port to Everfrost/Halas. Such a central location to everything, I go there all the time.</div></div><hr />

Pretty cool to have a self only port back to home anytime ya want...  Like having a second bind point. ;)<br />

Just went over to EQTraders and there are NEW BARBARIAN SMITHING RECIPES.<br />
<br />
Last week I sold to a vendor stacks of frost temper, imbued ivory, and goblin blood that had sat in my bank for almost 20 levels, thinking I'd never bother with racial smithing again. <br />
<br />
/cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I can't seem to find if this thing is droppable or not.  I've messed about with a number of tradeskills, but not pottery for some reason.  I should because the Thurg port would indeed be handy.<br />
<br />
Anyway, are these tradeable so I can just buy it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Makes me glad I am still bound at the firepot portals. Halas is just a click away.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, you see the interdependence and items required for this? The only time this gate would be relatively useful is in the pre-50 years when you need to train, buy, sell, etc.etc....If the recipes are right, no way someone is typically going to be able to get some of the rarer items in the younger levels. Blue Diamonds don't grow on trees.</div></div><hr />

So it appears that this is a magic item.<br />
<br />
If this is true then I will probably take the time to work on the skills. It will save a bit of time and money in the long run, and besides, you never know what might end up in Everfrost or the area... portal to a Plane anyone?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A brief summary (cause some people are confused):<br />
<br />
unfired spiritstone = idol sketch + large block of enchanted clay + water + celestial essence + vial of distilled mana + Everfrost essence + sculpting tools combined in pottery wheel<br />
<br />
spiritstone = unfired spiritstone + divine crystalline glaze + HQ firing sheet in a kiln<br />
<br />
idol sketch - vendor sold<br />
large block of enchanted clay - large block of clay + level 8 enchanter<br />
water - vendor sold<br />
celestial essence - celestial solvent (Bazaar vendor) + (apparently) any level 39 and over spell research component combined in a mortar and pestle<br />
distilled mana - 2 opals + poison vial + 39 enchanter<br />
Everfrost essence - frost turnip (foraged in Everfrost) + water combined in brew barrel<br />
divine crystalline glaze - white lead (lead sulfide and limestone combined by a rogue in a mortar and pestle; components are vendor sold) + iron oxide + permafrost crystals + water combined in a glaze mortar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Please tell me this thing is tradeable.  Eoin- nice summary but that looks pretty much like the definition of hell for me... something like 15 components, tons of intermediate steps; requires a rogue, enchanter, brewing, pottery, and a chunk of cash; and at the end of the whole thing you might fail.<br />
<br />
Uh, no.  I might buy it, but if I want something that involved, I'll get my epic.  :)<br />
<br />
/auc &quot;Paying 20 pp for a port to Surefall&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">IMHO, the great use for this would be to make money - I always hate how I'm in nfp selling potions and someone is like &quot;make me 1 ITU potion plzkthx&quot; and I have to turn them down unless they order more or I have a list of people because I'm not going to pay 20pp to gate to surefall, spend 15 minutes running to halas/making potions, etc, then gating back to nfp. (edit: for just one potion I mean)<br />
<br />
This will allow me to go to halas, dump cash into sow potions, gate to nfp bind, sell sow potions, gate to halas, dump money into sow potions, gate to nfp bind, sell sow potions... you get the picture.<br />
<br />
Before it was just a PITA to make potions to order for people, with this it'll be a lot easier. It would pay for itself pretty quickly I think because we'll ALWAYS be able to go make potions if we just bind where the person is waiting for us.<br />
<br />
Plus, now when we bind in a dungeon or something so we can loot our corpses faster when we are soloing, we can just gate out rather than fight out and walk. Granted, it's to halas, but at least we won't be fighting our way out of the dungeon. I've wanted this for a long time, glad they implemented it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have an OT hammer and I love it. But, it's not a clicky item...you have to proc it (with a 50 delay, sometimes it takes forever) and it's too big to fit in an EE bag but it only weighs 3.5lbs (or abouts) so it's not a terrible burden to lug around.<br />

This will probably be the cheapest course of action.  Based on the prices potters wanted for the old idols(which weren't too hot to begin with), I'm not gonna have the cash for a spirt stone any time soon:) .</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Works out about 250-300pp per combine :(  The expensive bit is the 2 sapphires needed per distilled mana - a stack of 20 distilled mana is about 4300pp.  Most of the rest is just very tedious to get hold of.<br />

<br />
Worked my skill up to 190.<br />
<br />
Made around 20 attempts at Imbued Idol to try to get skill increase before trying Spiritstone. No skill increase at all.<br />
<br />
Made 15 attempts at Spiritstone, 15 failures and no skill increase at all.<br />
<br />
Collected more Imbued Idol components and made about 15 more tries, no skill increase again. :mad:<br />
<br />
I said the heck Then I made 20 more attempts at the Spiritstone... no skill improvement or successes.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit burned out from trying to make this thing... will try it again sometime later...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now it is not Opal. I read the same thing and when I asked an enchanter to make me Distilled Mana I gave them the vials and Opals.<br />
<br />
Opals do not work, Sapphires do.</div></div><hr />

Isnt it supposed to be that if Im below a recommended level, the item doesntr function as well for me?<br />

So at level 30, will it only port me HALF way to home?<br />

recommended level...</div></div><hr />

Nope. My dirty druid had a few of them for me from her days of foraging the epic item.</div></div><hr />

Fortunately for me, my baby ranger is at an ideal level to hunt the mammoths in Everfrost.  I came up with 16 turnips and 3  yellow bubbles of experience on Saturday.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, with a brewing skill of 161, I only succeeded on 10 of 16 attempts at the Everfrost Essence.  At least I skilled up to 162 in the process.<br />
<br />
PS, they are also food, so be careful where you put them in your inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Spiritstones are trivial over 240 (confirmed not trivial at 240).  Based on the success rates over at Eqtraders the trivial appears to be in the 260-280 range (which would be not trivial with 250 skill and gearlock).<br />
<br />
I wouldn't even try Spiritstones before 220 skill, everyone below 220 skill is getting the base 5% success rate.<br />

Btw I made this tonight:<br />

1. whats the easiest way to get insanely high pottery skill?  idols?<br />

2. can we use the stones intended for other races/classes from the inventory?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">With all the changes to the trade skills recently VI should allow some means of resetting trade skills to a sub 200 level.<br />

I won;t ever get above 200 in Pottery since I have another trade skill that is slightly above 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Sikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I just bought one today and can I tell ya .. WOW ! <br />
Bought it from a rogue named Twinbabas on Bristlebane for a nice price and it was well worth it !<br />

The Iksar one ports to the Kaesora bind area.<br />

Didn't think I'd ever get one of these.  Pottery seems to be stuck at 188, and I'm not funding it to go further myself. :P<br />
<br />
A dear friend of mine gifted me an Everfrost Spiritstone this weekend!  OMG!<br />
<br />
Yes, it is heavy.  Yes, the casting takes forever.  Would I ever sell it?  Nope.  :D  In the rallic pack, the weight isn't a problem.<br />
<br />
Used it today.  Ports you to Everfrost near the little goblin igloos.<br />
<br />
Firepots ports you directly to the docks btw.  But now I don't have to stay bound there. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
Frekkels<br />

PS:  A very big thank you to Zephaus (Premier &gt;200 Potter on E. Marr) and Jvani for their generous gift. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Curious what other servers are selling these at - on Cazic Thule, seems the potters are setting at 10k.  I'm sure that price will drop, as more potters skill up, and the customers start to dry up.  Not quite willing to pay that much for one - 10k is a lot of Frost Potions. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Jaradis:  How much do you think those will sell for once people skill up?  Looks like a nice alternative to the howling harpoon or goranga idol I have ranged now- this is like a harpoon with a little AC and HP.<br />
<br />
Also, like the item snapshot- one of the better integrations of name/guild I've seen.  :)</div></div><hr />
