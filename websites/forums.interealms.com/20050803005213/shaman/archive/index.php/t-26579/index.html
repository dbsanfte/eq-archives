<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">New epic mount graphics are going in next patch (except for undead).  Here's a screen of the new white epic kodo I got on the test server.  <br />
<br />

<br />
You can also choose green and gray.  Basically just a little bigger, with armor along the back and legs plus a drum on each side of the rider.  Looks pretty sweet I think.  <br />
<br />
However, the new shoulder graphic for our set shoulders is absolutely horrible.  It looks like a bagpipe sitting on each shoulder or something.  It even harder to see with them on indoors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you make the drumming sound like the kodo riders in WC3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is this the true &quot;epic&quot; version, or just the replacement graphic for the level 60 mount? <br />
<br />
Pics of the other races revamped level 60 mounts can be seen [u]HERE[/URL].<br />
<br />
Reason I ask is there is another Night Elf Mount purchased from the &quot;Wintersaber Trainer&quot; faction that is referred to as our &quot;epic&quot;. It looks like a very large Frost Saber Pridewatcher (purple'ish tiger). The Kodo in the pic above looks more like the other level 60 mounts (a little armor added to the base models).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm not really sure I understand the difference.  The only mounts Tauren can get are from the trainer in Bloodhoof.  He now sells three different colored 900g mounts that look like the one in the picture I posted.  I just refer to the 900g mounts as epic because everyone on my server does as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Either way, looks pretty slick to me. Probably the best looking one in my opinion. The new Mechanostriders are kinda neat, but have you seen the new Human mounts? GAH! FUGLY! they look like old, broken down, race track nags with rickets! BLECHT! :)<br />
<br />
Side note, if the pic above is just the level 60 replacement, I'd REALLY like to see what they come up with for the &quot;epic&quot; version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is a difference between the 900g mounts and &quot;epic&quot; mounts?  The terms are typically used interchangeably.  Very curious what the difference is if there is one.<br />
<br />
Do you really have to be level 60 to get a 900g mount?<br />
<br />
Either way, I like the new raptor model for the 900g mount the best.  I'm a tauren and I think the new kodos are so-so at best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm not really sure Mach. I've just always heard them referred to as &quot;level 40 mount&quot;, &quot;level 60 mount&quot;, then &quot;epic mount&quot;. Being that I'm a Night Elf, and I've seen pics of the mount that can also be purchased after getting sufficient Winter Saber Trainer faction, I just always assumed that one was the NE &quot;epic&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's no faster than the level 60, and to be honest, the new level 60 graphics are more appealing than the purple tiger. The only reason I'd get one of those vs the normal level 60 mounts is so my pet would match my mount again. :)<br />
<br />
So far I like 'em all except the Human horses. Honestly, I think the Kodo looks the coolest, with the raptor and wolf coming in a close second. The new NE level 60 mounts? Meh! Same cats with only a few SPARCELY applied pieces of armor. Color me less impressed with them compared to the likes of the new Kodo, Raptor, Wolf, Mechanostrider, et al.<br />
<br />
Wish I could get Tauren faction. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, you have to be either level 40 or 60 to get the riding training in order to use the mount.  Not sure, but you may be able to &quot;buy&quot; the mount sooner, you just won't be able to ride it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">THe only thing stopping you from riding a mount is riding skill and money.  Since you can get the riding skill at level 40, any mount can be purchased afterwards, assuming you have the gold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I could picture my shaman on top of that Kodo! :) <br />
<br />
I just need to get him some spunky armor so he wont look ghetto on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">THe only thing stopping you from riding a mount is riding skill and money.  Since you can get the riding skill at level 40, any mount can be purchased afterwards, assuming you have the gold.You have to have &quot;exalted&quot; faction to train in riding another races mount. On top of that, Blizz has stated that there will be no way to buy/train-to-ride opposing faction mounts. So it's a tad more complicated than &quot;just having the money&quot;. :)</div></div><hr />
