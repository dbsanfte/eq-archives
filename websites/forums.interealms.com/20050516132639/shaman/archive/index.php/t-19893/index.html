<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We encountered this mob last night doing a Fear raid for epic drops.  He was NOT FUN.<br />
<br />
The one we fought was already up, but I've found out reading other class boards that he can spawn off Scarelings when you kill them.  It wandered into us as we were grouping up again at the WW area where you go when you break in, as we regrouped to kill the wraith for a chanter's epic drop.<br />
<br />
He's DB to 65, has around 125k hp (not entirely sure about this), and doesn't hit that hard (200 or so and doubled), but he has a wicked AE mez that has an absolutely insane range.  It must reach halfway across the zone.  He also spawned add mobs 3 separate times during the battle.  These add mobs were green to 65, had very little hp, but hit surprisingly hard (200 or so) for the fact that they were green.<br />
<br />
The AE mez was just EVIL.  It lasted around 30 seconds or so on the average, was absolutely unresistable, and the little monster kept chaining it.  After mez wore off, we had about 4 seconds to act before getting re-mezzed.  Needless to say, I spent that time memming Malicious Decay and a disease dot, then dotting myself in those short windows when I could move.  After those who could self-dot freed themselves up, the 5 of us who could self-dot became tanks, healers, and crowd control.<br />
<br />
It was a very wild and hairy battle.  Ireblind and his spawned adds killed a necro, cleric, and druid during the course of it, and our tanks were knocked out of the battle 90% of the time because of the mez AE.  His spawned adds proc'ed Shadowstep just like Scarelings, at one point flinging me from the WW gathering point to the other side of the hill the entry portal stands upon.  The two shamans in the raid became the tanks, while our casters who couldn't self-dot used their precious unmezzed time throwing fast-casting nukes on Ireblind.  We primarily just nuked/dotted him down, but since he had so much hp, this became a very long fight that wasn't without its casualties on our side.<br />
<br />
We had the joyous luck of dealing with Ireblind in an area where we had already cleared it out.  Had we had to deal with Ireblind when he spawned off a scareling in an area we were in the process of clearing, things would have been VERY messy.  If I'd have been shadowstepped out into an area and got aggro, I'd have been knocked out of the Ireblind fight because I wouldn't bring a train back to the others.  The way they've put Ireblind into Fear is devious, and it's going to get raids wiped.  This is a very effective and quite EVIL way for SoE to make Fear a very dangerous place again, even for 65's with Elemental+ gear.<br />
<br />
FYI, Ireblind drops a nodrop berserker item that's part of their epic.  A guildmate looted this, and since I'm currently working on a berserker, hopefully I'll be able to use it when I do my epic for him.  From what i've read about the zerker epic so far, this piece CAN be MQ'd...though nobody's entirely sure yet.  We'll know for sure soon.  ;)<br />
<br />
One thing about this mob makes him VERY dangerous, and that's the fact that he spawns off Scareling kills.  Like I just remarked, this guy's going to put the fear back into Fear if he pops off a scareling when you're in an uncleared area.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, we got 6 epic drops in Fear, including Child's Tears off all three golems (which isn't common, but was more then welcomed  :D ).  One went to our other shaman for her epic, I looted one, then gated out into Feerrott and kamikaze'd so I could leave that tear on the corpse and looted the second for MQs, since I already have my epic.  We also got epic pieces for a guild wizzie, necro, warrior, and chanter.<br />
<br />
That means that we don't have to go back to Fear for a LONG time...and with the Ireblind in there now, I'm kind of glad of it.  ;)<br />
<br />
Not that I'm complaining.  As far as I'm concerned, SoE did an outstanding job in making an old pushover zone suddenly EXTREMELY dangerous again, and they did it in a very simple and clever way that didn't require a total zone revamp.  Hats off to SoE, they got some dang evil people over there working for them now.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">About 2.5 groups of us killed that for the epic step a couple nights ago.  Interesting fight.  Adds were very easy to kill.  One dot nearly kills an add spawn, if some ticks crit.  Of course, being stunned alot made the fight alot longer than it needed to be.<br />
<br />
Similar type of AE from mob in DC for berserker epic.<br />
<br />
I would like to know if anyone with Persistant Casting that have been involved in these encounters, helped prevent the AE from interrupting casting a spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just 3 months ago or so, I went in there with 40 people all 65 non-elemental at the time but tons of AA.  Only problem was, out of the 40 people there, less than 10 of us had Fear experience in the past.  The rest are a bunch of noobs who flew thru the levels, wanting to come in to Fear thinking it is just some old world zone where they can take names and kick butt.<br />
<br />
Plan was WW break.  Monk to zone in first make sure zone in was clear.  As soon as monk zones in, a noob follows, then another, then another... gah, pretty much half the raid was in zone despite all efforts to spam the chat channels to stop going in.  Raid leader decides, to go in anyway with instructions to just go west.  As soon as we go in, we see all these noobs running North, East, South.. seems like everywhere but West.  Pretty soon, big ugly train... wipe. gah... Brought back old memories. One of the most embarassing things ever since we had to ask a smaller guild to help us with CR.  <br />
<br />
Now with a new mob in there, I hope the first Berserker in our guild decides to skip their epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ROFL, thats pretty funny Qatrixaro.  I'm in a family guild that has very few 65's (but a ton of 50+) and we took fear pretty easily in the past...  had a partial whipe on the first amy temple pull cause some idiot healed the monk  while FD pullin...<br />
<br />
So we've planed to go back today for some time (been on raid schedule for like 3 weeks, because my furry butt still needs a tear) and now we hear about this mob...  Dunno if our weak little family guild's gonna be able to take him down.<br />
<br />
I had a few questions though...<br />
<br />
1) I heard that they nerfed dotting to break charm...  That you had to take more damage per tick than you regen in order for it to count as damage and break the mez...  Is this still true?  If so wouldn't this make crimson potions unusable?<br />
<br />
2) is this new mob slowable?<br />
<br />
3) if it gets down to the nitty gritty, I'm going to end up dotting myself and being the tank...  Fully buffed I hit about 1020AC and 4500hps...  is that enough to tank this guy with the healers being in and out (I assume the druids will be healing because they can dot themselves)<br />
<br />
4) how resistant is this guy?  Am I (a level 54) going to be able to land slow on this guy?  Will disempower land (as this was going to be my agro pulling strategy)?<br />
<br />
5) are the adds very resistant (I.E. will the chanter be able to get them mezzed quickly, or at least as quickly as you can bouncing in and out of mez)?<br />
<br />
6) is there any other tricks that might help keep me alive?  other than praying?</div></div><hr />

Aaaah... Memories... breaking into Fear, wiping, trying again, wiping again... trying again, succeeding, getting the tear... *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Souls of the Arcane has a good number of 65's now, and a TON in the late 50's. We have broken Fear successfully three out of four times. That first time was a wipe like you have never in your life seen. Just as we get our strategy down and get a little experience and get a bit of a comfort level, someone at SOE decides it's time to be a smarty pants. Since SOTA is up for Fear on our server on Friday, we've got one day to come up with a strategy. Heh ... if we get crazy and engage this SOB, I'll let you guys know what happened. :D<br />
<br />
Kudos, SOE!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well Tordail, since we are in your same boat (minus a few 65's probably) and are raiding Fear tonight, I'll be sure to post how it turns out.  Unfortuanately we only have 2 SK's and they don't always show up for Raids, so the shaman might end up having to tank.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if anyone could help me answer my questions above it would be a GREAT help to us, as we don't really know what to expect.</div></div><hr />

And to think the only reason i go to fear now is to try to get an AON.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">like other people said, have everybody on the raid load up on a few crimson pots.  since sicken will only work on yourself (and if you duel your group mates to cast sicken on them, you won't be able to heal, buff, etc them), those pots should be an easy way to counteract the ae mez.  after that, he'll seem easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Howler, I am still wondering if the crimson potions will work since the &quot;nerf&quot; that I heard a few months ago said you had to take more damage then you regen for you to break mez...  was wondering if anyone had a definative answer on this.<br />
<br />
Also, just read the adds are unmezable and unsnareable/rootable.  Still don't know if they, or ireblind are slowable.<br />
<br />
Also, he can apparently pop more than once per fear-clearing.<br />
<br />
He casts shadowstep in addition to his mez, and usually only lets mez drop for all of 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
His stationary spot is wherever he spawns, so if you kill a scareling in camp and pop the bugger, he's going to be camping your corpses when you wipe.<br />
<br />
The brightside is that he doesn't have the insane agro radius of the rest of Fear, but if he's camping your corpses, it doesn't help much =P.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I'm also assuming strategy wise that you're better off with druids as main healers over clerics, as they can dot themselves and keep themselves unmezzed.<br />
<br />
Make sure the casters haveup their fast-casting heals/nukes, because even though your dots will break mez, mez will still interrupt casting.</div></div><hr />

A rogue with SoS is an easy fix to this as I doubt he see's through SoS. <br />
<br />
Doesn't matter if he's slowable if he's only doubling for 200 or less.</div></div><hr />

It just means that Fear raids will need to start requiring everyone to buy a packpack full of these before the raid... *shrug*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I understand that togh, but that is only true if the nerf I have brought up didn't go into effect... can anyone confirm or deny this by experience?  Recently, will a dot break mez if the damage taken does not exceed your regen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ok heres the Crim pot low down<br />
<br />
yes you need to be regening less than the dot is doing to break mez.<br />
<br />
when in pvp with a chanter I have to <br />
A click off regen if he didnt pell it,<br />
B Take off my regen 3 shoulders, <br />
C and take off my regen 3 neck.<br />
at this point the chanter is going to gate out or die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">thanks diabalein... that's what I though.  Forgive me for not knowing this, but doesn't everyone have an innate standing regen of more than 2 per tick by level 55 or such?  If so that kinda kills crim potions.  I know as a troll I'm gonna have to dot myself (and take off my fungi) to have any hope of surpassing my regen.</div></div><hr />

Keep the info coming ... I am posting every scrap of info I can get on my guild board.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this will be of any help, but this information was posted on the Karana Guild Central boards (that's our organization that takes care of planes/mob rotations).<br />
<br />
&quot;New mob, Ireblind Imp. He casts a PBAE Mezz. Resist -1000!! Range 500. Messmerize (2). Here's the kicker. He spawns at West Wall!! We were doing breakin, killed a scarleing and bam, this guy pops on us. It's for Berserker Epic. Hits miminal and had little hp's it's the freaken Mezz proc he does every 10 seconds. West wall is no longer a good breakin spot. Here's what I found out. He wont agro if you have Invis up. If you get his agro and he mezz's you he memblurs so if he moves out of agro range you wont get agro once mezz goes away. He does agro with other mobs if they see through invis. He wasn't up when we zoned in, but spawned right after we killed a scarling and will stay right at the West wall. I pulled him a bit north, he mezzed me and wandered back to that spot. You can breakin at the SW corner of the zone. We did that just fine.  [edit]: I am told the only way to beat the mezz is to dot yourself. :\ I'm sure would be an okay encounter if you didn't have to deal with him on breakin. I have logs if you wanna see them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you guys, Rookz.<br />

<br />
I don't think he spawns at west wall, he spawns off the scareling you killed to spawn him (random spawn of scarling death).  Wherever you finish off the scareling is where he will spawn and will be his spawn point.  He'll return there after mezzing/killing y'all.<br />
<br />
One strategy to consider: if he pops, try to pull and engage him away from his spawn spot.  If you die at least he won't camp your corpses.<br />
<br />
We were unable to agro him and move him however cause he kept mezzing the kyters (nobody had dots up or potions at the time).<br />
<br />
I hope the crimson potions work!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The guild who posted that happened to kill Ireblind's spawn scareling at West Wall, which is where Ireblind ended up popping for them. Definitely SOTA will try pulling him away from spawn point, though if he does come away, when we die he'll just wander back to his original spot, camping the corpses of those who died before he could be moved. He won't be camping corpses of those who *could* move him, since we'd be away from original spawn, but that still leaves a rather nasty CR. I will get our alchemists started on the potions ASAP, though, and keep /logs to let you know what worked. Rookz, if you could /log your raid tonight, I'd appreciate it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Norwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Evening all.<br />
<br />
I understand there may be a question as to if DoT's that are less then regen will work or not and I am sure someone will find out soon (may even be me).<br />
<br />
Another thought came to mind and that was chain stunning where those classes that can get in an overlapping cycle until the mob is dead. Anyone have any experience with attempting to stun this mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">So I'm semi-planning the fear raid our guild is running tonight...  At least I'm running it till all the scarelings are dead and we don't have to worry about this imp anymore...  Here's our plan so far...  Mind you we don't have many of any class except druids, which actually helps in this fight since they will be the most reliable healers (can self dot).<br />
<br />
First, everyone's going to take a couple of hits from the necro at the entrance to fear (root and proximity agro) and then calculate their natural regen... clicking off all regen spells, and removing all regen gear.  My guess is everyone but the trolls, iksar, and those who trained in innate regen will be at or below 2 per tick.  All that are will get 5 crimson potions.  If they are not, and are not a dotting class, we're considering them out of the fight (they can add a little dps here and there, but for planning purposes we'll consider them MIA)<br />
<br />
We will start with the monks FD pulling to split out all the other mobs from the scarelings, and try to clear them.  When we think we're pretty much done clearing, We will assemble an off-Tank group (all dotting classes, SK, shaman, Druid, necro, etc.).<br />
<br />
This group will be soloing the scarelings at a pre-determined spot (monk still pulling to them).  They will be regened, and self dotted (regen to cancel the dps from the self dot) the entire time.  When the imp spawns<br />
they'll click off the regen, shout the inc message (they will be pulling VERY far from camp, so hopefully everyone not able to use crimson potions will be able to self apply their buffs by the time this guy gets in agro range.  (the hardest part will be for the pulling group to get back, despite the mezzes) Another SK back at camp will be MT.  After the off-tank group shouts the inc. message, all casters will stand, and/or click off of their horses/drogmars (so they are at the standing regen that we tested).<br />
<br />
When back at camp, and MT gets agro, it's business as usual for the most part.  All classes are using only their fast-casting nukes and heals.  There is a secondary assist (sK also if we have enough) that is not apart of the off-tank group, incase the MT gets ported outa range.<br />
<br />
The off tank group will obviously attempt to pull the adds, and keep them off the MT, but we have to have the healers ready, because every time mez lands, the adds will be hitting on the MT till it breaks again (as the imp will break mez on the MT, and the adds won't attack anyone else while they are mezzed.<br />
<br />
Thats about it.  We considered gathering up all those folks that can't use the crimson potions, and can't self dot, and put them in duels with a dotting class, but this creates issues with buffing, and healing, and might produce more trouble than it is worth... Really it depends on how many of the raid are in this predicament.  If it's too many, and we don't have enough self-dotters/crimson-potion-users to be able to take him down, then we might figure out some &quot;on the fly&quot; duelling strategy.<br />
<br />
<br />
If any of this looks like it won't work, or if it looks like I am missing anything, PLEASE let me know, as I am nervous to lead my group into a wipe  :D .<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some who are considering this fight, and thanks for whatever additions/suggestions you have.<br />
<br />
EDIT: realize that it's probably not practical to save the scarelings for last, as they are all over the entrance area, and have one of the largest agro radiouses in fear.  As such we're going to try the suggestion made above, and set al alternate camp (probably just further south on the west wall).  If ireblind pops, we try and take him down there.  That way, if we wipe, he's north of our corpses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Norwolf, in response to your question, I have read he is unstunnable, unmezzable, and unroot/snareable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
--he seems to be umezzable/unstunnable/uncharmable.  Our raid chanter certainly seemed totally powerless against it, focusing on nuking down the mob.  I'll have to ask her if she managed to get off a mez, she didn't get back into the battle until late because she didn't put a strong enough dot on herself (yah, you have to dot higher than regen to break mez...I did the same thing to myself using Sicken til I was warned and upped to Scourge then clicked off Replenishment.  Didn't want to take any chances, hehehe).  Our chanter is a darn good one, so good she was the only chanter we took and the only chanter we needed, so I'm very sure that she tried mezzing the mob after she got back into the fight.<br />
<br />
--Nobody in our group managed to land a root.  I didn't try, but I'm sure the druid tried to snare AND root.  The fact that the druid kited the mobs out of the battle to give the shamans time to heal some people told me that either they won't land or she had really bad luck.<br />
<br />
--Ireblind's spawn adds seemed to have the same immunities as Ireblind himself.  I do remember one point where our chanter attempted to chain stun, but the spawn adds all raced off to chase down and kill the necro.<br />
<br />
There are two main suggestions I can make for Ireblind.<br />
<br />
The first is to make sure you have at least 5 people in the raid capable of self-dotting to break mez.  The regen/dot alteration might not let crimson potions work, someone will have to check.  In our raid, we had 5 people who managed to break the chain mez and fight, and those 5 managed to defeat Ireblind with help from the others during those brief windows when they could act.  Ireblind hits like a sissy and the only danger his adds pose is their Shadowstep proc, but his AE mez makes him virtually invincible if you don't have a way to counter it.<br />
<br />
Defeating his AE mez is your biggest priority, because it's the one thing that makes Ireblind such a dangerous mob to fight..  Take that away from him, and he's just another notch on your belt.<br />
<br />
One stopgap concept some people might want to consider is a cleric with the share health AA...if the cleric can break mez early, he could use that AA to break everyone's mez except the most injured people just once...but that one time might be the key to turning the battle in your favor.  ;)<br />
<br />
The second suggestion is, if he pops off a Scareling in an area you're in the process of clearing, you MUST pull him back into an area you've already cleared.  His spawn adds will shadowstep the people who can self-dot and fight, and they'll bring more adds if they get aggro running back to the battle.  This aspect of this mob makes him even more dangerous to battle, given the insane aggro radius of the mobs in Fear.<br />
<br />
Just like everything else, I'm sure we'll all adapt to Ireblind and overcome, but until then, he'll certainly make Fear raids much more exhilerating than they used to be.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well, fought him tonight with a VERY small force (2 groups, average level 55).  WE got a 6 pull, and of course, Ire poped out of the Last God **** scareling in the zone (2nd mob killed in the 6 pull).  Sadly, it still took him a long time to wipe us, even with 4 other mobs helping him kill his target.<br />
<br />
In my brief Time alive (I was the fist one to self dot, and had to pull him and the adds off the healers) I learned a few things...<br />
<br />
You can't stun/root/snare/mez him or his adds.  I think he is slowable.  Didn't get a immune message, but both me (54) and the other shaman (57) couldn't land one...  can't say we had much time to try though.<br />
<br />
MOST important thing to do to keep you all alive, is to keep the damn Scarelings mezzed till your done cleaning up your pull and healing/medding up.  Be ready for Ireblind before you kill EACH scareling, and he should be a cakewalk.  It was too late (midnight PST) to try again, but I am certain that even with that small group, we would have had him.<br />
<br />
the crimson potions worked for some, not for others...  our 59 pally swore that she didn't have any innate regen AA's nor any regen gear/buffs on, but the crimson potions were not enough to break mez for her.  However, it worked just fine for our 51 sk (tried the potion first cause of the instaclick, and then was going to switch to self-dot till he realized the potion worked).<br />
<br />
He mezzes with a eerie sort of regularity, so it's actually easy to time your casts.  I do thing a cleric could get off a c-heal if they started casting right after mezbreak (this is if they are breaking mez... if they wait for mez to fade and cast, the'll be lucky to get their fastest heal off).<br />
<br />
Also, I can't stress enough that it's important to move camp as soon as you spawn him.  If not, not only is he camping your corpses, but if you try to pull him away, he just keeps mezzing you (your puller and your body-recovery person) and whacks your puller all the while...  Puller can't get him too far from the camp before dying.  FD also stinks cause after you FD your mezed into a permaFD cycle and are kinda stuck out of commission.<br />
<br />
anyway... too tired to remember much... will post more when I wake up and can think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Instead of trying to pull Ireblind towards a cleared area, perhaps it'll be easier to pull the scarelings to a cleared area (hard to do during break-in, but once broken in that might be best option).<br />
<br />
Just bring back all the scarelings to safe spots, then kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">It almost reminds me of a Manaetic Behemoth raid, where you need one section of the raid strictly on crowd control, and another dealing with MB himself. Perhaps a two-part raid is in order ... one group on Scarelings, and one group on all other adds, if you could find a way to organize Fear's chaos into two groups of mobs. I don't know, but we're in Fear tonight on our server. It oughta be ... interesting, to say the least. All I know is my guild hasn't been this exicted over a Fear raid in a long, long time. :)<br />

If killing this Ire guy require MB numbers and style killing, I hope that Berserker epic or whatever else he drops is worth that effort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh? I was simply wondering if a two-part raid might be in order ... one part take care of strictly Scarelings, another take care of all other adds, etc. as you would in an MB raid. Nothing about MB numbers or required raid force. Rookz said he engaged Ireblind with a two group 55-ish force ... which means no, you won't need MB numbers -- but an MB-style split raid might work. If not, the effort would be interesting to see. In typical SOTA-style overkill, we'll probably show up to Fear tonight with a six group raid force. :) This might could be fun.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">No, it doesn't take those numbers, but it definately takes a separate group for the adds.  We had it all planned out to take the adds when they spawned, but we were amidst a REALLY big pull when Ire poped in the first place, and we weren't ready for that.<br />
<br />
one note to make, if your trying to dot yourself as close as possible to your regen, you better make sure to take sitting or riding a horse into account (for casters).  Despite my warning at the beginning of the raid, half the damn casters were still sitting on their high horse, complaining that the crimson potions didn't work, and pointing out that their regen *should* be under 2 per tick. /bonk<br />
<br />
I really think if you have the numbers to take out the golems, you have the number to take out Ire.. you just HAVE to be prepared.  Might be a good idea to assemble groups around this fight.  Since the crimson potions are somewhat unreliable, you want to have two groups of self-dotters.  Sk's as tanks (shaman if you don't have enough sk's, but honestly if this is the case, and you have one SK, put the SK in the offtank group, as they will be taking more damage.)  Put druids in those groups as healers, and if you have a shaman or two, put one in each group for backup healing.  The clerics, along with everyone else who can't self dot, will just be nuking like madpeople whenever they are not mezzed.<br />
<br />
When you get to the point that pulls are manageable, and you can start picking your pulls, do one of two things... avoid the scarelings and use FD to pull all else, or pull the scarelings exclusively.  Problem is the adds Ire makes cast shadowstep, so ifyou pull them first,there is a good chance of people being ported on top of some mobs.  If you try to save the scarelings, however, the raid will move alot slower, as scarelings have the largest agro range, and are hard to split.<br />
<br />
Final warning...  Agro control is INSANELY important on this fight.  when everyone's mezzed, the adds only attack whoever Ireblind wakes...  So if, say, a Wizzy pulls agro just before a mez lands, then when the off-tank group gets mezzed, the adds will jump the wizzy till the dots break mez.  Sure it's only a 6 second difference (max), but on the first add spawn thats 5 mobs at 120, and Ireblind at 200.  Plus, the mez effect slows down the tanks time to regain agro quickly, leaving Ire a little more time to wack away at the poor int caster.<br />
<br />
That's all I got folks.  If you have any specific questions let me know, and I'll answer them if I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Was thinking about this.  Came up with a sorta solution I think.  Someone correct if I am wrong, but you can be dispelled out of being mezzed, yes?  So, just pull a Glare Lord or Tentacle Terror and never kill it.  Sure, you'll spend all of your time in Fear with no buffs, but from my experience, that is the normal course of things anyway.  And, there are a few other odds and ends to deal with, like no pets, etc, but lot of raids don't like pets in Fear because of the Scarelings.  And, no heal over time, of course.  But, this is the best solution I could come up with.  Anyone see something about this that I don't?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I'm not sure dispell removes detrimental buffs.  Please, by all means correct me if I am wrong, and call me the nincumpoop that I most certainly am if I went all these years and still !@#$ this one up, but I thought dispell only eliminated beneficial buffs.  I clearly remember trying to dispell several bad buffs off myself, and only ending up with the same bad spells (few dots and a rune of warding) and no buffs.<br />
<br />
A very interesting idea one of my guildies came up with was instating a guild war.  We have a guild alliance, and do most of our raids with at least 3 other guilds.  I understand this doesn't work for everyone as many guilds fly fear solo, but it just might work.  I am unfamiliar with the buffing/healing restrictions placed on an all out guild war, however, and they might end up being too prohibitive to be beneficial, but if it simply puts both teams in a PvP environment with eachother, much like an arena, then we may be in business.<br />
<br />
Of course, this eliminates AoE spell as an option (including mez, wich will make some overpulls tricky) and makes mistargeting sometimes fatal, but all in all, it will allow two guilds to just set up a dotter or two who's job it is to keep a dot cycle going on all the raid members (would have to pre-determine what level dot to use to overcome the highest natural resistance).  This has the added benefit of getting your clerics, pallys, warriors, and such back into the fight, as well as allowing everyone else to keep their normal raid spell lineup uninterupted by self dots and such.<br />
<br />
I am going to see if I can talk my guild and two alliance guilds to start a war and do some testing... see exactly what detriments come along with this plan.<br />
<br />
As for guilds who don't have alliances, you could ask a friendly guild to start a war with you just for the course of the raid, and possibly allow you to borrow two or three dotting members.  They will be your dot force, and just chain dot from top to bottom of the raid list.  This meathod is actually much more effecient, as all the buffing/healing restrictions only apply to 2 or 3 members, all of which will have non-agro rolls, and all of which will also have non-healing rolls.<br />
<br />
Anyway, was just a thought.<br />
<br />
I am pretty low level, and as such don't raid much, but I am infinately intrigued by tactics and such, and this fight certainly has got me thinking =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this guy is slowable, doesn't that expand your range of tanks a bit? It seems to me like a ranger or a beastlord could tank a slowed mob that topped out at 200 hits, and they can both self-dot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Souls of the Arcane raided Fear Friday night. In typical SOTA style overkill, we showed up with seven full groups. We took the precaution of zoning our breakin team (two groups) in at the Southwest corner as opposed to West Wall ... and set about killing everything we could lay blade to. We mezzed only as we needed for crowd control, and didn't bother mezzing the scarelings separately. Sure enough, Ireblind popped, though he popped nowhere near our camp -- he had tucked himself into a little hollow near the Northeast corner of the zone by the fire pit. We managed to clean the zone almost entirely without agroing him or being cast upon. After the raid was over, and we were wandering around aimlessly trying to think of something to do with our overly caffienated selves, we took three or four 65's and decided to play. He sees invis, but his agro range is ridiculously small. My GL walked very nearly right up to him invised before the mezz was cast and Ireblind agroed. The raid was parked on the other side of the fire pit, and the mezz (rumored to be half a zone in range) never touched them. It is not 30 seconds duration, I'd estimate it at more like 15-20 tops. I was halfway between the fire pit and the zone wall, and was hit with the mezz, while a paladin was probably another 100-200 range behind me, and was not hit. Nothing added, since we cleaned the zone (all but two or three Amygladan warriors, I believe, and they were pretty far away on my GL's track). When my GL was COTH'ed to the raid, Ireblind took two steps, paused, and walked right back to his spawn point without coming after the paladin or I. We cast nothing on him or ourselves. My GL scrolled up and saw a hit for 124 damage.<br />
<br />
I don't know if any of this will help out any, but there it is. We've asked for another day in Fear, and he is our target. :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Did fear last night, I joined late on when most was cleared but was there for the second ireblind spawn of the night ;) I can confirm its a random instant-spawn from killing a scareling, the two we had (at different times - no idea if you can get two at once or not!) were from very different areas.<br />
<br />
It was all a bit hectic, but I'm pretty sure that he was both unrootable and unslowable, and likewise all the adds that he spawns.<br />
<br />
With regard to self-dotting, I used affliction (30/tick) and found I had to click off replenishment. Also needed to use malicious decay to make it land :). Once I got this sorted, everything was much easier.<br />
<br />
None of the mobs hit that hard, mostly in the 20-200 range, and not very fast. I could tank a couple of em, totally unbuffed (damn those dispellers!), and keepy myself alive whilst throwing some DoTs around. The adds are green cons and low on hp.<br />
<br />
From these experiences I've come up with a few ideas:<br />
<br />
1) For break-in, send in a bard with FM (if available) or a monk/sk/necro. Make sure they have a mage in the group too. They can check the break-in area, and if the ireblind is up, kite him away somewhere and then loose aggro. Rest of raid force then does break-in as normal, mage CoH the FD person if required. The reason I favour the bard is they can track, and with FM they can make their own way back whereas a FD class relies on the CoH coz ireblind camps corpses. With their deftdance disc and DA they're also more likely to survive in case they get hit by the mez.<br />
<br />
2) Already mentioned, but those that can should self-dot above their regen rate.<br />
<br />
3) Nobodies mentioned this yet, but the adds can actually be used in your favour. Grab aggro on an add (cripple is good), and just let it hit you. If you can get a number of people with one add each, that's a lot of broken mezzes. They don't hit hard enough for one to be a big problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok once more from the Zeks comes a word or 3 of advice.<br />
Dispells i.e. cancel magic/annull magic/all the chanter pells remove MAGIC based spells starting with the first buff slot and working up to the last (ocassionally you will get random buff removal but most of the time its your first buffs that get pelled)<br />
you must cure disease/poison to remove shaman and shaman style dots (not counting epic or ldon)<br />
tash is poison<br />
mez is magic and can be pelled. while the idea of keeping a glare lord around has some merit I think I would go absolutly bonkers keeping one alive to help the raid.<br />
<br />
can you mgb Radient cure? probably not but it makes me wonder...<br />
<br />
as for the crimson pots my post was a bit off, I only remove shoulders not neck. this leaves me with 2 from AoB, 3 from neck, 3 from aa and 1 from natural for a total of 9hp per tic when crimson pots will clear mez...I cant tell you if its different on the zeks, we have some strange code here that you guys cant even imagine (corpsegrinder proccs a 100hp heal...I can stand at an enemy corpse with autoattack on and the weapon will procc)<br />
some one find a chanter and an arena and test it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Just did fear last night, to work on a couple guildies' epics.  We did break in with 8 level 65's.  Imp is indeed unslowable, but that doesn't matter, he hits *very* softly.  I also never got disease or curse dots to stick on him.  Poison stuck readily.  Crimson potion did not work, sicken or affliction also was useless (and darn hard to land on myself).  Spell regen was turned off, didn't have any regen items on me.  <br />
By the time he was at 50%, we probably had 20 mobs running around us.  What worked for me was to dot as many mobs as I could.  When I was mezzed, there was a decent chance that one running by would whack me and wake me up.  Rangers were doing the same thing, and was where the majority of our dps came from.  Pretty much everyone spent the whole time with either shaman or cleric hots on em, but it was enough to keep everyone up.  The only exceptions were when a few younger folks (55-60) tried to come in and help.  By the time we were finished, everyone who came in during the fight was dead.</div></div><hr />
