<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi again<br />
<br />
First I would like to submit my talent tree idea for approval or disapproval. My thought was to get a blend of healing improvements while having enough melee talents to increase suviviability for tough situations and general soloing, so here goes:<br />
<br />
Restoration Mastery <br />
Improved Healing Wave Rank 5 <br />
Tidal Focus Rank 4 <br />
Totemic Focus Rank 5 <br />
Improved Lesser Healing Wave Rank 5 <br />
Tidal Mastery Rank 5 <br />
Nature's Swiftness Rank 1 <br />
Purification Rank 5 <br />
Restoration Total: 30 <br />
<br />
Enhancement Mastery  <br />
Ancestral Knowledge Rank 5 <br />
Shield Specialization Rank 5 <br />
Improved Ghost Wolf Rank 2 <br />
Two-Handed Axes and Maces Rank 1 <br />
Anticipation Rank 5 <br />
Improved Rockbiter Weapon Rank 2 <br />
Parry Rank 1 <br />
Enhancement Total: 21<br />
<br />
For the record. I am not a PVP shaman this time around. This is a pure PVE spec.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I'd like to tell of our little adventure into Mauradon yesterday. Together with my crew consisting of me Shaman lvl 47, Rogue 51 and Hunter 54 we decided to begin scouting out the first parts of Mauradon to get a little warm up before starting to farm Lord Vyletongue for the 33.2 dps dagger and the Agility pants.<br />
<br />
Nedless to say we weren't expecting any miracles for our first time there. We headed out, managed to clear room after room, dying a bit but slowly grinding onwards... I once again learned the benefits of the Poison Totem (yeah so we Taurens may lack long term memory, but we're actually very smart on our feet).<br />
<br />
After much struggling we reached Lord Vyletongues place. He spawns with 4 invis guards. We managed to single out the first two ones without fail. Then came the tricky part. The two last guards are impossible to single out. We even tried my own patented &quot;Suicide Kamikaze Split (tm)&quot;, wich means the Rogue and the Hunter pulls boss+2 guards, concentrates on one of the guards until it dies, then they die. I go in and rez, rinse repeat until boss is solo.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately Lord Vyletongue respawns his last two guards when he walks back to spawn, wich means you wont get him solo... We tried taking him down by brute force. It did look very good during the suicide run, the rogue almost taking no damage initially, but somehow during our first attempt to take the boss out once and for all, we somehow forgot to concentrateon the same targets and I somehow forget to heal hunters pet.<br />
<br />
Anyhow the rogue is last to die (no smokebombs left) and runs of and manages to die inside a pillar. I reincarnate to rez him up and the hunter up. Somehow the Rogues corpse is bugged. I try standing on it next to the pillar, yet I get the &quot;out of range&quot; crap.<br />
<br />
Oh well, the Rogue spoke with the white lady, he had to be at work in 4 hours and needed some sleep.<br />
<br />
Me and the hunter looked at eachother and thought &quot;What the hell&quot; and charged. We were just one man short of standing a chance. After speaking to the white lady I believe I had one item still yellow, the rest were red...<br />
<br />
Well on to the moral of the story:<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed this outing. We didn't get jack in the end but we learned some valuable lessons about Mauradon. After a few weeks of being burned out on the game I feel triggered to play a bit more again, if for nothing else, then for leveling up and trying Lord Vyletounge again, so me and the Rogue can get a weapon upgrade.<br />
<br />
Also, if any hunter is reading this. I's it possible to single pull basicly what you want, in the EQ way of FDing and tagging? Me and hunter friend have had some runs at trying but never really getting the hang of it. Are we chasing ghosts or is it possible with hunter and a tagger to single pull?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like a pretty solid defensive tank/healer build. Shamans can tank pretty well up to a point, if you are focused more on small group <br />
<br />
Not sure if you need both IHW and ILHW talents. From the numbers i've seen spamming LHW looks about as good as HW in terms of efficiency and speed. I haven't really checked it. <br />
<br />
If your group is pretty keen to push it, may want to consider instead the 20 min cut on reincarnation, or even ancestral healing, which i've heard can be pretty good if unreliable. I'd also max tidal focus, just because you have done all the other heal and mana buff talents.<br />

Hi, my shaman is lvl 51 on a PvP server, I have played a round with a couple builds, hopefully my comments will be helpfull.<br />
<br />
First off, early tier talents are to get you to better higher tree talents.  In both enhancement and restoration, you double up and take all the early tier talents which IMHO wastes the potential to take more effective later tier talents.  For instance, your enhancement build you picked the shield spec and the ancestral knowledge.<br />
<br />
Considering the highly defensive nature of your choices, I would drop AK and put them elsewhere, also decide right off the bat if you are going to be a 2 handed or 1 handed/shield shaman.  You get more out of your talent tree if you specialise.  If you say 1 handed, drop the 2 handed axes and maces, drop AK, apply the 6 points into the elemental tree or into thundering strikes/flurry.  If you want to focus more on DPS (great on earlier levels) then drop shield spec and go AK then thundering strikes.  AK doesn't really add that much mana, SS is sort of like stoneshield totem in that it mitigates damage, but not really a significant amount.<br />
<br />
In the Rest tree, I'd drop IHW, again, a first tier talent when you already have one filled out.  We rarely use HW due to the long cast times, and only after we get NS does it really become viable.  I can't argue against purification, great talent for raiding shaman, but I would still put those points elswhere.<br />
<br />
As for Mara, you should have no problem beating that satyr.  I'd suggest the hunter have his pet tank one guard, you tank the other while the rogue and hunter plough through the demon.  You might even have a shot (if you kite the tree spawn) of hitting the ordanus clone after the falls.  Kite the goo on the corner and stick to the water.  Don't forget to have the hunter dismiss the pet when you drop off the falls or you will get goo adds like you wouldn't believe.  Pick up one or two more guys and the princess and landslide are pretty easy.  My hunter friend said there is a way of FD splitting some mobs, but those 3 are linked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems I will have to ponder my options for talents. I'll dig into at talent tree script asap. I'm really not sure how much healability i want to sacrifice, but I'll come up with something and post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Keeping your restoration talents the same I'd get<br />
<br />
<br />
Enhancement Talents (21 points)<br />
<br />
# Ancestral Knowledge - 5/5 points<br />
Increases your maximum Mana by 5%.<br />
<br />
# Thundering Strikes - 5/5 points<br />
Improves your chance to get a critical strike with your weapon attacks by 5%.<br />
<br />
# Improved Lightning Shield - 3/3 points<br />
Increases the damage done by your Lightning Shield orbs by 15%.<br />
<br />
# Improved Stoneskin Totem - 1/3 point<br />
Increases the amount of damage absorbed by your Stoneskin Totem by 7%.<br />
<br />
# Two-Handed Axes and Maces - 1/1 point<br />
Allows you to use Two-Handed Axes and Two-Handed Maces.<br />
<br />
# Flurry - 5/5 points<br />
Increases your attack speed by 30% for your next 3 swings after dealing a critical strike.<br />
<br />
# Parry - 1/1 point<br />
Gives a chance to parry melee attacks.<br />
<br />
This is assuming you are going to use 2 handed weapons since you bought the talent. If you are doing so I'd ditch the extra shield bonus in exchange for lightning shield and a toss away point in stoneskin totem (you already have mana conservation for it through your restoration tree). <br />
<br />
Also ghostwolf isn't a big deal on PVE and I think lightning is a better allocation of points. <br />
<br />
Thundering Strikes to Flurry is a better damage combo than improved rockbiter, and I think would provide more benefit than the extra defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Right now im having huge problems deciding on what to do. There is no definite answer to the shaman talent tree...<br />
<br />
I don't know if i'll regret it, but I dumped a lot of things. I'm thinking in the old EQ way of getting the defensive stuff first, so I'm going all in for defensive, and picking up some damage skills on the way. Being a bit restrictive in the restoration tree aswell... heres how it looks:<br />
<br />
Restoration Mastery <br />
<br />
Tidal Focus Rank 5 <br />
Improved Reincarnation Rank 2 <br />
Totemic Focus Rank 3 <br />
Improved Lesser Healing Wave Rank 5 <br />
Tidal Mastery Rank 5 <br />
Restoration Total: 20 <br />
<br />
Enhancement Mastery <br />
Shield Specialization Rank 5 <br />
Improved Stoneskin Totem Rank 3 <br />
Thundering Strikes Rank 5 <br />
Anticipation Rank 5 <br />
Flurry Rank 5 <br />
Improved Rockbiter Weapon Rank 2 <br />
Parry Rank 1 <br />
Toughness Rank 5 <br />
Enhancement Total: 31 <br />
<br />
Rockbiter because it generates aggro. Everybody says flurry is good so I'm using it to get up to Toughness. Lightningshield is too mana costly in my opinion so I'm leaving it.<br />
<br />
I'm going to stick with Shield/Onehander and maybe use a staff if one comes along, but then only for fun.<br />
<br />
Purification seems like a decent choice, but consider I'll have to wade through some junk to get to it, im deciding against for now.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm going to have to respec when/if i reach uber high end...<br />
<br />
Edit: I might also consdider ditching improved reincarnation due to it being extremely situational... and thus go for mana pres on totems instead.</div></div><hr />

Good you pointed that out to me, I'll ditch a little of something to get that one in.  :)  I was thinking about it earlier but I got distracted by all the tanking abilities. Taurens and brain-cells you know ;)</div></div><hr />

You may want to have a look at this post on the shaman board: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-shaman&amp;t=36840&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post36840<br />
<br />
Some of the advice is very helpful.<br />
<br />
Edit: forgot... /moo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've got a 60 shaman with full enhancement talents, cept for the 16 elemental to make my shocks better + clearcasting.  It suited me well levelling up.  At this point though, I'd definately change my talents to something else, if I didn't have to ****ing retrain my 2h axe and 2h mace up again.<br />
<br />
Insights into talents while you are still levelling:<br />
-Stormstrike sucks.  For its huge mana cost, you get 1 extra attack, and your next 2 nature spells (ie earth shock) gets 20% more damage.  Also, your lightning shield happens to get this 20% bonus, but doesn't eat the 2 &quot;charges&quot; on stormstrike, so one of your lightning shield hits can get the bonus on average, and seldom 2 bonuses.  You need a weapon with very large base damage output to get the most out of this ability.  You can kind of treat it like another shock spell, but melee based, since it's instant damage with slow refresh.  I would not buy this skill again unless they dropped it's mana cost by about 25-50% considering it's refresh time.<br />
<br />
-Shield block IMO sucks.  I'd go for more maximum mana instead.  Shield blocking doesn't completely block an attack like parry or dodge.  You instead just reduce the damage taken.  Good shield block something like about 40 damage (and deal about 25 or so due to shield spikes).  When something is hitting you for 300-600s, reducing 40 damage from it is about 7%-13% damage reduction, an extra 5% of the time over what you'd normally prevent with a shield.  1 in 20 hits you reduce your damage by a mediocre 7-13%.  Average out it means you reduce your damage taken by 0.35%-0.7% per hit.  Ya.  I'd rather gain an extra 400-500 mana for the same 5 talent points.  They need to change the skill so you *entirely* block the damage if you block, instead of what it does now.<br />
<br />
-Improved stoneskin doesn't do almost anything.  20% more of 27 damage prevented is 32.4 damage prevented.  When stuff is hitting you for 300-600 damage, 3 talent points to reduce damage taken by an extra 5 per hit is pretty useless.  Granted, it does reduce damage on everyone in the entire party which makes it somewhat more useful, though I seldom see it actually giving benefit to more than 3 people in a group at once.<br />
<br />
-Look into the mathematics of using the mana totems and putting points into them (ie full restoration build):<br />
Mana Spring Totem rank 4 restores 10 mana every 2 seconds to group members within 20 yards. 205 mana cost.  1 minute duration <br />
Apply 10% mana savings on totems. Mana cost is 185. <br />
Apply 15% extended duration from Eventide. Duration is 1.15 minutes, or 69 seconds. <br />
Apply 25% enhancement onto the effect from Improved Mana Spring Totem. 1.25 * 10 = 12.5 mana every 2 seconds. <br />
69 seconds / 2 seconds = 34.5 ticks <br />
34.5 ticks * 12.5 mana per tick = 431.25 mana regained <br />
Every person in group will regain about 430 mana every minute and a bit. <br />
The shaman casting this will regain 246 net mana himself if he's the only one benefitting. <br />
The entire group will regain about 1970 net mana every time you cast this.<br />
This is useful mid combat for mana regeneration.<br />
And then the mana tide totem. Cost is 60 mana minus 10% making it 54 mana cost. <br />
Net gain is 960 mana per group member every 5 minutes. <br />
If you have 5 group members, that's nearly 5000 mana regained for almost free. <br />
Once every 5 minutes, everyone in the group gets a free Mana Potion effect.  I like.  And if I were putting points into restoration, I'd definately want to go with this.<br />
<br />
-if you are levelling up, get the ability to use 2h maces and axes.  The ability to wield those 2 extra weapon types is very useful and can very much increase your dps.  Remember, that even though you might really like the 1h + shield combo for when you tank, very often you will not be the tank in a group, and so your lower dps on your weapon and your extra AC on your shield is wasted.  Mograine's Might and Ravager are both fairly easily obtained weapons from a mid level dungeon (SM) that will keep you equiped for a long time.  There's also the mace from the Princess in Maraudon for furthering the 2h weapon options.<br />
<br />
-Flurry is very useful.  I've been trying to get a fairly even split between int/sta/agl gear on my shaman.  Big agility lets you crit often, and every time, not only do you do extra damage, but you haste yourself.  Haste is good *nod nod*.  30% haste is 30% more damage for free, on top of the increased dps you get from critting.  The unfortunate thing about using windfury + flurry is that the haste gets eaten up from windfury procs, but oh well, I just deal with it.  If you opt for the rockbiter option, though, you'll get full flurry benefit all the time.<br />
<br />
-The entire elemental talent line.  If you like doing burst damage, go with this.  It's highly mana intensive, and expect to drink a lot.  Drinking is boring though.  I drink enough on my mage.  And in doing some tests, I found that melee + totems for constant combat and minimal spellcasting allowed me the same kill rate as nuke + melee + drinking after combat.  The difference is cost for armor repair vs the cost for drink.  Every second you drink you are not doing dps to mobs, which you are making up for by the high burst damage on your nukes.  IMO if you want to play a nuker, then play a cloth class.  Shamans get good weapons and chain armor and shields for a reason.  In teh face!  As a side note though, if you go with elemental, you'll probably also make a decent healer build too.  Reason for this is you will be focusing on Int gear for mana pool and crits for elemental action, but you'll also get the benefit of a larger mana pool when you play healer.<br />
<br />
-Clearcasting (Elemental Focus) is nice.  If you actually do nuke stuff, you save on average 10% mana.  Something you can do if you are really low on mana is chain cast your level 1 lightning bolt spell until clearcasting happens.  With Lightning Mastery and Improved Lightning Bolt, your Lightning Bolt (rank 1) spell costs 17 mana with a 0.5 casting time.  Chain cast it (no delay between recasting) until you clearcast, then fire off a big spell.  It's not like, OMG that's so broken, but it could be useful if you are almost entirely out of mana.<br />
<br />
-Improved Lightning Shield I think is worth the points.  You can apply lightning shield after combat and then drink up, or run around regenerating mana via spirit.  Increasing the damage of a spell by 15% for only 3 talent points is pretty good IMO.<br />
<br />
-Ghost wolf.  Making wolf take 1 second to cast?  Ya.  That saves lives.  A lot.  If you have a steed, it probably loses some of it's appeal.  I personally don't have my Kodo yet even at 60 :( so I use wolf form all the time and I love it's super fast cast time<br />
<br />
-Parry Skill.  Good stuff.  If you have the Enhancement skills already purchased as prerequisite this 1 talent point purchase is a no brainer.<br />
<br />
-Toughness.  Useful skill IMO.  5 talents points to gain a few hundred more armor when you get to level 60.  (My AC is currently about 4500 with shield.<br />
<br />
-Improved Self Reincarnation.  Without res sickness, this ability is much much more useful now.  Wipes happen.  This is a major life saver.  20 minutes is a long time to wait for self res to come back again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Everything being said, redoing my talents as an &quot;enhancement&quot; shaman at level 60 with restoration &quot;backup&quot;, this is what I'd go with:<br />
Elemental Combat Talents (0 points)<br />
<br />
Enhancement Talents (21 points)<br />
Ancestral Knowledge - 5/5 points 5% more mana.<br />
Thundering Strikes - 5/5 points 5% more crit melee hits.<br />

Improved Lightning Shield - 2/3 points 10% more damage<br />
Two-Handed Axes and Maces - 1/1 point<br />
Flurry - 5/5 points 30% haste for 3 swings on crit hit.<br />
Parry - 1/1 point<br />
<br />
Restoration Talents (30 points)<br />
Tidal Focus - 5/5 points 5% mana save on heals<br />
Improved Healing Wave - 4/5 points 0.4 cast time reduction on Healing Wave ***<br />
Totemic Focus - 5/5 points 10% mana save on totems<br />
Improved Lesser Healing Wave - 5/5 points 75% chance avoid interuption<br />
Tidal Mastery - 5/5 points 5% more crit nature spells<br />
Nature's Swiftness - 1/1 point Instant nature spell<br />
Purification - 5/5 points 10% better heals<br />
<br />
*** Improved Healing Wave isn't that important IMO.  If they have time for a big slow heal, they have plenty of time for it and 0.5 second casting time reduction won't matter much.  Most of my heals are Lesser Heals.  These 4 points are probably better spent on Combat Endurance (for what good it does) and Improved Self Reincarnation<br />
<br />
The restoration talents I picked are more or less going to be the same for any healer shaman.  The remaining points in enhancement could very well be dropped in favor of elemental if you want to be more of a caster.  Lowering Purification to 4/5, you can add that 1 point to the 21 taken from enhancement, and get clearcasting + elemental fury in elemental.  Or, you could take the 16 points out of enhancement (leaving the 5% mana), and get clearcasting and good shocks in elemental.</div></div><hr />

11 elemental for clearcasting: wonderful (passive) talent. I have had fights with 4-5 clearcast in a row :) Nice for grinding. Good stuff higher up the tree too.<br />
<br />
18 enhancement: why not? At low level I got some nice 2h weapons and wanted to use them; all points in the tree after that are simply my own lack of imagination.<br />
<br />
21 restoration: NS; lifesaver and deathdealer. Simply the best talent for the cost in any tree.<br />
<br />
At 60 many of my choices seem wrong. <br />
<br />
Enhancement? Tanking is not a choice; the hps/ac just aren't there. On the other hand, that 2hander can do nice damage and makes farming trash for coin go much smoother.<br />
<br />
Elemental? Drop de Bomb! Yup, huge burst damage. Looks really good and I can see it being the PvP tree (playing on a PvP server I am tempted by this) Downside_you cannot spec up to NS and the end of Elemental.<br />
<br />
Restoration? After NS what do you do?<br />
You will never heal with anywhere near the efficiency/ability of a priest/druid. I am sooo tempted by the mana totem though :) <br />
<br />
I guess the answer is: do whatever suits your playstyle. I like having some of the advantages of each tree; I regularly agonize over what I'm missing by not focusing in Ele or Rest.</div></div><hr />
