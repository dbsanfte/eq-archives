<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit 27 last night, and I'm fighting in Marus Seru.  The exp there is starting to slow down, but I think I can ride it to 28.  But I was looking for a good place to go then.  Was thinking DSP or OT, but there are any other suggestions, I'd like to hear em.  thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cotto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have my shaman killing Golra's in Tim Deep. Long swim and all, but the exp is pretty damn sweet. <br />
Even easier with the lil snare necklace I got from those inkies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ihopp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would also be interested in some nice places to hunt @ lvl 28.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">some options are:<br />
<br />
Highkeep goblins<br />
LOIO<br />
Splitpaw or gnolls outside at the spires<br />
Sol A</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My necro is killing Treants in SK.  So if you're evil it's a good choice for exp and for the all import loot.  You can sit at the camp and try to keep up with the spawn time or kill the wandering mobs.  The place is so empty these days the mobs are plentiful.  It's good money for the lvl 29 spells you'll have to buy, especially after leaving Marus Seru - which is esactly hwere i'm coming from too.<br />
<br />
Buk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mascoma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We as a group of 26 to 30 went to Crystal Caverns last night and got over 70% exp in the time we were there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bortaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you want raw xp, I'd say go to HK if its not incredibly overcamped on your server. I'm lvl 30 right now and I kind of like doing LDoNs actually. Its not bad xp, you can pretty much get a lvl after two missions. Every once in a while you will come across a decent aug or item or something. Ive manage to rack up some wisdom and stamina augs in 4 missions. So, I say: xp = HK, fun = LDoN (call me crazy but I like them)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You could also try Castle Mistmoore (off LFay). A bit out of the way but it is a Hot Spot at the moment and the loot is great. You could also try Unrest, although it is empty on many servers.</div></div><hr />
