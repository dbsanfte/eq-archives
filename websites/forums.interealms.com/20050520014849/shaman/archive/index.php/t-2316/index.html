<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hudson Dawnweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I mean I know some are blue to me and some even and some yellow/red... At level 34 do I stand a chance at soloing a hill giant or 2 in rathe? Should I wait till my REIF procs at 35? or till I get better slows at 39? Cmon has ANYONE soloed HG's at 34?  If yes how exactly. I have not actually tried it yet but I am saving up for a JBB and would like to start in on these bad boys as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i first soloed a hill giant at level 34.<br />
<br />
i don't remember exactly what i did or even what spells i used anymore, as it was two and a half years ago...<br />
<br />
basic strategy - summon pet, buff with haste and regen.  pull with slow.  disease and poison, root as appropriate.  <br />
<br />
but i don't even know what spells are available for lower level shamans these days : ).  its not hard though, just keep the giant aggro on you and let the pet eat it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was told not to solo them till 44, they die nicely at 44, even though they are so camped i dont even think its worth it anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I soloed a hill giant in my mid-30s at some point, although it takes forever.  <br />
<br />
As for waiting for your icewurm fang to proc, it procs at 44 or 45, not 35.  Unless they changed it recently, mine didn't work until then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can you solo a HG at 34?  Maybe...would be a very tought fight I think unless you are very twinked.<br />
<br />
Is it worth it to solo them for cash before level 44?  I doubt it.  Prior to level 44 you cannot solo them effectively at all (again, may differ if you uberly twinked).  Sure you can kill them when you are lv. 39-43, but you have a LOT of downtime and possible coprse runs.  By the time you are 44, you can solo them on a fairly reliable basis.<br />
<br />
You want PP for JBB, I think you need to become an EQ trader, buy low and sell high.  I do not know much about that, I prefer hunting :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He did say he had a runed etched icewurm fang.<br />
<br />
Sounds like he probably is pretty twinked so I would say go for it :)<br />
<br />
Let us know how you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The reif does proc a 35.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i soloed my first yellow HG at lv 34(that was at the first months of EQ)didn t even know shaman were as good to take damage :-).<br />
that was my first char,whit crappy stuff.<br />
<br />
i had a pet whit haste/sow/str .<br />
i parked him in a safe place.<br />
pulled rooted a HG.<br />
casted  disease and my best dot at him(repeated dot root until i was near oom,and sent pet at HG whit no taunt.<br />
i already did more than half damage so the mob never turned at my pet,and i was cannibalising some mana back,whit pet attacking his back.<br />
ok it was very long(but only way to kill them IMO when it s your first char,whit low end items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hudson Dawnweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bah I am gunna try it. If a shaman w/ old world gear can do it I probably can. I have a ikky bp and a reif mostly totemic elsewhere w/ some JB mixed in  (for better AC). For attempting this should I go w/ the Ivory neck on 9ac or w/ the 65hp/65 mana neck?... Self buffed ill have about 750ac and 900hp....This should work. So the main idea is Park Veber buff us both up the wahoo med to full haste us both then pull w/ slow? or pull w/ scourge?... hrmmm....   Only reason I am trying this is I am pretty excited about my new spells and my dog dog.. hell I feel more powerful as a 34 shaman as I do w/ my 55 rogue =*(.... SOOOOO much more fun! NO LFG PLEASE!!!!!! anymore no group? SO WHAT SOLO POWAH!! WOOOT! Besides I love to role play DA TROLLESS! ME bash GUD!!! /em Burnsyoo drools.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Make sure that you find an out of the way spot, because any add's will toast you.  Doesn't have to be a HG, it could be a cyclops or a giant skeleton, but the end result will be a run to the zoneline or a CR.  I would suggest checking your bind spot before you start...Don't want to run from Kunark with no gear :)<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's usually not reasonable till you get your 39 spells(yes, you can do it earlier, but this is when you can do them reliably). <br />
<br />
Pretty much applies to druids/wizzies/mages/necros/shammies evenly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The other problem at 34 is that resists will eat all your mana, except when you are lucky. This is a worthy accomplishment to go for at 34, but I don't think it will seem very efficient to try to farm HG's at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mairi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Absolutely pull with the best slow you have.  You stand a better chance of landing your dots once you have it slowed than you do with it beating on you at it's normal attack speed. I personally was soloing them at 42, didn't try before then as I'm not dramatically twinked, and probably will never see a JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think I soloed my first HG in my mid-30s, mostly in totemic, with a few nicer items handed down by friends. I think I had a Jade Prod.<br />
<br />
I just couldn't wait to use that hound on what was an &quot;uber&quot; mob to me at the time. But it was hard as hell, and I suspect I may have died before I got the method worked out. I waited till around 39 (chloro!) before I started killing them for plat, I just wanted to see if I could do it when I tried earlier. As others have said, too many resists or any adds and you're running for the zone.<br />
<br />
It was a long time ago, so my memory may be hazy, but I'm reasonably sure I was in my 35 hell level.<br />
<br />
Pull with slow, then root and dot while I cann'ed mana back. Repeat and rinse. Then set the pet on it and start meleeing. Mind you, this was back in the old days when you could cast the Rage line with very little mana and get extra regen for the remainder of the fight. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I started out with Karana HGs. Harder to find, but much less aggressive adds.  Did the first one at 35 &quot;in self defence&quot;, got attacked, rooted, started dotting for fun. Died. Man was I proud :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pull with malise, and then root.  Just keep him rooted/dotted 'til you're too low on mana, send in pet and run him in circles while pet (with taunt off, very important) bites him in the arse.  Don't waste mana on a slow at this level, you don't wanna tank him at all anyhow.  Wait 'til 39-44 to actually use Togor's and do some tanking.<br />
<br />
p.s.  Once you get him rooted and dotted, get out of casting range.  When root breaks just stand up and keep trying to cast root/enstill until he's in range and he'll never touch ya.  Malise is important because it helps root last longer imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">before you enter the hill giant area(in rathe mountain)there is an area to the left(where the named drake)forgot the name.<br />
<br />
there's where i parked the pet.<br />
once again it was pretty long to kill one HG at lv 34.<br />
ipulled whit disease and tried to root,and casted a dot,root...ect.<br />
if i remember correctly(was at first months of eq ,hehe, i don't remember  much but i think i was able to cast dots or disease,even if they were not rooted.pet would not last long on these,so they do not have to take any damage.<br />
and will not if you did more than 50% damage whit pet no taunt and staying in agro range.was cannibalising to regain some small mana back,P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">At 34, do it for the challenge.<br />
<br />
At 44, do it for the money.<br />
<br />
At 54, do it to piss off all the 44's doing it for the money.  (j/k)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>wyrdrune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I did it at 34 , with totemic/banded armor, and puppy kited the thing, keeping aggro with dots<br />
<br />
(and while I commend you on searching first, try the combat and tactic thread as well, several hg threads :)</div></div><hr />
