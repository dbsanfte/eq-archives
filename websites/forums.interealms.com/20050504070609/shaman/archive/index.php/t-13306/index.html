<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know if I am the only person that has been buying up fishing spears in Tranquility to give to pets, but I recently discovered that these will not be dual wielded by pets.  I assume it is because they are primary only.  I parsed it and sure enough, no change from weaponless doggie.  Found out when a chanter friend turned my pet into a scarecrow amd no matter how many spears I handed him, he only equipped one.  <br />
<br />
Of course if you are from soe, then this is just a joke, please move along.  Pets can't dual weild ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you try making your pet fight fish?   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do you find your dog bogged down by tattered cloth sandals and rusty daggers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why would you expect a pet to dual wield a primary only item?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Because someone suggested it here.  But thanks for the helpful smug remark.  Hopefully this post will improve a few other shaman's dps.  <br />

Remember when we used to post helpful information here instead of taking cheapshots at every poster?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats also the same timeframe of when people actually used the search feature instead of repetively posting the same thing over and over, though this  thread isn't one of those.<br />
<br />
Back to the subject, I don't bother giving my pets weapons unless I happened to save some while roaming through a greeny zone, or the mobs drop weapons.  Particularly since I dont use a pet while soloing, so its kind of a moot point to fetch them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">*insert cheap shot at next post, regardless of it's possible usefulness, politness or integrity*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For those who haven’t happened across such a thread before, I’m sure this will prove most helpful.  When I first started using my puppy I had no idea how he duel wielded or even if he really did.  I was really happy to find out that my spirit puppy could use any weapon as long as it isn’t no drop.  And that unless it’s a procing weapon any old weapon will do.  And, as this post points out, primary and secondary restrictions do apply.  <br />
<br />
I try to keep at least four rusty weapons on me at all times.  If I loot them off mobs or fish them up it great.  If not, a quick run to Freeport will suffice, as there are two vendors there that have rusty weapons as their regular stock.  Another good source is the barbarian fisherman in PoK.  People often sell him the rusty daggers they fish up from the pool he stands beside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a spiritstone, which is surprisingly handy.<br />
<br />
I run into Halas, go to the merchant at the bar, and buy daggers for like 2pp each.  I can bank unmolested for buffs requests and without the horrendous lag I get in the bazaar or PoK.  <br />
<br />
Then race back out to EF and book to PoK and go where ever.  Works out good for me.  <br />
<br />
I'm bound in Plane of Mischief too, so the Faithstone is invaluable to get about and get things like daggers for my pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ditto for cabilis stone, you can buy three or four different kinds of weapons at vendors without zoning into the city.<br />
<br />
I, for one, like survival staff/shan-tok combination so I can 'hear' dogdog dual wielding (crush/slash).<br />
<br />
Of course, if I run into a mage this is a moot point since mage toys &gt; storebought toys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you have a primary / war weapon, then give it to your dog first. Then in second transaction give the dog another weapon that is secondary and he will dual wield. This works just fine at those times when you are short on weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Smackish Smackdaddy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hmm, was just thinking here.........scary i know.<br />
since dogdog is considered warrior class, and warriors piercing caps lower than 1hs and 1hb, any one tried parsing damage?<br />
just curious if he loses DPS due to less attack for using piercers.<br />
i know i always try to give dogdog 1hs and 1hb's, no idea if it matters but i do it anyhow, heh.<br />
i'm far to lazy to parse it myself, just a lil curious   :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">He will however dual wield if you give him a secondary only weapon, even if it's the only weapon you give him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shivs drop like candy in LoY, and don't sell too well, so make a quick jaunt down there if you're getting low on weapons.  The velium proccing weapons off giants in GD are quite nice too (if you don't mind smacking a few giants).  Gnoll hide lariats don't drop nearly enough to make them easy to acquire; the same with tentacle terror whips.   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Watch out for all spear-type weapons -- many spears only go in primary slot including rusty and fine steel and velium.</div></div><hr />
