<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ingred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I am a new shaman twink. I am switching over to shaman from a 51 paladin. I have about 15K but dont necessarily want to blow it all at once. <br />
<br />
Right now I am level 12, barbarian. I was wondering when would be a good time to get a horse. I assume the cheapest one will be ok to get?<br />
<br />
Also my gear is linked below, what would be good gear to fill the empty spaces?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Think the two best items you could get for your self that would last you for a while would be said horse then the Inky BreastPlate.  The regen you will get with both of those items will greatly decrease your down time.  They wont really start shining though till about 24 when you are able to turn that regen into mana with canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok...so this is wat u need to get imo<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwynhwyfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think I'd worry about a horse before you get comfortable with cannibalize.  If you're like most shaman, you're happily fighting toe to toe with your enemies, and your mana recovery time shouldn't be too bad.  I think I would replace those bracers, with something better, and if you are still concerned with mana, a Black Alloy Medallion would be nice.  It's AC, and wisdom, and has Mana Preservation II, so it will last you awhile.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd agree with Gwyn; I continued to melee into my 40s, its important for your defence if nothing else. So long as you melee, horse is useless.<br />
<br />
Here's my shopping list<br />
2 Velium fire wedding rings (6ac 65hp) 800pp<br />
Goranga idol for range (dops in ME, dunno price)<br />
Black sapphire electrum earrings<br />
Crystal spider eyes for face<br />
<br />
That's about 4k or so I guess, so you could replace some other bits too. Not sure if these have level requirements. <br />
<br />
Flowing black silk sash (a little haste is nice at your level)<br />
coldain skin gloves</div></div><hr />
