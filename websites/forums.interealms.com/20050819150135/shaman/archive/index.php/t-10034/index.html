<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Long story short... <br />
<br />
I belong to a mid-sized, family-style guild. We have tight allies and some experienced friends that tag along on most of our raids. <br />
<br />
Like many mid-sized guilds, PoP has created a rift between the &gt;60 people and the &lt;60's. Nearly all of our &gt;60s have left looking for &quot;more content&quot; and getting flagged. Some have been recruited by higher-end raid-type guilds.<br />
<br />
Our guild raids ~weekly, and requires a bit of advanced notice for long'ish raids (4+ hour raids), so we're a bit behind the power curve compared to most. Average level of the ~60 active players is 53 with the most active group (roughly 20 of us) at 55+. Between us, our friends and allies we can field about six 50+ clerics, three 60+ shaman, six+ higher level pure casters, and a dozen or more 55+ melees.<br />
<br />
Our guild can do Kael arena with out trouble, Chardok Royals, PoF (minus CT) and we recently cleared most of Hate and took down Inny for the first time. We're looking to &quot;take it up a notch&quot; and try some more difficult encounters. The question is, who and where?<br />
<br />
I've seen somewhere, a list of the &quot;old world&quot; boss mobs aranged in tiers. Trak and Inny are tier 1, Velketor the Sorceror, Zlandicar and Rhag`Mozdeth &amp; Rhag`Zhezum are listed as tier 2, etc...<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for is that list, or a more accurate one if it exists. I think the one I have is from Mage's Tower from October'ish of last year, but I'm sure I seen one here too... The Search function isn't cooporating with me, so I'm asking... Anyone know?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The list was made by Sony/VI, for the Legends server. On that server, guilds reserve pretty much all the major mobs, I am told, so there isn't the same sort of &quot;rush&quot; to beat each other.<br />
<br />
Last time I looked, the list was on the web site for Stormhammer. I'll see if I can find it again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Our small guild has been using the following thread for some suggestions as well, in addition to the tier link posted.  It's amazing what you can kill with 12 level 61+ with AA skills nowadays.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you for the quick response... That is indeed the list I've seen.<br />
<br />
The question I have is there are many mobs not on the list... I assume these are &quot;FFA&quot; mobs. Lodizal, VS, Master Yael, Scalekeeper, Kunark dragons, WW dragons, Woushi, lesser named giants in Kael... Maybe not technically a &quot;Tier 1+&quot; mobs, but still good for practice and loot.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to rank them in the Tiers? Even by adding say, a Tier 0.5 and Tier 0.25? Also, is there a way to ballpark the Ring events for average level/raid size? <br />
<br />
Myself and the other raidleaders in the guild are looking to take a &quot;baby steps&quot; approach to higher end encounters, skipping steps when needed. Our guild is new to this level of play and many are quite unsure of themselves in these situations. My main is lvl 55, so I'm pretty new to it myself. <br />
<br />
We're not a high powered guild, but we have a good solid core of members that are pretty well equiped (Thurg/SS level gear) and know their classes. What we lack is experience with the higher end mobs. That's where we're looking to go.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for your input. There's no replacement for experience. :)</div></div><hr />
