<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hope this doesn't only get read by higher lvl shammies even though, low need to hear this as well.  At lvl 54 to lvl 55 ish, I had 60k to my name.  I wanted more gear, more Ornate, more FT2+ items, but I was told by many wise shaman to not spendy the pp needlessly on anything else other then spells.  All else would pale in comparison.  <br />
<br />
Now I am lvl 59 and half way to lvl 60, I have my Malo, Torpor, FoS,, Avatar,  and PA spells. I have almost nearly all the spells below my current lvl.  I still need Anc Feral Avatar and Ancient Scorge of Nife, although I dont think I need thoughs 2 spells since I tend to group alot.<br />
<br />
Now my bank is down to 35k. I consider where I stand to be a HUGE accomplishment due to the shaman of this board, yet Im not at the top yet, I still don't have my epic even though Im on the 7th trial.  I can tell my 35k wont make it to lvl 65.  This worries me.  <br />
<br />
So I now call upon the shaman of this board to lend me there wisdom once more.  I need to know what spells from lvl 61+ and up to look for and what price to try and get them at to help me stretch what I already have.  So many spells, soo little pp and time.  Im considering staying in PoV till lvl 62 when I can enter BoT.   <br />
<br />
May wisdom hear my call once more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In general, I wouldn't buy any spells before you reach that level where you can use them.  Prices are continually coming down.  <br />
<br />
Quiessence is generally the best 60-65 spell that you will get.<br />
<br />
Getting to BoT is a good way to get spectral parchments and the occasional rune drop for 65 spells.<br />
<br />
You might also consider going to veksar with a friend and farming for items to sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Although I haven't looked at the bazaar prices for spells in a while, I imagine the level 61 and 62 spells should be dirt cheap; you should be able to afford them all. The level 63 and 64 will be a bit more expensive, because the spectral parchments are generally found in more restricted zones. My priorities for grouping would be: Blessing of Replenishment, Talisman of the Boar, Talisman of Alacrity (if you hate refreshing SltW), Velium Strike and possibly Tears of Saryrn. My priorities for soloing would be Breath of Ultor and Petrifying Earth.<br />
<br />
The only significant outlay will be for your level 65 spells. I would keep an eye on prices as you level up and try to pick up bargains. If your plans are to join a raiding guild at some point, they might be able to provide you with some or all of your 65 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can't speak for your server as the prices for level 65 spells are different for all the different servers but on Mith Marr, I got all my PoP L65 spells for the following prices:<br />
<br />
Fo7: regularly priced around 20K, bought it for 15K from a guildie.<br />
<br />
BoS: 2K in the bazaar<br />
<br />
FA: paid 24K (12K each) for 2 rune MQs.  One was for FA which I memmed and the other was an extra copy of Fo7 which was sold for 20K.<br />
<br />
Malos: Havent bought yet but runs between 6-8K PP in bazaar.  Have seen it for as little as 4K but atm, I havent had any reason to upgrade it from Malo.<br />
<br />
Quiescence: My single most favorite L65 spell usually sells for around 30K on the server but has been selling for around 20K rarely.  Snagged this one at 20K after selling a 60KPP Ornate Bracer Mold.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You should be able to pick up most 61-64 spells dirt cheap.  I've seen many of those spells for as low as 100pp in Bazaar cause there are just so many Ethereal and Spectral parchments out there now.<br />
<br />
If all you do is group/solo and don't raid, get Quiescence first.  Its really the only one you need, you can live with Primal Avatar and Malo for groups.  The rest just pick up as you can afford them.<br />
<br />
If you do buy OoW, I'd suggest going there the first few weeks and seeing if you can pick up some new drops in the beginning zones and sell them.  New expansion items, even stuff from the beginning zones usually nets you a good high price at first before people farm them.  Look at some of the Natimbi stuff and how high it went for at first.  Even if its something that would be an upgrade for you, just sell it if you get a good price, you can always go back and get another one later when prices aren't as high.  A lot of plat can be made in the beginning of an expansion when stuff is new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Danemoth Spiritconvoker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Definately get all your group buffs if possible (Talisman of Boar, Wrulan, Diaku, Alacrity, and Tribunal) it will save mana and time for buffing. Dont waste too much plat on Tears of Saryrn, as its only like 150 more damage a wave than Torrent of Poison.<br />
<br />
If you solo a lot, get Breath of Ultor. Its about 3k damage in 2 minutes, so it helps quite a bit IMO. If you group more than solo, dont waste huge amounts of plat on it. The regen spells are good since they were upgraded so getting Blessing of Replenishment would be good too. Keeps those Necros happy and quiet. :)<br />
<br />
For level 65 spells, get Quiescence first (as many have said), then afterwards its really up to you for what to get. Blood of Saryrn is an awsome DoT spell, especially in BOT, as it should run its full duration even after Malo + Turgurs. Ferine Avatar would be a good third if you can afford it. Malos and Focus of the Seventh should be the last things on your list of spells to buy if you have Malo and Focus of Soul. They are almost the exact same thing, except Malos reduces resists by like an additional 20 points and Fot7 is just a group version of Soul.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

Everyone already gave you the right information so i wont echo it.<br />
<br />
I did however want to congradulate you  on your accomplishments, i love how you portray the struggle, the accomplishments, you are really having fun and thats a big deal. Keep on having fun and dont let the high end raiding game suck you up and spit you out and take your wonder of the game away. Through your eyes EQ is a great game, keep it like that.<br />
<br />
good luck :)</div></div><hr />
