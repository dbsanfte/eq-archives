<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all,<br />
I had a pretty good weekend, for an under 50 shammy.  In the span of 2 days, I finally got stoicism (woot, great spell), I'm partially done with my epic (thanks guildies), and i made over 1k pp (frost giants in EF rock). K, here is how I did the epic part: I killed the guy in Rathe (got the gem), then killed the SK and Pally (also in Rathe) and did the loots.  I realise that this is somewhat out of order, but hey, it saved me a trip.  I did the turn-ins in Freeport, so now I need to do the test of patience.  Can someone tell me how long this takes (in RL time)? I tried to find out, but never saw a time given.  I realize that these are not BIG DEALS, but hey, It was a good weekend for me. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Count on 2 hours from the moment you start running/porting/getting on the boat until you're done. Been a while, but that seems about right<br />
<br />
Bakkal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">from when you reach the loc it vaires. Iv'e heard up to an hour but it was 40mins tops for me. Use InvisVs Animals though to ward off sharks (killer sharks see invis so if one passes you, move away).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agree with Teleosk on the time.  After turn in to Ogress, run to spot,  then about 40 mins, maybe 45.<br />
<br />
With lev, you can sit above water and listen for the spirits casting.  No shark aggro up there.<br />
<br />
without lev, but with E up, stand on sea floor and keep invis or invis-to-animals up.  Despite many quotes from others that it should not (or does not) help, all I know is:  I got aggro once, when the Invis-to-animals dropped because I needed to refresh EB.  I ran for shore, camped, and got back in time to meet the Spirit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Invis to Animals is your friend. I recommend swimming down and waiting on the sea floor with the spirits, if only because it's creepier and you get to see the spirits.<br />
<br />
I have fond memories of this part of the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">mine was about 40 min to a hour and oddly i never saw 1 shark or anything else for that matter. So yea , with porting and setting up and all that , about 2 hours or a lil under</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh I remember doing that part, although sharks are'nt as deadly as people make them out to be... but much better off to keep up invis-animals for sure.</div></div><hr />
