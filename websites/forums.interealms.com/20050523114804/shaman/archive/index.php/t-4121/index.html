<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, in one of the other threads I noticed someone say that shaman could duo well with almost any other class.  What I wanted to ask the Crucible was: how about clerics?  The reason I'm asking is because my RL friend plays a cleric (I'm level 52, she's 54), and while we work great as a trio with a tank (cleric tank works awesome, then I throw in haste, pet, JBB, and slows and things speed up) I have yet to figure out how to effectively duo.  So far, the best we can do is just to have me tank, and her heal me, but fights seem to take longer this way because my JBB gets interrupted more.  So then we try making my pet tank, like I do when I solo, and she heals the pet.  But with the pets low HP the cleric's heals are way inefficient, and since my pet's life isn't usually that much of a factor when I solo, her healing of him doesn't exactly speed the exp gaining up at all.  So, anyone have any ideas on different tactics we could try?  If so, I'd love to hear them.<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm toying with the idea of going to CoM and basically just soloing, with her using undead DoTs and DDs to add supplemental damage.  Has anyone ever tried this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Waredan Borealis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are missing one thing with that duo, melee damage. I wouldn't consider it a very viable group. The clerics main role is healing, and that would mean healing you - and on that same coin you tanking is really a waste of your time.<br />
<br />
A shaman with a melee is extremely potent because of the 'free' damage the melee provides.<br />
<br />
Its not a good group, but yea you can make it work - you will probably get better exp solo'ing tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, this is a tough one.  <br />
<br />
I think your plan (acting as if you're solo'ing but having her throw in damage through DoTs and DDs- and concentrating on undead mobs) is a good one, but probably still not at efficient as having a melee around.<br />
<br />
Definitely have a dog up and hasted.  I'd seriously consider throwing a Cripple-series debuff on the mobs (so dogdog can hit better), Slow (duh), Cann like crazy (she can heal you), and alternate between JBB, nukes, DoTs, and plain old barshing (get a big two hander and swing between casts.)<br />
<br />
I'm thinking you'll need to play a little dangerously in order to get good xp from this combo.  Think of it this way, you need to be killing mobs twice as fast as when you solo... and you basically have a very similar &quot;safe&quot; damage output.<br />
<br />
Might not be efficient, but is might just be a messy good time!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its possible and fun though probably not the most efficient thing in the world to do.  Just go somewhere fun, find undeads and enjoy.<br />
<br />
Let the cleric root and stun and nuke.  Remember to ge buffs on that pet as well as yourself.  Celestial heal is good for pets.<br />
<br />
Later on in levels MoR and MoK are the biggest assest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A cleric is probably the toughest class to duo with efficiently. But since I have a few good friends that play clerics, I've done that duo often. It actually gets better at higher lvls, once you get cann4, BoN and Pox. <br />
<br />
Pull with Mal-x, since it will help the cleric land spells, slow if need be, then stack your 2 best poison dots and maybe a disease dot. JBB and re-apply poison dots when required. After the fight, canni down and get a complete heal. At 60, I can come close to doubling my kill rate with a cleric partner, although I'm sure that if I had torpor that wouldn't be the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh and remember one more thing.<br />
<br />
The shaman that duo's with a cleric always gets a rez. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great, thanks for the tips all (and keep 'em coming if you have any more :-) ).   I'm now really looking forward to getting to higher levels so I can Cann4 and get CHs.  As it stands right now, we do something similiar with Cann2, but it takes forever and is hardly worth the trouble.  At any rate, there's no place like the crucible for advice and tactics on random class combos :-)</div></div><hr />
