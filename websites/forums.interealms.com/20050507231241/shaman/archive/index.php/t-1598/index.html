<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darkui</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used to play a shaman. I got him to 22 and then decided to quit, 19-23 is horrible:(<br />
<br />
But I've decided to go back to him and I need some advice on gear. I already have a fungi tunic and fungi staff (waiting until 35 so I can use it). I will have approximately 50k to spend on the rest of the slots. All advice would be appreciated, thanks.<br />
These are ARo prices by the way.<br />
<br />
BTW he is a barbarian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was the same way.  I quit at like level 17 and thought it was too difficult to level.  Then the second time around - I guess I knew what I was doing - I blew through the 20s like it was nothing.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to address your question:<br />
<br />
You didn't mention race but if you can wear it, JB armor is nice to fill in on some slots (e.g. arms, feet, etc.).<br />
<br />
If you want a really good weapon I'd recommend the Rune Etched Icewurm Fang.  It goes for probably around 5k or so now and is a really great weapon especially for a lower level shaman (IMO).  But you're best off using a piercer because the epic, if you ever get it, is piercing.<br />
<br />
Get a good shield ... CC, SBS, whichever.  Some of the Arctic Wyvern armor is nice also.<br />
<br />
For jewelry it depends on what kind of shaman you want to be (WIS v. AC/HP) but the Velium Fire Wedding Rings (6ac, 65hp) are great.</div></div><hr />

If you have 50K to spend, just click the Magelo profiles of some of the shaman on the board to get an idea for gear.</div></div><hr />
