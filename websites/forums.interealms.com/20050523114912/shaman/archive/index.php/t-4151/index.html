<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dinged 28 about 3 days ago. I've been hunting in Marus Seru lately grouped, but the exp got slow, so once I turn 28, I decided to solo. I get much better exp soloing in Marus Seru, but the problem is I burn all my mana on these little bastards with over 1000hp. I use envenomed beath on them and by the time it runs it's corse it only took away 1 bubble of health from them. Can someone please recommend a good spot to solo that can take me from 28-34? I've tried Echo Caverns and the needlite, but those things hit to fast and to hard for me to solo, even with walking sleep. I've just been kinda idling since I turned 28, so I blew all my money and started a twinked druid. It's 9 now, but I don't really wanna abondon my shaman because they seem to be the ultimate soloers. Thanks in advance. - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've found high 20's to low 30's tough to solo with several of my characters. <br />
<br />
In the short term, LOIO is excellent xp until 30, even 31 if it's not too crowded. My high-level spot there is on the beach on the South edge of the Lake. There's a big mountain there were you should find plenty of single wandering blues. Easy to pull them off the mountain and down to the beach for easy killing.<br />
<br />
From there, I think I had some success in FM killing burynai miners, but the adds there can be brutal. <br />
<br />
Now that I think about it - why are we posting this stuff here?! Take it to the Hunting Grounds forum! =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I leveled from 30-34 pretty much at the Golra Iceberg in Timorous Deep. No competition for spawns, and there is a exp modifier in that zone 20% I believe so the exp should flow like water. <br />
Loot isn't great but its not too shabby either, occasional pp and words are dropped by them and they will help work on your melee skills and defense. No roamers so adds are not a problem.<br />
Here is a link to a map of <br />
Tim Deep (http://eqatlas.com/kunark/timorousdeepmap.html) <br />
<br />
#12 on the map is the Golra Iceberg, here is a link to the beastiary:Golras (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=72) <br />
<br />
The only real problem is getting there is a pain, and always have Gate memorized. Also Crushed Diamonds for Cannibalize II quest iis a ground spawn on that island at  location: -8840, -6080. <br />
Good Luck hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You could try Netherbian lair until 30.<br />
<br />
Then once you hit 30, head right down the hall to Dawnshroud peaks and hunt at the zone in.<br />
<br />
I would suggest finding a group until you get 34.  And watch out for wolves.  They have a HUGE aggro range and hit like a mack truck.<br />
<br />
Or you could just head to OT.  The loot there will be better as zelniaks and wolves in dawnshroud peaks drop nada.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">try checking the hunting grounds forums too.  You may find some suggestions there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have checked the hunting forums, but the thing is they all say Dawnshroud peak. They all also recommend grouping there, something I really don't want to do after I tasted the exo of a solo artist. Thanks for the advice guys. I think I'll stick it out in Marus Seru till 29, then head back down to Everfrost so I can charm the mammoths to hunt each other. Thanks again guys.  -Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I will also vouch for Golra Island in Tim Deep.  Great exp, easy mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i'd do either SK spires or inside Paw if you have good gear.  this will take you to 34-35 pretty fast if its not too crowded.  you can also get a decent amount of FS to sell.</div></div><hr />
