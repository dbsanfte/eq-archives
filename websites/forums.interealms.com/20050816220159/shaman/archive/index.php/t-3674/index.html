Part a recent large tradeskill patch.  They are created with pottery skill and have unlimited charges of a &quot;home port&quot; for priest classes.  Cabillis, Swamp, Everfrost... and the like.  They are 20 stones or so each and take 30 to cast or so.</div></div><hr />

Another nice thing about these is you can bind outside a dungeon and use the spiritstone to bank or sell and then gate back. <br />

The Iksar one to FoB is also great for going to Sebilis as you are right beside the EJ zone.</div></div><hr />

 At skill 250(255 with my trophy) I have a 1/3 success rate on these. They are diety and class restricted. Drop points are the the same as gate potions, as far as I know I can't really use the Iksar and Barb ones. =)</div></div><hr />

From what I understand, it will cost about 20K to get the pottery<br />
skill up to the point where you can (semi) reliably make them. <br />
I'm not sure on the cost per attempt, but I remember it being<br />
around 2-3K. I paid 6K for mine on Tunare the week after they<br />
came out, which I thought was quite a bargain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">20k is a pretty good approximation on what it costs to get to around 220 pottery skill. It costs considerably more than that to get to 250 for me though. Cost per attempt of spiritstone/prayerstone is approimately 250p (as long as you didn't pay for the iron oxide for the glaze, which could potentially add another 300-500p per success on the wheel that you fire in the kiln). I usually charge 4k. For swamp stones I charge an extra fee unless they bring swamp veggies to me. I can't stand trying to find groundspawns in innothule. The success rate for most of the stones once you reach around 250 skill seems to be near 50%. At 220ish skill I had approximately 25% success. Below 200 skill it would be a statistical abberation (pure luck) if you had a single success out of 100.</div></div><hr />

Below 200 skill it would be a statistical abberation (pure luck) if you had a single success out of 100. <br />
<br />
I was under the impression you always had a 5% chance for success regardless of skill (and a 5% chance of failure), which means you should get about 5 out of 100 (plus what limited skill you do have, but minus the 5% chance to fail).<br />
<br />
A wizard I know was talking about that with the shawl quest.  The theory being it was faster just to fail until you lucked into a combine than to grind out all the required skill increases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>snow79</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">2k on test :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">5% success rate is minimum but...<br />
<br />
Given that this also requires firing (I don't know trivial) you might end up making 100 attempts to get a finished stone as you'd need to beat the 5% thing twice.<br />
<br />
_______________________________<br />
<br />
For POTC quest, the components destroyed on a ROBE combine are roughly 60 PP.  The expensive Gemmed Chain is returned on a failure.<br />
<br />
Ergo, if you want to spend the time to farm a stack or two of silks it makes little sense to pay 4k for a ceremonial solsitce robe robe ... use the 5% rule, spend 1200 PP on ingreds for 20 combines, add in 800 or so for the gemmed chain and you can expect to have a self-made robe for 2k.<br />

Now tell me this people<br />
<br />
Why in the da name of da Gawds was this skill NOT put under Alchemy?<br />
<br />
If you dont think alchemy has not place making 'stones' dont forget about the philosopher stone.  Long prized  in the art of Alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I would assume it wasn't placed under Alchemy because these stones are also for clerics as well as shamans, so they wanted a skill everyone has access to.   Also I believe this was a nice push to pottery which previously was a worthless skill beyond Thurg gate potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Munkee Bizness - Yub. Our spiritstone puts us in the Innothule<br />
swamp, right in the hand with the invisible men. Same place that<br />
the gate potions puts us.  Great loc, very close to the Feerott. <br />
Also handy for getting to South Ro for a pickup (either Druid or <br />

Wish all Shaman could use all Shaman spirit stones. I'd love to<br />
be able to use the one near Seb (Field of Bones).</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Im level 60 and get ask for Sow/shrink potions.  This would have been a perfect chance to high level Shamans to make some money back.   Shamans potions are useable by all, I just dont understand to put stone under pottery is all.<br />
<br />
 Lets not even get into resale rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Blackpete</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I got lucky and found a potter last weekend who was willing to help me make one.     I provided 2 innothule mushrooms and 1 iron oxide that he said he needed for the attempt.   His skill wasn't the greatest, but I had received no other tells after auctioning for a spiritstone, so figured what the heck.     I paid him 2k in addition to providing the 3 items I mentioned above, and he successfully made it.      Really lucked out that he made it, although he wouldn't have charged me anything on a failure.    <br />
<br />
The swamp gate does land you right on the hand in the middle of the Shadowed man camp, but at level 55, they didnt aggro at all, even standing next to them for several minutes.     Definitely love that they added these stones, with them, the OT hammer and gate, cant quite port like a druid or wizard, but it ain't bad.   :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">100 tries for 5 successes is so laughable as to defy description.<br />
<br />
You need iron oxide for a completed stone. IRON OXIDE IS REALLY REALLY REALLY RARE. Worse-than-blue-diamond rare.<br />
<br />
To get 5 completed stones (the firing is only slightly less trivial than the idol itself), would require roughly 2000 attempts. Course, at an average of 40 attempts per skill imp, you'd expect your skill of 200 to max out at 250...and with higher skill, your success rate will get better.</div></div><hr />
