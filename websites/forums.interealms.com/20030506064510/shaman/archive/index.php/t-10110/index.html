<br />
Hoping that you can confirm my logic here.<br />
<br />
Current equip in glove slot is SCHW, now that i am approaching 45 and have JBB ready to use, should i keep them as i wont really be meeleeing anymore due to horse that i just bought?<br />
<br />
Seems sensible to me, but i thought that the experience here may help me.<br />
<br />
Also, what can i replace them with? Pref Droppable or Questable solo. (or Buyable :P)<br />
<br />
Any other equipment suggestions appreciated also.<br />
<br />
Going to solo the Coldain Military Bracer soon too.<br />
<br />

Cheers.</div></div><hr />

I was in your situation, albeit I was 52 when I finally got my JBB...... but I went one step further.   I sold my SCHWs and my REIF.  Let's just say I really wanted to get a white horse to go with my JBB, and the SCHW and REIF netted me 10k :)<br />
<br />
Now what to replace em with.<br />
<br />
For the hands I went with Leaf Scale gloves because they were so cheap.... 150pp. Remember I just blew another 10k.<br />
<br />
AC 14 DEX 3 WIS 5 AGI 4 HP 30<br />
<br />
Other options are Shissar Scaled Gauntlets<br />
<br />
AC 12 WIS 5 HP 40 MANA 40  (about 1k)<br />
<br />
or Crystal Chitin Gauntlets<br />
<br />
AC 20 MANA 35 (about 2K)<br />
<br />
With regards to the primary slot I went very unconventional, no weapon at all.  Now I carry a book.<br />
<br />
History of the Dizok (500pp)<br />
<br />
AC 15 WIS 2 HP 35 MANA 35  (not a bad stat booster)<br />
<br />
I exclusively use JBB now and let dog dog do the meleeing.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your choice and as far as ditching the SCHWs.. I agree.<br />

<br />
A horse and jbb are a tremendous combination.<br />
<br />
When you can't use the horse,  you still do not need the hast because you only swing between JBB blasts.  The best wepon to swing will have the bigest damage number and you should not care about delay at all. <br />
<br />
As an ogre....  i would rather die then equip a book *grins* but Naala's chose is both resonable and rational.</div></div><hr />

that one is soloable at about 49, if you kill the chieftain thru dots only, then loot, agro one guard and  run to pet.  the chieftain does not leave his spot when attacked, and will not be assisted unless you do DD.<br />
