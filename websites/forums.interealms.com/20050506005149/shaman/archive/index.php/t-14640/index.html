<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Servel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's a question that I'm sure someone here can answer:<br />
<br />
What level does our pet need to be in order to proc the mage summoned swords and hand to hand items?<br />
<br />
I know that there are at least 2 swords they can summon. One is &quot;sword of Waylan&quot; or somthing like that. The other is &quot;sword of Kedge&quot; I think.<br />
<br />
I am only level 45, and wonder if my pet can use either of them.<br />
<br />
Thanks.  :) <br />

Shaman pets are patheticly low level untill out 61 pet. You lvl 55 pet is in the mid 40's if memory serves. the level 44 pet is even lower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently confused about dex bufs on pets tho.....<br />
<br />
and only chk lvl 65 folk for buffs if desperate, as many are arrogant jfjkj who are always too busy to buff, &quot; I am on my way to a raid...&quot;  bah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">and only chk lvl 65 folk for buffs if desperate, as many are arrogant jfjkj who are always too busy to buff, &quot; I am on my way to a raid...&quot;  bah!<br />
<br />
wow.  I think it rather arogant to expect anyone you don't know to buff you just cause you want them to.  I solo my shaman self buffed only unless I either have leftover buffs from a group or happen to see someone oocing or shouting that they are buffing for donations.  It would never occur to me to send someone I don't know a tell and expect them to buff me.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, I do get those tells on my cleric.  If I am on my way somewhere I usually reply with &quot;sorry people are waiting&quot; but I guess that is arrogant and I should just tell my raid/group that they have to wait while I buff the 2-10 people that send me tells while running through PoK.  If I'm not on my way to a raid or group who is waiting for me, I usually reply with my location.  Depends how I'm asked but a polite request almost always gets buffed.</div></div><hr />

Your playing on my server huh  :p <br />
I would buff anyone who asked when I wasnt on a raid but getting tells when raiding by some clueless gimp who starts to insult you because you wont leave your raid to buff him in bazaar or wherever can also get annoying.. Try to see the other side of the coin  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">eeek salorm   /shudder<br />
<br />
DId u get anymore pills yet from the doc yet?  muhahahha)<br />
<br />
Actually its the 65 folk who wont even reply to tell that is annoying.<br />
<br />
jenina i always give buffers 21pp for crack/virtue and various amount for the pet gear. So get off yer PC soap box plz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I always feel a little bemused when I see people whining about high levels not stopping to buff them. I have never sent a tell for buffs, except maybe the odd kei when no one was selling. Even then I am polite and just request it if they are free, or if I am going to attempt a mob that could well be above my level. If they say no I just thank them for responding to the tell and head on out.<br />
<br />
Just because you want buffs, and there is a 60+ person who &quot;could&quot; buff you in the zone, it is not your right to expect them to. If you are so reliant on virtue/kei to play then you are probably playing the wrong character in my opinion.<br />
<br />
The thing that I find fascinating about playing a shaman is that I can self buff up the wazoo and take on same level or higher level mobs with a feeling that I can win it. I think I have had virtue etc about 3 times solo in my 54 seasons (raiding it is a given anyway) and then it was usually because I had sent a tell to a cleric that a drop they wanted had arrived. That is their normal mode of thanks which is nice, but not something I request.<br />
<br />
This is a bit of a rant, for which I apologize, but I just can't see the reason why high level folks get put down for not stopping to buff people upon request.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How wonderful!  A cleric can make 10.5p for using 1/5 of his mana bar!  What a lucky opportunity for him!  And to avoid being an &quot;arrogant jfjkj&quot; he can explain to his group/raid when he gets there that he has to med before buffing.<br />
<br />
I've never had a PC soap box before so I think I'll keep it, thanks.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A WHOLE 21pp? What fools they are for not rushing right over to get that bounty! Little hint for you, you are not the center of the universe and people didn't start playing EQ to buff YOU or to rez YOU or to spend their time helping YOU. If they buff you, they are doing you a favor, it is NOT a right. Besides, what the hell do you need buffs for, you are a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I rarely ask for buffs, and if I do its from friends who are in the same zone and buffing for donations. I don't feel they are exactly needed, and unless I have raid buffs or xp group buffs I never have anything not mine eecept an occasional Kei from a friend of mine who always kei's me when he sees me. 21pp for a 10.5pp cost plus a 5th of the old mana bar is uber, gotta figure he can make a whopping 52.5pp before he has to med for 10 minutes. thats a whole 315pp an hour!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">From what I've tested so far, the the mage-summoned haste mask does not work on our dog. Whether it works at all on pets of other classes, I don't know. Our pets will equip the summoned HP belts though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nytmare, stop it you are scaring me....what do you mean mage pet mask doesn't work on our dogdog? Have you parsed, or is that just an empirical impression from watching dogdog in action?<br />
<br />
On the subject of buffs, I always ask prospective buffers (clerics, chanters and druids) if they are willing to trade their buffs for my shaman buffs - there aren't many that turn down focus and stamina at the very least, and it seems a reasonable swap for aego/virtue or KEI/tranq or PoTC/PotG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I thought for sure I parsed that mage muzzle at around 11 percent on my dog (true spirit) a month ago in PoV.  I'll have to go and try it again.  <br />
<br />
BTW, I was using 2 swords, muzzle and girdle on dog, with Focus of Soul, replenishment and celerity.  Makes for one mean mutt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I parsed, with and without SLTW, with and without dual weild. Mask should be 11% haste, but had no effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">BUffs help speed up exp rate.  Only idiots would not take advantage of any help available.  I guess the same turkeys dont give theri doggy procing weapons- cos that a crutch too! sheesh<br />
<br />
Also i exp in duneons with alot of HT mobs so getting hp over 3k is very useful, also have the bad habit of puling the mobs in torment for the grp, well the crows anyway, and being doubled for 300-350 if a mob resists is a bit risky; both for myself and for the grp.  Rezes just slow a grp down, so my getting buffs is me being considerate to the grp.<br />
<br />
Shaman &quot;jack of all trades&quot; is a class that requires using any angle u can, spending my time purchasisng buffs helps me perform as a competent player.  If this upset some gimped liberal from CA then HELL:  `Barman----MINES a buff PLZ!! <br />
Its people of that mindset who come up with things like- lets put a tax on internet communications, cos we`re bureaucrats and we have issuses --we were abused as kids, so lets take it out on everyone and tell them they have to be bland gimps with no opinions too. Hey those folk seem to be enjoyign themselves /slap get back in line!  How dare you have a goodtime!<br />
<br />
/chukle<br />
<br />
ps actually the real reson i buy buffs is because i am a power lvling froggy to 60.  Guess i been found out  /blush.<br />
<br />
I muck around abit with some faction work in guk and nurga but an 2 yellow from 60 with 22 days played.  I am the 2nd frogy to 60 on my  erver, the other was 65 in 6 weeks and had his epic at 40. Even i find that sad LOL<br />
<br />
I dont recomend lvling fast to 60 if u have played eq less than a year. The first year of eq is time for having as much fun as u can.  Its when ur really adsicted that u can phaff about lvling hard.<br />
<br />
ok the shakes are cutting in i better get back to norrath  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Guess your talking about Harokan the frog who was 65 with epic first on AB server? If you didnt know this Starlite, your attitude is hostile and rude.. And I understand very well why your getting flamed for it.. I remember I went to your forum and got the same welcome there after a while about me being so uber and looked down on each and everyone.. You need to calm the **** down before replying with your attitude.. And believe it or not, its EU who came up with the taxes to buy **** from outside EU so blame them and not USA about this.. USA even tried that(taxing internet stuff) a few times, but there wass alot of discontent I vaguely remember.. And hell, Im from Sweden knowing this and I will also be taxed those 17%.. <br />
well, thats all folks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If this upset some gimped liberal from CA <br />
<br />
Is this referring to me?  LOL!  I'm almost laughing too hard to type.  <br />
<br />
Just for the record, I have no problem with people who purchase buffs.  My problem is with the people with bad attitudes who think others exist in the game only for thier convenience.  <br />
<br />
Back to the real thread... <br />
<br />
I'm really interested in if the muzzle works or not.  Seems odd that it wouldn't since it is specifically for pets - unless it is mage pet only?  <br />
<br />
If this is true, how do we know the 250 HP belt works?  I guess you can parse how much damage your pet can take before he dies?  I've read in other threads that +HP buffs work but no +stat buffs work... so is the belt good for all stats or just the HPs?  Wondering if the summoned items work the same as buffs here.  If the stats don't work is that by design or something else that is &quot;working as intended&quot; until they figure out how to fix it?  <br />
<br />
I went and found the items being discussed since I wasn't sure on the stats of some of them and figured some others may not be as well.<br />
