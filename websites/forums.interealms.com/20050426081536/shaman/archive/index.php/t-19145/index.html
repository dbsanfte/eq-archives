<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blaorfi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to solo the dragon in CS, sorry I cant remember his name</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">says on allakhazams he has a 1k ae with stun,depending on how long the stun is id say this would be possible 8) might be one of the &quot;toughest solos&quot; but thats to be expected.<br />
<br />
dont see how its not worth a shot 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would think your hardest part will be getting him solo to the shorline, but once you get him there it shouldn't be too hard I'd imagine.  Practice on some comperable AE dragons in WW if you want less competition to refine strategy.   I'll post again if I ever see him up and give it a shot with my impressions, but from what I recall the 2 times I did him with friends it shouldn't be too hard.</div></div><hr />

The author at one point says &quot;A 65 Shaman might well be able to solo Kelorek'Dar.&quot;  Sounds like a challenge to me :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">delited post, you beat me to the punch with that link man =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've trio'd him twice.  He's a bitch to slow and malosinia took a few times with malos and HOS in.<br />
<br />
his AE is cold based and we had a bard tanking most of the fight(about the 4th slow bounce i tanked for about 45 seconds)<br />
<br />
He could probably be solo'd if your CR was around 400 and you melee'd with a tash stick till you got him slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I 2-boxed him a few weeks back.  Was a little scary until I got him slowed, since his unslowed melee + 1k ae do some pretty fast damage.<br />
<br />
I think I was maybe fighing him in the wrong place though...  I've seen pics of him up on the beach, but I tried to pull to the rocks (since not much in CS likes me, and I really didn't want an add), but he wouldn't come out of the water, so I was constantly trying to keep him right at the edge of the water so I could hit him, but didn't have to keep my shaman in the water for heals to land.  He summoned my warrior in fairly often though, so it was rather annoying.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it was a long fight, but not really too mana intensive once he was slowed, and I was only self-buffed, so I'd think with raid buffs and maybe slightly better gear and/or the hp/defensive AAs, he'd be soloable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've trio'ed him (65 untitled warrior, 65 elder druid, and me 65 elder shaman 94 aa).  Slow stuck after malos.  Fight took about 10 mins and had to re-slow.  Disease dots and epic dots stuck well.  Poison dots seem to stick after malos, but sometimes resisted.  He would be a challenge for a shaman to solo, but if we'd be one of the classes that would have a shot at it.</div></div><hr />
