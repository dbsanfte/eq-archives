<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which of the following suggestions would make a good AA skill in OoW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cann 5 crits hahahaha. You give an odd choice. My idea is possibly that the options should have been divided as<br />
Enhancement-Hastened Cann5, Dire 50% spells<br />
Utility-Improved Invis or Advanced Suspended Minion.<br />
Novel- Pet Avatar idea.<br />
Not selecting them just saying that would have been perhaps a better categorization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sacrificial Canni (die, and give mana conversion to another, similar to pally sacrificial heal)<br />
<br />
Shouldn't that be Ranger in group dies, his health converted to mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">please define &quot;passive canni&quot; ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">please define &quot;passive canni&quot; ?<br />
<br />
Probably means a form of Lich similar to necros, but with a shorter timer, say, 2 minutes, you lose hps as you gain mana.<br />
<br />
I voted for Group Canni. If there is ONE THING that we truly lack in the overall group scheme compared to other &quot;highly desirable&quot; casters, its the ability to increase or give mana. Even our Hybrid (BL) has excellent forms of this, both a buff and an AA.<br />
<br />
I want Paragon, but BETTER than the BL version, period, end of story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Group canni, but only if its coupled with a group HoT that is efficent to use. This would be a good way to speed up mana productionw hile limiting it to when its needed. THis wouldnt unblance our soloing aspects but would increase our group presence.<br />
<br />
Though advanced suspended minion would be oh so sweet.<br />
<br />
Though hasten can5 would be sweet. I cant decide between can5 hasten or group, but either one i would be happy with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hastened canni, but group canni is nice and PLEASE an improved invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hell Improved Invis shouldn't cost us AA's it should be a spell like everyone elses......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Group canni, but only if its coupled with a group HoT that is efficent to use.

<br />
<br />
<br />
Very true.  I can just imagine the outcry the first time we group canni and it resulted in a chanter or cleric death because we did not have a group HoT to go along with it.  Would be nice, but also require extreme caution when using.  <br />
<br />
Group Canni/HoT and passive canni or quicker refresh on Canni 5, get my vote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Guntak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Group canni, but only if its coupled with a group HoT that is efficent to use.<br />
My thoughts exactly. Give us group canni and group Q... I'd be one happy bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Honestly Group canni with perhaps a small group heal would be nice.<br />
<br />
They wont give us a group HOT cause they would screw us and root the whole friggin party<br />
A small group heal would suffice instead.<br />
<br />
Now to be fair if the bumped up the group regen and the passive group canni would be a nice way to provide us with mana regen abilities for folks</div></div><hr />
