<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Lost Dungeons of Norrath introduces an exciting new type of treasure to EverQuest. Using new modular items gained from dungeon adventures, characters are able to modify the powers and effects of their equipment, allowing for a tremendous amount of customization.<br />
<br />
Using these new items, characters can augment an existing breastplate, for example. Bonding the proper augmentation item to the breastplate might give it +5 strength. Bonding a different augmentation item could give it +6 wisdom. These are just a few simple examples; the new items have a wide variety of possible effects and benefits.<br />
<br />
Have a helmet that you like, but think needs a little boost? This new item system allows you to customize that helmet and make it fit your character's needs better. Most characters have a favorite item that they've had in their bank for a while. They don't want to destroy it because it holds some memories, a link to the adventures they had gaining it. With this new item augmentation system, those items gain new life and endless potential!<br />

That's incredibly nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We've done this here at SoE because we are tired of our playerbase always finding nitpicky flaws in every piece of equipment that we release.<br />
<br />
With this new system you can only blame yourself.  Also, we are lazy.<br />
<br />
All joking aside though I think this is kind of a neat idea.  I would honestly wait a while before I even attempted any modification of items like this though as the possibility for bugged effects is huge.  I mean look what happened to the folks that just preordered this expansion; Id hate to see what could happen.  It might wipe all stats except the ones that were modified....heh</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">anyone played diablo 2? sounds alot like the socketed armor, so i don't think they would let u edit existing armor.  I could also imagine the accual armor peices being nodrop and having a diffrent # of &quot;slots&quot; you can put things into, that come in the form of dropable &quot;gems&quot; kinda like velious all over again /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh my.. Anyone else play Parasite Eve through about 20 times till they had a gun with maxed stats?   Hope it takes at least a month before we see someoen linking their 99 all stats 999 hp/mana BP :)<br />
<br />
<br />
  Of course, this means the prices on any item with a nice focus or click effect will SKYROCKET.   Superpowered fungi would be nice indeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
   I wonder... will we get a &quot;item socket&quot; that can add another class or race to an item?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The ONE thing I dream of in this expansion... a decent, long, annoying quest for a NICE cloak item...  Cloak and shield are the last 2 items that I need to upgrade to something that few have or kicks enough arse I don't care that others have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Given the way the EQ item database works, they will probably limit any one piece to a single change. Just enough to bring up some minor shortcoming, but not enough to have a HUGE influence on the stats of the item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Get this, if you sign up for beta (seems automated at the moment) you can enter a single command to get all your spells, including the LDoN ones.... excuse me while I go see how much Bane is going to &quot;suck&quot;</div></div><hr />

I love it when people post without reading it hehe<br />
<br />
Alot of people think it will make the item nodrop and u can unbond it to make it dropable again or the new stats will be bonded to your toon so if u sell it wont have the stats like the loy dye</div></div><hr />

yeah, was gonna post the same thing.  I will almost guarantee any items that you currently have will be able to be modified.  I am also betting that its not gonna be very easy/cheap to do so though.</div></div><hr />
