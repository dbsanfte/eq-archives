<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brewnoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The last couple days I've been sitting in the guild hall working on my crafting when I wasn't able to find a kei right off the bat.  While I was sitting there wondering if anyone was casting it I thought it would be nice to be able to click a button and hear PoK /ooc ... <br />
<br />
Well, tonight when an alliance member complained about buffs wearing off while looking for other buffs, it finally hit me .. a pokbuff chat channel. Buffers that want to play an alt can join with their alt and log in their buffer if demand is high enough for em while people that have one buff but really need another to hunt can preserve that buff in the guild hall and so on.. <br />
<br />
For my fellow Stromm-ites, I'll be in PoK tomorrow passing out shammie buffs and benefit awareness potions (5pct mana cost reduction on buffs that stacks with mana preservation) to try and get the channel going. <br />
<br />
For my shaman brothers and sisters that want to try this on their servers, best of luck. =D</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's KEI?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Isn't KEI that buff that casters other than Shaman and Necromancers get addicted to?  Necros can't use it. and Shaman don't need it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, but there is a battle waging amongst some of the older and some of the newer, should we say p s y Necros, that don't feel like having their hps go down, and omgz the lifetap dot costs so much mana, etc.. <br />
<br />
I despise a Necro who uses KEI, slacker, loser, wanna be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, first time I grouped with necro asking for voq/pot9 I nearly fell off my horse.  Still kinda wonder what the point of it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">9 is good, VoQ wont overwrite our 49 lich. They are slackers, they should bind over lava and drop Lev, they suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The KEI line is great, it lets me cast more panthers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When our raid leader forbid all illusions on certan fights including lich all our necros only wached the fight without moving an inch only casting lifetaps to keep themselves alive. :D <br />
<br />
Nothing more shamefull as a necro to be forced to use  C line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Look at the mana cost on our best dots and you can see why. Our new lifetap over time at 68..750 freakin mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WHat the hell raid leader would force necros out of lich form? Thats rediculous. As to a necro using KEI once they ding 49 they need to be shot and it's even worse if they have SoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Savas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">KEI addict since sunday when I got spirit of the panther.<br />
<br />
I use to be proud that I could just run off and play and not have to beg for a kei, now i'm in line.  Damn it all to hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Some zone crashes/lag outs seems to be related to using illusion spells, lich wasnt treated any better than other illu spells. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Brewnoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Congrats to Griz and anyone else so dedicated to blowing thru new content asap that they think the game is dead.<br />
<br />
Please pardon us c5-less noobs while we enjoy our kei and Norrath in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">man...thats out of the blue.<br />
<br />
simply put, a shaman can canni, so there really is no NEED to carry any mana regen buffs. its not to say that they don't help but have you ever tried pulling your own weight?<br />
<br />
take something you normally do with KEI or similar.<br />
<br />
now click off all of your buffs and give yourself only the ones you can cast on yourself. now try it again.<br />
<br />
the point is that you won't always have it available to you. if you can't function without it, you can't function at all. buffs fade, they get dispelled, they can seriously hinder your play style in certain situations.<br />
<br />
whenever I go to solo for a few hours, I don't take any buffs from any of my guildies. because it messes up my rhythm. no cleric HP buff. fine. if I were soloing in yxtta, the extra HP matters ALOT. I get wreckless, I can canni a little more, try and root the mob one last time. and when the buff fades. you have to readjust. unless you're gonna ask someone to risk life and limb in a zone that they can barely touch.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying never take a mind buff, or click them off every time you see them. no...I'm saying take a challenge and try and improve the way you play for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When Dys first dinged 45, I immediately went and got a KEI.  Why?  21 levels of spamming Canni I/II got old.  After getting a Drogmor I didn't rely on it too much, unless I was going on an LDON.  I could get by without it, but if it's all the same to the rest of ya, I'd rather go with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We'd all rather go with it. It's just nice to be able to go without it (but at a slower pace).<br />
<br />
I crack up (or get frustrated) when someone has to run off for out-of-group buffs. I can solo for XP fine with only my own buffs. One 7%AAXP mob every five minutes isn't fantastic, and sometimes I can fit in a fifth, but with 20 minute respawns, one every five is just fine. When I'm duoing with my Bard buddy, we can be XPing for hours and hours with no real downtime and only our own buffs.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean I click off Steeloak/Convo/Crack when I get it, just that I don't make a group wait because I won't leave PoK without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I admit, I love KEI been using it for this character's entire lifetime (character was started before the great kei level nerf) and really do love it. Can I do without? yeah but I choose not to, most of the time I can do just fine np with out it if i'm on my drog with tribute on I don't really notice if its not there, but doing something thats indoors you really start to notice its absense.<br />
<br />
Oh, and conviction is god. Thanks to that awsome buff I break 6k hps on a regular basis which is something I could never do with virtue.</div></div><hr />
