<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have come in to my own...24th level.  My Innoruk (lol...sorry), do these spells define our class.<br />
<br />
BTW, I bitched and moaned about the 6k for the Ikky Regen BP...&quot;It won't make that much a difference&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, and this makes me giggle:  I make tanks cry :D<br />
<br />
Troll Regen + Ikky BP regen + Regeneration.<br />
<br />
Battle goes like this.  Tank pulls too many...say 3/4 mobs..no chanter.<br />
<br />
Mucha, relaizing the distress of the sitiation, drops AOE poision and disease DOT.<br />
<br />
Start slowing..by then, 1-2 are on me.<br />
<br />
&quot;We must save the Shaman!!&quot; Tank 1 cries.  The cleric is furiously healing tank, while I sit and play with the one or two aggroed mobs.<br />
<br />
There were moments when I wondered when we would come into our own...now I know.<br />
<br />
Thanks all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This weekend, I was in a guild group goofing off in the disco area of OS.   We had: shaman, mage, cleric, rogue, ranger, all level 60.  At one point, we ended up with 7 frogs somehow without any form of crowd control.<br />
<br />
The ranger yelled at us to gate if we could, but the mage started nuking, the cleric and I started root parking, melees, well I guess they did what melees do.<br />
<br />
The cleric managed to catch serious aggro but torpor kept him alive.  All mobs were slow, all mobs were epic dotted and we easily lived through the situation.<br />
<br />
It's great at 24, but trust me, it just gets better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just wait until you have 7 snakes in Ssra whippin up on your group. You will without a doubt know the power of a shaman. We are not overpowered imo, but sometimes we really look like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not quite as cool as 7 ssra snakes on me, but ive had 6 or 7 Solb kolbolds on me at one point(MT pulled nox, a couple adds, and full repop of the room), parked acouple of em, and tanked the last 2 until the ones we were fighting died.<br />
<br />
needless to say, My groupmates were somewhat in awe that i was able to do it.  I did need a heal halfway through, but it was still pretty fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sssithmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Reminds me of a conversation I had in a seb pick up group.  Me and a guildie warrior were douing.  Started just picking up some more dps. <br />
<br />
random_person tells the group, we getting a chanter?<br />
warrior tells the group, we don't need a chanter.<br />
random_person tells the group, what if we get adds.<br />
warrior tells the group, we don't need a chanter.<br />
random_person tells the group, but...<br />
warrior tells the group, WE DON'T NEED A CHANTER.<br />
<br />
slow and torpor, who needs a chanter (c:<br />
<br />
this was of course before frogs would nuke me for 1k.</div></div><hr />

So NOW we know why they made casters more powerful. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have seen shaman do more amazing things then any other class.  Which is why I wanted to start one up and be a GOD(dess) too.<br />
<br />
~City of Mist: Black reavers, one group (warrior, ranger, rogue, monk, cleric, ubershaman) and only the shaman and monk were 60.  Pull comes in with 3 reavers, warrior tanks one, ranger tanks another, monk promptly goes LD, rogue tanks third.  Cleric kept warrior and ranger alive with alternating chain CHs and shaman kept rogue, cleric and self alive and topped off warrior and ranger.  Would have been ugly had they have chain spawned. Thankfully the 3 of them were it total and the elusive Jade Reaver dropped and we went home.  Nother notch in the UBER LB's belt for saving the day when poor cleric ran OOM. ;)<br />
<br />
~SolB: Camping FG Throne room in vain hope of RF spawn (quite a while ago).  Paladin, Rogue, Druid, Cleric, Shaman and a Monk, all 60 cept the monk.  Insane paladin pulls the freeti, while its full pop though most rooms along the way we had already pulled.  (Some dumb ranger snagged off the freeti but we got the brunt of the train.)  Shaman kept everyone alive with slow, dot, heals and root.  Nother notch in UBER LB's belt, damn hes good. ;)<br />
<br />
~Howling Stones: South wing camping. Paladin, Rogue, Druid, Cleric, Shaman and sometimes an enchanter.  Pulls got to be 11~13 Harm Touching Mobs withOUT an enchanter and upwards to 16 mobs WITH an enchanter.  Cleric could only chain CH the paladin while torpor kept the rogue, cleric and enchanter alive.  <br />
<br />
SHAMAN ARE GODS, I tell you!<br />
<br />
(Of course I could be slightly biased.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At this point with the skills I have, I am frequently accused of having a giant oversized ego when I mention one or two of my abilities.  <br />
I say, &quot;We dont need Clarity&quot; and they take it all wrong . . . <br />
I say, &quot;I want a necro not a chanter!&quot;  and they boggle at me.  <br />
I say, &quot;I always pull&quot; and they shake their heads.<br />
I say, &quot;You call that a nuke Froglock krup wizard? I hurt myself worse than that!&quot; (canni5 soon after)<br />
I say, &quot;I soloed that camp before&quot; and nobody says anything.  <br />
I say, &quot;Get that Paladin!&quot; and hear much scoffing from the rogues and monks. <br />
I say, &quot;We don't need cleric for Reavers, sheesh!  I will be the healer!&quot;<br />
<br />
So yah, i get called a egomaniac sometimes.  <br />
It's all true tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">random_groupleader: you in a group?<br />
me: no<br />
random_groupleader: we are over by . . . .<br />
me: not LFG<br />
random_groupleader: you waiting on someone?<br />
me: no<br />
random_groupleader: travelling?<br />
me: in battle atm<br />
<br />
I have had this conversation several times in areas were people usually group by neccesity. It is certainly a morale booster. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, my guy's still a baby compared to the lvl 60's with Torpor, but I had a great time handling adds in KC the other night.  Surprised the pickup cleric, I think.<br />
<br />
At one point we had two hands, a skeleton, and two drolvargs and got them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We is poweredful.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say UBER. But I know no other that can match us for what we do. <br />
<br />
Cant port, but we get around easily enough. Can't ds through a spell but alchemy can fix that. Can't nuke as well but we can nuke all the same. Cant mez but our cc is considered by some to be better. Can't fear but who needs fear when you can slow? Can't tank but we can root dot debuff and some melee. Can't quad. Like hell. I have done it a few times and it isn't easy but it IS doable. Just root cook their butts and let puppy finish them off. Can't heal as well, yes but who is keeping the casters alive so they can keep the melees alive? Therefore I am the most important healer. <br />
<br />
Welcome to Jack of all Trades master of a few. <br />
<br />
I play many classes as alts but I can't imagine any that can do what we do as well as we do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Being a 53 shaman, troll, I often partner with a 53 monk in KC. We take LCY and anything else around it, and usually run out of pulls. Neither of us has died. We often take on 5 mobs or more, just root park and slow, then jbb and monk does his part. I use a horse which helps as its such an unfair advantage, but I would never let it go. Shamans are really outmatched in there, and especially since I turned off horse models and I run sow speed again (I had the crappy horse). Its fun seeing a whole group in LCY with a chanter and cleric, and they are having trouble. We then proceed to take the extra mezzed mobs :). It goes like this in most other zones I visit too :)</div></div><hr />
