HOLY CRAP<br />
Enchanter with charmed, snared, speed enhanced frenzied initiate. <br />
Cleric------&gt;healer of group and pet.<br />
Shaman-------&gt; me! the slower.<br />
Ranger/drood to keep pet snared, pull mobs.<br />

<br />
Made about 3-4% AA per kill at 61. Each kill taking maybe 20-30 seconds. I was making an AA every 45 minutes at that rate. AA=80%/Exp 20%.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tactics is also insane exp with an enchanter charming a mob.  We had a group that went like this.<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Ranger<br />
Beastlord<br />
Cleric<br />
Enchanter<br />
Me<br />
<br />
We took the SE cornor of the arena but were a bit farther out so we wouldn't have to pull that much and just let mobs wander into camp.  We had the enchanter send his pet on one mob while the rest of the group was on another.  Once the pet was around 7% we'd kill it.  Shamam play important roles in these fast paced groups.  Our powerful slows and quick heals help big time and save the group countless times.</div></div><hr />
