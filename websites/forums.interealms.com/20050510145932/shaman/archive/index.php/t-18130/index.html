<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can get to the sever select screen fine. It goes though the server loading process, and when it completes I always immediately disconnect. I don't get to the character select screen or anything. Anyone having similar problems, or know how to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<br />
But if youre not from the UK thats not your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there was a grafics dll updated... make sure you are patching.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">NTL went down in UK as well, very very sporadic connection. Was fixed by midnight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless the brits say one of those words differently than us Americans do, that is not a rhyme.  Catch is an &quot;eh&quot; and patch is more of an &quot;ah&quot; sound.  It would be what is properly referred to as &quot;slant rhyme&quot;.<br />
<br />
That's the only time I have ever, in my life, used something I learned in my junior english class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nope sorry mate they definetly rhyme.<br />
<br />
Said in a Yorkshire accent these are identical vowel sounds like cat and pat. ( for Yorkshire see Borowmir in LoTR - hes from Sheffield ).<br />
<br />
Ah well its true - We are two alike peoples only divided by language.<br />
( Probably another mis-quote but ya know what I mean )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you are both correct, even for American pronunciation.<br />
<br />
Acceptable pronunciation for catch is &quot;kech&quot; or &quot;kach&quot; with the e being used as in the word &quot;pet&quot; and the a being used as in the word &quot;pat&quot;.<br />
<br />
Acceptable pronunciation for patch is &quot;pach&quot; where the a is used as in the word &quot;pat&quot;.<br />
<br />
In the UK the a format is used, as in many parts of the US. I think the e format was probably added to save US citizens from having to define an entirely new language for some folks in the South. :)</div></div><hr />
