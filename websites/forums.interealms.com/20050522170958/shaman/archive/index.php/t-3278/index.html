<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'll keep tabs on our donation drive here, so everyone can see how we are doing.<br />
<br />
We needed $1950.00 this drive (as usual :)) and thus far, our total is:<br />
<br />
&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;$886.14&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone thus far.. we are getting there! It seems we have more donations this time, but less amounts.. though one or two people donated $100! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, were still getting there!<br />
<br />
Total is now up to &lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;$1178.53&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
Only about $700 more to go to cover server costs and then hopefully a smidge more for Cold Fusion :)<br />
<br />
Thank you everyone!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, wer'e up to $1492.56 after the weekend thanks to some fresh people :)<br />
<br />
We're actually doing pretty good this drive and I can't thank you all enough. We've got another $450 or so to go for the server costs and then I hope to raise an additional $500 dollars for the ColdFusion MX upgrade.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you to everyone that has donated so far. Once I upgrade the boards and close this drive, I'll be sure to immortalize any of you that could help!</div></div><hr />
