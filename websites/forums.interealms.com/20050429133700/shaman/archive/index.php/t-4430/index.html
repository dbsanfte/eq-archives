<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Landragoran had a post about this but i can't seem to find it...<br />
<br />
what level is Evil Eye in lower guk live side? how hard to get to (can it be done invis without worries or do you have to go through undead)? how hard to solo? any/many other mobs near/at the spawn? what is the respawn timer, and is there a PH? how are his resists/damage output/HPs? does he always drop the bag?<br />
<br />
thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hear he is very hard to solo.<br />
<br />
I hear he's often camped.<br />
<br />
I've never done him, I bought the bag from a guildie.<br />
<br />
Nice bag.</div></div><hr />

I think EE has around 1000 hp...I sorta recall being able to  take him out with a few retributions (518dd) from my 52 cleric. Hardest part is getting down there, and that depends a lot on your faction; if you can walk live side safely it's easy. You will take a hit on live frog faction for killing it.</div></div><hr />
