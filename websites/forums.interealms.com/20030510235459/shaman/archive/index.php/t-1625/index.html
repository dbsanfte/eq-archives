<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Methinx me knows da answer ta dis one.  Tabien 'n Glaron are part of da Test of Wisdom, me quotes:<br />
a wandering spirit says 'It is unfortunate that it came to this, but nothing else was to be done. Both paragons had lost sight of their virtures to protect the items given to them. The mere protection of these material belongings was not as important to Mithaniel Marr or Bertoxulous as it was that they act with righteousness in their minds and purpose in their hearts. You saw this and acted accordingly. For that, we will reward you with the three treasures made into one to ward off the falsehood of possession, the [Shield of Falsehood]. <br />
<br />
a wandering spirit says 'Yes, I have taken Marr's Promise along with Woe and Envy and fashioned them together to create the Shield of Falsehood. Wield this in defense of possession and the weakness that comes with hoarding treasure instead of using it to accomplish your goals.<br />
If yu take one side of dese two and giv da items to da udda, yu will hav failed da test.  Da purpose of da rock is ta return it to da wanderin spirit ta get yer &quot;test failed&quot; lecture. ;)<br />

I'd like to see the &quot;test failed&quot; speech. :)<br />
<br />
Hell, my own epic is so FUBAR'd because of the patch, I may just try doing this myself.  Maybe it will lower my faction back to what it is supposed to be... :P<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
