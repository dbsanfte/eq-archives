<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Impetus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">By now you all know that the recent patch fix to HoS has bugged the Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients (SCot) Carnage Effect.  To remedy this injustice, we shamans must work together as we did to solve the 7th and 8th quests.   The Carnage effect: +40 attack, STR, DEX and AGI was intended to stack with shaman buffs, as evidenced by the fact that AGI still stacks, but STR and DEX will both overwrite Carnage AND be overwritten by it...in other words the code to fix HoS is bugging SCot! <br />
<br />
Here's what we do...copy the text below and /bug, /feedback, /petition EVERYTIME you get on or log.  And follow it up with emails.  It is key that we all have the same Subject heading for optimal impact!<br />
<br />
Subject:  Recent patch fix to HoS has BUGGED Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients!<br />
<br />
The May Patch to fix Harnessing of Spirit (HoS), a STR, DEX, HP buff from stacking with other STR/DEX stat buffs has BUGGED the very rare and very hard to get Skyiron Cudgel of the Ancients.  This reward item, which requires solving eight quests each with mutiple subquests, has the effect Carnage (+40 attack, STR/DEX, and AGI).<br />
<br />
Since your patch, Carnage is coded as HoS is coded.  Carnage cannot overwrite the any STR/DEX buffs and will be overwritten by STR/DEX buffs.   This bugg renders this spell effect useless.<br />
Carnage was intended to stack with all stat buffs as evidenced by the fact that it still stacks with AGI.  Please do what is necessary to repair the code so it will once again stack with STR and DEX too.<br />
<br />
All the best,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssirul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">carnage also doesnt stack with focus of spirit and khura's focusing. so don't forget to mention this in your /feedback and your mail :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, this has broken our Rage line (again), too.  Rage doesn't stack with HoS any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">erm....i dont recal rage ever stacking with HOS !  heheh but as i can hardly cast rage(without MANY fizzles) its been while since i tried that combo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Carnage has never stacked with focus, so I don't think the hos fix broke the cudgel, it fixed HoS so it worked normally (i.e. doesn't stack w/ other str buffs, same as focus).  Still broken, but it wasn't the HoS fix that did it.  I /feedback and /bug every day or so, but no luck so far.<br />
<br />
As for rage, they screwed up rage / votb line stacking with focus/hos, and then hardcoded VotB to stack with Focus.  Rage won't stack with focus (or HoS it seems), nor has it ever.  It's another crappy workaround for shaman buffs &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />
