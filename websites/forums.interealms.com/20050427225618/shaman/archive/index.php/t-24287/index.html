<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The best lower level exp I've found for soloing is Golems in Plane of Valor.  Do a search, there are a couple of threads about it.<br />
<br />
Over a blue of AA xp per kill, and a bit of a risk if they break root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">at your lvl best would be pov golems, they give solo easy 6% axp per kill.<br />
<br />
but with your gear and with out the 64 and 65 dots it will take a while and you will have a lot of downtime i guess.</div></div><hr />

I was about to say, even though I'm lvl 63, I know I cant solo Golems, they would take the pup out to quick and my Dots arent strong enough to take the mob out before I am minced meat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoP tier2+ mobs aren't generall tanked by shaman they are root rotted, which is a difficult task using mostly root breaking dots.<br />
<br />
If you have access to PoI Factory, head to the spiders.  At 63 you can torpor tank them yourself easily, use a horse, epic, dots, jbb, and dogdog :)  It's just like fighting in Luclin.<br />
<br />
You have OK hitpoints but lack focus items and AA's which really make solo worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It helps to Tank for pet.<br />
<br />
As long as you are close to mob, You can slow mob, sit on pet, topor self, dot mob, &quot;and let pet chew on the mob.&quot;  Pet does a lot of damage and you keep aggro so pet doesn't die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In PoV as well as BoT I notice that slows are resisted around 30% to 50% of the time.   So how do you start, Root first (Which doesnt seem to ever hold long) then Malo, slow,  then DoT?  At 63 if Root or slow are ever resisted any shaman would be in a world of hurt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in pov i used to pull with malos, then root and do a safety slow...then just root rottet..at 65 i was able to kill all ww mobs in pov befor respawn. at 6% aa per kill that was a real nice xp  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rugtuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I pull with Insidious Decay and then Root.  That almost always lasts long enough for me to debuff the crap out of them then I start Dotting and rerooting.  I am only 62, but have the clicky pants so that helps alot.  The best camp for me solo is OC in POV if I have to go solo.  I usually 2 box, but have done OC solo with full pet gear and keeping torpor on dog dog.<br />
<br />
Having said that I have found that I can usually find groups in HoH of BoT at all hours of the day and night without to much problem.  OOW has really emptied these zones out.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Also I decided to stop leveling to get AA's as I noticed I am getting them much faster at 62 then my 65 Warrior does and since finding a group isn't a problem and I am landing spells I might as well get the important AA's taken care of.  I just havn't decided where to stop with the AA's and get back to leveling.  Originally it was going to be Canni 5, but now I may just try to fill out all my raid prereq AA's and a few solo AA's like VP3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grennon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, as of right now i am lvl 64, half way to 65, soloin OC PoV. have had a couple run ins with more than one, and they did not turn out good. this seems like a very well balanced spot, but where else could i go? I have noticed some shamans soloing NC.. but they have VP.. (aa root).. is that possible without AA root? i have one dot that is Breath of Ultor that does not break root.. any feedback would be appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mower</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well I  am  61st lvl almost  half way thru it  and I solo  belive it or not in Nadox most mobs are Db to me there. I  have  my pet buffed  as well as myself also have Kei and virt if I can get them the I pull with either  slow then have pet attack, let pet  take mob to 90% then I dot  with Pox, let  that run till around 70% in the  mean time I heal my pet then at 70% I dot again with Bane and then  let that got to arounf 40% then I redot bane and attack my self.<br />
JUst me  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For what it's worth, as long as Nurga is still one of those high-exp hot zones, the goblins at the far end are all blue cons at level 63, and go down fast enough that it might be better worth it for you than the high-risk root-rotting in PoV.<br />
<br />
Good cash, too.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Agreed on Nurga.  I went there to screw around and found that I was getting as much XP as I was in CoD camping my epic drop.  I duo a monk and we were both 66 at the time.  Was seeing 2% of regular xp an hour in Nurga.  Pretty much exactly what I was seeing duoing in CoD without the risk and with nice plat drops.  I could pull 5-6 mobs and kill each individually without much issue at all.  Now that the majority are light blue I'm not going back, but the solo xp is good up to 65 I'd say.<br />
