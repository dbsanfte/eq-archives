<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tamarack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like to see an archery range added to the game in the forest city zones, (gfay, SFG)  It doesn't have to increase your archery skill or anything but it'd be a way to pass some time if you wanted to.  Have high scores and such.  An ingame game like gems so to speak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Relios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it would be good if you got an increase in archery skill , and free no rent 0 dmg arrows</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tobonar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It would be Really Sweet if they would do this.  Make it to where they give you a No Rent No Drop Bow 0dmg 50dly 200rng &amp; 0dmg 0dly 0rng no rent no drop arrows for free.  But you can only Have soo many Per game day.  Like 5 times of arrows 20 per time.  Have competitions But when you do this you have to aim the bow.  No sights or nothing like First person view with a longbow in hand.  Like a real life longbow no sights or anything you just gotta get good .  That would be a sweet passtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I first ventured to Surefall Glade and saw the archery range I was overjoyed. However after hailing everyone and clicking on everyone I was disheartened to learn that it wasn't usable.</div></div><hr />
