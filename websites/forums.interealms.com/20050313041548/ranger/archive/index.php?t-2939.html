<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taldaas</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i totally dig that you have sweet stuff.  Not that your super rad gear will help you much... well you'll be able to kill stuff faster i guess... anyways if you're fear kiting you probally want to go to EF (everfrost), grab yourself a bind in halas and i think you can also pick up flecthing supplys (to make sure that you can get that animal before someone else does).  Anyways, you'll want to fear kit teh mammoths only darry around bags that hold giant items.  Seeing as how you have sweet gear i assume that you also have sweet bags.  If you don't have sweet bags sell some of your gear to get some bags.  Having bags that hold giant will help you out in the long run (especialy if they have a high wt. redction %).  You need these bags because you will be looting the tucks off the mammoths and they sell for about 10pp each.<br />
<br />
-good luck<br />
<br />
P.S.  if you can't find any sweet bags hit up your local friendly magician for some of the NO RENT 4 slot 100% reduction giant bags.</div></div><hr />

You can get in a group hunting gnolls outside paw, go into paw, fear kite elephants or hunt at the aviak village.  Lake Rathe is cool too.<br />
Nice camp right at SK zone entrance.<br />
<br />
High Hold Keep basement is very good if you want fast xp with conveniences like bindability, merchants, guards and bank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everfrost and South Karana are awesome suggestions.<br />
<br />
But if you want to fight the crowds, Lake of Ill Omen. :P<br />
<br />
If you have Luclin, Pal Caverns might be fun, though it may be greening out, not sure. In any event I love the look of that zone. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
the xp modifier in th dungeons make them the best place for xp hands down.  At 22 with good gear I would guess that runneyeye will give some great xp, as will najena, warrens will be greening out, but plenty of blues and yellows to keep you busy for a while.  <br />
<br />
If you are really set on fear-kiting, EF is the way to go, hunt mammoths and if its too crowded get a group together to kill redwind and Co. that is good xp for your level and a harmony on redwind allows you to single pull.<br />
<br />
Most of these mobs have lower hp than mammoths or most animals and hit for a fraction of the damage.  Grouping is not so easy and fear-kiting is impossible, but the xp is unparalelled.</div></div><hr />
