<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Found any charms? Also, do you know if charms will only drop in the new LoY zones or will old zones have updated loot drops?<br />
<br />
Hell I don't even know how to get to these zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill the clueless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think they forgot, once again like they have done with other patches and spells / items, to put these items in the game.  I have searched every weapons/armor database that I know of...and all searching come up as... No records found.  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Instead of searching databases try playing, about 10 dropped in the 4 zones we found last night.<br />
I dont have stats on hand but one got bonuses as you increase  AGI and WIS and another gained power the fewer people were in zone. Sorry info is vague , was up till 4am on a CR , ADVENTURE !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spirit,<br />
<br />
<br />
 al dropping in new zones? Didn't want to mess with a rush of level 65's pimping all the new zones last night.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Someone linked a &quot;charm of defence&quot;, gave me AC 28, 30 agi, 100 HP, some sta, saves etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye all dropped in new zones.<br />
<br />
You arent wrong about high levels pimping the zones either, however to be truthfull there seemed to be more than enough content to share, those zones are big.<br />
Trolly pirate boss encounter still ate several of us tho but at least we were first to try on the server :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Umm, super stupid question here.<br />
<br />
How do you get to the new zones? Is it through stonebrunt? I just did /who all 65 and stuff last night and people were all in weird zones so figured I didnt want to compete with that.<br />
<br />
<br />
People on KB are about as ****less as they come, some real weird folk.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">are the charms no drop or can they be traded?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You are so cool Spiritbinder...Yes...I never play EQ...all I do is sit and search databases for equipement I will never get cause I never play...pfft...what an idiot</div></div><hr />

Someone linked a &quot;charm of defence&quot;, gave me AC 28, 30 agi, 100 HP, some sta, saves etc. <br />
<br />
that's funny, not a single charm I saw linked showed any stats at all, just said how it became more powerful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lethul Injection</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My friend showed me a Charm the Dropped in BoT last night...i forget the name of it, but it had no stats on it and said that with the less containers you carry the better AC you get.  Im really curious on how these things will work...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ridgewall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">to see the stats you or the person linking it must have the charm equip ir aleast thats what people are saying</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So, how to get to new zones? Through stonebrunt? Something special in Stonebrunt?<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I saw a charm that gave you a 20% damage bonus to DD spells if you cast hopping on one leg, while humming the EQ theme song.<br />
<br />
Oh and there is another charm that gives you spell haste for Roots, Malo, and Slows if you cast with your ceramic skull stuffed up your....nevermind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here's (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehousethebackroomsecretsspoilers.showMessage?topicID=12893.topic) a list of Charms at The Safehouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Charm of Defense is a drop in Plane of Fire. Its RANGE slot only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Millman, to get to the new zone head over to Stonebrunt.  There is now a ship sitting at the dock.  Double click on the ship doors to zone into the new area.  I’ve not gone beyond the lighthouse there, so I can’t tell you how to get to any of the other zones. <br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ranukuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">got on tonight, a drop from a Ogre in Gunthak<br />
Powdered Mammoth Tusk...No Drop<br />
<br />
Bonus is increased with Aglity and Wisdom are raised<br />
<br />
<br />
No Idea what it does...saw not one stat change and my wis is 200 and agl is 140.<br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">thanks calabar,<br />
<br />
I wonder, if like other item slots, there are drops that simply do not do anything special?<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I saw a Platinum Sword Idol or something similar.  All is said is that it becomes stronger the more powerful you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Saw a link to a charm that increased the more spell slots you had open. No doubt favored by pickup group clerics and wizards everywhere.</div></div><hr />
