<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all-<br />
<br />
43 Shaman here looking a bit ahead.  Since I've maxxed Off/Defense at 200 I'm flying through 43 by quad-kiting spectres in Oasis.  And yes, I feel like I need a shower after I do it  :p <br />
<br />
At 44 I get Stoicism and usual 44 spells, at 45 I'll have a JBB (almost certain) and horsie (have one now).  I have pretty good gear for my level.  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=494623<br />
<br />
Will I be peaking in RELATIVE power until I hit the 60+ PoP game?  As a casual player I'm a bit aprehensive about my viability in the end-game.<br />
<br />
Won't the relative power of the JBB decrease level by level until in the 60+ game it's in the bank?  While AAs in the 50's will help, I can't help but feel that I'll be past my OOBAH-Jr. peak.<br />
<br />
Please enlighten my lowbie ass.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Take a look at your 49 DoTs.  I felt very powerful at that time.  If you're soloing well now, you'll solo even better at 49.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heya,<br />
I dunno, but at 49 we get E-bolt, That seems like a rocking spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">49 all the way.   JBB is still a major force, much better DOTs, Stoicism.<br />
<br />
45 will be very, very powerful with just the JBB, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">errr quading??? How do you do that with a shaman? I can think of some ways but dont seem to be easy on the mana pool. Please tell me how.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But there are 4 Spectres on Island.  It aint hard to get 'em to aggro <br />
<br />
Then with a fresh SoW, pull past the Inn to the Derv Camp to the South.<br />
/ooc zone first of course, but not many people around there.  1 Scourge 2-3 Venoms per Spectre will usally do.  Keep spirt strike up to finish em off, if needed.  Takes bout 6-8 min to do, I guess.  Go from full to oom, often have to melee the last one, so I save 1 Slow.  No pet.  Get bout 20 plat per pull of 4 dark blues.  Sweet at 43.  Have spell haste II, manna pres II, efflic eff  II and extend afflic III.  That helps too.<br />
<br />
Boring as hell, once you get the hang of it, and the camp isnt taken by some 50 something farming <br />
<br />
You're so much faster then Specs us have time to can at the end of each run.  I have chloro and regen BP so even if they get a quick hit or stun in on the turn-around, you're still near full hp all the time.  Helps to melee the last one.<br />
<br />
Edit:  As to manna pool- yes I'm OOM but usually at 60-75% HP with a horse and 15 hp per tick regen, not for long  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">49 will change how you solo...<br />
51 will give you best slow in game...<br />
54 will give you faster mana regen...<br />
56 will give you easier soloing...<br />
58 will give you the even faster mana regen...<br />
60 will make you feel godly, if you can afford RARE spells or are uber lucky with drops...<br />
<br />
after that it is just rinse and repeat :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As a former, Jr. Ubah shammy I can relate to your situation.  I had Fungi, RBG, and a brawl stick in the 40s and I was a monster.  That was before I'd gotten a horse, jbb, or epic.  To answer your question, yes you are quite the Jr. Uber shaman, and you will stay that way quite happily for another 10 to 15lvls or so.  JBB will be god for your next 5lvls, and still an amazing item thru your career(I still use mine a TON at 61 soloing).  At 49 you get some nice spells and it is worth changing your play style a bit to make the best use of them.  You'll kill faster, but probably notice a bit more downtime.  Then a few lvls later you get Regrowth and Turgurs, and everything is back up to Jr. Uber status again.  Dont take as much damage due to slow and hp regen goes up so you can Canatank well.  I think the &quot;Jr. Uber&quot; phase faded for me around 56 or 57, when I was still a much better soloer than most classes, but just didnt have quite the upper hand on my mobs that I had in lvls prior.  However, at 59 and 60 I got Horse, Torpor and Epic and am feeling like quite the bomb again.  With horse and Stoicism I think you'll maintain your current enjoyment quite well.  But work on your epic as early as you can too, also an esential soloing tool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">49 you get a new pet and a new dot.  This is a big step up from 45.<br />
<br />
51 you get a new slow, some AA abilities and a new heal.  This is another big step.<br />
<br />
I'm now 55, and I haven't seen as big 49/51 in the last few levels.  I expect that 58/59/60 will be a sweet range with mini ch, can5 and then hopefully topor/malo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As for relative power, I think 45 with a JBB is just about as high as it gets.  Versus the types of XP mobs you have at 45, you will just own!  However, 49/51 are also big power increases, but relative to what you're fighting, I think 45 w/ JBB is close to the most powerfull you'll get before 60.  My bigest downfall around that lvl was healing, but stoicism is a huge upgrade.</div></div><hr />
