<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looks like shadowbane comes out manyana and I havent seen any reviews on it by people in the beta on this board.... search came up null the other day as well.  So anyone on this board have anything positive/negative to say about it?  Is it another break from eq MMPOG or has it got flavor. For the length of its dev cycle I would hope it has some :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shadowbane just not look that great to me, and I have grave concearns about how good a job the dev team will do with bug fixes and updates when it took so long to get it out in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I played recent beta of Shadowbane<br />
<br />
A.  It has Horded Lag which makes the first few beginning days of Anarchy online load time look a like joke.<br />
<br />
B.  I don't enjoy being killed by a Leet overpowered Wizard class over and over and over again.  That eventually gets the cash for a tree of life and then carries the cash where ever he goes.<br />
<br />
C.  The over head look is Diablo all over again with todays technology you think they could have made also a first person perspective.<br />

D.  There are NO Quests.... None at all.  Not one.<br />

E.  No high level Player vs Environment scenarios.  IE.  You want a big raid go fight another group of players in the so called named kingdom_02.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I only got to test it in the last phase of beta, so I never got over lvl 20 due to a couple wipes and the fact that I was having too much fun starting new characters every other session. So take this with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
PROS: <br />
The Character creation process allowed for very diverse characters.<br />
<br />
Leveling was fairly enjoyable.<br />
<br />
CONS:<br />
Massive Lag and Rubberbanding (Network related mostly).<br />
<br />
Numberous Bugs, sometimes I'd log in and couldn't see half the buildings, trees and other obsticles. However the object collision code was still working you would always be running into invisible barriers. Sync problems and other stuff also existed.<br />
<br />
Had difficulty finding a mature player base, but after all...it is beta.<br />
<br />
Pathing is horrible.<br />
<br />
Way to many channels. SPAM.<br />
<br />
IMHO it still needs a couple more months of testing, but thats what early release is for right?! hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
A. They were doing stress test on one server. The lag from 3 weeks before compared to 2500 people on one server was INCREDIBLE. It will be fixed by release.<br />
<br />
B. Wizards.. pets in general getting nerfed hard ^_^ damn wizards<br />
<br />
C. Boo hoo, guess how much loot Diablo games netted.<br />
<br />
D. OHNOS!!! That's why you PK people and take their stuff. Well, their gold and whatever they're carrying.<br />
<br />
E. Ohnosssssssssssssssssssssssssssss x2, not no PVE in a PVP game! You make kitty sad! =;___________________________________;=<br />
<br />
<br />
I played beta for 4 - 5 weeks, I don't know if I will switch to shadowbane. At least on SB, I can pk morons that annoy me, unlike the ones that join my serverwide.crucible channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got rid of my EQ account for shadowbane. It has a unique way of creating a game. It puts the fate/story/how good the game is exclusivly on the player. You want uber conflicts? Well you gotta fight other uber players. You want citys? You gotta build them. This is a lot of responsiblity for the players. Some servers will suck so hard it will make you wish you were a dark elf necromancer in halas. Others will be boring with no combat and treaties. And a select few will have the combat we desire (us being pvpers). People dont seem to understand this game. Its not about mob killing loot farming time wasting I wish i was 65 so i could join the 1 guild on my server that can go to said zone (which isn't a bad system, but why switch to a new game that does what your game already does) It is a system of land control. Guild v Guild combat to control citys and land, nothing more. If that doesn't apeal to you, I wouldn't suggest wasting your money.<br />
<br />
That said. The game has BUGS! I personally dont think they should release the game for another 6 months. In fact, I'm not going to buy the game for at least 3 more months after release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not me, I just got my main to 47 after 2+ years. (Hey, I'm a very casual player). I tried DAoC (Bleh), and Asheron's Call 2 (Bleh), I think I'll stick with EQ at least until WoW comes out. Some say it won't be that good, but Blizzard always puts out quality games..period ! So it will be good, whether it will be better than EQ that's another story. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Beta Screen Shots (http://www.shamanscrusible.com/sbshots)  Two 34 Templars and a 40 bard.  Got two copies on Preorder, and I have the shakes bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sucks. Shadowbane is Ultima Online first expansion pack about 5 years late. Was in beta, played on 3 servers, on each got chars to R3 - R4.<br />
<br />
Game is buggy as hell, not even good enough for the beta, and they are already releasing it. Lag is crazy, even with the really powerful machines you feel like playing current EQ with Voodoo1 video card. Basically:<br />
<br />
PROS: <br />
* Good selection of classes and disciplines, really plenty to choose from;<br />
* Group formations - making travel as a group really easy and fun;<br />
* Levelling up - pretty fun and not hard at all;<br />
* Ability to build player cities, from small to huge - very neat;<br />
<br />
CONS:<br />
* LAG, horrendous lag!<br />
* BUGS, horrendous amount of bugs!<br />
* Disciplines - most of them are not working at all;<br />
* Balance - there is no balance. Wizard kills everyone, melee get killed by everyone;<br />
* Content - there is no content in the game whatsoever;<br />
* No quests, no dungeons, just random patches of mobs to level up;<br />
* Solo ability is &quot;done&quot; to every other class really - other then pet class, i.e. wizard - at lvl 20 already;<br />
* Graphics suck too. Would have been cool for a game like 4-5 years ago, now it sucks;<br />
* Point and click way of moving - some on, good for Diablo, but NOT MMORPG;<br />
* Only 3rd person view sucks;<br />
<br />
Frankly the beta was a nice change for EQ and I played it. Too bad I was gimped from the start, since I liked to play melee classes. But heck, it was FREE, so I played it. But definately I am not going to pay even a dime for such outdated, without content, laggy, buggy, barely quarter working product. I didn't mind the PvP, in a way it's pretty useful - morons just get thwacked down there and no fussing - but heck, it was completely unbalanced. If you chose a melee class, i.e. tank type, then you already made a choice to be a free loot bag for others. Classes who can hide could do to you big damage even before they become fully visible. Wizards have pets, which even when being lower level then you, outperform you in any way. You have no ranged means as a tank class, and your styles are useless, because everyone sees when you execute it, and then everyone has enough time to take 1-2 steps away from you and your style will fail, and takes too long time to refresh to be of any use again in PvP. When you die, ALL of your gear will take damage from it, and damage is at times so big that casters can go naked in a blink of an eye, and melee people have their gear half damaged, amounting in repair costs for well over 10-20K (and higher) per death. And this is with the usual gear, imagine when you get high end magic gear - you will pay the blood out of your nose to fix it and still wont cover it. Imagine lagging out and dieing, then getting ganked by someone 2-3 ranks (i.e. 20-30 levels) above you, and then dieing again to stray mobs or a train - and your melee person is also without a gear, because it was destroyed. Casters are competely naked already after the second death.<br />
<br />
Imagine the situation, where a higher level wizard, about 10 levels higher then you, comes to where your group is hunting (newbie lands still) and starts to KS you. You can't do really much, because the wizard pet outperforms your whole group. Also, the XP in SB goes to the person, who delivers the killing blow, not who does most damage. Also everyone can loot the corpse as soon as it dies. Basically, in this example, the wizard keeps following your group, taking all your kills, looting your kills, laughing about it and you cannot do anything - you petition, and in best case the answer you get from CS is: Dear customer, please remember the name of the offending person and when on mainland (off of newbie island, where is free PvP), kill him&quot;. Yep, that's it, that's the whole customer support. And natually you cannot kill the wizard, unless you're another wizard and equal level or higher, or this one is really stupid in PvP (i.e. stands in front of you and let's you just kill him). Heck, there's even NO point to PvP, because all it gives to you is killed target and the chance that he had some loot you can take and sell (if you make it back). In DAoC at least there were special RR points given for PvP/RvR, with what you could enhance your char (AA points in EQ), nothing like this in SB.<br />
<br />
There's plenty of more issues regarding the game, but I am not going to waste the forum space here. Will just say that unless you're some hardcore PvP, who wants to do nothing else then just kill the players, but even that gets bleak after 10th time. Always the same, even with the cities, no real reward for PvP either.<br />
<br />
Empty game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A friend of mine let me play on his account for a couple days last week.. I didn't really care for it much.  I personally don't like the overhead view like you get in NwN and Diablo..  The concept sounded great.. but I think I'll stick with NwN and EQ til EQ2 and B&amp;W2 come out hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmmm well its only 39.99 so i ordered a copy and will be in game once I recieve it tomorrow.  See all you crucible folks there.  If you want to setup a common server just post it here.  Oh and about the lag I played UO from day 1 it cant be THAT bad :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I played the beta for this game.  It didn't hold my attention for more than 30 mins.<br />
<br />
- No quests<br />
- Graphics are comparible to games 2 years ago<br />
- No first person view.  Just third person where trees get in the way, and you can't see yourself or the mobs you're trying to target.  Also a pain in cities/towns, where you can't see through buildings.<br />
- Horrible pathing.  I was able to get my character stuck in dead ends all the time.  Funny how he doesn't know how to get around that stupid pole.<br />
- Horrible lag.  Maybe this will be fixed, but just running around I was doing lots of warping and freezing.<br />
- Crappy UI, with huge fonts.  I didn't play around with this much, so maybe it's customizable.<br />
- Did I mention the bugs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Darjeelingx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Great game lots of fun.<br />
<br />
Unlike EQ which has become the hollowest shell of what it used to be.</div></div><hr />
