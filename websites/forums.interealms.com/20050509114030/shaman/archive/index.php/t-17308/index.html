<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read lots of posts about AA (the ones linked in the Medicine Cabinet and others), and they've helped, but I still want a few opinions based on my particular situation, and would like some advice.<br />
<br />
My play style is now mostly raiding in Elemental Planes, though I do spend some time in exp groups, mostly LDoN these days. I'm always slowing and often patch healing, though rarely the group's only healer.<br />
<br />
Because my guild raids a lot, so I don't get many AA, typically 3-4 a week, so I want to buy the ones that will help most for what I do.<br />
<br />
I currently have (in the order I got them):<br />
<br />
Run 3, Regen 3, MC 3, CanniV, RC1, MGB, ND3, SCR3, SCRM, QB1, VP1, CA3, LR2.<br />
<br />
I am going for LR5 next, but am unsure where to go after that. I tend to pick a line and follow it through, (with exceptions for the ones that are most useful at 1st level). In particular, I'm considering healing AAs, MC3, and finishing off the RC and VP lines.<br />
<br />
I was planning on doing Planar Power/Innate Enlightenment soon, but as a result of the aforementioned posts, I've decided to put them off for now. From those posts, PP5 would gain me 47 HP and 126 mana. It would all help of course, but those 10AA seem to be better spent elsewhere.<br />
<br />
RC2 and RC3 (4 and 6 points) - I want to do these at some point. I currently have RC1 and always keep it primed for a quick cure, but sometimes it's not as effective as I'd like.<br />
<br />
HA3/AHA3 (24 points) and HG3/AHG3 (24 points) - I do have a longer Quiescence, thanks to SCRM, but an improved Tnargs would also help. On boss mobs particularly, I'm often backup healing in group, healing AE or riposte damage, etc, while the group cleric is in the chain. When other shaman heal for around 2000hp, I know I have some way to go in healing... :) Which is best first out of HA/HG for Tnargs? (I have used Kraggs once in the last 3 months.)<br />
<br />
SCM3 (12 points) - I know many people would have already got this by this stage, but I never really considered saving mana to be that important to a shaman, so I went for survivability and SCRM first. Now, I have FT14 and Preservation of Xegony, so I am still dubious about the benefits of this one to me.<br />
<br />
VP3 (6 points) - seems to be mostly a good solo tool. VP1 already works for punting mobs out of range in LDoN most of the time.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, I am considering interspersing some fun AA just for the hell of it - SCF1, SC1, but does SCF1 go off enough to make it fun if I'm not planning on following the line any further for a while?<br />
<br />
I'm also working on tradeskills for the earring, so I'll probably get Tanaan Tradeskill AAs in there somewhere. I'll get those when I come to it though. I'm currently working on getting all to 200 first, and I don't spend that much time on them (lack of cash limits me apart from anything).<br />
<br />
I feel I could easily reach 200 AA points and still be spending them on useful stuff, and that's not including the resist AAs. It's funny when talking to other classes who say they have run out of useful things to spend AA on at around 80 points. I guess it's good in a way - we do have some AA that really helps us, and I've noticed the difference as I've grown in power. (Of course, I've also inproved my gear a lot too, so it's hard to tell how much is from AAs).<br />
<br />
Anyway, based on my play style, are there any shaman out there who have these AA and have some recommendations/comments for me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Being in a very similar situation (130s AA, same raid type, doing LR right now) I've been thinking about this too.  I would start the healing AAs after this.  With some of the elemental boss/time encounters you will spend a lot of time spamming tnargs on the main tank, and HA/HG will help a lot.  Then I'd go for SCM, it's around 10% mana savings, so the equivalent of 400 - 500 mana. Better value then planar power.  <br />
RC3 is situational, but I know at least one PoFire fight where RC3 is the only way to cure your group fast (GRC is a pain, all you do is cast RGC to get everyone cured before the next AoE hits). <br />
VP was a bit of a disappointment for me, I don't use it nearly as much as I thought.<br />
QB2 is very nice if you have a haste of mithaniel item, otherwise go for qb3 to max Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I recommend getting the basic stuff first and waiting to end to get specialty stuff like VP. If you are playing alot of LDoN though VP is very helpful. Just be sure to explain VP to yer group before using it. Otherwise they will be wondering what the hell is up when adds start shooting across rooms and are rooted where they stop. Hmm on second thought don't wait, get VP now ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I think RC1 is by far the best bang for the buck. The biggest problem is that rc2 and 3 get much more expensive but for most stuff don't get much more effective for curing. RC1 cures 9 poison/disease/curse counters. RC3 only thats that up 16? if memory serves. In practice in game most things with either be cured by 9 counters or require over what rc offers. There are very few things inbetween. The one part that does get better is the remove detrimental effects. Thats is 1/3/6. I bought rc2 for the more chances to remove detirmental effects.<br />
<br />
HA3/AHA3 (24 points) and HG3/AHG3 (24 points) - I do have a longer Quiescence, thanks to SCRM, but an improved Tnargs would also help.

<br />
I've got those and with them maxed out and a imp healing item you definitely don't touch kraggs anymore. crits for over 3k are nice and definitely make a difference. Personally I ended up working them both up some and then finishing off gift first since the planar level was 2/3/4 in stead of 2/4/6 so it was a bit cheaper =)<br />
<br />
SCM3 (12 points) - I know many people would have already got this by this stage, but I never really considered saving mana to be that important to a shaman, so I went for survivability and SCRM first.

<br />
More mana pres is always a good thing. Since your saving mana and don't have to actually regen it you end up effectively increasing you mana regen rate in addition to effectively increasing your mana pool.<br />
<br />
VP3 (6 points) - seems to be mostly a good solo tool. VP1 already works for punting mobs out of range in LDoN most of the time.<br />
<br />
great for soloing in PoFire. Seems to almost always last the full duration as long as you aren't nuking. Bane + saryrn + ulthor + vp3 = easy and descent exp in fire.<br />
<br />
Apart from that, I am considering interspersing some fun AA just for the hell of it - SCF1, SC1, but does SCF1 go off enough to make it fun if I'm not planning on following the line any further for a while?<br />

<br />
Personally i'm at ~285 and i'd say about 225 or so I ran out of things I really considered good and useful and started doing somethings like suspend minion or channelling focus (does this do a bloody thing?). Haven't gotten to resists yet but i'd expect that someplace not too far after 300. After those I'll definitely be into the fairly useless stats or alchmeny master =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Planar power can wait a little bit, and I sometimes wonder if I'll ever have enough aa to train innate enlightenmet.<br />
<br />
SCF 1 is pretty much useless, I think you only crit for 25% more at that level, you need to train it up to level 3 to do the double damage crits. Don't train SCF unless you're willing to put 12 pts in it.<br />
<br />
SCM is nice, I got it right after Canni5, this should be high on your list. It's a better mana pres than planar boots, and it stacks with everything.<br />
<br />
HA/AHA is nice. 14 pts (HA3, AHA1) will make Tnarg's 13% better.<br />
<br />
HG3 and AHG1 for 14 pts will make Tnarg's crit for 12% of the time for 14aa, again, a nice way to spend pts.<br />
<br />
RC3 is ok, I only got it because my guild was going to Plane of Time and I thought it'd be useful there. I did fine with spell RGC, Rad Cure 1 and blood of nadox in elemental planes. RC1 will cure the Rathe ae, the single most annoying ae in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shamu, thanks for the advice - I was leaning towards the healing AA myself, anyway, but it's a lot of points to max out both.<br />
<br />
However, on RC3 - I can't think what fight you're talking about in PoFire. Arch Mage Yozanni is the only one I can think of that needs RGC, and his AE has 18 curse counters. Since Radiant Cure 3 only removes 16 curse counters, it won't remove it in one shot. I do usually end up curing everyone for most of the fight, but since I only recently got RGC, I'm quite happy to do that! Once the mob is debuffed and slowed, I consider it to be an effective use of my time to make sure the big healers and damage dealers can carry on. Here my experiences tie up with Taraddar's - for curing, most of the time either RC1 is enough or RC3 isn't sufficient. The main reason I'm interested in RC2/3 is for greater chance to remove detrimentals.<br />
<br />
I'm not looking at QB2 yet - I have QB1 and a Quickening of Mithaniel item (30% beneficial spell haste) so with BoR I already have a 3 second Quiescence. I will probably do QB2 some time down the line so that I am maxed without the cleric buff, but I see no real need for that right now.<br />
<br />
Taraddar, I realise the benefit of SCM as mana preservation - but I'm not sure how this compares to improved healing AAs. I do have very good mana regen, and yet I still find myself casting Canni 4 a lot even now. But better heals could save lives.<br />
<br />
Basically, I think my question boils down to - should I do SCM3 or healing AAs first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd usually suggest SCM, but looking at your situation I'd lean toward the healing ones tbh. If you've already got more mana than you can use, I'd suggest that it would be more efficient to find better ways to use it than to find ways to have even more of it. Just my copper..</div></div><hr />
