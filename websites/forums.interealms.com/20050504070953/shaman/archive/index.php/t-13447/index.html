<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Impact</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, first time poster here but have been poking around the forums for a couple of months now.  Love the forum and there is a TON of information here.  I am currently a 52 shaman on the rathe and I have to say this class has been a blast!  Not a dull moment, I love my shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I have found out that while in the planes as a shammy you are a aggro magnet!  In most groups (group mostly with the same bunch of friends, monk, war, cleric, myself, and 1 or 2 lfg'ers)  the monk pulls, war gets aggro, monk fd's and I sit there a sec before I slow to make sure war has aggro.  Once I am sure he has aggro I stand and slow. 9 times out of 10 I will not have aggro from slowing this way, that is untill I have a seat to med or start to canni.  I find that I have to stand more then half of the fight or else I will get sit aggro.  Is this normal or is the tank not doing enough dps/taunting enough?  Because of this I am working my butt OFF dealing with the rude people in Rathe moutians to farm plat for a mount.<br />
<br />
<br />
My problem is (of course money issues :\) I'm not sure what to do.  Should I buy a mount to avoid sit aggro and increase mana regen?  Should I save my money and upgrade gear (sadly, my gear is nothting to write home about, approx. 1.7k hps/850AC self buffed)?  I think also spells need to be considered as I am reaching the level where I am either going to have to camp spawns for drops or baz them.  Money is limited, at the moment I can only do one thing.  I have current 7k saved up and if I have to spend more then 3k pp worth of time in RM the computer is going out the window.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your time and help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Getting a horse is probably the best way to avoid the sit aggro. You dont even have to get a good horse; just buy the cheapest one solely for use when you are hunting. I dont use mine for travel at all.<br />
<br />
Some other tricks that you can use are to shrink yourself and stand right next to or behind the MT. Then if you pull aggro with slow, the tank wont have to chase it down and he can pull aggro back much faster, usually with one taunt.<br />
<br />
Or, you can wait until the MT has the mob positioned, root it, then slow it. Long as your root lasts a decent length of time, you can sit down and probably wont have aggro anymore when it does break. Course, some of them will complain about rooting the mob because of proximity aggro...wah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You should be canniing/stoicism whenever you can't sit.  Mana regen is still huge.  Your efficiency won't suffer much from not sitting but you will work your fingers bloody.<br />
<br />
The horse is a great idea.  In outdoor zones I never sit anymore.  I mount up and canni/stoie for mana.  It's far faster.</div></div><hr />

The Tank slacks imo!  Trade him in for a new one!   :p  :p  :p</div></div><hr />

*edited out the annoying colors*<br />
<br />
Hes right.  Warrior taunt sucks.  Period.  Rangers taunt better than warriors.  hell, youve noticed it yourself..shaman taunt better than warriors.<br />
<br />
In PoP zones I truly prefer to have a Paladin or SK tankin because I wont get agro.  With a SK tanking I wont get agro for anything no matter how hard I try.  Pally lets me slow and cripple without problems, but I still have to watch my dot agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I reccommend you try going to Dulak harbor to farm plat. You can make it faster there and everything is lb or db. Not to mention there are a few good quests. <br />
<br />
As far as mt i never let a warrior tank any more. Half the time i dont even ask a warrior to join my group when looking for people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree most Warrior taunt sucks, I love having a SK or Pally in the group that way I can slow as the mob is incoming. If the Warrior is the MT I just stand by him so he can regain agro. I will admit though I have grouped with a couple of Warrior's that keep agro. Also, I would buy the horse, even if it's only the cheapest, then you don't have to worry about sitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Impact</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thank you all for your help!  I think I will give dunlark a try for plat although I do have a sour taste in my mouth for that zone. Three 5 hour session camping the empty flask for stoic before it dropped.<br />
<br />
Anyway thanks again, going to buy my mount soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dulak is good for coin, and I love those little shivs for pet weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Warrior taunt very much depends on the warrior in question.<br />
<br />
If they're dual wielding lammys and hitting the taunt hotkey every time it ungreys, the mob will be ping-ponging around like anything.<br />
<br />
If the warrior has worked on their weapons a little, and uses taunt timing astutely, you'll notice the difference.<br />
<br />
Some warriors go for the best damage weapons they can afford, they like to do good damage. But smart warriors realise that taking damage is their job, and go for tauntier weapons even if it means dropping their overall damage. And there a fair few good weapons for that now, obtainable by untwinked level 50s.<br />
<br />
But please don't slate warriors uniformly - some warriors are better than some paladins or shadowknights. The hybrids have an advantage, but there's still room for skill in the equation - a lot of it is down to the person, not just the class.</div></div><hr />
