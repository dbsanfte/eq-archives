Easiest place that comes to my mind right away is, if you're flagged for the plane of tactics, killing the stampeding piglet there, a random even where he and 20 other huge pigs run out from the pigpens there, next to the pit.  They do a circuit around the arena then come back to the pit.  Stay far enough away and you can root the piglet.  This spot is perma-camped on many servers; I know of someone who perma-camps it on multiple servers with different toons at the same time.  But if you find it free, it is shaman soloable.  Some of the items still sell for around 10k on my server, and it drops spectrals. Plus, if you are lucky, you can sometimes see an &quot;enraged war boar&quot; pop out in the arena which drops spells and ornate molds/patterns and also nice things like a ring with improved damage 4 on it, very popular with SK's especially, that goes on some servers for 20k and more still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to the Safehouse, and look for Droga quests in their Quests forum. In that thread is a map with all the named mobs on. With a mage/shaman combo you should easily be able to take any of the named camps, with the possible exception of the King.<br />
<br />
Try to find a nice item or two, and farm it. Whilst i still played, i used to farm for an hour a day here. I considered myself unlucky if I didn't make more than 10k in that time from named item drops. Plus, the cash adds up if you farm here enough.</div></div><hr />

Try Inner AC. You can go for the named and farm acrylia . Not sure if CoH works there. If it works just gate out with your shaman to sell runes / other stuff, run back and get CoHed back to inner AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There's still good money in Droga, but try farming some more out of the way stuff.  Copper Hammer is nice but it's frequently camped and the price is dropping like a rock.  There are almost 30 named in Droga IIRC and most of the items are decent midlevel or twink gear that should sell for 1-10k.  Spawn tables typically cough up a named every 3-5 spawns, and spawn time is only 20 minutes.  With two of you you should be able to keep 3-5 camps clear easily, so you're looking at an item drop every 20 minutes or so after the first cycle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Assuming your mage has skill points unused...funnel some money into maxxing the mage's research skill.<br />
<br />
Prices on researched spells are starting to drop but I'm still making good money on my enchanter.    A mage can research mage and priest spells so don't go buying components for KEI, though you could buy the ones for torpor :-)  You have to be a little careful doing this though as failures can HURT if you spent too much on the components.  Search your bazaar for components for spells you think might be good sellers.  Look at prices for those spells.  Be prepared to slowly drop your price until the spell sells.  I'm not really a wheeler/dealer but I'm making more money than I could be soloing or in a pickup group :-)  It only takes me about 15 minutes a day now that I have my list of components to look for.  One thing I try to do is not buy a component for a spell unless I can get all the components for a spell.  This why I don't have cash tied up in the common components while looking for someone to sell the rare one.  <br />
<br />
If you are on Bristlebane...I have enough competition....this thread isn't for you!  :-) :-) :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Another suggestion: farm Veksar. On Bertox, at least, the zone rarely has more than 2-3 people in it, and there are plenty of named to camp. 65 mage and shaman are plenty of firepower, too. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lashon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I would also suggest Veksar.  Not &quot;too&quot; many people go there ( on Vazaelle anyway), plenty of camps, nice drops.<br />

<br />
I don't believe CoH works in AC.  Its been a year or so ago but CoH used to summon multiple Grimling Heroes who were pretty difficult at the time.  The first time I saw this it summoned 8-10 of them and wiped our small raid.  The other time it only summoned 2 and we dealt with them though they have a large amount of hitpoints.  You can't bind in Inner Acrylia and if you camp out in Inner Acrylia you pop back at zone in when you log back in.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion would be Veksar, Droga or Acrylia.  I don't have a lot of experience in Veksar but it seems similar to Droga in loot potential.  I'm not sure if its just me but the named in Inner Acrylia don't seem to spawn as often as they once did.  I remember for the first 4-6 months after the revamp it seemed like we'd see one of the named an hour.  The last 4-5 times we went for 6+ hours and only saw 1-2 named so we stopped going.  So while Inner Acrylia loots may generally sell for quite a bit more than Droga/Veksar loots they don't drop nearly as often.</div></div><hr />

I would head to the seer/king camp in droga and clear as many goblins as possible. Good fun, quest drops, good loot and cash. Holding down the shrooms in sebilis would be good fun. I would opt against tactics since having the mage page tank would probably eat your mana fast and you would probably just end up root/rotting. droga/veksar/IC are indeed your most probable best places to head.</div></div><hr />

You are correct, sir.  CoH will summon Grimling Heroes who are terribly underconned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tendaena - my boyfriend and I were in your EXACT situation a short while ago.  We both were able to finance our missing 63-65 spells as well as picking up some ornate armor - all in the bazaar, by farming / exploring underused zones.<br />
<br />
My first recommendation is for both of you to get suspend minion 2 before anything else.  In droga, for example, the mage can pop on his fixed duration invis and CoH you to the named camp of your choice - which is a lot safer with a fully armored and buffed pet at his side.<br />
<br />
Second is to put in the time (if you have it) at the takish dungeon for the mage pet augment.  It's really ridiculous the benefits you BOTH will get from that enhanced pet.<br />
<br />
DROGA -- We spent a LOT of time in droga.   Not for the named drops - though we found that the drops sold quite well - but we were originally after the quest bits for the FT2 shoulders for me and the FT2 neck for him.  We ended up getting both, but banked about 100k each by selling the named drops and the quest bits that we didn't need.  How much will people on your server pay for the quest bits to get a hybrid only FT1 70hp earring?  On xev it's 10k or more each.  Yes, these drops are rare, but it's a chance to make the devaluation of platinum work for YOU for once.  *grin*  The plat they drop, and the skins to sell in the bazaar add up as well.<br />
<br />
VEKSAR -- maxed cabilis faction by turning in the weapons, while I was at it.  Very nice drops and good cash per mob, like droga.  Undead-heavy, so it's a good idea to LDoN to bane if you want to help with damage.<br />
<br />
CHARDOK B -- again, heavy on the undead, but very easy for a shaman/mage to mow through these critters.  Max your chardok faction, and pick up named drops as well as the random drops chardok always had.<br />
<br />
ACRYLIA -- haven't done anything here outside of VT shards, but the acrylia sells VERY VERY well (between 500 and 2k per BRICK on xev, people are insane).  We plan on going back when we have some spare time.<br />
<br />
There are a few threads on each of these zones for more detail, but they're all high-exp dungeon zones, very easy for a 65 shaman/mage duo, and will net you a good amount of cash over the long term.  Overall, I've found that there's very little a shm/mag duo can't do, and we've had a lot of fun exploring new places in our hunt for spell-plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Droga is indeed a good place to farm loots. I've made well over 100kpp there and i dou a 62 ranger and 62 shammy, started douing there when I got the 58 shammy cheal and my ranger was 61. I can't take every camp but for me to be able to log on and make 20kpp in 2-3 hours is pretty good Imho and I'm sure your gonna be able to make a hell of alot more than that since you can handle camps I'd get smoked in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Veksar.  Veksar Veksar Veksar Veksar.  I made 40k there in two days, plus got a spell haste 3 ring and some nice stuff for my cleric.  If it weren't in such a pain-in-the-ass place to get to/cr from, I'd probably still be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aqualung</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've spent a lot of time in droga, and i can tell you that you'd be better off there without the mage.  <br />
To optimize your time there, you'll be wanting to invis between camps and tank-fight mobs on their spawn point, to avoid clearing trash.  Trying to use a pet in this style is a death sentence, since they will inevitably path out into the middle of the room and make a large mess.<br />
If you fight king where he spawns, the rest of the room won't add.  Flame master can be single pulled over the table.  Ice master can be singled from on top of the bunk bed in his room.   Earth seer is all alone, easy root/rot kill.<br />
You alone can easily keep these 4 spawns cleared before repops.  I could usually work in an extra named  spot and still have time to get back. <br />
Stone Crook, Whip Cracker, Bone Knight, are all killable without adds.  <br />
<br />
Your best bet would be to both go to droga, and then split up.  Let the Mage take care of a couple of the easier camps that involve clearing a few trash mobs, while you do as many of the camps i stated as you can.  Having both of you there will be good, since all the item drops are lore.<br />
Just be prepared to hear people whine about how many camps you are taking up.  If you're inclined to be a nice guy about it, put the priority on king and icemaster spawns.  Those 2 are the best sellers, for the most part, and also ALWAYS spawn a cave lord or an icemaster for their placeholders.  important because they can randomly drop the quest items for the FT2 neck and shoulder.<br />
<br />
When i first started farming droga, the prices were about 3x higher than they are now, but you can still make some good cash there, based simply on how many named spawns you will be able to keep cleared.    <br />
If you're clearing 5 nameds, you can expect 2-3 items per hour.  Almost everything still sells for 4-5k, the hammer a bit more.  That equates to around 10k an hour, or more.   not too shabby.</div></div><hr />

You are lucky if you get 1 fungi in 2 days. just not worth it, even more because those 2 can handle the fungus cycle and get a fungi vest much easier</div></div><hr />

That IS insane.  Acrylia doesn't sell as well on Vazaelle as it used to.  Velium tends to sell a lot better (about 2 times the price for the same size piece/brick).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Threads like this emphasize the worst design aspect of EQ at present.  <br />
<br />
It's retarded that people feel so stymied in obtaining their spells that they have to farm up 45k in cash to buy a spell.  And sadly that's reasonable (and even expected by some), because hoping for runes drops in BoThunder or PoTactics (if flagged) can be a really slow process.  <br />
<br />
I scrabbled through getting my spells, and it involved a lot of bazaar merchanting.  That's asinine in an adventure/quest game.  <br />
<br />
Now my guild can farm earth rings, and we'll get like 6 runes a night that no one needs - except twinks.  So, we sell them them to the folks who used to be like us, scrabbling along trying to get spells.  <br />
<br />
The loot scheme is wrong.  It should not be about farming plat to buy things in the bazaar.  It should be about hunting your spells and gear.  <br />
<br />
I don't think runes are sufficiently available at present, but ironically they might be overpresent in the elementals.  <br />
<br />
There's limited fun and adventure farming crap for gear.  It just feeds into maggots like Yantis and IGE providing short cuts, when a better game mechanic can both limit their involvement and corruption of the economy and provide a better gameplay reward system.</div></div><hr />

too bad :/ I didn't come back to PoG since sebilis B2 nerf, so maybe they nerfed PoG at the same time.<br />
About the snare weapon, there is one dropped in sebilis crypt that procs snare, so if you give it to pet, he will proc snare ........ but as you can see, it isn't a weapon of all days :(</div></div><hr />
