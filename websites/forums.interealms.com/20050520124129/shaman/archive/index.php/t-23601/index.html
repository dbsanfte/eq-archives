<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently aquired Breath of Trushar, and last night used it on our raids for the first time.  Problem is, it wouldn't land on anyone, including myself.  Punch cann5, hot myself, tab back to target.  A few seconds later, I noticed I wasn't being healed.  Did it again, and saw the 'did not take hold' message.  Cast it around on a number of folks, and did not take hold.<br />
So, I went through my buff box and clicked off one at a time, once I clicked off 'dance of blades', I could land bot on myself.  Q was completely unaffected.  Had a couple others, most notably shadowknights, I couldn't land bot on either.  Again Q was fine.<br />
Is this a known problem?  Was I bugged maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This happened to me the other night in Ikkinz 1. I could not BOT the monk to save my life (or his, incidentally). He had three buff slots open, he said. There was no bard in our group, so the &quot;Dance of Blades&quot; explanation doesn't work in that respect ... but yeah, I've had the &quot;did not take hold&quot; message several times in instances where Q has landed. Oddly it's never done that when I've tried to cast it on myself, only on others.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probably the weird line of sight errors that happen sometimes. Horseback seems to make the problem worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a bard bot and BoT lands on him and myself without any problems so it's not related to Dance of the Blades.  Sometimes I do have problems casting when Im on a mount standing against a wall, but that's another story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm always grouped with a Bard when XPing and I've had no issues landing Trushar. The only time I got that error was trying to HoT the tank during the Packmaster Scrtbetchacantpronouncemynamesuckers event, which sucks because his AE removes the effectiveness of all other healing other than HoTs. The Clerics hadn't HoTed him and I'm the only Shaman with my GoD spells in guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cant be horse, was in ssra temple doing emporer.  Kept trying to cast it and did not take hold every single time until i clicked off the bard song.  Kinda sucked because I was slower/healer for the tank cc group.  Switched to Q and all was fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I also bot a bard and BoT works just fine with dance of blades up. Where you just out of buff slots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Newp.  Again, Q landed just fine, trushar wouldn't stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's randomly unable to land because of our massive ability to regain mana, and because we have slow.<br />
That's probably the developers answer anyways. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dirkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've never had any problems with BoT.....weird hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah I have a problem with BoT.....fargin rune is too rare.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only time I have problems with BoT is when target is out of range and of course I get a &quot;target is out of range&quot; message. If I get a &quot;spell would not take hold&quot; message I ask the intended target if they are buff locked. They always are. In other words I have never had problems with this spell. I find the range is very small on it and the range on Q is larger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Shrug the range on both is 100 <br />

Had bot not land on a bard I was with last night. Did inspect buffs and they had 15 buffs up so i cured tash and it landed just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've had BoT for a long time and never had an issue with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I had the &quot;Your spell would not take hold message&quot; a few times during a VP Dragon raid the other night. Each time I spoke with the person about it, and it was because of full buffs.</div></div><hr />
