<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>skulript</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, <br />
<br />
I love this forum, and appreciate all of your insight and help with being a shaman, and playing EQ...I am humbly asking for your help yet again. <br />
<br />
I know absolutely zero about AA - Is there a resource I can look at to give me the low-down on it? Seriously, I see threads refering to AA, but they all assume a knowledge base of &gt;0, which I do not possess. <br />
<br />
Now that I have pleaded ignorance (very humbling), can one of you lend a fellow shammie a helping hand??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you could try searching, since theres about 500 threads on this subject already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply. Sorry if my plight was vague..it really does show off my lack of knowledge, eh?<br />
<br />
Here are a list of questions that I am interested in:<br />
<br />
How is AA amassed? I read a thread that alluded to AA being experience driven, but AA exp differed from normal exp? Is this zone specific? Is this MOB specific?? Something you need to turn on somewhere??<br />
<br />
Are different AA's better for different Races? Are they based on the type of player you are? Solo vs. Group? Root/rot vs. melee? <br />
<br />
These are a few of the burning questions...i appreciate any assistance you can provide!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whoa.  <br />
<br />
Okay, read this for a starter:<br />
<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/archetype/default.asp?Action=Cat&amp;ClassId=4<br />
<br />
How is AA amassed?<br />
Killing mobs, like regular exp<br />
<br />
I read a thread that alluded to AA being experience driven, but AA exp differed from normal exp?<br />
I've heard alt experience is as fast as level 51 experience.  For those of us 60+, alt exp is MUCH faster than &quot;regular&quot; experience.<br />
<br />
Is this zone specific? Is this MOB specific?? Something you need to turn on somewhere??<br />
<br />
Yes, some zones have a modifier and give better experience.  At lower levels, dungeons typically give better experience than outdoor dungeons.  Higher level mobs will give more experience.  You can turn on alt experience by clicking the alt experience button in your inventory.  You can then set the slider from 10% to 100% of your experience going towards AA experience (by factors of 10%).  I believe you only have this option at level 50 when you can begin accruing AA experience.<br />
<br />
Are different AA's better for different Races? Are they based on the type of player you are? Solo vs. Group? Root/rot vs. melee?<br />
<br />
The beautiful thing about AA is it helps alleviate &quot;cookie cutter shaman syndrome.&quot;  Until we're all like Mudcrush and Ceno with 300+ AAs, folks are getting a chance to &quot;specialize.&quot;  You can maxx out your healing AAs and be a better healer, or maxx out your nuke AAs and nuke for more damage or maxx out your defensive AAs so you are more sturdy.  So, yes, it is based on the type of player you are and whether you solo or group.<br />
<br />
Most folks follow this AA path:<br />
<br />
General - begins at level 51 (or 50?) - must put at least 6 in general before you can move on to arch abilities (6 points gives Baron/Baroness title).  Most folks choose 3 runspeed 3 regen.  All abilities are 1 point per level in this section.<br />
<br />
Arch - begins at level 55 - must put at least 12 into arch before you can move on to class abilities (12 points in arch gives Venerable title).  Almost EVERY shaman puts 12 into mental clarity since it's a prerequisite for the can 5 class ability (incredibly powerful mana regen).  In the arch section, the levels are 2 points, 4 points, 6 points.  So, to earn mental clarity 3 for example, you will spend 12 points...2 for level 1, 4 for level 2 and 6 for level 3.<br />
<br />
Class - begins at level 59 - must put at least 24 points into class abilities to earn your Elder title.  Nearly everyone goes for Can 5 first becuase it's just that good, it costs 5 points.  The abilities here have random costs...5 for can 5 (prereq of mental clarity 3), 8 for Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery (prereq of spell casting reinforcement 3), 9 for mass group buff, etc.<br />
<br />
PoP abilities - some fun stuff here, read the descriptions in the link I posted for more info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go to Casters Realm, section shamans, sub-section Alternate Advancement Abilities. You'll find them all listed there.<br />

<br />
Starting level 51 - Basically get runspeed 3 and regen 3, then forget about Basic AA's for a long while.<br />
<br />
Get to 55 and go for 12 points in Mental Clarity (this is generally accepted to be the best for shamans because at lvl 59..........<br />
<br />
You can go for Cannibalize V for massive mana regeneration (5 AA points).<br />
<br />
By the time you've done this you should be able to come back for more details (or figure it out for yourself :) ).<br />
<br />
Some people may argue use a different order (go for different AA's) but this is the generally accepted route that i think the majority of shamans take. Sometimes it may be better to level to 60 (or even 65) and then go AA's, depends on your play-style, guild etc.<br />

<br />
Edit: I found this link while looking at something about rabid bear.  So rabid bear will be highlighted if you use this.  Kinda ironic if you looking for information about useful AA's :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">AA is simple and complex....  Until level 51, you've always had regular EXP at 100%.  Mobs give EXP and AA EXP.  These are two different pools, you can't get 100% of both of them.  As you raise the percentage of one pool, you lower your percentage of the other.  Therefore, if you want AA, it behooves you to go to a place where the mobs give better AA than they do regular EXP.  <br />
<br />
As you die, you lose EXP, Regular EXP only, not AA.  Therefore, even when you decide to go hard for AA, you should keep at least 10% regular EXP going.  And remember, AA's are to enhance your class, they aren't more important than levelling.<br />
<br />
Talk of Can V can be dizzying, but don't let it divert you.  Can V is a fantastic skill, but it only enhances a well-set up Shaman.  Without Torpor/Quiescense, it's usefulness is diminished.  If your HP's are low enough that every time you use it you get low health aggro, it's of limited usefulness.<br />
<br />
You'll get it.  You'll be a powerful Shaman, but not tomorrow.  It'll take time, effort and knowledge.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As a real rough rule of thumb, when you hit the level where you can start collecting AA points, set your experience slider to 20% AA exp, and then forget about it.<br />
<br />
AA points are nice, but IMO, the benefit that you get from increasing your level is more than the benefit you get from AA abilities. But having said that, it is nice to keep the AA exp ticking over. I set my AA bar to 20% when i dinged 51. I am nearly level 60 and by the time I ding 60 I will probably have 8AA or so, which is fine for me</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to disagree with this as a matter of principle.  First things first. If level is most important, level.  If AA is critical, then AA.  Half measures (or in this case 20% measures) just slow both up.<br />
<br />
Now, having said that, I'm at 98% of 53 with all exp going into AA, but I'm doing it to allow a friend to bring up an SK (SK is stuck at 51 as he changed back over to his cleric and his enchanter.  He says he got tired of 3 boxing, can you imaging?  j/k).  <br />

<br />
No offense, but do what works for you!<br />
<br />
Level are more &quot;empowering&quot; than AA points.<br />
A level 60 shaman with zero AA is more powerful than a level 52 shaman with 30 AA. If you are looking at this game from a completely dispassionate point of view, in terms of complete efficiency, it is probably better to go 100% level, o% AA until 60 and then 100% AA o% level until canni V. However, this is not supposed to be a test, its supposed to be fun. My point was that by setting the slider to 20% AA, I don't really notice the decrease in my &quot;real&quot; exp, but my AA exp does creep along slowly. That way, I kinda get the best of both worlds - I get to reach 60 &quot;relatively&quot; quickly, but when I get there, I already have a little bit of a headstart on the AA grind to get canni V.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've got to admit I'm an efficiency sort of guy.

You have a good reason for doing what you do.  The people that drive me nuts are the ones that set it to 50% because they can't make up their minds.  PICK ONE, dang it, and DO IT!

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hail, yet another dead horse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don’t think this is a dead horse at all.  Maybe if you have 20+ AAs you may not care to read this thread.  Fine, don’t read it.  Move along.  But for those of us who are just starting to get AAs, or have not even gotten to that point, this kind of information is very handy.  I just spent the last 45 minutes reading this post and the other post from the link above.  I love this sort of stuff.  I have always been slow to level so AAs come very slowly as well.  I want to make sure I’m spending my hard earned points where they will do me the most good for my play style.  So please, back up and give this horse some air.<br />
<br />
My kitty shaman is level 52 and I just turned regular XP back to 100% after spending three AAs on run three.  Being only level 52, this took me about two weeks.  But I’m happy I did it.  The increased running speed will prove very useful in many situations.  But I think my time can now be best spent leveling to 60.  I don’t want to go beyond that point because from what I’ve read many of the old world locations turn LB at 61.  So once I hit 60 I’ll switch to 100% AA experience and get as many AA points as I can stand.  It would be a lot easier if that level 61 pet was level 60 instead.  I just know at some point I’m going to have to level and get my new puppy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah, level to 60 -- POSSIBLY stop for run 3 along the way, I think your hunting grounds more than anything else will tell you if you need it -- then turn on AA until cann 5.<br />
<br />
I can also make a case for leveling to 61, because the bigger pet could be a significant boon to your leveling IF you have the places to level, and are ready to toss off the stuff that LB/greens out at 61.<br />
<br />
I stopped at 60, and got an orange in to absorb deaths, then turned AA to 100%.  If I die, I turn it back to regular XP until the bubble refills, then back to AA again.<br />
<br />
Actually, after about 10 AA I paused and filled up a second orange just for the hell of it, thinking if I changed my mind and decided to go to 61, it wouldn't be such an onerous climb.  But that was just me wasting time really.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ok... Now time for another question then regarding the quality of XP mobs. Now, I understand that mobs have XXX exp attatched to them, and that number can vary according to ZEM, full group bonus, and how close the mobs are to your level. (IE exp bonus if the mobs are within 5 levels, when you are post 50)<br />
<br />
My question has to do with low con blues, vs light blue. Is there an exp penalty on light blue mobs? (IE normally the mob when it is blue is worth  XXX exp, but once it turns light blue it is worth XXX -20% exp)<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is because I have a good low blue exp spot that I have been grinding AA's on. Near constant solo pulls, a basic revolving door of mobs. There is a big power difference between 59 and 60 (main is a paladin) and the mobs might turn lt blue at 60. I cant imagine pulling or killing faster than I am now. So... would it be best to hang out where I am with the mobs as low blues, or level up for the better power? Will my AAXP rate change? or is Y mob worth X EXP even at LT blue?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Gabus, if nobody answers this question please post it as its own thread.  I would very much like to see it answered.  I read a lot of message boards and I&#8217;ve never seen this explained.  From other things I&#8217;ve read it&#8217;s inferred that there is indeed a big difference in experience when a mob turns light blue.  But inference is all I have to go on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Is there an exp penalty on light blue mobs? (IE normally the mob when it is blue is worth XXX exp, but once it turns light blue it is worth XXX -20% exp)<br />
<br />
As far as I know, a light blue mob gives only 40% of the experience it would if the mob were dark blue. In any event, it's a significant penalty and makes hunting low blues not worthwhile. They're practically as hard to kill as a dark blue, but give nowhere near the reward.<br />
<br />
This experience penalty applies whether you have exp set to regular or aaxp.</div></div><hr />

Aha! Precisely the kind of response I was looking for. Especially the part about the AAXP being effected by the penalty as well. So, if I cannot kill 40% more mobs then dinging up to 60 really isnt worth it, assuming i consider this spot better than what i can find at 60. Great explanation thanks.  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not quite.  To make up for a 40% of EXP reduction in your mobs, you need to kill 67% more mobs (just ran the numbers).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Sometimes gear you acquire along the way will help you to choose what to train next.  For instance, I got a mask with 18% spell haste on it, which negated the need for me to train Quickbuff III (9 points, ouch!) since QB II (25% haste on buffs) plus the 18% left me near the 50% haste cap for buffs, which if I can get a cleric haste buff, I'm right at 3.0 second Quiescence, which is dam handy.  <br />
<br />
Or I got a Crown of Ambivalence, which extends duration of all my spells by 15% that have a duration.  This means that my buffs are also affected.  So I just got Spell Casting Reinforcement II because that combined with my hat focus meant 30% added length on my buffs!  I might finish it out later, but there's no hurry now, you see. <br />
<br />
Right now I'm finishing up the last two points I need to train Spell Casting Fury III.  I just decided it would be kewl to nuke a lot and do some good dmg for it.  Many shamans never train this skill because &quot;shaman nukes suck&quot; but I want it anyway.  Then again I trained Rabid Bear (mistake, dont do it), and Pet Control (good move) and most shamans don't train those either.  Of the two, Pet Control is my favorite by far.  Being able to sit your pet down and having it stay while you pull is valuable, very valuable.  Specially if you like to pharm or solo a lot.  In PoP the value decreases of course, but it's an absolute GODLY skill in pre-PoP zones.  <br />
<br />
So do what you wanna do for AAs.  But I would recommend you get MC3 and Canni5 before anything else.  If you don't, when you finally do you'll be kicking yourself for not getting it in the first place.  I can name a few shamans who visit this board who were HEATHEN UNBELIEVERS and didn't train Canni5 first!  It was funny to get a big &quot;I told you so&quot; when they finally broke down and trained it and their eyes popped.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">As a bit of counter opinion.   Our guild wanted everyone to get to 65 (as soon as realistic) post PoP.   So for the most part, everyone was grinding xp on leveling while grouping.   But while raiding, many would go full exp into AA's.   What would have been minor (to hardly nothing) experience in normal turned out to be very rewarding over long raids to AA's.   <br />
<br />
One side effect of working on AA's is the removal of the exp hit ... ie 5/10/20 less exp per kill based on Race.  So as a Troll Shaman, I would balance my normal experience grinding for the max rewards.   But while raiding, my exp was balanced across the whole raid group without any race based factors.   <br />
<br />
What I found during a normal week I would gain a couple AA's just on Raiding.    Because I was impatience ... after spending these on Run 3 and Regen ... I took the easy way out spending each week's work on the first level Arch's.   So I had first level in mc, healing gift, scf,  and scm.    Now that I'm a full 10% into 65, I've been working totally on AA's pushing on to Cann V and beyond.   <br />
<br />
Bottom line ... Play EQ based on you and your guild's playing style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>dcfix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Whenever I find myself in a raid situation or helping lower level guildies camp something, I always turn my AA to 100%. For example, on Monday in KD, I ended up with 7% AA exp, as opposed to the 0-1% of normal exp that I would have gotten. <br />
<br />
I'm currently running 50% until I have the spells that I want for my next level (59), then I'll bump it to 100% normal experience again until I get a safety orange. Then I'll go back to 50% until I can save up enough to at least buy Torpor. Since I'm not a member of an uber guild, I have to earn my spells for the most part by grinding and selling potions, and I see little point to rushing to 60 if I can't afford the spells of that level.<br />
