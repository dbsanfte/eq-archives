<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ursus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Will be hitting 60 soon, and don't have any AA points at the moment. I have torpor banked and ready to go. So my question is...how useful will regen3 be for me once I do hit 60? The first 3 points will be spent in running...but what about the next 3? Regen...stamina maybe...or even the less eating/drinking one. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">3 points of regen is moot with Torpor. just not sure if there is much alternatives. i've thought about STA. that's about all the words of wisdom i have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brocht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I put 3 into regen. Is 3 points per tick meaningless? Kinda. But hey might as well get used to the &quot;I just blew points on a near useless skill&quot; before you get to arch and blow TWELVE points on mental clarity.  (after all most want Cann5)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually the first point of regen gives you 3 points per tic.  I went from 2 per tic standing to 5 per tic standing when i put my first point in.  Two more made 7 standing.  Add the AoB effect from vindy bp and that's 9regen/tic standing.  It all adds up pardner.  Less casts of Torpor = more mana faster.  Sides, you'll be pulling a lot most likely and that's hard to do while snared.   You'll figure it out.  <br />

cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Stamina is pretty worthless, unless you're dreadfully low or nearly maxed. 5 points of stamina is 15 hit points. 3 points of stamina is only 9 hit points. Not really worth the effort.</div></div><hr />

I may be wrong but I thought you barbs got 4 per tick standing when you hit 60 and therefore the single hp per tick an aa point gives you would have put you to the 5 hp you say you were getting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bonestorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You get +2 Sta for every 1 skill point in stamina, so you get +10 Sta for the full 5 points, which in turn gives you +30hp gain overall at level 60 (3hp's per Sta for priest classes).</div></div><hr />
