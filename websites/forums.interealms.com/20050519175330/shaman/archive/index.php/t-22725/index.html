Actualy im willing to bet they looked at WoW and said &quot; we better do that&quot; and implimented a quest based experince system.<br />
<br />
Its cheap and shows you the level of imagination of the dev's but hey, if it works out well, i might renew my subscription cause ive always loved my Wizzy and Ranger and Monk and other alts, but grouping at that level is near impossible once you get past PC, till you get to PoP.<br />
<br />
Thats something i think they should really address, even if most poeple are 65 at this point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im wondering now why the task system is only &quot;designed for 1 to 50&quot; at this point.  Granted, I have a few characters in that level range that will make use of the system, but come on.  <br />
<br />
I know that SOE states that the largest demographic is players 25-50ish.  Of course, this number is skewed.  I would like to know how many active accounts have at least 1 level 65 character on it.  That would give a much fairer measure of where players spend thier time.  Sure, Ive got 1 level 65 on my account, but I have 7 other charactes from 5 to 57.  Those alts see maybe 1 hour of play for every 6 hours I spend on Thorzion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brenlo: Buff timer is a possibility and I will forward it over to our coders. It might be something tied to leadership or an AA though. (that is just me supposing). Removing pet buffs, I do not see happening soon.<br />
<br />
Puppy buff timer should have come with the PC buff timer this last patch or two, period. The very idea of making us spend leadership points or AA points to have something so commonsensical is infuriating. I /feedback a puppy buff timer almost every day.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Gemdiver: Is it possible to add a raid option to the LFG tool, so that if you are waiting for a raid invite you can put /lfg on, and click the raid button in the LFG tool, This would allow you to keep the /lfg tag above your head but would not include you in the LFG list when other players use the LFG tool?<br />
<br />
Brenlo: Interesting idea. I will see what the guys here think.<br />
<br />
Not a bad idea. When I'm LFG for a raid, I always put that in the LFG window, but a lot of folks don't use or don't know how to use the window. I've also /feedbacked the idea of putting an LFG column on the guild manager window, in addition to the /who guild LFG command (I think that's the right command, anyways).<br />
<br />
I'll agree with Haagen ... I think another round of LDON armor should be added to the merchants ... perhaps 2k-3k points (and perhaps a required number of wins in a certain camp?) and not QUITE elemental quality. I'm not particularly all that upset, because a set of augged Incorporeal armor is pretty sharp, but I don't suppose another set of gear choices is all that bad a thing.<br />

Well then why should Elemental armor be in the Elemental planes? I mean you already GOT there, so obviously you can hack it right?<br />

All I play is Ldon now.  Its what keeps me going and a few others I know in EQ.  Most of my 'pickup' groups are smooth but there are a few players I am starting to weed out that just love to try your patience.  To them ldon is a joke and they don't take it serious.  To me its very serious and all that I play for.  I have had many players in 'uber' guilds join me on ldon.  I would be very happy to have ldon gear available to me somewhere between current ldon gear and elemental gear.  Would be very rewarding and make doing hard ldon's in pick up groups feel more comfortable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it just me, or is this mentality in EQ one of the reasons that EQ has lost some of its magic?<br />
<br />
Just because you spend 150 hours doing something, doesn't mean you get to have a piece of loot off a god.  I mean, it seems to destroy the feeling that god-like loot is just that, something from a god or uber monster.  The fact that it takes 40+ people to kill the monster/god, is what makes the loot so good.  <br />
<br />
If you could just spend 8000 ldon points, which are aquired from doing basically a repetitive task with little or no planning involved.... and get something of equal value to EP's off some major deity, I mean, come on.  Doesn't that sound slightly off to you?<br />
<br />
Its bad enough as it is that you can farm some trival camp for days on end, and buy items that used to take raids to get.  Personally, I wish everything was no-drop:)  That'd separate the men from the boys right there hehe.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOUR TIME IS MORE VALUABLE THAN MY TIME.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nope, its not.  Both our times are valuable, I just spend my time ganging up to defeat gods with 60 other people.  You choose to run down a low risk ldon over and over and over, defeating mobs you could probably solo. <br />
<br />
I say sure, give LDON merchants new armor, IF, and only IF, the loot is now one groupable.  People one group Vindi now, so you can buy that loot sure:)<br />
<br />
I don't know.  I feel your pain at not having raid quality gear if you can only play like 1 hour a day and that is spent doing ldon, but I mean, can't we retain some semblance of reality (fantasy reality) in the game?  Namely, you can't have god-like gear without killing a god.<br />
<br />
p.s.  Oh, btw, someone posted above that Ldon merchants have VT-like gear on them.  hehe. No way, its not even close.  Maybe VT trash gear sure, but nothing off of the big name mobs in VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You do need elemental armor to do well in GoD though. <br />
<br />
In Luclin they added easy made trade skilled armor as good as the quested Velious armor. One expansion later. <br />
<br />
I personally think they should add elemental level statted armor (minus the focus effects/clickies) as a new set of blue diamond trade skill armor makeable by anyone not just people in EP+. What the hell is wrong with everyone having access to armor that is going to be 4 expansions old soon? <br />
<br />
Anyways I love how they list all these things (especially more GoD rebalancing) for after OoW comes out. Exactly how often do they go back and rebalance previous expanasions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When the games Expansions are being desinged around certain Stats. <br />
You either need the ability to leg up In said expansion. Or allow some avenue on gearing up in the previous expansions so that you are equal or at least close enough to the Elemental players.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is that simple. <br />
<br />
Elemental Geared people, Get too many advantages for being raiders.<br />
<br />
They get More zones.<br />
They get More choices in gear.<br />
They get Special spells.<br />
They get better effects.<br />
They get vastly inflated hit points and mana numbers.<br />
They get much better Xp based zones due to exclusion and hyper inflated ZeMs.<br />
<br />
And they get to bring every single gear and AA related advantage to current casual suited encounters and dominate them.<br />
<br />
Then complain that the encounters are crap. Or too easy, and to top it off bitch and complain that things are too good for the risk involved when they wouldnt even give it to twinks. (As in the first release of LDON armours that could actually be augmented to high levels.)<br />
<br />
Hey all they need to do is set up a system where if you are vastly too powerful for an encounter you get stripped down to the proper levels for the encounter. That would be fair. <br />
<br />
But guess what people don't want fair. They never have. They want Fair for them. Or fair as in the best advantage for themselves. <br />
<br />
Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Raiders have ALL the advantages. And that my friends aint balanced at all.<br />

Take a look at my gear.  I'm damn near in the top ten outfitted shaman on my server.  I don't need elemental gear, almost all of it would be a downgrade to me.  THIS IS NOT BRAGGADOCIO.  I point this out to deflate the argument that I'm being &quot;greedy&quot; or hating on raiders.  I'm not.<br />
<br />
It's my opinion that putting a BP with, say, 160hp/160mana on LDON vendors with accompanying sleeves, legs, head, etc., etc., and some upgraded weapons and focii augments wouldn't be a bad idea.  Would make the folks that spend their time one-group raiding LDONs a little closer edgewise to the folks that raid till 3am.<br />
<br />
I'm personally not saying one method of playing is better than the other, but they should be rewarded about equally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">There are a lot of benefits with raiding but there are a lot of sacrifices as well (my guild has raided every Sat morning at 7:00 am PST for 4 years). My time in game is generally not my own. Last week for example, I raided every night I played - no time for exp or anything else. (note: that's the way I like it, I prefer to raid over exp).<br />
<br />
That being said, I have no problem with people earning elemental quality gear via LDON. There is a huge, nearly unfair advantage between a well geared elemental + raider and a more casual player. When I pick people lfg for a LDON adventure, first I start asking lfg players in the &quot;big guilds&quot; because I assume they will have the gear/AA/focus/spells to make a LDON a breeze.<br />
<br />
New items and shiny stats are nice for everybody. It won't hurt me a bit if a more casual player who can't raid for 6 hours on a work night can knock off a few LDONs and get a little closer to a nice wrist or boot item.<br />
<br />
Heck, I have always thought they should bump the stats on ornate. Why is elemental 135 hitpoints and ornate is 40 hitpoints...it makes much more sense to me that ornate would be 75 hitpoints. I mean, the darned heiro cloak from Kunark had 75 hitpoints/mana and that was 4 years ago!!</div></div><hr />

Actually, it's not even about equal reward.  I'm talking about an upgrade to the stuff on LDON vendors.  Just make it some upgraded raw hp and stats with maybe some stuff, like maybe a single weapon or BP from each camp having a slot 8 augment.

<br />
I disagree with several of the things you said but I dont like those multiple quote/replies posts so I picked this since it seems like the key issue here.<br />
<br />
If you honestly dont care what equipment others have then why not let there be elemental-level equipment on LDoN merchants for a suitable price?<br />
<br />
It will be far from easy to get (but theoretically possible). And it wont enable anyone not in an elemental-level guild to do any of the far more interesting raid encounters. It wont enable anyone to skip any of the key mobs. I think the key is to set a suitable price but if that is done then noone will progress any faster than they could by going the official EverRaid route.<br />
<br />
Theoretically people could gear up to elemental level before entering the elemental zones but given the prices for the current top equipment from LDoN it would probably be a very slow way of getting to that level of equipment. And people would still have to get the needed flags afterwards. I fail to see the harm in this.<br />
<br />
I cant even spend enough time in LDoN to get the current best equipment so even better/more expensive equipment would be far far out of my reach so it wouldnt affect me in any way. But if there are people in small guilds that are able to spend the needed time then I am all for giving them some more to work towards without having to join one of those huge uber guilds.</div></div><hr />

No it doesnt. From ancient times people have spent years and years on pleasing their gods in hope of being rewarded later. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this concept in EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">People do not need better gear to do GoD.<br />
<br />
I am proof of this, I am in God and getting upgrades for my guild. And myself.Ferubi, Qinmi, Riwwi have all been very good to me an mine after the revamp. <br />
<br />
But people do LDON also to achieve better gear themselves. The endless killng a Raid guild does is comparable to the endless killing a casual guild does in LDON. Cause at the end of the day the Raider has more to choose from in Class and gear basics than any LDON one does. <br />
<br />
AS for Risk?<br />
<br />
When was the last time anyone lost all thier gear.? Raider or casual.<br />
<br />
There is no risk but wasted time now. Or blown spawns. And that affects Both groups equally. The raider loses a nights encounter times 50- 72 people. The casual player might lose a night for 6 -18 people. <br />
<br />
The largest difference here is The raider will be able to get back to the encounter soon enough and risk it again with better tactics. For a casual with thier limited play times and conflicting schedules there might not be a window again for a long long while. <br />
<br />
People always say You need the raid loots to gear up for Raid encounters. If this is true then you do not need those same raid loots and vastly superiour gear for when you are slumming. So lose it. Make it fair for both teams.<br />
<br />
Again. People don't want fair. They want fair for them and thiers.<br />

You might not have said it directly but it sure sounds like you meant that only people in the PoP elemental zones are allowed to have armor equivalent to what drops there. You might not want to admit it but that isnt the only place where armor like that could be of use. Again, remember that people going the LDoN way would probably be far far behind the EverRaid horde equipmentwise even if there were elemental level equipment introduced in LDoN now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This I agree with but.........<br />
<br />
Why then have i hundreds (exaggeration but you get the drift) of times grouped with people from the top 3 guilds on my server in LDoN.<br />
In fact if you look at the top 20 list of players in LDoN most of them are from the top guilds.<br />
Why do most top guilds still take down trivial (to them) mobs if nothing else is available to them.<br />
<br />
No non raiders dont NEED EP gear but why do raiders get so green eyed at the mere thought of it happening.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">The important thing here is thats it`s (going to be) plenty of high-lvl expansions since PoP.<br />
   This game has always followed a certain suit--gear from raiding now is worse than stuff that casual people can get in a few expansions.<br />
    This being said theres really no reason they cant bump up the ldon armor...even a lot.<br />
     I`m not positive on this,but I think that a lot of  stuff that un-guilded people can get from GoD is better than anything,or near anything  I have on me in my magelo.Up until my quit date I  raided lots,everyday.Now casual people can get better stuff.This is the way the game is ! I have No problem with this at all,it has always been that way.<br />
     Not positive who first burned this point into my brian,but I love it(this it was Faern)--What You Have Does Not Matter To Me.Plain and simple,when the day is done the things the guy has next to you isnt hurting you.Why try to make an issue that it does?<br />
     The raiders will Always get better things than the casuals.This is meant to be,theres a ton more challenge involved in taking down a lvl 80 mob than taking down oodles of lvl 60 mobs.<br />
<br />
      This doesnt mean that ppl many expansions later should be denied even the Same Exact Gear.If you think about it,it wouldnt hurt a damn thing.Is it going to hurt anyone to put a blackflame sphere in ldon? nope.is it going to un-balance the casual from the raider? nope.Look at a heavy raider`s range slot.its a sh!t-ton better than a BFsphere.It may close the gap just a tad between a casual and a heavy raider,but imo that needs to be done anyways</div></div><hr />

This is very true and there is a connected statement:<br />
<br />
In EQ time is money - money for SOE.<br />
<br />
If SOE had a surefire way of having us all pay for staring at a rock day in and day out they would implement that instead of a vastly more interesting concept that might only keep 50 percent of us playing. This is where lost EQ lost its magic for me. When I started playing way back I would recommend EQ to all my friends but now I honestly cant recommend it to anyone.<br />

If you disagree with putting elemental armor on ldon merchants then I can only believe that you have some alterior motive with your objection because your logic doesn't hold water. Perhaps it's a knee jerk reaction to the thought that those non-raiding newbs, whom you've looked down upon from your high horse for so long, might actually come a little closer to being your equal.

Take a little time. It is actually pretty darn fun in parts.<br />

There are flaws of course. The invis runs suck since actually getting there safely as a shaman involves a lucky roll of the RNG for invis. <br />

And the monsters hit aweful hard for someone who doesnt raid. But it is doable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">&quot;No it doesnt. From ancient times people have spent years and years on pleasing their gods in hope of being rewarded later. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this concept in EQ.&quot;<br />
<br />
Uhmm.. sure, maybe do a series of quest that actually are dictated by your god, and then he'll give you a good piece of loot (think Prayer Shawl).  Its not that I don't want to see casual players get good loot, its that I want to retain some semblance of fantasy reality.  <br />
<br />
Crawling thru the same easy ldon dungeon 500 times doesn't tie into any sort of lore.  It just seems like going to work, 9-5, and then shopping at the mall on the weekends.  Just doesn't feel like part of this fantasy world anymore.  Thats issue one.<br />
<br />
Issue two is that I don't think that loot should be for sale (quality wise, not the exact piece), unless that loot level is single groupable.  But again, its not based on a desire to hold back loot from casual players, but based on a desire to tie the economy of EQ into some sort of set fantasy reality.  If a single group can kill it, then an EQ vendor could sell it to a player who has only single group experience.<br />
<br />
Likewise, why not have Ldon raids give Ldon raid points?  If you can play for 1-2 hours every night doing ldons, then why not play 2-3 hours one night and organize a ldon raid.  The ldon raid gives everyone ldon raid points (new point type) and they can buy gear that is of raid quality.  <br />
<br />
That I'd agree to in a heartbeat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Reading that whole Q and A has really made me see the summit as simply a superficial PR move that didn't affect anything.<br />

I could almost hear the Nelson laugh from Sony in that Q and A.<br />
<br />
And you guys, whether or not you need elemental armor to do hard ldon or to do GoD is beside the point, I concede that maybe you don't. What is the point is that reports from the summit said it was coming and MANY people have been taking that into account in their plans and point spending and expectations.<br />
<br />
Anyway, bottom line is the Q and A made me more cynical than I had been up to now about events of recent months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">So you would gladly give up the aa's if you decided to venture forth in your shiny ldon gear to the elementals? Just asking, because you want the raider to giveup the stats, what will you forego when you decide to progress through the planes? You won't want to give up the equipment so how about you lose 80 percent of the xp you gained while doing ldon? Only in pop+/god zones of course...... or do you only want fair for you and yours?<br />
<br />
<br />
I would be happy too. I personally hate LDON's I got all my xp and such in Tactics. Storms And other places I could get to in single group content.<br />
<br />
Besides. Know what there sparky. LDON is crap xp. I get better xp in a 12 man raid in Ferubi.<br />
<br />
I think I have maybe 20 wins total in LDON. And maybe a total of 30 full runs. <br />
<br />
And I have 411 AA now. <br />
<br />
Or wait. How about you have the elemental plains with LDON XP rates. What about that?<br />
<br />
Wouldnt be fair either. <br />
<br />
LDON gear with elemental stats would replace risk for tedium for rewards.<br />
<br />
Kind of like raiding the 35th time for a peice of gear. Tedium. Farming. <br />
<br />
Raiders have the option for both. Non raiders don't.<br />
<br />
The whole crux of the argument is the rewards are to vast and too good  for the effort required between raiders rewards and Non raiders rewards. And the only single reason for this is simple. <br />
<br />
1 encounter for 72 people takes less time to develop and tune with a 20 deep drop slot list. Compared to  12 encounters  for 6 man groups with 2 item drop lists each.<br />
<br />
I personally don't want improved rewards in LDON for the adventires that are there. I want better adventures for the better rewards. This aint gonna happen Just like rewards for LDOn won't get marginally better. There is no money iin it for SoE.<br />
<br />
If they took the sewers and Vxed and tipt and greatly simplified the lists so that 10 Wins in those done properly netted you a Elemental gear drop or aug related thing it would be a win for both casuals and raiders. <br />
<br />
Make it so groups want to play in there. Rather than be ferried through to get to the good stuff. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">There are both advantages and disadvantages to high level raiding, but that end game raiders CHOOSE the raiding life should be some indication of how the balance sheet ends up for them.  If they didn't like it, they wouldn't do it.  The way I see it, something needs to bring MORE balance between raiders and casuals.  I'm thinking along the lines of some heavy handed farming for a quest or vendor gear.  The gap is so broad that the results have been mentioned already.<br />
<br />
Once I recall a stupid druid waiting for an invite from anyone from a senior raid guild to adventure on a NORMAL LDoN.  He turned us down because he had no faith in anyone who was not in a top guild.  After we wrapped up 3 advents in just over 2 hours (after winning we stuck around to kill nameds, so we were a little slow that night) he was still LFG and we had 3 wins.  Not a great story, but it shows how mudflation perpetuates stupidity.<br />
<br />
Some folks here make an easy mistake, they look at themselves and say, I don't need the gear to do this ... they say that and don't look at the fact that they already have that gear and 3-4 times as many AAs as the shaman posting that the gear is required.<br />
<br />
Honestly, don't know if the gear is needed or not in GoD, but I wish people could better put themselves in another's shoes.  There are strong arguments that can be made to support those who feel there should be an alternate path to almost raid level loot, but that said, Brenlo just said it ain't happening.  I just hope VP will provide the chance casuals need to score better loot to help them gear up.</div></div><hr />

It's not a worthless reply, and it's certainly not complex enough to be scrutinized so. You had it right in the first part of your paragraph there, when you said, &quot;...there is no basis for any discussion for or against what he says because he doesnt really say anything.&quot; All right then.<br />
<br />
/bow<br />
<br />
Actually if the thread hadnt got derailed it would have died off because 99% of the rest of what Brenlo had to say is bollocks basically.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Sorry just had to relook at Brenlos answers (?) and theyre even worse than i thought originally.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Any eta on adding new elemental level LDoN armor? I am trying to<br />
decide whether to save points or continue purchasing upgrades.<br />
<br />
Hehe this is a nasty rumor going around. We do want to look at adding<br />
more items to the adventure merchants, but if/when we do it will not be<br />
elemental armor.<br />
<br />
Is this actually an answer ?<br />
<br />
2) Any more information on when we will see GoD legs/chests looked at<br />
for possible retuning?<br />
<br />
I would imagine this could happen after Omens.<br />
<br />
Yer so we're still none the wiser.<br />
<br />
3) Any plans to implement a guild alliance tool in order to improve<br />
comunication and coordination between allied guilds?<br />
<br />
Something I will pass along to the team.<br />
<br />
Woot the stock answer from anyone at SoE who posts on the boards.<br />
<br />
4) Will Research tradeskill ever see a trophy?<br />
<br />
Probably will not happen as it is a skill you can use training points to<br />
max the skill out. The team would like to have some reward though and<br />
will evaluate what that may be.<br />
<br />
Ooh nearly a definite answer.<br />
<br />
5) Will Resarch ever be updated to research current spells?<br />
<br />
Completely depends on the spells, and if we see a need for them to be<br />
more common. This probably won't apply to no-drop and ancient spells.<br />
(Per Maddoc)<br />
<br />
Is this actually an answer ?<br />
<br />
<br />
6) Will we receive new pillar spells in Omens? (They have<br />
been on our wish list since Kunark - you can find our old<br />
wish list from then on caster's Realm asking for some)<br />
<br />
Spell lists are not final for Omens so I really cannot say just yet.<br />
<br />
More non answering.<br />
<br />
7) Why does AA work on right clicks for shaman, necros ( ie thier dot<br />
pants can crit each tick), and every buff class in the game (ie their<br />
right click buffs, maelins methodical mind, maelins meditation, form of<br />
endurance and the like from time) lasting nearly twice as long. Yet when<br />
wizards right click a robe, we can not crit.<br />
<br />
I am not sure why this would be. I will pass it along to QA as it may<br />
be a bug.<br />
<br />
Woot another ill pass it on.<br />
<br />
8) Would like to know the possibility of having the buff<br />
timer on pet buffs. Would like to know the possibility of<br />
the ability to click off buffs at will (for pets).<br />
<br />
Buff timer is a possibility and I will forward it over to our coders.<br />
It might be something tied to leadership or an AA though (that is just<br />
me supposing)<br />
Removing pet buffs, I do not see happening soon.<br />
<br />
He's blustering again.<br />
Why not on the buff timers ?.Coding reasons or others ?<br />
<br />
9) Any chance of having voice graft added to our familiar?<br />
<br />
As it would require some code changes (familiars are treated differently<br />
in code than standard pets) it will not be happening anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Means we never thought of that.<br />
Why the hell wizzies would actually ask for this god only knows.<br />
<br />
10) What other zones are in the pipe for revamping (not in appearance,<br />
but for content), and will the majority be done similar to VP (raising<br />
the level of the zone) or simply changing the content around a bit?<br />
<br />
For now we are turning our focus to Omens of War. I would look for<br />
revamp announcemens after it ships. I think you will see a varied<br />
approach, some levels will be beefed up while others are changed to be<br />
more appealing.<br />
<br />
Revamp announcements :) Think he means revamping the newly introduced zones ala GoD :).<br />
<br />
11) Any plans to instance any old content? The emp in Sraa<br />
is quite annoying for smaller guilds trying to get into VT.<br />
His loots are decent enough larger quilds kill him alot for loot and<br />
smaller guilds have a difficult time getting people the rifts they need<br />
for VT.<br />
<br />
No plans at this time. It would be a massive undertaking though.<br />
<br />
Oh my god heaven forbid you do something that you couldnt charge us for.<br />
No wait it will probably happen in the future tacked onto an expansion.<br />
<br />
12) Any plans to reduce spawn time on older content?<br />
<br />
Not currently.<br />
<br />
We want big Timesinks and arguing amongst guilds etc so that you keep paying and playing.<br />
<br />
13) Any plans to change wizard resists in GoD? (Our only big nuke is<br />
fire but all the major bosses have high FR with low<br />
CR/MR)<br />
<br />
Not currently but it is something the team can re-evaluate after Omens.<br />
<br />
More bluster and fobbing off.<br />
<br />
14) Can they add a ceiling to zones they felt were exploited<br />
by Grav Flux and un-nerf it? (Grav Flux no longer fluxes you<br />
- it was nerfed to stop people jumping over walls in PoTime)<br />
<br />
That would require re-building the zones. We may do this when the zones<br />
are eventually updated to the new graphics engine, but it's not going to<br />
happen anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Didnt SoE say they werent going to upgrade old zones gfx with the new engine.<br />
<br />
15) Is it possible to add a raid option to the LFG tool, so that if you<br />
are waiting for a raid invite you can put /lfg on, and click the raid<br />
button in the LFG tool, This would allow you to keep the /lfg tag above<br />
your head but would not include you in the LFG list when other players<br />
use the LFG tool?<br />
<br />
Interesting idea. I will see what the guys here think.<br />
<br />
In other words i'll pass it along.<br />
<br />
17) What is the status of single player LDoN or similar type adventures<br />
<br />
None coming anytime soon. I think the task system in Omens may fill<br />
this role though.<br />
<br />
Forget LDoN thats old content buy the new improved shiny thing OoW.<br />
<br />
18) Where does the Plane of Sky stand on your &quot;list&quot; of<br />
zones in need of a revamp?<br />
<br />
We have not plotted out revamps just yet so please stay tuned.<br />
<br />
Keep paying and playing again.<br />
<br />
19) can you reveal any information about the Omens Task<br />
system?<br />
<br />
Not yet, but I think you will be pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
Hmm new expansion coming up needs to be brought by people yet cant reveal anything about it.<br />
In other words its not finished yet and we're not really sure what its going to be like :)<br />
<br />
20) Would it be possible to add a tradeskill path to the solvents?<br />
<br />
This is something under discussion.<br />
<br />
Bluster.<br />
<br />
21) Does Firiona Vie have any regrets over her breast<br />
reduction surgery? =D<br />
<br />
She had surgery?<br />
<br />
At least he didnt say &quot;whos Firiona Vie ?&quot; :)<br />
<br />
23) How does the team (i.e. Rytan) feel about some form of Group<br />
Harvest?<br />
<br />
No idea, but I will ask him.<br />
<br />
As its not a shaman ability you'll probably get it.<br />
<br />
24) What is the possibility of seeing Portals added to some<br />
GoD zones - particularly Barindu and Qvic (Reminder that<br />
Nexus was the only port at beginning of luclin and then more were added)<br />
<br />
It is always a possibility =)<br />
<br />
No chance.<br />
<br />
25) Lately there has been a lot of threads about<br />
solo-content. What sort of plans are there in the next 4-5 months for<br />
some sort of alternative for progression than grouping?<br />
<br />
The Task system! The system will be a fun alternative to grouping for<br />
players with short play times. The task system initially will be for players<br />
of 1st to 50th level, but wil be expanded to all levels after launch.<br />
<br />
Woot so nerf the **** out of solo exp everywhere then realise youve ****ed up but rather than admit your mistake reintroduce soloing but ONLY if you buy OoW.<br />
<br />
Thanks again Brenlo! <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Well then why should Elemental armor be in the Elemental planes? I mean you already GOT there, so obviously you can hack it right?<br />
<br />
And using your 'logic' everytime an EP flagged person &quot;slummed it&quot; in LDON they should put on those rags they keep around for &quot; old times sake.&quot;<br />
<br />
How about this sparky:<br />
<br />
I put in as much if not more time doing LDONs than you EVER will raiding.  While you have the benefits of a working, cohesive guild, I play &quot;pick-up roulette,&quot; often with people bearing your guild tag.<br />
<br />
So what you are saying in essence (and please feel free to correct me or give me a neg rep bum (LEST WE GIBES FEK)) is that <br />
<br />
YOUR TIME IS MORE VALUABLE THAN MY TIME.<br />
<br />
I call 'shenanigans' on that specious line of 'reasoning.'<br />
<br />
Oh and for those who think I am &quot;uber hating,&quot; perspective please.  As I have said repeatedly, I don't care what YOU have, I'm concerned with what * I * have.  You SHOULD be rewarded for investing time defeating tough MOBs and progressing.  But I should be equally if not near-equally rewarded for investing similar time dragging five knuckleheads through LDON's.<br />
<br />
<br />
Going to cut/paste the same thing I said in the wizard board version of this thread...<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Any eta on adding new elemental level LDoN armor? I am trying to<br />
decide whether to save points or continue purchasing upgrades.<br />
<br />
Hehe this is a nasty rumor going around. We do want to look at adding<br />
more items to the adventure merchants, but if/when we do it will not be<br />
elemental armor. <br />
<br />
This is something that's been discussed extensively on SKO  -HERE-. (http://www.shadowknight.org/forums/showthread.php?t=21945)<br />
<br />
Basically, adding new LDoN gear would be a good thing, but it shouldn't come from the current LDoN content (at least not normals, but really not hards either).  Better gear should require facing harder content, LDoN normals are arguably too easy for 1492 armor as it is.  Giving someone something better (say VT quality) for facing the same content is bad regardless of the point costs - it's not a matter of time, it's a matter of having gear appropriate for the content you're facing.  Someone doing normal LDoN's (possibly even someone doing hards) isn't likely facing anything that remotely warrents better gear than is currently available from LDoN and the bazaar.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not about risk, time, effort, or anything like that (at least not primarily) - it's about gear being appropriate for the content you face.  <br />
<br />
The fact that people with better gear can go back and do trivial content can't really be a factor - there's simply no way to address it in EQ, and you can't balance a game around people farming trivial content anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wulfbane<br />
<br />
I keep thinking Brenlos means the team will not fix or change anything before Omens.<br />
<br />
When will Omens release please ??<br />
<br />
Maybe we should let him know we will not buy Omens before he fix everything lol.<br />
<br />
Wing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">It's not about risk, time, effort, or anything like that (at least not primarily) - it's about gear being appropriate for the content you face. <br />

<br />
What a load of steaming, stinking, pile of elitist bull-SHEIT.<br />
<br />
So while I struggle with bazaar gear (O' thank you Ubers for allowing me your cast-off rags and baubles, may I wash your feet?) LDON gear (you don't really want a time breakdown), and TS items (oh please elemental planes farmers - may I spend money on your farmed items?)<br />
<br />
Raiders can come back, c0ck-block or farm BoT and other MOBs and sell the loot rights, all the while wearing their GUILD acquired Plane of Time and better loots,<br />
<br />
and I just have to sit there and accept that?<br />
<br />
Dude - get over yourself and quit being an apologist.<br />
<br />
How about you don't insult me with your idea of what is &quot;appropriate&quot; and I won't tell you to go fek yourself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">You already can get VT/EP level gear from single-group content if you're willing to put in the time to farm the intermediate steps.  With drops from LDoN hards, random quest items and drops from 1-groupable mobs, and a decently augged set of 1492 armor, you're sufficiently well geared for sewer and Vxed trials.  You can then farm those to gear up further, move from there to tipt, continue to farm vxed and tipt, and start farming KT.  And that's as a tank, which is more gear-dependant than a shammy.  <br />
<br />
GoD itemization (speaking strictly of single-group content) could use some work, I won't deny that - the quality of items is on the mark for the most part, but loot variety is lacking for some parts.  You can get appropriately powerful upgrades, but you can't always upgrade a great enough variety of slots.  This is something I've brought up in the past as needing changed - it would do a lot to help non-raiders - but even so, that option still exists for the non-raiding player.  <br />
<br />
That said, I have absolutely no problem with EP-level gear coming from LDoN content.  It just needs to be harder content than the current LDoN's.  You shouldn't get a 42ac/135hp bracer for killing mobs that hit for 250, regardless of how many of them you kill.  Impliment a new theme with harder mobs that require you to have geared up with the 1492 armor in order to succeed, and put elemental-level armor on the merchants there - I don't really care how much it costs, it could be 1500 points itself for all I care, so long as the mobs are sufficiently powerful to warrent elemental-calibur armor.  That's progression, and that's good.  <br />
<br />
Nothing faced by the typical player grinding normal LDoN's warrents elemental-level gear.  Progression is improving your character by facing harder and harder content - not improving your character for facing the same content an ungodly amount of time.  I'm all for progression for non-raiders - GoD did a lot for that, but more wouldn't be a bad thing.  <br />
<br />
And seriously, littering your post with personal attacks just makes you look like a dumbass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gotta side with Faern here. The player who CHOOSES to be more casual and raid less SHOULD have some alternate path to progress, especially given the difficulty of Gates (can we EVER stop calling it GOD, for Heavans sake?)<br />
<br />
The 2 most obvious solutions are LDoN Upgrades and opening the EPs to backdoor-quests flag/keys so the mini-mini's in there can be farmed for upgrades. <br />
<br />
NOTE: Neither of these solutions would bring the purely casual player even CLOSE to the level of even most mid-range guild Raiders. My server has 7 guilds Time+, and 4 others fully EP capable, and a couple others with RZ kills. EP (near, when FULLY auged) LDoN would NOT compete with the drops these folks are capable of getting, and would also allow raiders to selectively upgrade their own gear (I still wear LDoN legs with a BA4 aug for soloing).<br />
<br />
/derail off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Actually Blazz and Faern, if you read Slein Jinn's post, you'd see he agrees with you.  It's just the path he proposes would take longer and require SoE to add content.  He says, basically, that itemization should be based on progression, it's a good idea in principle, but the fact that SoE would have to add content to make it viable makes that idea unlikely to ever see the light of day.  I think that Faern does have a valid point in the cock blocking and bazzaar fodder from raiders, but that is a whole seperate discussion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casual and non-raider are two different things.  You can be a casual raider, even in PoTime, or you can be a hardcore non-raider.  The casual non-raider is naturally going to be behind in gear, but the hardcore non-raider has access to EP level gear from GoD content as it is.  It's a matter of having a consistant pool of people with which to group, and being determined enough to farm the intermediate steps - that's generally the same prerequesite faced by raiders.  <br />
<br />

<br />
30 LDoN's puts you up against content that's hitting for 250, all slowable, all low resists, all low HP - the content lacks power, regardless of quantity.  A raid in the EP's puts you up against content that quads for four digits unslowable with AE's, AE rampage, adds, etc. - content that generally demands a much higher level of gear in order to be successful.  The physical demands placed on a character by the content should determine the reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">30 LDoN's puts you up against content that's hitting for 250,<br />
<br />
When was the last time you did LDON's? They hit me (and others) for 388-392 max.  Sure, they're trivial NOW. They weren't when I first started doing them.<br />
<br />
I am sure the same can be said for those SOLOING in the EP's.<br />
<br />
Hard LDON's? Well they often resist Pacify, come in bunches (like bananas), mitigate slow, and oh btw the Charmable ones ain't snareable. <br />
<br />
Did I mention that LDON's are timed? <br />
<br />
Get over yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Zaniza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I currently have an LDoN Bracer: Dark Bracer of Rage:  AC:23  STR:9  DEX:4  WIS:6  AGI:8  HP:110  MANA:70  SVF:9  SVC5  SVM:3  SVP:3<br />
(Aug= +6Fire and an LDoN 40HP &quot;Glowing Sapphire of Courage&quot;).<br />
<br />
I still have yet to decide what to put in that Type3 Aug slot... I could have a BA4 item or FT2 item or 8% Dodge mod or Spell Haste 4 or ER4.  What ever I do decide, it will be a KICK BUTT Bracer.<br />
<br />
I get near EP hitpoints (i.e. 110 vs 135) and a Focus Effect of my choosing.  I also now have the added benefit of removing those Augs and swapping them out if the effect is no longer needed.<br />
<br />
I fail to see why it seems everyone is say'n this stuff is crapsor and sucks and not worth my time and we &quot;need&quot; better.  I'll be the first to cheer if better stuff comes out of LDoN but as it stands now, I still have a butt load of adventures to do just to get my next piece of armor.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that my bracer IS   &quot;near EP quality&quot; already!  And I get to hand pick the focus effect on it to boot!<br />
<br />
I guess my point is... no matter what you have or can attain in the near future, it will never be good enough.  It's human nature to strive for better and to dream/wish for what we cannot have or are denied.  <br />
<br />
Ofcourse the the other side of the coin is... if you never ask for it, you will prolly never get it :)</div></div><hr />

You are forgetting that there is one other factor. That type 7 slot in the EP bracer, where a +40 aug can go similar to the Type 2 one. This puts the EP bracer at 170 hps, which is pretty big against the 110 in the LDoN one. Even bracers from VT with 90-100 hps to start can have a +40 and be well beyond the LDoN one. <br />
<br />
I agree that the ability to design your focus effects around your slots is a nice bonus, but in todays world of Tribute, is it necessary anymore? Unless you are getting better focus on the items than you can get from Tribute (like FT4 on EP bracers) then I think that whole arguement is sort of moot.</div></div><hr />
