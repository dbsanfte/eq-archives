<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick Buff 3 and Spell Haste DO NOT stack...<br />
<br />
I am seriously hoping this is a bug or oversight, and hoping it is not just more SoE stupidity...cause it seriously makes NO SENSE.  This is not a question of two focus abilities not stacking.  This is One) An AA; and Two) A Focus effect.<br />
<br />
I understanded that Effects shouldn't stack, but come on....and ability + effect just makes sense....otherwise, some items or some AA's are just farking pointless...<br />
<br />
Someone tried to say there is a max spell haste....so I am guessing that is 50%....altho that seems really really odd, considering focus items don't stack, and I don't know of any 50%+ spell haste items....anyone have any evidence of this somewhere???  <br />
<br />
But then, even if there is a &quot;max spell haste&quot; I would argue that Quick Buff is infact NOT HASTE, it is a reduction of spell casting time for buffs...big difference!<br />
<br />
Now, I love my QB3, and I love my Spell Haste 4.  Guess I would just love to see the ability to cast quiessence in 2.55 seconds, instead of 3.0...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They do stack... but like you mentioned, the spell hastes cap is 50%, so anything you cast that's affected by QB3 will already be capped.  Thus why many people stop at QB2+item haste, which gets you mighty close to 50% anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Someone tried to say there is a max spell haste....so I am guessing that is 50%....<br />
<br />
<br />
This is, in fact, correct, sir.<br />
<br />
50% is the maximum spell haste.  Therefore, the quickest you could ever cast Qui is 3.0.  Note, however, that qb3 is for *buffs* only.  Qui counts as a buff; it gives you a buff icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">but it isnt haste is my whole point....really it isn't....read the AA description for QB, then come back to me...<br />
<br />
That's my arguement... Spell Haste is an INCREASE in Spell Haste...Quick Buff is a REDUCTION of spell casting time... Even tho the value appears to be the same in the end...meaning you cast faster.... it should be treated as seperated items, IMHO...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Melee haste caps at roughly 100%, which cuts delay in half.<br />
<br />
Spell haste caps at 50% which cuts casting time in half.<br />
<br />
Coincidence? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no, not at all <br />
<br />
cause melee can get upto 125%...<br />
<br />
And, Melee is offensive...buffs are defensive...<br />
<br />
I just want 65% haste for buffs.... or if you like 125/2 = 62.5% is fine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I suppose they could give Bards a 12.5% spell overhaste song or something...  That's what would be comparable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oh well, still missing the point...IMO QB isn't Spell haste, again... Nothing I say is going to change anything, but I really needed to vent this out...I mean come on, shamans really got shafted on AA's compared to almost every other class...throw us a fricking bone somewhere...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not missing it, just dismissing it. :p<br />
<br />
I've been pretty happy with the meager AAs I've been able to get so far.  Only thing I'd really like is a dot dmg focus aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Who cares?  Seriously, try to pick your battles -- while I agree there are some things with shaman that could use fixing, this isn't one of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Spell haste and QB do stack as mentioned above, maximum reduction in spell casting time is just capped at 50%. Be happy that QB is so powerful and applies to torpor/Q. Aside from buffs most spells can only get up to around 30-40% reduction in cast time with the right focus items and cleric spell haste. I think you are barking up the wrong tree on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">oh well, still missing the point...IMO QB isn't Spell haste, again...

<br />
Just because you want to nit pick the specific wording used in the descriptions of the aa's and focus effects doesn't change the fact that the most you can reduce the casting time of a spell to is half of the normal delay and thats true for any spell. It's fairly well documented and commonly sugguested that you stop at QB2 for that exact reason. Your Spell haste 4 item is still a very useful effect tho since it does cover a whole lot of other things that QB doesn't. This really isn't something verant is going to change and trying to argue it like you are just makes you look silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">they used to stack, torpor in 2.1seconds ... and my jbb used to crit nuke<br />
<br />
ahh the good old days =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is spell haste, for buffs.  Max spell haste is 50%.<br />
<br />
I don't want a bone, I want **** that's good for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just curious, does the Spell Haste cap include the Blessing of Reverence (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3472&amp;source=Live) line of spells that Clerics receive?  Has anyone done any testing with this, QB, and Spell Haste?<br />
<br />
Just noticed something interesting NPC Spell Haste? (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3079&amp;source=Live).  So that's why NPC casters always cast nukes and heals so dang fast....grumble grumble.<br />
<br />
And something like this (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4026&amp;source=Live) would be a nice addition to the shaman slow line of spells :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tobyus,<br />
You can't go below 50% period. That cap includes aa'(s), focus effect(s) and any buff(s). For a while I was at 25% from aa's (QB2), 18% from focus effects (earrings), and 10% from cleric spell and it still caped at 50%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Nit picking over some slight variation in the phrasing of the abilities does not change the fact that Quick Buff and Spell Haste have identical effects. Count yourself lucky that they stack at all, and don't spend the 9AA on QB3, stop at QB2 and spend the AA on more productive things.</div></div><hr />
