<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm in the open beta and so far up to level 10 I've been loving this game. My question for the long time beta peopl is how friendly is it to duo/trios? <br />
<br />
I dou'd and trio'd with family all the way to 65 pretty much in eq and much prefer it to pick up groups. We only played final fantasy for the free month because it was just too painful slow as a dou. <br />
<br />
Does wow allow you to duo all the way up at a decent rate? I don't mind being a bit slower then a group, but would like to be able to progres and do a good portion of the quests. I really don't want to get into another game where I need to play half the group just to get a group going fast which is what eq really turned into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm only 21 so I hope you don't mind me responding but from my experiences and everything I've heard you'll be fine with a duo/trio.  You can fairly easily solo to 60 if you want.  You might have to wait until elite quests are a level or two under you but that's about it.  I know instances become very popular and I believe you need a full group for that but you definitely don't have to do instances to get to 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You take a substantial jump in what you are capable of doing when you go from even just solo to duo.  Most any combo can work quite well.<br />
<br />
I duo'd my Hunter with another Hunter and it was just silly how much damage we could do to a mob with ranged before it reached us, if it even lived that long.<br />
<br />
Of course it's going to be variable depending on a lot of things like gear, skill, level difference between players and mobs...<br />
<br />
The one big thing where you will notice a difference however is Instanced Dungeons and Elite mobs.  You won't be able to do as much here due to adds/cc and the difficulty of the mobs.  Elite mob classification is that they are mobs intended for groups to handle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds really promising then, don't mind needing a group for somestuff just don't like being forced to group to get decent exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is no &quot;holy trinity&quot; like there was in Everquest.<br />
<br />
Any two classes can duo together and prove efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah i was about to say that penny.<br />
Last night me (warlock) and a mage and another warlock were raping scarlet zealots in Trisfal Glades. We had no problems. I am sure some crazy instances require healing power etc but outside anything goes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So far every combination the wife and I have tried works well together. Granted, our highest are only level 10/11, but so far we haven't found any situation that required having a specific class in the group.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there will be some limited situations later in the game, but that's to be expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Doing elite quests and instanced dungeons while the rewards are still useful and you still get ok exp will be the biggest challenge.<br />
<br />
When soloing I can still do some of those while the rewards are (barely) useful so it will be easier with a duo. It wont be easy though just easier hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My man and I duo quite happily with all the combinations we've tried, and if a friend logs on, ANY class adds a nice new dimention to the group.<br />
<br />
We usually grab some people to do elite quests, just to have them done earlier than we can duo them, but we've found - as was said above - that if we wait 2-4 levels, we can duo elite stuff that less experienced players will tend to only take with a full group.  Bosses present a problem (level 20, deadmines for alliance, as an example), but luck, planning, potions, and special items (e.g. bag of marbles) can bring you the win.  Which is why we usually just grab a group for a couple hours - more warm bodies will also tend to win it for you.<br />
<br />
WoW is much more forgiving of error, you don't have so many 'noob disaster' errors as EQ, like broken mezzes and training.  They're possible, mind you, but it's a lot easier for someone to remember to not hit the SHEEP, than it is a mezzed EQ mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">To do Dungeons and their quests while they are still level appropriate and a challenge you might need a little of that  Holy Trinnity sort of approach.  If you wait awhile longer to do them then yes you can make it happen, but with Elite mobs the exp. will get a lot worse for the effort once they are no longer &quot;hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
One thing that's good is that barring the higher end stuff which I have not seen any healer should be able to cut it fine... you don't HAVE to have a priest, you can go with shaman or druid also.<br />
<br />
I find that the way CC is handled has been done fairly well also.  There is no character that is the BEST at this.  Rogues have a degree of CC.  Mages can Sheep.  Sleep in it's original form is gone.  Druid's have Hibernation which is an animal based (beast/dragonkin?) sleep.  Hunter pet can off tank an add.  Warlock depending on pet ie VoidWalker can off tank an add.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sounds really promising, for beta my wife, brother-in-law, and myself are playing a warlock, war, and dru. So far its been a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My GF and I duo'd almost exclusively getting her warrior and my shaman to the level cap in closed beta.  We were able to trio many instances (especially at lower levels) by adding a druid into the mix.  We also found that a paladin/hunter duo was devastatingly effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In beta, I played a warrior, my wife played a priest, and my brother played a shaman.  We had an easy time with most stuff we did.<br />
<br />
Just duoing with the priest or the shaman, we did great as well.  I kind of even think that even 2 melee's as a duo would work well.  I haven't seen (at least in the early stages) any real strong need for a healer.  I'm sure that changes quickly though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I played a horde warlock to 13, and the few times I grouped up it was specifically for a quest mob that was too tough to handle alone, usually because of the adds.<br />
<br />
Twice I duo'd with a melee (rogue then warrior) and we killed the boss mob but the melee died first.  We didn't have a way to heal except for heal potions and healthstones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As a 25 rogue, I duoed alot with my brother, who ended up 26 warrior, not much we could not do. Even wariors have CC abilities, such as a shout that makes everything but the target flee for a bit. Rogues of course have sap, can gain aggro and tank well, especially if use evade, and can drop aggro using feint when they need.<br />
<br />
All classes so far appear very versatile.<br />
