<br />
Short of being yet another Shaman running around in Electric Pink hot pants give me a reason why I should buy LoY?<br />
<br />
B</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't bought it, and won't do so untill Sony shows some competence and willingness to fix bugs.  Therefore, I'll never ever ever buy it heh.  /boo Sony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i didnt buy it, and so far i dont see a reason why i should</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Veksar will be going live soon.<br />
<br />
For those who don't know it was a dungeon/temple in the the middle of Lake of Ill Omen and was going to be called 'Sunken Temple of Veksar' (still is). For some reason Verant back then decided to abandon it but with LoY they will be completing and releasing it. It's supposedly going to be aimed at high end players (no confirmation on last bit though).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">LoY is actually a lot of fun.  I'm not sure how fun it would be if I were level 65, but so far it's been really challenging at 61.  One thing I like about it is that &quot;rare&quot; spawns pop from the yard trash after you kill it, which is pretty novel and can take you by surprise.  Also the quests are engineered differently so that shortcutting of quests is basically out the window, and someone with a quest item from LoY is pretty much garaunteed to have worked at the quest from start to finish.<br />
<br />
There are also a lot of scripted events that are both challenging and fun.  A lot like PoP encounters they grow in difficulty as the encounter progresses. Good challenges for single groups.<br />
<br />
ps dont blind me with Hot Pink armor please .. there are enough halfling skittles running around already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The only possible advantages to to you would then be<br />
<br />
1)8 extra bank slots<br />
2)The cartography system<br />
<br />
The real question then is do you think those are worth the money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I bought it for the bank spaces (I'm a tradeskiller ~ even my new bankslots are all full now).  I ended up enjoying it though.  I hate the maps (probably because I haven't really figured out how to use them) but the bankspace was worth it to me.  <br />
<br />
I also like the zones though.  I really think they put the expansions out in the wrong order - I would have LOVED these zones when I was 60 and the only places to get AA were FG/Velks/DN/HS.  They are fun and I actually enjoyed the time I spent there to get the Pure Blood quest done for my cleric even though the mobs were green and light blue (with an occasional dark blue to 65 tossed in).  I think they did a great job with the expansion although I think it was a bit silly to have it come out after most of the players were too high to utilize it except on twinks.  Jen solos there a bit...nice to have a spot besides the evercamped ice giants where the cash loot is decent and I can get xp at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only get it if you need the bank slots or you don't know by heart everywhere you go yet.  I've yet to go to that area yet and probably never will.  I bought LoY for the cartography alone and was disappointed in its application.  Haven't bothered with the dyes and probably never will.  Save your money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can ride a cool leezord instead of a horse? ;) I have LoY but other than the bank space, haven't got much use out of any other features, except the lizard mount. I do like the lizard better than the horse, but couldn't advise buying an expansion just for that. In the end, for me, it boiled down to completeness. It's sort of like having a book series and missing one of the volumes. It's incomplete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Veksar will be going live soon.<br />
<br />
Will they give it to us for free or will it be added into another expansion? LOL I can never really tell with SoE. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LOL I can never really tell with SoE<br />
No, you can always tell.  They do nothing for free, we'll pay if they can find any way of getting us to do so.<br />
<br />
Lizard mounts are really gay, popular with the trendy crowd.  You know, EQ players who have britney spears and the backdoor boys playing on winamp, after they get home from school.  Stick with a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Agree with Jen that they should have released it before PoP...some really fun zones to wander in with decent loot off random named mobs mixed in with the normal exp mobs.  The bank space was a much needed addition (not sure we should have had to pay for it), the cartography system is useless really if you already know your way around, and the dye system should not be in the hands of the masses although it's very easy to use.  No advantage to lizards over horses except that you can avoid being forced to shrink or invis to get rid of those ridiculous ears.  Stereotyping folks with lizards is just short-sighted.  There's still plenty of blue mobs in the Crypt of Nadox, Torigan Mines and Hate's Fury at 62nd, although the exp isn't near comparable to PoP zones.  I've enjoyed exploring the new areas and haven't thought twice about the cost of the expansion.  If you like to explore then consider the expansion....if exp'n is your thing then doubtful you'd find yourself in these zones on any regular basis.  <br />
<br />
G'luck in your decisions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is really not one point, why you should buy LoY urgently imo.<br />
<br />
There are some &quot;nice to have it&quot;:<br />
- maps for the ones challenged with basic orientation (don't look at me here :D )<br />
- guild management tool (very useful even for non-officers)<br />
- bank slots, when you are a hardcore trade skiller. <br />
<br />
The other news are useless or near useless:<br />
- zones (at 64 they are useless for me personally, granted you may like them, when you are in exploring new things)<br />
- frogs (can someone exterminate them please ...)<br />
- dyes (pink trolls, nuff said)<br />
- charms (what a joke, they actually define useless)<br />
- new spells (very small addition, but kinda nice for low lvls)<br />
- LFG-tool (too big and complex, and useless, when not commonly used)<br />
- storybook (useless, though you may perhaps use it for other purposes)<br />
- journal (another nice idea in theory, but haven't found a practical use, OK am no big quester).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I didnt buy it, still think they should have just given us that **** for free. I guess if I was a low level I might have bought it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, Blood of Nadox is nice.<br />
<br />
And the charm slot may eventually turn in to something ... but I noticed some magelos of &quot;uber&quot; shaman with charms that looke dot me to be from the elemental planes - and they were just as useless as the charms that drop in Gunthak.<br />
<br />
all the threads on how useless stat buffs are, and we get charms with, yes, dex and agi and str and cha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">downloaded some maps to put in, and managed to find my way to turn in my skyshrine armor on the first try.  That in itself was worth the price of LoY.  Since my character slots are FULL of alts, that's not just 8 extra bank slots, it's more like 64 more bags full of crap I can accumulate!  =)<br />
<br />
Blood of Nadox will be useful, I know it will, though I've only used it once.  But the zones are entirely too low exp and the critters even hit my twinks too hard for it to be worthwhile.  The zones are definitely a waste unless you enjoy the exploration aspect of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I REALLY enjoy the new mapping system. I spent a week just making and updating maps. It's really handy for even zones you know your way around in. You can mark special spots or named camps or vendors and and what they sell. Really nice for dungeons; even handy for outdoor zones to get you from point A to B in the shortest possible time.<br />
<br />
LoY zones has a couple of fun camps and single group encounters even for level 65's if you enjoy that sort of thing. There is also LOTS of money to be made here if you want to farm equipment and the like.<br />
<br />
Blood of Nadox spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brettation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">its only $20</div></div><hr />

Other than that, I've used some dye, soon to be removed.</div></div><hr />
