Encounter Description:<br />
<br />
Nezekezena (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=6357)<br />
Phurzikon (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=6706)<br />
<br />
There is burnt-out area just to the west of the spawn-point of (-450, -2500). The spawn point itself is in a grassy area between the burnt-out area and a prominent (to me, at least) branchless tree trunk. By killing everything in sight in these areas, eventually the spawn cycle will begin. On an approximately 90-second timer, a PH, Nez, or Phurz will spawn. The PHs appeared to me to be anything that Illia's (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=77) lists as being able to spawn above level 40. From that list, these include:<br />
 An Ember Hornet A Forest Giant Ancient A Forest Giant Verdant A Greater Plague Skeleton Greater Plaguebone Greater War Boned Skeleton A Moldering Gorilla A Sarnak Avenger A Sarnak Champion A Sarnak Zealot A Scoriae Hornet A Tottering Gorilla A Wurm<br />
<br />
Having worked this camp before, the two greatest issues are control of the annoying green yard trash adds, and mana regeneration.  Bard Fear was very effective on all including Nez/Phurz, and magic-based DD spells landed well. (Fire-based spells useless, as you would expect.) As a solo or duo, mana regeneration in the 90-second interval can be tough.<br />
<br />
Plan on it taking a half-hour before we get lucky and trigger the cycle, then an hour and a half to get the drops. Red Wurm Guts are said to drop &quot;every time&quot; off Nez. The Burning Embers are rarer, probably about 1 in 10 from the reports I have read.  Reports indicate that the Nez/Phurz pop chance is about 1 in 4, once the cycle is started.<br />
<br />
The following is collected information that I cannot speak to first-hand, unless noted:<br />
<br />
Nez and Phurz can both Gate, and that if Nez spawns at a high-enough level can (chain) summon.  One Gate point is (+2700, +1000). Similar spawn points to the one we are targetting include (+2700, +1000) and possibly (+1800, -3700). <br />
<br />
I have twice seen Phurz paused contemplatively at about (-1000, -2100), then walked off to the NE (while I was waiting for Slixin respawns).  Nez/Phurz glow when carrying embers (ala Glowing Wurm Bile).  Nez and Phurz can both be up, and in multiples.  I have seen back-to-back Nez/Phurz spawns at the camp point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your support on this one!<br />

Itchy and Azero</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>itchyban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks to Dawak, Infinate, and Toddeth for joining Azero and me on a first run at Nez and Phurz. We arrived to find the cycle already started and being tended to by an enchanter looking for a piece for his mage alt. In about two hours, we kept the spawn cycle alive, with the PHs coming 1:20 after the last death. Kills were typically under 40 seconds, resulting in about 30 kills per hour. It was funny to see the MOBs attacking Toddeth even before their feet hit the ground...<br />
 <br />
8 Phurz, 7 Nez -- Gratz to Azero on his Epic piece, and a couple of Wurm Scale Cloaks to whoever looted them -- sorry, I wasn't keeping notes on that.<br />
 <br />
No Burning Embers :(<br />
 <br />
Oh -- I got a tell from said enchanter later -- he couldn't get Nez/Phurz to spawn at all -- a testament to our ability to keep up with the cycle -- thanks again!</div></div><hr />
