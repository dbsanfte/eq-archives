<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Domandred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">That bloody hammer that VI gave clerics is the bane of exp groups everywhere.  I can't tell you how many times now clerics are saying &quot;OOM&quot; then you look over and the reason they are OOM is because they were healing in between swinging that oversized crockette mallet they call a weapon.<br />
<br />
Sure a weapon like that in my hands would do some uber damage, but in their hands with their meager 1HB skill they are basically relying on procs for the damage.<br />
<br />
VI effectively made it so Clerics now think they are a Melee class.  Clerics forget to heal, are late on heals, complain about being OOM while they are standing fighting instead of medding, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Clerics - Do everyone a favor and put that bloody hammer away before you get us all killed.<br />
<br />
Until then give me a 58 Druid as a healer.  At least Druid's still sit and med.  Just insert a heal spell in place of their favorite DoT and all is well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I gotta agree on this, and I am a double mained ranger/cleric. I can't believe clerics are bagging their epics (+25 wis +100 mana and other goodies for those who do not know) for a hammer with only +5 wis, and either very little or no +mana, and +25 dex, as well as a couple saves I think. ***? A cleric's job hasn't changed THAT much....you're still responsible for keeping your group alive, and healing is your first priority. More mana means more heals, which means your group survives longer.<br />
<br />
Summoning the new &quot;pet&quot; hammer and sending it at a mob is one thing. Bagging your epic (or another high wis/mana) item is just silly IMO. Even with a &quot;raised&quot; 1hb and bash skill cap, clerics are NOT damage machines. They rely on procs to contribute significantly to a fight.<br />
<br />
I know level 56 Clerics who just got their epics and already are walking around with that cursed hammer in their main hand instead of their epic. When I earned Swiftwind, and when my cleric earned her sprinkler, that was a moment of pride. Something major has to happen for either to be pried from my hands (not including soloing on the Ranger and swapping in Swarmy for a few seconds, of course).<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp, of course. Some clerics prefer to melee over heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>clailya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Clerics have been soloing KC ALOT on tunare server. Granted this CAN be a good thing because when I die (i die alot- chanter) there will normaly be a clicky cleric in zone who will rezz me for free. The bad thing is they do get into groups some times and will go oom cause they are standing up banging on the mob.<br />
It is understandable for certain classes to go oom quickly. Take wizards for example, they nuke and alot of times they will get so much agro they cant sit down. Same with the chanter, I have to stand up before mezzes are broken. It doesnt matter how many times the tanks taunt, unless its rooted it is going after me, the wizard, or the cleric.<br />
<br />
Clerics just need to remember that their first job is to heal, melee comes 2nd. If you are having a good day and having a good amount of mana then sure- melee- but watch your darn mana bar!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">t doesnt matter how many times the tanks taunt, unless its rooted it is going after me, the wizard, or the cleric.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you need to get a ranger to tank for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I trio permanently with a cleric who has this spell/weapon and a lower level shaman for hastes and dexs.  Fully melee buffed the cleric dishes out a ton of damage with that hammer.  It hits hard and procs a lot (she has 230 dex, 70 more than me fully buffed!).  Our fight times are cut by a third when she melees.  The downtime generated because she is not meleeing is virtually null.  she keeps yualp v up at all times, so she is medding at half rate plus has a FT item.<br />
<br />
And since the shaman has no reason to be meleeing, he is always medding.  he can keep me healthy and everyone buffed with his mana whenever we are doing exp grinds.<br />
.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Now, I know my gear isn't exactly great.. less than 1000 ac fully selfbuffed and very low hp as well at 57.. but my pretty-well geared level 60 cleric buddy beat me in a melee-only duel with that hammer =\<br />
<br />
A lot of small/medium things were stacked in his favor, but nothing really huge. It was a lot of proc damage though, I'd easily pull ahead of him if he didn't proc for awhile.. but that would usually be met with a string of procs not long after bringing me back slightly under. :p<br />
<br />
granted, I had 2000 more hp to chew through, but hey..<br />
<br />
so long as the cleric is causing downtime by having no mana for healing, the cleric probably should be meleeing. with that yaulp thing they don't lose as much mana.<br />
<br />
The REAL question is, why the hell did clerics get melee stuff? I guess the paladin class isn't sufficient for a healing/melee class? :p<br />
<br />
I'm ok with clerics getting something after druids/shm got their big heal spells (not near cheal, though..) but this seems really dumb considering paladins already, you know, exist and stuff.<br />
<br />
In any event, it's fun if nothing else, and I haven't had to deal with risk of death from oom battlecleric... yet :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think cleric melee was an upgrade LONG overdue.  Playing a cleric 99% of the time is mindshatteringly boring.  Number one class to duel box on the box you don't pay much attention to).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If a cleric wanted to melee then they should have made a Palladin. I wanted to cast but didn't want to spend all my time sitting..... so I made a ranger. As for the new hammers.... this is TOTAL bull. <br />
<br />
1) Most clerics 1HB is laughable at best<br />
2) Even with yaulp v mana doesn't regen as fast<br />
3) Clerics have never been melee and as such don't know the rules. My best example of this was a bug group in Seb. Lvl 60 cleric that just loved her procing hammer. Procd like mad. She was taking agro. Not neccessarily a terrible thing except she also refused to stand with the other melee fighters so that the rogue could do it's BS. Instead she choose to always stand right beside the rogue. So you  have this mob switching back and forth between hitting the cleric and hitting the ranger and the rogue SOL.<br />
4) Clerics already have enough to make them valuable in a group. Yes... playing a cleric is boring. Yes.... playing a cleric is a lot of sitting around... big deal. Enchanters spend most of thier time sitting.... mages... wizards... shamans... druids..... every other pure caster spends alot of time on thier but standing only to cast. Does that mean that they should get summoned weapons of duplicate power? The pet hammer... Ok... nice thing to have around when things go bad.... but a cleric bieng able to melee is just wrong. Plate armor or no.. sit your happy butt back where it belongs with the rest of the pure casters. Want to fight? Start a pally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some Clerics can melee, and it's not about the hammer, it is about if they know how to do their job or not. If you have a good Cleric, then let them have the hammer. The problem is they are like kids showing off a new toy, and the new toy is just ticking the other kids in the neighborhood off because it's not as great as they think it is.<br />
<br />
I have a Cleric friend that melees with us in our groups, but, we never run low on life either, because she knows when to med, when to cast, and when to Melee. It's not the hammer, it's the people themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">But clerics shouldn't be melee'ing at all let alone with an uber weapon. Every other class that can melee and cast payed a penalty for that ability. <br />
<br />
Ranger<br />
Druid/Warrior. In return for many of the combat skills.... gets less spells<br />
Pally<br />
Cleric/Warrior. In return for some of the combat skills and plate armor they loose some spells.<br />
SK<br />
Necro/Warrior. In return for some of the combat skills and plate armor they loose some spells.<br />
Bst<br />
Shaman/Monk. In return for thier melee abilities and pet they in turn don't get as many spells.<br />
<br />
It's a simple forumla. In return for having a high damage output in melee combat I don't get spells untill 20 levels after the druids do. I don't even get many spells and spell lines. So... a cleric wants to melee... Fine... Penalize them as you do every other caster melee hybrid. Want that lovely little hammer with it's procs every other hit... fine... when you have that hammer anywhere in your inventory you loose spells. You get marginally better spells then a paladin of equal level. If your going to do it fairly then that is the way to do it. As for saying &quot;But a good cleric can.....&quot; Yes....a good cleric can...... but that relies on the cleric bieng good... and not all are. In fact... I know only 4 good clerics and 3 of those have ranger mains. The 4th just grouped with a ranger alot.... coincidence? The simple fact is that there was an order to things. If you wanted to be straight melee you got the melee abilities... you wanted to be a pure caster then you got the pure caster spells... you wanted to do both...... fine... but you can't do either as well as a pure can. So you have to look at why they where given the hammers... to make them more flexible in a raid environment. Anyone ever seen a raid without a cleric CH for other classes or no? When a cleric is looking for a group thier only real competition is a cleric of a higher level also looking for a group. So you want to start &quot;fixing&quot; classes with summoned items.... fine..... Rangers get summoned bows starting at 9..... rogues get summoned lockpicks.....druids get summoned scimitars..... shamans get summoned spears.... enchanters get summoned something or others.... Any other caster class can melee... it's possible... but if anyone that wants to melee well has to spend alot of money to get the weapon or gear..... Bone Handled Scimitar.... with that a druid can melee as well... 12/24... 1/2 rate.... very not bad... in fact.. better rate then the weapons I'm using..... but it's also prohibitivly expensive. Clerics want a great hammer to melee with... fine... that hammer should be the result of a hard quest.....make them kill every dragon in the game, every named giant in the game, and every god. When they do that... they can have a hammer. In the meantime..... giving a cleric a melee capability not only doesn't balance the game.. it in fact... unbalances the game. A charachter that wears plate, can melee, and heal/buff is a paladin. Make that description fit a cleric.... since a cleric has better buffs and heals..... and then why get a paladin? Clerics will always find a role in a raid because they have good buffs... good heals... and the ability to rez. If you want to always find a group.... you make a cleric or a chanter. So yes..... I'm sure alot of clerics like it.... but they don't deserve to be able to melee without paying a heavy toll on the casting side... just like every other hybrid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with you, however, the problem is this: Ckerics whine to VI about needing a group. VI gives them the hammer. Warriors ALREADY have Armor that can do just about anything BUT rez. It's not the fact that I wanted to play a Hybrid that got me where I am, and yes, the only clerics I have grouped with that were any good understood the fundamentals of being grouped with Hybrids, which is to say 2. Both of them regularly melee, and both of them aren't too bad at it. They don't use the hammer, one uses Dark Ember, but, hell, why not let them try it? Clerics still know they would get their asses handed to them solo, and Rangers wouldn't, so the hammer is like a mock from VI. &quot;Here little healer, run and play with your new toy then go running back to the Melee when that mean, nasty spider bites you.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well that would be true if that niftly little proc wasn't there. Not only does it proc... it procs often. I'm a ranger. I have a high dex and 2 lammys. 19 delay weapons with SCHW is 15. Both lammys have a proc from Call of SKy. I'm using 2 weapons with proc with a lower delay and yet ever cleric with that hammer I have seen yet gets more procs off thiers then I get with mine. Now if I have 2 weapons with a proc... and I hit more often with those 2 weapons... and have comperable or better dexterity... logic would dictate that I would proc more often... logic yes.... verant policy.... no. Yes I know Verant put that in because they like clerics best and because clerics make the most noice. The sqeaky wheel gets the grease and all that. And yes.... rangers are getting screwed. That is why I have stated many times that they either need to fix the class or remove the class.  Granted... if they removed rangers I would quit playing EQ but I'm about to that point anyway. The fact of the matter is.... a cleric with that hammer procing like mad can do more damage then a paladin in many cases. If they are going to get a good melee ability..... they should be penalized on thier casting ability.... if they are going to get alot of procs and uber damage from that hammer... they should be very penalized... and if that hammer is free to them except mana then they should be nerfed when they use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why nerf them?  the damage output is welcome in all the exp groups I have been in with a cleric with the hammer?<br />
<br />
What the hell does a cleric do in full US or even LS supposed to do in Velks?  Everyone is at full health, the spiders are slowed, the enchanter is pulling.  Clerics used to just sit there and watch TV.  Now they get to do something.<br />
<br />
Yes, Yaulp IV is not the same as normal medding.  It is 10 mana a tick.  Sitting mana is 20 mana a tick.  But if the cleric is not using the mana anyway, what does it matter?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, with FT items and AA points, standing med can be as good as the old normal med rate.  Yes you would still get more if you sat, but even then if you have the mana and aren't using it, why bother?<br />
<br />
Some clerics need to learn when to use the hammer, I agree.  If you are chain pulling nasty mobs the cleric shouldn't be up meleeing.  if the cleric is in a cheal chain they shouldnt be meleeing.  <br />
<br />
But for the average run-of-the-mill exp grind group, I want my cleric meleeing with pet, fully buffed by my shaman with str dex and haste.<br />
<br />
As for the procing.  Yes it is amazing, but I've never had an issue holding agro.  Even when the cleric lets loose with MoK and MoR and a 900 point nuke and has haste and dex and a pet I don't need to do anything at all to keep agro on my pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Again... your justifying this item by saying that it gives them something to do. You want something to do... play gems. If you have extra mana to burn..... rebuff everyone.... stun the mobs.... do whatever you like. But the fact of the matter is.... that in the game in order to have a melee ability you are penalized on spells. It is this way with all caster/melee classes. But clerics have been givin the ability to be a melee force in and of themselves without getting penalized on thier mana pool or on thier spells. Giving one caster/melee something that no other has is totally unbalancing. That would be like giving rangers all of the druids spells. Sure... we would have lots to do.... but is it proper and fair... hell no. A paladin is a melee'ing cleric. They are given weapons and combat skills and in return they have thier spells nerfed. If a cleric wants to melee fine...... then they can get thier spells nerfed just like any other paladin would. Furthermore..... this is a unique item. No other pure casters have anothing like this. So not only does it screw out hybrids it also screws out pure casters. The only person it doesn't screw are warriors, rogues, and monks. Verant's favorite or not..... this is a totally unbalancing item in regards to almost every class in the game. There are what... 12 classes... and that one item just screwed 8 of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Monk,  <br />
<br />
A paladin is NOT a meleeing cleric.  A paladin, and all other melee classes, are on different tables in EQ.  Different defense table, different offense table (I think different offense at least.  Defense for sure).<br />
<br />
Furthermore their caps and abilities are lower.  Given the same weapon and stats a paladin will outdamage the cleric hands down.  And will tank better to boot.<br />
<br />
I suppose you argued that when Wizards got their familiar that this was unfair/unbalancing to mages and necros (and shamans and beastmasters) since Wizards can port and the others couldn't but at least they had pets.  NOW the wizard gets both.  <br />
<br />
You can't compare two classes that have separate jobs in a group and say getting x makes y unfair because z doesn't get it.  You have to look at the class by itself and ask &quot;what would make this class more appropriate?&quot;<br />
<br />
As for re-buffing.  Right.  And why would I want to have my cleric waste more peridots just because they are full mana?  Why stun a mob that isn't gating?  Play gems.  What a laugh.  If you have to resort to playing a minigame within a game to stay entertained tehre is something wrong with the game.  This was Verant's answer.  <br />
<br />
It's not like clerics won't learn to be clerics before they start meleeing.  They still have to get to 56, so by then one would hope by then that they would know when their mana was needed and when they would be free to stand up and help melee.<br />
<br />
It's not unbalancing.  What IS unbalancing is a level 55 cleric not being able to kill a low green mob without using half of her mana.  All the other classes can do it without burning mana but the cleric could not.  With the hammer I don't have to help my cleric collect spider silks in EK or dire wolf whiskers in GD.  She can go off on her own and I'm free to go do my own thing.  <br />
<br />
How did the melee classes get screwed?  How does the Cleric getting below average melee skills affect them in the least (assuming the cleric isn't meleeing when the melees need heals and is oom)?  Why not say &quot;Gratz&quot; and move along?  Isn't it BETTER that the cleric can help you finish off that mob so you can move to the next that much sooner?<br />
<br />
Clerics needed an upgrade of some sort and a melee upgrade made sense in the classical D&amp;D motif, which is what EQ is based on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A paladin is a meleeing class with the spells of a cleric. In generalizing that makes them a meleeing cleric. Yes they are on diffrent tables with diffrent skills and diffrent spells even. Yes perhaps given the same weapon and stats and proc/proc timing a paladin will out damage a cleric but that isn't the case. As for the example concerning wizards no I never said that because a wizard familiar isn't a pet. It is a form of self buff. Furthermore I have already stated that I had no objections to the clerics pet hammer. You bring up jobs in a group.... what a wonderfull idea. Lets discuss those jobs. A clerics job on paper is to buff and heal and stun the mobs. In practice the clerics job is to cast a couple of buffs, heal and loot whore. You scoff my statement about rebuffing and again... I point out that not all cleric buffs require dots. You have either fallen victem to the classic cleric misinformation or a moron. As for which is the case I choose not to state which I think it is. Why stun a mob that isn't gating? To stop it from hitting. Most mobs in the game can be stunned. When stunned they stop running, stop hitting, and stop doing anything other then standing there. Concerning playing gems... if it was such a laughable idea then it would never have been reintroduced. As for clerics learning how to be clerics you state that since they have to be 56 to get those hammers then they will have already learned how to be clerics. That is so wrong I don't even want to get into pointing out the falacies with that thought. Yes it is unbalancing. I don't care what level the mob is a clerics job is not nor has it ever been to engage in combat. A cleric is a buffer and a healer. Thats it's job. In return for wonderfull buffs and bieng allowed to loot whore they get highly specalized uses. As for farming I don't care whether they can or can not. It doesn't matter. A warrior can go down to half health on a green mob and that is the same thing. Verant policy has always held that soloing is bad and grouping is good. A charachter not having the ability to solo has never been a reason to make changes to it untill now. How did the melee classes get screwed. First of all I didn't say that melee classes got screwed I said that melee/caster hybrids and pure casters got screwed. In case my previous post didn't clear up my reasoning as it apparently did not resulting in your post let me reillustrate things.  A hybrid no matter how pathetic thier combat skills and how laughable they are in combat still have the ability and in return they loose spells. It's a really simple concept. Want to do both...make a hybrid. By your own reasoning clerics still shouldn't have the hammer. You say it helps finish off a mob and yet you state that they can't do much damage with those hammers. Well if they aren't doing much damage with those hammers then thier mana and time would be better spent stunning the target so that it doesn't hit back and doesn't do damage to any of the people attacking it and just stands there and dies like a good mob. But no.... they do do good damage with thier hammer.... not because of it's base stats but because of the proc and proc rate. I have never seen a weapon that proced as often as those hammers and I doubt such a beast exists. If it does it is so expensive as to make it's ownership the domain of the very very rich 60+ chars. Not a free item that any cleric with the spell cost in plat and mana can cast. Clerics needed no upgrade no matter what EQ is based on. Clerics had a welcome place in most any groups, they could easliy survive while grouped, and easily get a group. That is more then can be said about alot of other classes with the possible exception of Enchanters. Enchanters, clerics, and warriors are 3 classes that are designed soley to work well in groups. That is the purpose of thier existince. The chanter is there to mez and charm and to buff the group and debuff the mob. A warrior is thier to hold agro and absorb the abuse from the mob so that it is 1) easier on the healer with a single target to heal and 2) allows the other classes that have less ability to take damage but a greater ability to inflict damage to come in and do thier thing. Clerics..... thier point ... thier role..... is to buff and heal. It's a simple job and one which clerics are very good at. All three of these classes suck at solo'ing. So why do they exist? They exist because the point of the game is grouping and socialization and within a group context they shine. Why should a cleric not melee..... because they don't know how, becuase they either do no damage as you suggest which makes them meleeing a waste of time or they do lots of damage which makes them unbalanced. Also a that is one more body facing the mob, getting in the way of the other melee classes, and forcing the mob back. Plus in a good group the tanks are the ones that gets adds and not the casters. They are usually sat in a place where they can't get adds... where they are nice and safe. Since in a normal group all heals depend on that cleric and since if things go wrong it is the clerics job to rez that makes thier safety a priority. The safest place happens to be not on the front lines but rather far far back from the action. Clerics are highly specilized classes. They do one real job and they do it well. If you want to do something else then make a diffrent class. Each class has it's own job..... What is a paladins job? To melee and do damage... to take agro on occasion... and for after and betweel battle heals and buffs. When you make a cleric with a melee ability thier job becomes to melee, take agro on occasion, and buff after and between battle and heals. If all those clerics wanted to melee they would have made paladins. If instead they wanted to be welcome in almost any group, to be widely sought in a variety of situations, and to be the medic that keeps the fighters alive... they choose a cleric. That is or was thier job. They where in fact given heals so great that it would raise them consderably high on the hate scale. Granted with proper meatshields and rangers in the group that doesn't matter because the mob will never go after the cleric but clerics where still given plate armor in order to make them more durable. To be long lasting and if it came to that... .to be the only group member left standing. By yoru reasoning then druids and other classes should get standing mana regen buffs and summoned weapons as well. Druids get some fine melee weapons that are dropped in the game already...... they could do a little extra damage for the group...... so give them standing mana regen buffs. God knows it's not easy for a druid to find a group as it stands. Sure they wouldn't do much damage with thier melee capabilities but if things are as you say then neither do clerics. In the meantime as I have said before... clerics only competition for a group is a higher level cleric. Complete heals for other classes or not. They do not need help in finding a group and they do not need something as powerfull as this to make them an even more powerfull class then they already where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Concept:  Enter key.  Learn it.  Live it.<br />
<br />
Your arguments are based entirely on situations where the cleric should be sitting on his or her arse medding.  If the battle calls for it I agree wholeheartedly.  However, my argument is for when there is no god dammed reason to be sitting and medding.  Try and understand that.<br />
<br />
Yes I scoff at your idea about &quot;rebuffing because I have nothing better to do.&quot;  It is a waste of mana that does not help the group by any tangible means.  Once Agleoism is up, what else is the Cleric going to cast?   Not every battle needs 4 types of resists up.  <br />
<br />
And even after all those resists are up (they hardly use any mana as it is) what then?  They still have full or nearly full mana.  Why NOT do some melee damage?   <br />
<br />
Stunning:  why in gods name waste mana on stuns on a mob that is tashed and slowed and not doing any appreciable damage to the main tank?  Waste of mana.  They could nuke, but nuking takes a huge chunk of mana.  You are the one wanting the cleric to be full of mana and ready to heal, so nuking would be counter productive to that, wouldn't it.  Besides, the cast time on those nukes are longer than the average lifespan of a spider in Velks.    <br />
<br />
Loot whoring.  I didn't know that was part of the job description for my cleric.  I should tell her this is an acceptable role for her to have.  She'll be quite happy.<br />
<br />
Gems:  shouldn't have been introduced to begin with.  Verant might as well say that some classes have a boring life, but here, play with this instead.  Why NOT give classes something else they can do instead of creating a pointless mini-game?  If advancing levels in gems somehow correlated to a slight increase to med rate, then I'd be all for it.  Afterall, you are &quot;concentrating harder&quot; on spell (icons) so it wouldn't be all THAT far fetched to give an extra point of mana per tick per 5 levels in gems.<br />
<br />
Why is it laughable that a 56th cleric know already to be a cleric?  A cleric, as you point out, is primarily a healer.  By 56 I would hope that they would have mastered the art of looking at red bars and clicking a heal macro when there is an unacceptable amount of red left.  It is true that there are still thing for a cleric to learn to do from 56-60.  C heal chain and whatnot.  Puller's personal healer on raids.  etc.  It is also true that there are some clerics that have no idea what they are doing and somehow make it to 60.  They are the tiny minority however.  Most high end clerics have the general ability of a cleric to be a healer and a damned good one at that.<br />
<br />
My point, which you seem to refuse to acknowledge, is what is a cleric supposed to be doing when there isn't any healing to be done?  Instead of sitting there medding for mana that is already full as you suggest, then why not contribute to the downing of a mob?  You say stun, but I say that is a waste if the situation is under control.  The mana used for the stun + damage does not balance to the mana saved from the needed heal for the damage the mob would have output.<br />
<br />
Their melee damage is not godly.  The weapon is damned nice and they can do significant damage with it, but it is by no means godly.  I have seen no parse data concerning overall damage done by a 56th hammered cleric vs. a similarly equiped paladin, but I doubt that the cleric would out-damage the paladin.  As proof I only have anecdotal evidence in that I group with a 54th paladin on occasion and when she is with me, the mod dies a lot faster than after my cleric got 56th and joined me as a full time meleer.<br />
<br />
If you have parsed data to support your assertion that cleric damage &gt; paladin damage, lets see it.  If true, then yes I will be the first in line to call for re-tuning of the hammer to fall into an acceptable damage output range.  But nothing I have seen supports your theory so I await your parsed data.<br />
<br />
As for soloing/farming it does matter.  It was ridiculous that an &quot;uber&quot; cleric was unable to gather his or her own silks/pelts/whiskers/skins/eggs without being drained of mana after a small handful of fights against mobs 40 levels their junior.  No other class had to deal with that.  Even enchanters could charm something and go on a killing spree for a lot less mana than the nukes required to kill in the cleric spell line.<br />
<br />
Summation:  cleric melee damage is not overpowering.  The output is not on par with a hybrid but is still significant enough.  It is a little embarrassing to be standing next to a cleric buffed out with haste and dex, but I'm content in my knowledge that I still out damage her by more than four times her melee output even if her damage is a lot more flashy and noticeable.  Exp grinding does not usually take a full time healer.  Spiders in Velks, shrooms in FG, Dwarves in EW.  None of these camps require an &quot;on-the-ball&quot; cleric medding every second when not healing.  They might as well be useless or the group look to replace them with another damage dealer.  Clerics having a hammer does not directly adversely affect your play experience as long as said cleric is intelligent and knows when to put the hammer away and med.</div></div><hr />

 As for loot whoring ... if your cleric is not a loot whore then she is in the minority.<br />
<br />
You say that that a cleric should be able to read a health bar and know when to cast a heal by Lvl 56 but the simple fact of the matter is that many don't. <br />
<br />
All pure casters are boring. Simply put that have to sit there and med. That is thier life. If you don't want to spend your life medding then you make a hybrid. If you don't give a rats @$$ about casting and just want to fight then you make a pure melee. If clerics wish to have a melee component to thier charachter then they should be penalized for it as are all other caster melee combinations. In emplimentation this is simple. When you have that hammer anywhere in your inventory you loose half your spells and the last heals you've gotten in the past 15 levels.<br />
<br />
Your class is boring.... Awww.. poor baby..... well lets mess up the entire game just to suit you. By your own admitance you have a cleric that is of suitable level to use this. As the player of a cleric you are biased. In this case that bias is making you blind to the simple facts of the game.<br />
<br />
I have pointed out the fallacies repeatedly and I grow weary of having to repeat myself in the hopes that it will soak thru your skull. I grow weary of having to argue the same points over and over because you seem totally incapable of recognizing even the simplest of truths. On the other hand I am dismayed to find one more moron greedy cleric in the game. <br />
<br />
Is it a great ability to have.. certainly... does it make gameplay more entertaining for a cleric... certainly. That is not a reason to completely change some of the basic principles on which the game is founded. Personally I would have great fun with my ranger if I could summon a bow equivilant to the thunderbolt or enchant my weapons with a proc that procs every other hit with each weapon. I would have alot of fun if I could nuke for 3K at level 50. But.... and here is the important bit so pay attention..... Just because it would make the gameplay of a ranger more enjoyable that does not mean that it should be done. <br />
<br />
Whether a cleric is boring or not...... whether they &quot;deserve&quot; a melee ability..... those are not the issue. The issue is that it gives them a power unique to the class and a power that no other comperable class recieves and is thus unbalancing. <br />
<br />
As for my use of the enter key..... if you have trouble reading it that falls under the catagory of your problem and not mine. Personally I hate people who only use 2 or 3 sentences per paragraph and make the message extraordinarily long to read due to having to scroll down every 3 sentences.<br />

This will be my last post on this message because there is no point in beating a dead horse... or in this case... pointing our the simple truths to someone incapable or unwilling to hear them. Good day to you all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you have been reading, I talk about &quot;my&quot; cleric in the third person.  &quot;I should tell her&quot;  &quot;she can do her own thing while I do mine&quot;.  Implication:  it is not MY cleric, however I am grouped with her 90% of the time because I usually only play eq when this person is on.  But *I* do not have a cleric, much less a cleric of an appropriate level to summon a madly-proccing hammer.  Therefore you can kindly take back your belittling statement about me wanting the game designed around myself.  *I* am a ranger.  I want double shot arrows, ae arrow damage, rain volleys, and 30k crit hits with arrows.  (That was sarcasm.  I think.)<br />
<br />
I still don't see how you can make the case that the Cleric getting nominal melee skills is in any way overpowering and/or unbalancing.  The melee damage is not reason enough to get upset over.  It's not THAT much damage.  The classic D&amp;D cleric could do useful melee damage and EQ is based on the D&amp;D system.  Not entirely but many of the classes and mobs and spells are.<br />
<br />
Your case is that no other pure caster can melee.  Fine.  The other pure casters have abilities the cleric does not have.  Mages and necros have pets that can outdamage player characters.  Wizards and druids can port.  Shammys get a pet, tho I have no idea on how useful it is.  I would guess not very.  Shammy and Chanters (another class with a near-useless pet) get slow and hastes.  Clerics get heals and buffs and resses.  None of which are unique to the class or even necessarily needed in many situations.  <br />
<br />
Clerics have the best buffs for melees, tis true.  But Agleoism lasts forever and a day so it only has to be cast once in a great while.  If the mob is under control, there is no call for healing.  Likewise, if things are under control there is no need for rezes.<br />
<br />
You can say the cleric is the best at those things and you would be correct.  However, being the best is not always needed.  What is wrong with giving the Cleric something to make them unique in comparison to the other classes?  <br />
<br />
Other classes:  can’t speak on mages, but I assume they do nuking.  Like wizards.  Necros DoT, Tap, share mana and can help with crowd control with charms and mezs.  Druids have DoTs and frequent buffs to refresh. (yes, I think druids should get some sort of limited melee ability as well.  In this case, yes I have a druid, but it was only created to port my cleric around).  Shammys have to slow and often debuff.  Chanters deal with crowd control.  Melees get up and fight.  Bards twist.  Every class in the game should really be doing something in each and every fight.  You said it yourself, EQ is about grouping.  As such every member should have an active roll.  Previous to the hammer, there were many situations in which a cleric had nothing to do for many fights on end.  My cleric and I got thru an entire night in velks doing spiders and there was only one battle where her healing abilitys came in useful  But that was because the chanter went afk and we had 3 mobs.  Slowed mobs, but the damage added up.  This was before she got the hammer so she worked on bash for most of the night, played with her pet spell and in general did nothing useful outside of a buff every 2 hours.  The group only kept her for “just in case” reasons.  She did get a bunch of silk threads, but I wouldn’t have called that whoring.    <br />
<br />
You have not proved your assertion that a meleeing cleric is unbalancing.  All you’ve proven is that no other pure caster class can hope to do as much melee damage.  SO WHAT?  How does it affect them?  Since you can’t answer that I guess that’s why you have “grown tired” of proving your point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kelliani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Monk, your posts to Dedolito are becoming quite insulting.

I'm trying to hold off the possibility of Sunmoon booting you since, so far, I've seen decent posts from you (before this one).<br />
<br />
I have pointed out the fallacies repeatedly and I grow weary of having to repeat myself in the hopes that it will soak thru your skull. I grow weary of having to argue the same points over and over because you seem totally incapable of recognizing even the simplest of truths.<br />
<br />
Let me remind you that your perceived &quot;truths&quot; are nothing but an opinion.  You &quot;feel&quot; that it breaks the game.  Assuming that your opinion is uncontestable fact isn't going to win you any converts.<br />
<br />
Here is a real &quot;fact.&quot;  People play this game differently.  Some people play with a rigid set of rules that they have decided upon and adhere to,  some allow some flexibility to themselves, and some even go further and do whatever it takes to do the job in whatever manner it takes.  Myself, I'm in the latter category.  Whatever it takes to win.  If you are not and want your groups to follow a rigid structure of play, that's fine.  That's your option to ask for.  However, people are not morons because they won't play your way and your way only or happen to disagree with you.  They are just people who are exercising their minds.<br />
<br />
I totally agree that any OOM cleric who is up and meleeing in the later levels needs to be set straight.  I totally disagree that a full mana cleric in an undamaged group should be parked on his/her rear end if they don't desire to be.  Hell, while you're on this crusade, why not go after shamans that move in and give a few pokes with a spear?  Or druids who go up and take a few swipes with a scimitar?  For that matter, why not attack me because I had my wizard meleeing one night in between nuking?  (/gasp)  Oh, the horror!!   Very few casters who entertain themselves in this manner are OOM.  Some are and need to be taught better; but the vast majority are effective to their groups, manage their mana properly , and are in no way obligated to listen to you screaming because they are having fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">LOL you people are incredible. My second char is a Cleric and I enjoy playing him as much as Tath at the moment. He doesnt have his epic and will not have for some time, nor does he have the magical hammer yet.

Its my choice how I play, its my dime, Ill do what I like. I have had no party members die on me from some fault of mine yet and I will do anything I can not to let it happen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The question is, if paladins are melee with heal spells, why give clerics some half-decent melee abilities (even if it is via procs.)<br />
<br />
Sure the hammer is fun, I've got to play around with it a bit.  Sure it gives the cleric something to do. But uh, last I checked clerics were wis casters, not melee.<br />
<br />
You can play your character how you want to. I'd melee for fun on my enchanter with a brawl stick and buffs out the wazoo. Did I do noticeable damage? Uh, well, I guess... max hit was something like 60ish, and getting 30-60 damage hits throughout a long fight is probably worth a % or two.<br />
<br />
Wis casters with their slightly higher weapon caps are better off, but they're still casters.  They cast. A level 60 druid with all his skills maxed has the same 2hb skill as a ranger of what, level 35 or 36?  That should say something.<br />
<br />
Ok, so verant gets around to decided druids and shaman need some substantially large heals (no, I won't call them complete heals, cause they're nowhere near it. :p) This infringes on a cleric's desirability for groups (both realistically as they're not as good compared to, say, shamen as they once were, and probably more important in an altered perception.) They decide to give clerics something to make up for it.<br />
<br />
At this point, were I verant, I'd be thinking &quot;hmm... what kinda spell should we give clerics.&quot; They are, after all, casters. I would not expect my enchanter to get any melee enhancements of any sort were something taken from his class (hell, bards got a GoK equivalent song, which makes them better than enchanters in a group in all situations except where you'll be expecting a steady stream of big pulls.. encs got nothing :p)<br />
<br />
Maybe, MAYBE if paladins didn't exist, and only because clerics have something of a history in the fantasy genre as occasionally being a meleeish type of person. In EQ, healing melees already do exist as paladins though.<br />
<br />
I really see no reason to give clerics or any other caster class improved melee capacity.  They already had it in a limited form, in a couple velious era procing weapons. The one off yelinak in particular (ok, it sucks a LOT, but hey) has a cannibalize proc to try and offset your lack of medding while meleeing. I don't know if this trend continued in luclin loot, as I quit back in december and have only been exping my ranger since.<br />
<br />
Myself, I would've given clerics something reasonably unique.. maybe a new spell line of three spells spread out over the course of a leveling cleric's life. Something that had a minor but nonetheless real impact on a group.. I didn't try to spend lots of timing thinking of something, but I dunno.. would be something along the lines of word of retribution maybe. Something that would help make you want a cleric over a shaman or druid, something unique to the cleric class.<br />
<br />
The whole melee bit seems to me like they ran out of ideas. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Qwexton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">4 out of 5 rangers prefer the cleric epic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I don't care if they use their epic or not. If we are all in control, and this has happened quite a lot in my groups, then I welcome my Cleric friend getting up and delivering a few whacks. Druids kite all the time, and I watch druids use scimitars to whack at the enemies, but, no one yells at them. Druids get bored too, and no one cares that they melee when they are at full, no one needs healed, and everyone has Spirit of Eagle up. <br />
<br />
So, why yell at Clerics? If the same case holds true there, why should they be medding when their mana bar is full? Heck, we can pull for my Cleric friend, yellow con mobs, to low red, at a rate of one or two at a time until she is down to 20M, THEN we have to pull white or blue cons while she meds. Until she needs to heal, and until she needs to med, she melees, and I think it's great. We only group with four people anyway, usually.<br />
<br />
Me, Two Paladins, and Her, maybe my Shaman friend. And then she really doesn't need to med at all because he can heal us first, and then he melees while she meds and heals. They trade off that way. So, when it's her turn to be up, why shouldn't she melee? She's not healing, she doesn't need to rez, and she has full mana, so, why med? It's pointless. Our Shaman has better buffs right now, for the most part, than her, because we're not level 50+ (I am only now 40, and she is a level or two below me) so Ageolism is WAY out of the question. It just causes more, unneccessary downtime for the healer, who is sitting there medding to full when she is already full. What's she going to do, get 200% mana? I wish.<br />
<br />
Play Gems? If I wanted to play something like Gems, wouldn't I be hooked into an old Nintendo, or a new Graphics Caluclator with Tetris? Or what about Columns for the old Sega Genesis? I don't think I would be in EQ if that was the game I wanted to play.<br />
<br />
Giving them a new spell line might help, yeah, which would be cool, but more than three spells please. Rangers get three Conjuration spells throughout most of their career, and look at most Ranger Conjuration scores. They suck. Mine doesn't, but most do. Heck, I have a level 40 Ranger friend (Only reason he IS 40 is because his new Guild leveled him, I'm not stupid) and I pull because he can't cast Stinging Swarm. Why? He never learned how. Now, Stinging Swarm has saved my butt dozens of times against close fights, but he doesn't have that option because he left out Conjuration. So, why should Clerics leave out melee? It can save THEIR butts, and WE need THEM for Rezzes, so, why would we want to risk them not having EVERY skill available to stay alive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I used to play a cleric at times in D&amp;D as well.<br />

They are not great fighters, but rather than sitting back healing all the time they get in the action too. its a fairly common thing in most Fantasy games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Siriath you give the example of a druid kiting and it getting up and whacking the mob a few times and no one is complaining. Well that really isn't a fair example and here is why.<br />
<br />
1) Druids have to purchase thier scimitars and a good one is very expensive. Clerics just have to use 250 mana when they log on to get thier hammer.<br />
<br />
2) Even the bone handled scimitar which is argueably the best purchasable non no drop druid available scimitar is only 12/24 with a few stat buffs and costs around 5K to purchase. The cleric hammer on the other hand has a few buffs, decent rate, and all that but the part that makes this so diffrent from other weapons and trivializes any comparison to druid weapons or shaman weapons is the proc. Not only is it a powerfull proc that does a fair bit of damage, but it was designed to be a &quot;high frequency proc weapon&quot;. If that proc wasn't there or proc'd as often as most procs do then I wouldn't have a problem with it. However when equipped and with the use of Yaulp V which has a significant dex buff on it and combined with this &quot;high frequency proc weapon&quot; it combines to make a cleric capable of inflicting massive damage on a mob.<br />
<br />
As I have said many times before... there already was a melee class with heals. Those where paladins. The paladins are pretty weak in combat for the most part and in return they where given good healing spells and the ability to rez.<br />
<br />
Give a cleric a hammer .... Ok fine<br />
Give a cleric a hammer that they don't have to quest or buy and is a weapon with good rate and stats..... ummm... I guess.<br />
Give a cleric a hammer that they don't have to quest or buy that procs ever other hit and has a powerfull proc......Ok now you've gone to far.<br />
<br />
Your arguements always come back to two key points. First that the life of a cleric is a boring one. Second that other casters can melee if they choose to. These points by themselves are true. However if an enchanter chooses to melee it has to go and purchase AC gear, purchase a weapon, purchase a haste item, and various other things. If a druid wishes to melee then it has to purchase a scimitar, purchase a haste item, purchase some AC gear.... and purchase crack because druids weren't given the handy dandy little standing mana regen buff that clerics where upon the introduction of this hammer. You give the example of the druid but it isn't a fair comparison because even a decent druid melee weapon is expensive. And no matter the cost, rarity, or otherwise I don't believe there exists any weapons which proc as often as this hammer does. <br />
<br />
The hammer itself I have no problem with them getting. Standing mana regen buffs... still no problem there. Getting an ungodly powerfull proc that procs every other hit is where you get into the &quot;bend over and get ready for it&quot; area because that proc alone is totally unique and makes clerics a melee class in and of themselves.<br />
<br />
Another reason for this to be such an odd thing is in it's nature as a summoned hammer. Clerics get the following summoned hammers currently... not including anything preported to be released in PoP which isn't out yet<br />
<br />
Lvl 56 Hammer of Judgement - Mana cost 250<br />
Lvl 58 Hammer of Divinity - Mana cost 250<br />
Lvl 60 Hammer of Souls - Mana cost 250<br />
<br />
Now if you look at these hammers compared to the other summoned weapons you can see some inequality to begin with. Mages can summon a dagger that is magic, no stats, bad rate. This item is good for arming your pets with at low levels. Paladins have always been able to summon hammers starting at Lvl 15 with Hammer of Wrath 6/32. However these items to have poor rates and no procs (let alone a high frequency one) and as such is good for arming yourself for a corpse recovery and thats about it. Then clerics come along and supposedly need a new thing that makes them unique. So they get a hammer. Hammer has a proc that loves to proc. That proc by itself will get them agro and it loves to proc which thru the proc alone does significant damage. This has the effect of making clerics a plate wearing class with superb heals and buffs that after Lvl 56 have a true melee capability. Also the spells are not drops, or researched, or quested or anything else and are in fact readily available at vendors for a marginal amount of plat.<br />
<br />
Now again .... you made the example of the druid. Well lets look at this closer and see some diffrences between the two<br />
<br />
Cleric - plate class<br />
Druid - leather class<br />
<br />
Cleric - standing mana regen buff<br />
Druid - Has to find a enchanter to give them Breeze/Clarity/C2/KEI<br />
<br />
Cleric - Low mana cost summoned hammer with a proc every other hit<br />
Druid - Bone Handled Scimitar 5K with 1/2 rate a couple of buffs and no proc.<br />
<br />
Cleric - Wanted in any group that doesn't already have a cleric or is getting a higher level cleric<br />
Druid - Many deem a waste of a group slot and even with thier improved healing spells and the nerf on thier healing spells removed have an almost impossible task finding any job in a raid other then porting beforehand and giving everyone SoE beforehand.<br />
<br />
These points taken singly should be enough to point out the disparity in comparing a druid whacking a mob with it's scimitar and a cleric summoning this hammer. <br />
<br />
Now I have said all these things many times before but some people still haven't seen the truth of the matter so I will continue. A Paladin is by it's nature a melee/caster hybrid that wears plate and in return for getting some spells looses many of the skills a warrior has. Also in return for getting some of the melee ability they loose out on many of the spells available to thier parent the cleric. Now granted... it is true that a similiarly equipped paladin can do more damage then a cleric but that is a mote point because there are no weapons available to a paladin with the proc and extraordinarily high proc rate of this summoned cleric hammer. They are items totally unique in the world and with it a cleric becomes in practice a hybrid without the hybrid penalties on spells. <br />
<br />
Now without this proc the hammers are a fine thing for a cleric and I have no problem with them recieving. But with that proc they become a plate wearing, heal and buff casting, melee class with no spell penalties and thier own buffs for dex and standing mana regen. <br />
<br />
Well lets look at the companion of the hammer and it's proc. That would of course be the new Yaulp spell.<br />
<br />
Yaup V Lvl 56 Cleric Spell<br />
Actual Effects: Self: Increase ATK (50) <br />
  Self: Increase Dex (75) <br />
  Self: Increase Attack Rate (25%) <br />
  Self: Increase Mana Regeneration (10 per tick) <br />
<br />
This spell is in and of itself is a class defining spell because only Clerics and Paladins get it and at Lvl 56 a Paladin only recieves<br />
<br />
Yaulp III<br />
Actual Effects: Self: Increase Strength (30) <br />
  Self: Increase AC (12) <br />
<br />
Now to this point only enchanters and bards are given any form of mana regeneration buff. So if a pure caster such as a druid, or a wizard, or a mage, or a shaman, or a necromancer wishes to stand and battle they have to first get a buff from a enchanter or have a bard in the group playing mana song. Lets look at the other effects of Yaulp V. Increases atk power by 50. This by itself will make a cleric hit harder.... increase atk rate 25%... makes a cleric hit faster..... Increases Mana Regeneration 10 per tick. An enchanter.... a class primarly known for thier mana regeneration buffs cannot cast a 10 point per tick mana regeneration spell... self or otherwise..... untill Lvl 60.... when they can either pay 100K for the spell or go and defeat Vex Thall. Untill Lvl 60 a enchanter can only offer a 7 point per tick mana regeneration buff self only or otherwise.<br />
<br />
Now when you combine this spell which is unique to them with the hammer which is also unique.... with the proc and proc rate which is not only unique to them... it's unheard of....... This makes a cleric a melee'ing force in and of themselves. <br />
<br />
Now when a person is making a charachter they have to make some decisions. One of which is what kind of spells and how many spells they want to recieve. If you want to cast... then you make a pure caster. If you want to melee then you make a pure melee. If you want to do both then you make a hybrid. This is a simple to understand and logical system upon which has stood the foundation of classes in Everquest. In return for a melee capability and the ability to inflict a large amount of damage on a target in melee combat a person must also loose many of the spells that the parent pure caster would get. The spells that hybrid does recieve are recieved several levels higher (20 levels higher seems to be average from my observation of druid/ranger spells but that is not a hard and fast gaurenteed number) <br />
<br />
This principle should be well known to everyone here as this is a message board and website devoted to one such hybrid. We should all know for a fact the penalties in spells that come with out ability to inflict damage in melee combat. Previously this was a well understood principle that everyone understood and acknowledged. However now Verant has decided that clerics should be able to melee and do a large amount of damage in melee combat. Furthermore in order to aid this ability they have given clerics a very powerfull buff which allows them to stand and fight rather then sitting. Not only is there now a plate wearing melee class that can do large amounts of damage and get large amounts of agro but that same melee class also has every single one of the spells that a pure caster would get because they are in fact pure casters. Not only has Verant not penalized a clerics casting ability in order to give them a melee capability they have quite the opposite given them new spells to AID in the ability to do so. This also is unique.<br />
<br />
Previous to this if you wanted to be a melee that could heal and buff you made a paladin. Personally I think that paladins suck but that is my own personal opinion of the class and I hold nothing against paladins. But now you can be a class with a large damage/agro output that can do large amounts of melee damage and yet still have all the spells of a pure caster. This also removes the worth of a paladin in a Post 56 environment. <br />
<br />
So it has been asked why I feel this is unbalancing and I will again give my reasonings for making that statement<br />
<br />
-Trivializes an entire class in a post 56 environment<br />
<br />
-Gives a hammer that is cheap and effective and easliy available<br />
<br />
-Gives standing mana regeneration that is not only superior to what an enchanter of comperable level can give but also to the best of my knowledge stacks with the enchanter Clarity/C2/KEI.<br />
<br />
-Has a proc with a proc rate that is totally unheard of in any other weapon available to any other class.<br />
<br />
-These are given while no penalities to either spells or casting ability and mana pool are assessed<br />
<br />
-These things where given to make up for a loss of place that was more imagined then real existing in the cleric class.<br />
<br />
Now that last statement may not be agreed upon by all but lets review it. Clerics are still the best healers in the game. Clerics still have the best rezzes and at an earlier level then any other in the game. Clerics are still the only pure casters that are allowed to wear plate armor. Clerics are still capable of finding a group in almost any group unless said group already has a cleric or has one on the way that is of a higher level then the cleric looking for a group. Nothing really has changed for the clerics.... they are still the best at what they do.<br />
<br />
Now some have said that this makes a boring class slightly less boring. All pure casters are boring. Stand-Cast-Sit. It is the penalty assessed for the superior spells pure casters get over hybrids. Just because a class is boring to play has never been considered a reason to make drastic changes in that class.<br />
<br />
Some have said that these hammers are warrented because it allows a cleric to solo. Again..... bieng able to solo has never ever been a reason to make a drastic change to the class. Verant policy has always been... put simply..... that soloing is bad and grouping is good. Many classes have trouble soloing no matter what the con of the mob. Many still do.<br />
<br />
Lastly... why this discussion is taking place on a message board devoted to the ranger class..... I will state my opinions on the subject. These are not facts as opposed to the rest of what I said and merely my own opinion.<br />
<br />
Clerics have always been able to find a group fairly easily while rangers have not. Clerics have an identity and something that makes them unique while rangers do not. A person stated that Clerics untill the advent of these hammers couldn't solo a green without going to half mana and that that is a reason why they should be given it. Well I am a ranger. If I was wearing the best armor I could loot and get a group to loot that would make me a Lvl 50 Ranger wearing Ry'gorr armor. In that armor with weapons that I could loot or get a group to loot I would go to half health or lower fighting a green mob and would even die to a green mob depending on which mob. Even in gear that I couldn't possibly loot on my own or get a group to loot without the aid of some high level friends that took pity on a 50 ranger in ry'gorr I wouldn't have any of this stuff I currently do. Having said that I still get creamed by greens very often. Giants, dire wolves, and various other things. Most seem to agree that there are ALOT of changes needed to the ranger class..... and instead verant is making a powerfull and greatly disired class even more powerfull.<br />
<br />
Now I said before that I had given up but unfortunatly I logged on today and decided to read the new messages and was shocked to see others trying to use arguements that I had already pointed out as not fit for comparison. So I have decided to give it another go and see if I can show some people the errors of thier thoughts and reasonings. Let me know if this phrase rings any bells &quot;This forum is not moderated at all.. you are warned!&quot;<br />
<br />
PS: I have yet to attack someone. Furthermore this is an unmoderated section to allow people to speak thier feelings. Now if I should actually begin to attack him.... using deragatory remarks about a person then I may.... MAY...... feel that a moderator would be justified in warning me to &quot;watch it&quot; However as yet I have limited myself to making comments on some peoples opinions and that is not a personal attack.<br />
<br />
PSS: Make all the references to D&amp;D you like..... when you log into the game do you see anywhere the name D&amp;D? No. You instead see Everquest. This game may have been originally based on many of the concepts that D&amp;D was based on but that was a long time ago and since then Everquest has evolved and grown and is now a game in and of itself. Just because something existed in D&amp;D does not justify something existing in Everquest. That would be like justifiying something in Everquest by pointing out that it exists in DAoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Monk,<br />
<br />
The crutch of your argument is centered on 2 facts.  <br />
<br />
1) Paladins already exist, therefore a meleeing cleric &quot;screws&quot; them.<br />
<br />
2)  Other casters can't melee so clerics shouldn't either<br />
<br />
I ask again, despite your long winded answer, SO WHAT?<br />
<br />
The cleric, despite the uber proc rate, will not outdamage a paladin of similar level and a level-appropriate weapon.  My proof?  Mobs die much faster while exp grinding when my lower level (than the cleric) paladin friend is fighting than when the cleric is fighting.  <br />
<br />
I exp grind dwarves in EW when I’m looking for safe exp.  Solo, I have to reapply snare (I pull with my guants) halfway thru the battle.  With the Cleric (56th) meleeing now (with pet, and mark of ret. up as well, plus dex and haste from a shaman) the snare runs out when the Dwarf is down to his last bubble.  With the Paladin (54th) meleeing (and the cleric sitting out) the snare does not run out and the Dwarf dies before I have to reapply it.  <br />
<br />
Therefore a meleeing cleric is not unbalancing to the paladin class.  You say the damage dealt by the cleric's weapon is obscene.  I disagree with that.  If my output is 4 times my clerics output, and the paladin’s is roughly twice the output, I cannot possibly believe the cleric's damage is obscene, even if the Cleric is lighting up the mob like a 4th of July display.<br />
<br />
Your second point, &quot;no one else can do it, so why should they?&quot; in itself a counterproductive argument.  If no one ever got an ability that was new, there would be no new content to the game.<br />
<br />
As rangers, we didn't have /trueshot, EQ or AM3.  Suddenly we did.  Traditionally, Verant had taken the stance that archery was not, and never would be, a primary mode of damage.  It is a well-documented fact that the original dev teams (or at least Abashi) were vehemently against archery ever becoming anything more than a toy and pulling tool.  Then we get all the archery upgrades.  Something that was OUTSIDE THE ORIGINAL SCOPE OF THE GAME.  OMG.  NERF IT NERF IT.<br />
<br />
Please.<br />
<br />
So what if the cleric's new melee ability is outside of the game's original scope, IT ISN'T HURTING ANYONE. <br />
<br />
Despite your lengthy spell analysis and diatribe on various class abilities you have yet to show how a meleeing cleric adversely affects any particular class or player.  It's NEW. Yes.  It's DIFFERENT.  Certainly.  It's unbalancing and is going to ruin the game!  Most definitely not.  <br />
<br />
Then you have all the little side points trying to point at how the hammer is unfair.  You used the druid scimitar at 5k as an example.  Are you saying because something costs money for one class it’s unfair that another might be able to get it for free?  That sounds more like jealousy than anything else.  And 5K?  Big deal.  That’s not exactly a large sum of money for an item that you describe as being the best available non-no drop weapon for a druid.  Druid can head over to RM and quad kite hill giants for a few nights and come back with that kind of cash and then some.<br />
<br />
 That proc by itself will get them agro and it loves to proc which thru the proc alone does significant damage. This has the effect of making clerics a plate wearing class with superb heals and buffs that after Lvl 56 have a true melee capability. Also the spells are not drops, or researched, or quested or anything else and are in fact readily available at vendors for a marginal amount of plat.<br />
<br />
They may wear plate, but they are not a tank.  The defense table that they are on make them a terrible choice to tank.  Furthermore, I have never had a problem holding agro on my pull even if the cleric is meleeing with haste and dex 220+.  I don’t taunt and the cleric doesn’t get hit.  I don’t do anything different than I did before she got the hammer.  I don’t know what weapons your groupmates have been using but mine are substandard for my level (58) and yet agro is not an issue, even if the cleric casts high agro spells at the dwarf during the pull.<br />
<br />
Then we have more of your druid/cleric comparisons.  You conveniently neglect to mention the druids have excellent dots that work across the board where the clerics have a few undead-only dots.  In terms of being able to contribute to most battles, the druid contributes much more with DoTs and other battle spells than a Cleric could hope to do in a well-handled fight. <br />
<br />
I would go on, but the rest of your argument makes a mountain out of a mole hill.  A cleric is not a melee force to be reckoned with.  They have a much welcomed damage add-on to the group’s overall damage that costs no mana and thus keep them ready to heal if needed.  You are not going to see Clerics flat melee soloing blue mobs for exp because they will a) not be able to take the hits and b) the relatively low melee damage output will make attempting to melee an exp giving blue mob to death an exercise in extreme patience.<br />
<br />
The one and only agreement I have with you is that the hammer spell is too easy to obtain.  I only know of the 56 hammer as I have not looked at the others yet, but purchasing it off a vendor for a handful of plat was silly.  It should have been a relatively rare spell drop off a relatively tough mob, giving it a market price of about 5 to 8k.<br />
<br />
And I’m still awaiting an apology for your incorrect and belittling statement about me wanting to have EQ centered on “my cleric.”  In addition, it was not I that reported you to a mod, but you were getting abrasive in your previous posts.  How is calling someone a moron not a personal attack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">anyone disagree with my post? It sorta got eclipsed, I'm feeling shafted ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Noggel, <br />
<br />
I gave your post a lot of thought.  I've been trying to imagine a spell or ability that would give Clerics more utility other than the melee ability.<br />
<br />
I haven't really come up with much that would add to their usefulness in exp grind situations, something they could do at least once a fight that actually makes a difference.<br />
<br />
The closest I could come up with was undead mezes, but it seemed kinda silly to me for a cleric to have the ability.  Undead DD and DoT they already have, and they are not used very often.  Wouldn't make sense to give them charm/mez undead, that's necro territory.  Maybe an AA exorsism kill (insta undead kill on mobs 45 and under?), but again, where's the day-to-day utility?<br />
<br />
I thought going melee was a good choice given that a cleric in a fantasy world was often endowed with a decent fighting ability.  As long as they cannot do more damage than a level-appropriate equipped paladin i thought it was an appropriate change given the choices.  More heal power or more anti-undead power wouldn't add anything to the class imho.  Something new was needed to breath life into the number 1 botted class in Norrath.  Giving them melee was a good way to fix that.<br />
<br />
As it was pre hammer, I would choose a shaman over a cleric as a duo partner any dy of the week.  Same goes for most grouping situations unless the raw heal power of the cleric was really needed (which it is not in all but raids and really tricky exp grinds).  Despite the wonderfulness that is Agleoism, I'd rather have my self buffs and shammy ac/hp buffs as well as his haste, dex, and str buff.<br />
<br />
Now, with the hammer, it depends on the situation I am in if I would perfer the shaman over the cleric or the cleric over the shaman.  I think that is a reasonable and desireable outcome form the change.  Both classes now have a selling point to me, and I have to choose which is better for the given camp (which is why i duel box a shaman so i can have both! =P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Dedolito there are so many falsehoods in your arguement that at first my impulse was to deign to answer them and walk away. But here goes anyway<br />
<br />
First you give some vague examples of something, of what exactly I'm not sure because it didn't make any sense except that I think you where refering to grouping with each class since they haven't given clerics snare..... yet.<br />
<br />
You say that just because a ranger can outdamage a cleric that that makes it Ok.  Thats like looking at the aftermath of a killers rampage and saying &quot;Gee... blood is sticky&quot; You didn't just miss the point you missed the gist, the line of reasoning, the point, the thrust, and I'm not even sure your on the same topic anymore. If you where the Air Force you would have just bombed that embassy.<br />
<br />
Sure a specific ranger.... YOU.... may... MAY... be able to do 4 times as much damage then the cleric but so what? Rangers can do twice as much damage as a warrior and 4 times as much as a pally. I say may because you offer no logs (not that I would believe anything from you at this point without a notary publics seal) No parses, No listing of weapons used, no names of these supposed people, no levels, no equipment lists.<br />
<br />
Next you give the example of rangers getting Trueshot, EQ, and A3. That again is totally missing the point. <br />
<br />
Trueshot is a discipline.<br />
Duration: 2 minutes. <br />
Re-Use Delay: 72 minutes. <br />
Re-Use Delay at Level 60: 67 minutes. <br />
<br />
Endless Quiver is a passive AA skill that merely gives you more arrows.<br />
<br />
Archery Mastery Lvl 3 just gives 9 extra points in damage.<br />
<br />
Both EQ and A3 are as I AA abilities requiring both Lvl 55 and a extremely significant amount of time invested in earning enough AA points to aquire these things. One is a discipline that you can only use every 72 minutes. Quite a long time. The other 2 require a massive amount of AA points to have been accumulated. For a cleric to get the first hammer it needs only to hit Lvl 56 and purchase the spell. Once purchased they can use the hammer as many times as they want, whenever they want, and can use it for as long as they want. This alone provees your arguement to be incorrect.<br />
<br />
However assume for a second that none of those facts existed as I'm sure you well. Even then you would still be wrong because adding those to the rangers was not a fundamental change in the nature of the game. Rangers are seen by many to be bow weilders.... thats our thing... our gig.... what we get criticals in. This merely made our bow a tiny bit more usefull. Does that hammer heal? No. A clerics main thing is heals and buffs. Did they give a cleric a new discipline that gave them a LoH style disc? No. Did they perhaps make it to where the heal had a chance of bieng a group heal when cast on a single person... No.  <br />
<br />
Rangers are supposed to be masters of the bow.... and they eventually gave us some things that made us better with a bow then we had been. Since previous to those things you mentioned our archery surpassed a warriors only in the ability to get critical hits this was a warrented step. <br />
<br />
On the other hand.... making clerics a melee force did change the fundamental nature of the the class relationships in EQ. First that a class has recieved a very powerfull melee ability without getting ANY penalties for that. Secondly that they just made a new melee/caster hybrid without any spell or mana pool penalties once so ever. Sure a paladin may be able to do twice as much damage then a cleric. Personally I think thats total bull**** from what I've seen of the average weapons a paladin uses as opposed to what that proc does but even assuming that where true.... they just made clerics 7th best melee class in the game and made them a pet class and gave them a mana regeneration spell which alone changes things because that was the property of Bards and Enchanters. <br />
<br />
Now you call the druid cleric comparison MY arguement when it fact I was merely pointing out that your use of the comparison was faulty. You state that 5K isn't alot of money..... I'm glad you feel that way... give me 5K because to alot of people it is. You say that my arguement that others have to pay for an item that clerics can get for free is jealousy. Far from it. I possess neither a cleric nor a druid. I had already suggested that they could partially rebalance the situation by giving other pure casters summoned weapons of equal rate, stats, and procs. Even without giving the other pure casters a yaulp style spell that would go a long way towards evening this out.<br />
<br />
You point out that druids get very powerfull dots like it's your coup de grace when in fact it makes no diffrence. Yes druids get good dots. Clerics get better heals and they get better buffs. In return for a little more offensive style SPELLS then get less maintenence spells and less defensive spells. That is what makes diffrent classes....... wait for it.... DIFFRENT. <br />
<br />
The last arguement you put forth is &quot;Who is it hurting&quot; I really felt sorry for you when I read this. Like the parent abandoning reasoning with the child and relying on &quot;Because I said so&quot;. or the stupid football player abandning knowledge in the arguement and resorting to just beating up the nerd. <br />
<br />
So... the question posed is who does it hurt. This should be obvious but you have caused me to remember that common sense isn't all that common and nothing is obvious anymore.<br />
<br />
Who does it hurt? Well the mobs for one obviously. It hurts the cleric class as a whole because alot of clerics where so happy with thier hammers that they forgot thier job is to keep everyone alive and have let many people die in the proscess. It hurts the warriors by giving them one more person to worry about keeping agro off in battle. In hurts the rogues because that is one more person pushing the mob back.  It hurts other pure casters because they can't melee without spending lots of hard earned money to get equipment that isn't fundemental to thier class. It hurts paladins because group spots are limited and there isn't a shortage of clerics. <br />
<br />
In case these weren't enough there is the one final set of people it hurts. Every non cleric. By introducing the hammer they changed some fundamental principles in the game, they have showed a willingness to make one class more powerfull then others.  Now your going to read powerfull and your going to immediatly begin making plans to come back with &quot;but but but they don't hit that hard *pout*&quot; so let me nip that one in the bud before it starts. Power is not necessarily about what you hit for. Power is something less tangible.  Clerics now have the ability to do the best heals, the best rezzes, arguably the best buffs, and now can buff thier own mana regeneration and engage in melee combat with success. All that is missing from the cleric arsenal to make them the uber class of norath is snare/root/and ranged weapons...... give that some time.<br />
<br />
In summation ... just because it doesn't directly hurt other players and just because it's never been done before can in some cases be a good thing and in others be a bad thing. Verant could give rangers a summoned bow with stats and arrows. They could give us a weapon enchant proc that procs every other hit. They could give us a standing mana regeneration spell. They could give us all the druids roots, nukes, and dots. They could give us the ability to cast KEI.<br />
<br />
Lets line up your reasoning on this last suggestion...<br />
<br />
1) It wouldn't hurt anyone<br />
2) it's new and diffrent<br />
3) it would make the ranger class alot more fun to play<br />
4) it would greatly improve our ability to solo which in the case of most rangers is a negligible ability<br />
5) It would greatly diversify our abilities in a raid situation<br />
6) It would make us more pallitable to a group<br />
7) It would allow us to do more damage.<br />
<br />
By your arguements giving rangers all these things would be a perfectly natural thing to do. Will Verant EVER do that. Hell no don't be a moron. But then again... we aren't clerics.<br />
<br />
This will be my final post on this thread. If this doesn't get thru to you nothing short of beating you over the head would do so. That's fine... some people are stubborn and hold on to thier false ideas. They killed people for saying the world was round and the earth was not the center of the universe. I know some people are just to stupid to be reasoned with and know when to give up on them as a free thinking member of society.</div></div><hr />

Archery Mastery Lvl 3 just gives 9 extra points in damage. <br />
<br />
Both EQ and A3 are as I AA abilities requiring both Lvl 55 and a extremely significant amount of time invested in earning enough AA points to aquire these things. -Monk<br />
<br />
Archery Mastery, unless it has been changed significantly, is a percentage increase in damage. AM3 = 100% more archery damage. Not 9 more points.<br />
<br />
Both of these skills are Class AA abilities, which requires level 59, not 55.<br />

<br />
Someone said that a cleric stunning a mob is a waste of mana when they could be up meleeing.  If the cleric has enough mana to be up and meleeing, then stunning a mob is not going to make any big difference to their mana pool, and they can easily sit down and med up whatever they used in only a couple seconds.  Its not a waste of mana at all, its simply something to do when they obviously have excess mana in the first place.  Clerics also have a couple of nukes that they can use as well.  Especially if you happen to be fighting anything undead.<br />
<br />
The only reason I can really see the hammer being introduced was to allow them to solo.  They can cast for damage in the first place, so melee was never a high priority for them.  I think verant should nerf the proc rate quite a bit on the hammer, or else Paladins may end up becoming void in most groups.  Why get a paladin when a cleric can do near as much damage and also heal better.  CALL ANOTHER ROGUE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Dedolito there are so many falsehoods in your arguement that at first my impulse was to deign to answer them and walk away. But here goes anyway<br />
<br />
I could say the same of your argument.  <br />
<br />
Who does it hurt? Well the mobs for one obviously.<br />
<br />
And the point of that statement was?<br />
<br />
It hurts the cleric class as a whole because alot of clerics where so happy with thier hammers that they forgot thier job is to keep everyone alive and have let many people die in the proscess. It hurts the warriors by giving them one more person to worry about keeping agro off in battle. In hurts the rogues because that is one more person pushing the mob back.  <br />
<br />
Illogical argument.  Using a worst case scenerio does not validate an argument.  I have had zero difficulties keeping agro, keeping the mob facing the right way, or having the clerics I have grouped with remember that they are there to heal first, damage second.  I'd launch into simile and/or metaphor as you do using real life examples but it is not relevant and it is insulting.<br />
<br />
It hurts other pure casters because they can't melee without spending lots of hard earned money to get equipment that isn't fundamental to thier class.  <br />
<br />
No one is forcing the other casters to melee.  They have a role to play in every battle.  The cleric did not.<br />
<br />
It hurts paladins because group spots are limited and there isn't a shortage of clerics.<br />
<br />
I would not choose a second cleric to a group for the extra melee damage over a paladin (assuming those were the only two classes available).  Would you?  If you are looking for increased damage output, obviously you would not.<br />
<br />
First you give some vague examples of something, of what exactly I'm not sure because it didn't make any sense except that I think you where referring to grouping with each class since they haven't given clerics snare..... yet.<br />
<br />
If I'm giving your the courtesy of reading through your arguments, you could at least try reading mine in return.  The examples were to show that all classes, melee or caster, have a role to play in every, or nearly every, battle.  A cleric does not.  With the adding of the high hp heals given to other classes, which further decreased a clerics role and desirability in a group, they required an upgrade as well.<br />
<br />
You say that just because a ranger can outdamage a cleric that that makes it Ok.<br />
<br />
I didn't say that.  I said that the cleric outputs, in comparison to ALL other melee classes, the least amount of melee damage, and rightfully so.  As such, they are not a threat to any melee class that is LFG when a group is looking for a melee class.  THEREFORE a cleric meleeing hurts no melee class.<br />
<br />
Sure a specific ranger.... YOU.... may... MAY... be able to do 4 times as much damage then the cleric but so what? Rangers can do twice as much damage as a warrior and 4 times as much as a pally. I say may because you offer no logs (not that I would believe anything from you at this point without a notary publics seal) No parses, No listing of weapons used, no names of these supposed people, no levels, no equipment lists.<br />
<br />
oh ho.  YOU don't offer any logs showing the cleric weapon being all powerful.  I will make you a log next time I have a chance.  But wait, you launch yet another personal attack justifying your inability to listen to an idea that disagrees with your own neat little view of the universe.<br />
<br />
As for weapons, I am newly equipped with a fungus encrusted hammer in my primary slot and a jagged blade of mourning in my offhand.  <br />
<br />
Next you give the example of rangers getting Trueshot, EQ, and A3. That again is totally missing the point....   Rangers are supposed to be masters of the bow.  <br />
<br />
Not according to Verant we weren't.  Have you forgotten already that archery was not supposed to be a viable form of any class under EQ's original &quot;Vision&quot;?  The point of bringing it up is the simple fact that just because something wasn't in the original &quot;Vision&quot; (i.e. ranger bow damage and cleric melee) doesn't mean it does not have an appropriate place in the game at this point in development.<br />
<br />
Once purchased they can use the hammer as many times as they want, whenever they want, and can use it for as long as they want. This alone proves your arguement to be incorrect.<br />
<br />
DId you miss the point where I said I thought purchasing it was stupid?  Did you miss me saying it should be a relatively difficult spell to obtain?<br />
<br />
Even then you would still be wrong because adding those to the rangers was not a fundamental change in the nature of the game. Rangers are seen by many to be bow weilders.... thats our thing... our gig.... what we get criticals in. This merely made our bow a tiny bit more usefull.... .... and they eventually gave us some things that made us better with a bow then we had been. Since previous to those things you mentioned our archery surpassed a warriors only in the ability to get critical hits this was a warrented step. <br />
<br />
Again, not originally.  Before /trueshot was introduced, any ranger with a bow out was yelled at by group members to come and do our duel wielding, double attacking melee damage as we were designed to do.  Warriors get bow crits just like we do.  Tiny bit more powerful?  Are you saying a 60th ranger with EQ and AM3 is just a TINY bit more powerful that a 60th ranger without? <br />
<br />
Does that hammer heal? No. A clerics main thing is heals and buffs. Did they give a cleric a new discipline that gave them a LoH style disc? No. Did they perhaps make it to where the heal had a chance of bieng a group heal when cast on a single person... No.<br />
<br />
There is a hammer that procs group heal.  A cleric has to melee to get that to happen, do they not?  LoH style /disc would be a pally domain, not a cleric.  You are the one saying paladin &quot;rights&quot; are being trampled here, this would be the same thing.  And why in the name of Tunare would a cleric want all the extra agro associated with a percent chance heal that not only cheals the target, but everyone lese in the group/radius?  <br />
<br />
On the other hand.... making clerics a melee force did change the fundamental nature of the the class relationships in EQ.<br />
<br />
And how is that?  The cleric is still largely responsible to doing heals, especially in raid situations.  Doesn't change their relationship there, and that is a big part of a cleric's life by the time the start getting these hammers.<br />
<br />
First that a class has received a very powerful melee ability without getting ANY penalties for that.<br />
<br />
Our luclin bow powers are extremely powerful, we were not given any intentional penalties to balance them out (I say intentional because LoS and poofing arrows are bugs). <br />
<br />
Secondly that they just made a new melee/caster hybrid without any spell or mana pool penalties once so ever.<br />
<br />
Are you calling clerics a hybrid class now?<br />
<br />
Sure a paladin may be able to do twice as much damage then a cleric. Personally I think thats total bull**** from what I've seen of the average weapons a paladin uses as opposed to what that proc does but even assuming that where true.... they just made clerics 7th best melee class in the game and made them a pet class and gave them a mana regeneration spell which alone changes things because that was the property of Bards and Enchanters.<br />
<br />
I'll give you a parse next time I group with an appropriately geared paladin.  But then you said you wouldn't believe me if I did.  As for being 7th best, where were they before the change?  I would have put them at about there anyway because most clerics I associate with have had so much free time over their careers their offense and melee skills are maxed. <br />
<br />
Now you call the druid cleric comparison MY arguement when it fact I was merely pointing out that your use of the comparison was faulty. You state that 5K isn't alot of money..... I'm glad you feel that way... give me 5K because to alot of people it is. <br />
<br />
Incorrect.  I said 5k isn't a lot of money for what you call the absolute best druid 1h slash weapon available in the game.  That's different that saying 5k isn't a lot of money.  Incidentally it is not a *lot* of money at level 55+ but so some, yes it would be I suppose.<br />
<br />
You say that my arguement that others have to pay for an item that clerics can get for free is jealousy. Far from it. I possess neither a cleric nor a druid. I had already suggested that they could partially rebalance the situation by giving other pure casters summoned weapons of equal rate, stats, and procs. Even without giving the other pure casters a yaulp style spell that would go a long way towards evening this out.<br />
<br />
And I would disagree with all caster classes for the above stated reasons.<br />
<br />
You point out that druids get very powerfull dots like it's your coup de grace when in fact it makes no diffrence. Yes druids get good dots. Clerics get better heals and they get better buffs. In return for a little more offensive style SPELLS then get less maintenence spells and less defensive spells. That is what makes diffrent classes....... wait for it.... DIFFRENT.<br />
<br />
This is getting redundant.  Cleric have great buffs and heals yes.  But where is the &quot;every battle utility&quot;?  Clerics have little &quot;every battle utility&quot; in comparison to the other casting classes.  Verant knows this (why else are clerics the number one boted class?) That is my coup de grace.  Not the fact the the druid dot in and of itself, but rather they have a utility in most grouping situations where their mana or skills are useful.  However, that said, druids would probably be the last group I would choose to group with in most situations.  On the other hand druids solo well, a cleric does not have that option.<br />
<br />
The last arguement you put forth is &quot;Who is it hurting&quot; I really felt sorry for you when I read this. Like the parent abandoning reasoning with the child and relying on &quot;Because I said so&quot;. or the stupid football player abandning knowledge in the arguement and resorting to just beating up the nerd.<br />
<br />
Your analogy is lost on me.  I see no relevance.  Keep it to in game discussion if you are debating an ingame problem. <br />
<br />
So... the question posed is who does it hurt. This should be obvious but you have caused me to remember that common sense isn't all that common and nothing is obvious anymore.<br />
<br />
Hmm.. Another veiled personal attack?<br />
<br />
[In case these weren't enough there is the one final set of people it hurts. Every non cleric. By introducing the hammer they changed some fundamental principles in the game, they have showed a willingness to make one class more powerful then others.]<br />
<br />
The fundamental role of the cleric has not changed.  They are still the primary healer in most situations where it counts.  Clerics should not be in the front line meleeing Vex or any raid mobs.  Their role in these situations is to be a healer.  What HAS changed is that when their primary role, i.e. healing, is not needed, they now have another way to contribute to the group.<br />
Verant makes drastic changes to the game now and then.  Though I wouldn't call the hammer a drastic change, you do.  The monk changes have the potential the drastically change how monks are used on raids, the not-so-long-ago necro FD change drastically altered a necro's viability of being a group puller, the pet changes to the solo owner only needing to do 1 point of damage drastically altered the exp gain balance, ranger bow abilities have drastically altered our role in end game encounters.  Need I go on?  Obviously Verant makes changes that drastically alter class utilities in various situations for the betterment of the game.  I am sorry you don't see a cleric being able enjoy his or herself while being able to benefit the group.<br />
<br />
Now your going to read powerfull and your going to immediately begin making plans to come back with &quot;but but but they don't hit that hard *pout*&quot; so let me nip that one in the bud before it starts.<br />
<br />
That another veiled attack on my level of intelligence?  I have not once &quot;pouted&quot; during this argument.<br />
<br />
Power is not necessarily about what you hit for. Power is something less tangible.<br />
<br />
According to your original premise it was.  But now you have changed your tune to admit that cleric melee output isn't as godly as your originally stated.  Interesting.<br />
<br />
Clerics now have the ability to do the best heals, the best rezzes, arguably the best buffs, and now can buff thier own mana regeneration and engage in melee combat with success.<br />
<br />
Redundant.  I have already argued that said abilities are not useful in many situations.<br />
<br />
All that is missing from the cleric arsenal to make them the uber class of norath is snare/root/and ranged weapons...... give that some time.<br />
<br />
Bracer of Hammerfall summons cleric usable throwing weapons. Felwith Earring quest gives clerics a root item.  Neriak earring quests gives clerics snare.  They've had these for a long time, yet you didn't complain about them being uber then.<br />
<br />
In summation ... just because it doesn't directly hurt other players and just because it's never been done before can in some cases be a good thing and in others be a bad thing.<br />
<br />
That's a rather all-encompassing statement.  Safe to say for either side of this argument.<br />
<br />
Verant could give rangers a summoned bow with stats and arrows. They could give us a weapon enchant proc that procs every other hit. They could give us a standing mana regeneration spell. They could give us all the druids roots, nukes, and dots. They could give us the ability to cast KEI.<br />
<br />
Those are abilities that would either make no sense to have as a ranger or be so ridiculously overpowering that it would make sense to give the ability because having such would seriously encroach on other classes' abilities.  A cleric meleeing makes sense by the classic definition of a cleric and in that it does not seriously encroach on any of the other &quot;true&quot; melee classes.(and I believe the original EQ definition of a cleric was a class that did decent amounts of melee damage via crushing weapons.  But I may be getting that confused with a D&amp;D description)<br />
<br />
Lets line up your reasoning on this last suggestion...<br />
1) It wouldn't hurt anyone<br />
2) it's new and diffrent<br />
3) it would make the ranger class alot more fun to play<br />
4) it would greatly improve our ability to solo which in the case of most rangers is a negligible ability<br />
5) It would greatly diversify our abilities in a raid situation<br />
6) It would make us more pallitable to a group<br />
7) It would allow us to do more damage.<br />
By your arguements giving rangers all these things would be a perfectly natural thing to do. Will Verant EVER do that. Hell no don't be a moron. But then again... we aren't clerics.<br />
<br />
Proving your argument with such an outlandish and obviously ridiculous set of circumstances does not really prove your point.  Obviously if a Ranger could do all that, all the classes that are normally sought after  for these abilities would be hurt by us having them.  Again, the Cleric having melee hurts not a single meleeing class.  <br />
<br />
This will be my final post on this thread. If this doesn't get thru to you nothing short of beating you over the head would do so. That's fine... some people are stubborn and hold on to their false ideas. They killed people for saying the world was round and the earth was not the center of the universe. I know some people are just to stupid to be reasoned with and know when to give up on them as a free thinking member of society. [/B]<br />
<br />
Oh yet another personal attack and you showing the inability to listen to other's ideas with an open mind.  I listen to yours and agreed that it was too easy to get the hammer.  Otherwise you have been belligerent and demeaning the entire time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ok, so we more or less agree on the basic premise behind the addition of cleric melee, Dedolito.<br />
<br />
I still say that there are spell options available to clerics though. Given a few minutes of thinking of something, I don't think a smallish rune, stackable with everything except enchanter rune line, would be out of order. Maybe make the most powerful one 350 hp or something, give it a longish cast time.. maybe 5 or 6 seconds, and make it less mana efficient than heals as well, although don't make it horribly mana ineffecient :p<br />
<br />
This could be cast before each pull, and would be used much the same as rune, except rune's use is limited (rightfully so, due to the huge HP amount it adds) by reagents. In any event, this would save pullers during a bad pull at best, and at worse is a slightly less efficient preheal.<br />
<br />
Maybe another death pact spell which has a very low chance of working, maybe 10%.. give it a 30 min duration and not particularly expensive manawise. A cheap reagent might be in order to stop it being used on raids though... or do MTs have no extra buff slots? I know I'd sometimes have trouble landing rune, and that was before the horrifying visions spell lines were added. AE bard songs don't help either as far as buff slots go.<br />
<br />
I dunno, Verant designers are paid to think of stuff, not me :p They should be able to come up with something more in line for a casting class, as I think the existance of paladins rules out the EQ existance of a battlecleric found in some fantasy books/games/what-have-you, especially because class lines are fairly distinct in EQ (although it's certainly been blurred a ton lately, it still has a long ways to go...)<br />
<br />
I do agree with your post in response to me, just that I think there are still possible spellcasting options out there, and clerics being a caster class should get spells. The only other thing I really disagree with you on is cleric nukes... yes they suck.. only encs are worse, shamen/necs worst of all if you even include them when talking about nukes (they do make up for it in dots, but adding dots makes the whole picture fuzzy as encs also get (good given the time) dots, convoluting evertyhing.) In any event, I think that FM clerics should be nuking. :p Especially come PoP, seems they'll be adding a lot more summoned/undead/etc, as it should be. My enc nuked horribly, but I would still nuke when I had the mana... would stay floating between 80-90m and it'd work out quite well.</div></div><hr />

Not really true.  Enchanter's definetly don't have a role to play in every battle, especially when the group has a stupid monk puller!  I hate having a monk pulling when I'm playing my enchanter, it's makes it extremely boring.  I've come to not like monks very much for that reason alone.  Although any pullers that don't realize you have to spice it up when theres an enchater around is bad, monks are usually worse in my experience.<br />
<br />
Well, anyways, the point was simply that maybe if thier handing out things to do when you're bored, they should look at enchanters next :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">The only time monks really hurt an enchanter's playability is around and before 35, when mem blur (read: FD) always works. After that things get a little better.<br />
<br />
The thing is though, enchanters always have something to do. Worst case scenario we have nukes. Enchanter dots are quite efficient if the mob is living 2+ minutes. If the healer is having trouble keeping mana high, stun a bunch.<br />
<br />
In this vein, I'd say clerics always have something to do, too.<br />
<br />
The thing is, clerics had lost a bunch of (real or not, perception is more important than actual reality in cases like this) desirability in groups. They needed something to make people occasionally choose a cleric over a shaman (and druid, though shm usually was a better pick for a healer.) I agree to this, others do too. The net effect of cleric melee is good, but my personal argument is that clerics shouldn't get melee stuff. They're casters. :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Aralys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">You know what? I loved it when the druid or cleric or Shaman in my group would start whacking on the mob with their little scimitar or hammer. This was back before this neato proc'ing hammer mind you, but I guess unlike Monk here, I want my group mates having fun.  If the cleric is sitting on his/her butt that often then I need to make the group more exciting.  It cracked me up to see a halfling druid smacking the mob for 10's and 15's, but hey I the guy is a friend and if it makes him happy I don't mind if we lose some efficiency.  In fact if groups got boring I would often try to rile up the casters to get meleeing, just to have some fun.  <br />
<br />
Some of you here make it sound like clerics need to sit on their butt and LIKE it.  Most will do so because they want to be reliable and experience the game, but it doesn't hurt to give them something fun to do when the situation isn't critical.  <br />
<br />
All casters need to get something fun to do in addition to their main spell function. Necros get a kick out of maximizing their mana/health ratios while dotting the hell out of mobs.. enchanters get their kicks from controlling a charmie or keeping the train you just brought in under wraps or even pulling, druids at least get some efficent damage to use their mana, clerics click one or two spell gems and sit.  They've been looking for something interesting to do for the non critical scenarios for a long time, sounds like VI gave them a winner here.</div></div><hr />

My cleric Melee'ss as often as he pleases...and rarely runs low on mana unless he has to mana dump the chanter...which is insanely rare. <br />
<br />
I want you to read my sig below...and take not of the fact that my ranger is lvl 54...whereas my cleric just dinged 59 2 nights ago...(I know...sig needs an update). Subwen was my first char I created 2.5-3 years ago. Sark I only made 1.5 years ago. I would actually have more fun playing ranger. They can do stuff...like kill things...and that pleases me. My cleric sits on his ass most times...healing....yippee-kay-yay. Cleric is soo insanely easy to play I honestly feel like a complete slacker and also like I am not contributing a damm thing to the grp. Sure..I keep my group alive..which is essential...but so what..ITS EASY AS HELL to do that. What truly amazes me is that most clerics suck at doing this. Sub is stuck at lvl 54..cause trying to find a decent cleric that I feel comfortable trusting is like pulling teeth. If yer clerics are meleeing and such to the point where you have downtime after a couple pulls...then ya need to find some new clerics to grp with that know what they are doing. If ya dont have aggro management sorted out...then sheesh....I could rant about that for hours and hours. This is not rocket science here at all. SK's can obtain and hold aggro better then any other class out there...period *HINT HINT*. CLerics should be able to get some mind candy....at 56+ use yaulp5 to make up for not sitting...melee if they like...and ALWAYS have mana for heals. All the cleric needs to do is Pay Attention. Cleric'ing is EASY...and to those clerics that are no good...well..I have no sympathy for you at all.<br />
<br />
All verant did when they gave clerics the hammer and the new yaulp spell is give us something fun to toy with....so as we could contribute some kinda damage and still maintain mana for healing. A Cleric's role is still that of being primary healer in a grp...and I myself have never strayed from that role....even when I do pull out the hammer and start smacking mobs around.</div></div><hr />

Okay, a few clerics you group with are stupid, and dont know how to balance, does that mean no cleric should melee? no....some rangers are stupid and cant manage aggro well and die alot...does that mean they shouldnt melee, they should heal instead? no....<br />
<br />
Those of you saying clerics should get punished with spells...we do, our buffs are nice sure, but at cost of 210p for a stack of reagents...its not exactly a cheap line of spells...and look at our damage line of spells....516dmg for me...same spell untill level 54...<br />
<br />
No, im not saying clerics should always melee, no im not saying clerics shouldnt melee either....<br />
<br />
I have a rather set reputation on my server, for being a good cleric...i still melee at times...but im smart about it...yet you all feel i should be punished because some of your clerics arent smart? maybe i group with rangers who arent exactly the brightest bunch...but i dont complain about you all...i suck it up and play the game...<br />
<br />
You all want to piss and moan here, go ahead, while your doing that us good clerics will have fun with our hammers...and the stupid clerics will die...if you dont like grouping with stupid clerics, then dont...<br />
<br />
Clerics as a class arent stupid....just like rangers as a class dont always die...its the few idiots who dont know what they are doing that make the rest of the game think that...and you all just seem to find them and complain...<br />
<br />
all of you here who have complained about our damned hammer...go find a good cleric...a cleric who knows what they are doing...then see how you feel...i can keep every person in my group alive, have time to melee, and still come out of every fight with over 80m....its not the clerics...its the nut behind the keyboard who doesnt know what they are doing...<br />
<br />
Telling clerics what they should do is pointless...you all tell us to keep you alive...we feel its time we get to do something...clerics arent just to heal and rezz...we feel like having fun too...what this game is about...<br />

If you think clerics are too overpowered, and shouldnt be having/using these hammers...maybe you should look at the fact this is a game still...and if you take it that seriously...then you need to take a break...im not saying im better then any of you...i play this game too, and i play quite regularly...but i dont get to the point where i piss and moan when other classes can do stuff...sure i dont LIKE the fact druids can heal better...but i live with it...sure i didnt like the fact my cheal isnt as effective on the top 5% of the game...but i live with it...so i think its time you all live with something that is useful for us...so that we can have fun...and so that you now have a way to tell the bad clerics...from the good ones....flame away...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Sullah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">When the Hammer of Judgement was orginally introduced that first night it was a very nice suprise and change to the cleric style of play.  It procced quite a bit and did significant damage.  It was made into an almost worthless weapon the next day.  I toyed with it a little afterwards and only found one instance where it proved useful : Sebilis crypt.  With Shaman dexterity buffs and haste (I was also wearing an FBSS) it was actually a mean little weapon consdering the +10 bane damage against undead.  Hits for 80+ were not uncommon.  The group was overkill anyways and hardly anyone ever needed healing.  <br />
<br />
Now, speaking as a level 62 Epic'ed cleric I don't even remember the last time I summoned a hammer in an experience group.  The last time I used it was to beat up on spiders in East Karana for silks.  Some people in Everquest are stupid; this is uavoidable.  The cleric that keeps plucking away at a monster while their groupmates die is a bad player.  Liken it to the Ranger that gets aggro on every mob and doesn't use the Jolt line of spells to lower the aggro on himself.  You don't see me going to my message boards asking that Rangers have their damage lowered because they are getting too much hate from the monsters and a couple of them don't know how to solve that.  <br />
<br />
The hammer as it is now  is usually a joke and should not be a threat to Paladins and other classes .   Just remember that we are a plate class but have the damage mitigation of a leather wearing druid.  With a dodge cap of 75(!), 1HB of 175 and Offense of 200 we are no threat  to melee classes.  Also our riposte and parry skills are not that great---oh wait we don't have those skills.  <br />
<br />
Just calm down guys and gals, once you learn the truth of the matter you'll see that this really isn't an issue of balance.  The hammer is a joke and is mostly used by people that don't have their epic yet.  It might be used more frequently in easy zones like Velk's and Sebilis but  I have to see a cleric running around PoI, PoD, PoN and PoV smacking things with their wittle &quot;uber&quot; hammer instead of medding for that next pull.</div></div><hr />

3) &quot;Pure-casters&quot; don't melee?   I agree.   Druids, shaman and clerics are &quot;Priests&quot;.   Priests melee when they have full mana - just something I've noticed, and frankly don't have an issue with.   If it's stupid, but it works, then it isn't stupid.<br />

You're being hypocritical.  You say that it's not ok for clerics to have decent melee because clerics weren't meant to melee in the original vision of Verant.<br />
<br />
Then you say that it's ok for rangers to fight with the bow because rangers are meant to be masters of he bow.<br />
<br />
Umm, no they weren't.  The bow was nothing more than a pulling tool for 2 years, and Verant wanted it that way.  The vision for rangers got CHANGED.  So you can't complain that the vision for clerics got CHANGED.<br />
<br />
To be more specific, the vision for rangers got changed to a more AD&amp;D specific version.  Rangers in AD&amp;D are the masters of the bow.  And you know what?  Clerics in Everquest just got changed to a more AD&amp;D specific version.  AD&amp;D clerics are meleers.  They wear plate and have weapon skills for a reason.  You say the two games are unrelated, but that's being silly.  Most Everquest classes are taken straight from D&amp;D in the first place.</div></div><hr />
