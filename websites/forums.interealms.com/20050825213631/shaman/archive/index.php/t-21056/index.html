<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wallorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello fellow shammies,<br />
<br />
I lurk mostly. I was just hoping for some feedback on tribute system. What types of things have you all found helpful and what is junk and should be avoided. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like the 150hp one. There are several helpful ones, check it out and see what ones you need. You can get FT and focus effects too if you need them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally I've got the hps, the MR, the EB and the BA4 tributes going. More hps and MR is always good. The EB is kinda handy because you have it even when dead or just resed. Burning affliction covers a focus i'm still missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Affliction Haste4 is nice. Regen/Mana regen for the non uber shaman help lots as well. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">how expensive is it to keep those running?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like the critical affliction one. I think at the top level it burns through around 60 points every 10 minutes, or around 350-400 an hour.<br />
<br />
If you turn in a tacticians bullwark for example that you can get from about an hours worth of soloing in the tactics pit you will receive 27,000 tribute points.<br />
<br />
I really only turn tributes on if I am going on a monster solo root rot session. I wouldn't have them running while grouping, or raiding. It's just not worth it to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I keep the 150 HP going all the time, and then before each Time raid, I go and turn on FR, CR, MR and PR (I'd turn on DR also, but you can only have 5 tributes running at a time).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use em on my beast.Hes 56 atm, and I dont really feel like tracking down some of the focuses for him or the other alts of my friends/ In the mid 50's a little tribute from trash items can go a long way towards making your life convenient. If I ever do tables again (i dont think I have exp'd as Flabbo in months really) Id get Affliction haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Is there any documentation on how this works?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">but you can only have 5 tributes running at a time <br />
<br />
Thats the biggest drawback imo.  I use the tributes a lot, and its really pretty easy to keep the points maxxed, just takes a little farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tactician's bulwark for 27k points? Hmm, now that's good info!  <br />
<br />
I'm maxed in all tradeskills, and found a use for the unsellable cultural plate armor that stopped moving on my bazaar trader mules months ago.  They can bring from around 9k to like 21k in tribute points, and if you get lucky with your success rate(about 30-40% is a good success rate on those), you can make quite a lot of tribute off of not a whole lot of plat.<br />
<br />
I've also found the same thing applies to other tradeskilled armor.  Tae Ew shields bring somewhere over 4k in tribute value, and sometimes you can buy all the bloods needed for 1k, if you're lucky.  Worth looking out for.  Same with nightmarewood compound bows.  Both are more or less unsellable these days, but still bring good tribute.<br />
<br />
I tried looking for some of the items that others said they turned in, but found that what many recommended using goes for literally 10x as much on my server, or was never found in the bazaar, or was lore, and the transferring back and forth was just not worth the effort for the small return.<br />
<br />
Tacticians bulwarks are really easy to get, though.  I might try to scoop some of them up sometime from the bazaar.  I probably sold 50 of them myself.<br />
<br />
The tributes can get used up very quickly, I find.  I'm not comfortable going through many hundreds of plat per hour, even though I'm doing fine for money and don't really have anything else to spend it on.  But I already have detrimental haste and BA4 and crit AA.  If I didn't and I was going to do a lot of dotting to camp loot or get exp, I'd probably be a LOT more excited about tribute.<br />
<br />
Or if I had a lowbie I wanted to level fast.  Those tributes can be fantastic for a lowbie without the benefit of good gear or AA yet.  I'd say that was probably the best use of the tribute system -- to power up lowbies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wallorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for your replies ladies and gentlemen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">BlargX, the best thing about the tacticians bulwark is that it was 27K before the points reduction, and remained so after it. <br />
<br />
It is the common drop off the piglet so at least if anyone is farming it they can put it to good use. <br />
<br />
Finally, the piglet is pretty easy for any Shaman with malo and torpor to solo, you don't need to be 65 with all spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My friend makes Robe of Virtue for me.  They cost around 1k to make, and fetch about 8k points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The Tae Ew chain leggings are pretty good I think, store bought for everything but the blood and 11k points (I think).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmm Robe of Virtue eh? I'm max tradeskills, but for some robes you need to be a caster.  I'll check that one out.<br />
<br />
On piggy -- yes, a shaman with canni 5 can do him easily, but you'll probably die once in a while figuring out the tricks.  Small price to pay for good sellable loot pretty fast.  Doesn't sell for much on my server anymore -- 8k and up; but it's still an upgrade to some and for either cash of 27k tribute points, it's not a bad deal.  Heck, the more people who figure out it's a good deal, the better price the shields will go for, making the shield even more worthwhile to camp, for those into that kinda thing.  I know I sure used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Dang, that robe is only makeable by high elves.</div></div><hr />
