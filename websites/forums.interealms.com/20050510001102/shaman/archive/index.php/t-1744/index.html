<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey,<br />
<br />
I'm a 56 shaman, I've noticed recently when I've been trying to use plague, it says, 'spell did not take hold'.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't know for sure because I haven't botherd testing it, but I believe plague will no longer stack with slow (turgurs).  Now that slow is a disease debuff (if I read correctly) and turgurs is a higher level spell then plague, they won't stack. <br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm this, shamans are really having a crap time of it of recent, courtecy of Verant.<br />
<br />
PS - I also use my epic, is it possible epic and disease no longer stack?</div></div><hr />

well I soloed a rock thingy in the grey the other day, using turgur, then pox, plague and epic without trouble.<br />
<br />
Tugur is not a debuff disease like you said, but now the slow line spell can be dispelled with a cure/abolish disease.<br />
<br />
It still checks the magic resistance to land and far I know (except for Plague Of Insect that checks disease).<br />
<br />
Now the velious legs in CT are very usefull with all those AoE slowing lizard hehe.<br />
BTW the slow they use is disease based, I found that after casting jacynthe on my group and we went from 70% unresited slow  to 80% resisted slow. that gave my legs some rest )<br />
