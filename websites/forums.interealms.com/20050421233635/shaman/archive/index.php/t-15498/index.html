<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently dinged 51. No epic yet, but I do have a jbb. Scrimp and save, it's worth it to have since 45. :) Dulak slowed down, db's giving 1/2% or less. Nadox overcamped, tried the planes and the same. CoM is annoying, way too many lb adds. Jaggedpine overcamped. Scarlet Desert went lb for the most part. Running out of places I have been and know. Where would the solo shammy head next? If I can get a group, I sometimes do, but until now best xp has been solo. Any worthwhile places to go next?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dulak slowed down to 1/2 a percent? Are you sure you are camping the right place? I can see Stormwave dropping around that level but are you aware that the boats get harder in level? At 51 I am pretty sure you will be getting 1 fleck + of xp. Then Dandolak should be good as you get higher. I am currently 57 and getting 1 fleck of xp per mob on Dandolak with no light blues.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you need more information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did the Seb/CoM route from 51-55. Go to Seb first and LFG. If you can't find anything then head to CoM and hunt at the temple. Everything at the temple should be db up to 52 AFAIK then to the bowling alley/gazebo it should be db up to 54/55. Yes you will get adds at the temple but everything there is very low MR so root parking is easy. I recall getting doubles sometimes and only got triples if I pulled any of the 3 from inside and down the steps. The stables is also a good area at 52-53. CoM is really hard to beat for solo XP. Keep trying till you get it down right and you'll be glad you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to second Solariis on this one, CoM is where I hunted from 52 to 54/55 or so.  Great exp and the zone is alot of fun to explore when solo.  If you do get a chance to group you will probably tear the place apart ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pzakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I second Dulak, great exp in IMO and great loot. I was 51 doing 20% in just over an hour for me thats good. I walked away every half hour with around 500 to 700pp in items and straight pp drops. I dinged 52 last night. So am going to try soloing there some more.<br />
<br />
I'm fighting the Fisherman across from the hungry shark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The loot has dropped off significantly in Dulak, no doubt it was higher to lure people to head over ther in the beginning. However, the xp should still be good in the low 50's. The boats really are just a set of rungs to use on your upward grind. Don't give up on Dulak unless you are bored. It isn't the most exciting place to level, but having a boat is really just a personal uncontested, non-stop, grind spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nadox elementals.<br />
<br />
If camped, Nadox furious blackhands near the luggald castle zone line.  There is a safe spot to pull to and it isn't hard to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The loot has dropped off significantly in Dulak<br />
Either I'm terribly lucky, or you just hit a dry spell. I'm still walking away from Dulak with about $1k/hour from plat, weapon, and gem drops alone. Granted, I didn't see that much on the Stormwave or Lady D (maybe half), but it's not uncommon to see two or three Blue Diamonds drop on Dandolak during that time. Not to mention all of the merchant fodder gems (sapphires, star rubies, etc).<br />
<br />
Exp is still decent at level 56 on the boats except for Stormwave and Lady D. Dandolak or higher...sweet spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sandadarz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've been going to HK for exp if you get past the annoying guards with pet you can maybe get nobles or bards. They WILL ruin faction of Qeynos and Freeport though! but nobles give me 1% a kill just pull with slow sick pet in e-bolt root and med. I got 50% in 3 hours of soloing. (Should have used AA......) Anyway it is good and the guards drop up to 5p and always drop fine steel so thats 5p its a money-making/exp zone.<br />
<br />
Just a thought :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm up to 53 and 4 full yellows. Quite slow. Grinding in PoJ, PoD, PoI, CoM, and a little Karnors. I toyed with Burning Wood, Charrisis (sp?), Velk's, and various other places. I REALLY wish I had hit Burning Wood about 5 or 6 levels ago. (Lots of HP on the wurms and gorillas, but overall, better xp to effort ratio.) As per soloing grounds, STILL looking for good soloing areas. Most of my xp has been grouping, done a bit solo. CoM actually provides a challenge now... things still have few hp, but do ALOT of damage in comparison to other places. As per another spot I've been using.. PoJ... stand in the courtyard where the graveyard is, and cast through the open windows along the ground around it, and you can pull the mobs to you. You'll have to be prepared to handle 2 or 3 pulls at a time (rooms can have up to 4 mobs inside, pull one, pull all), but PLENTY of room for root/rot or pet kiting. Downsides are CoM is pretty much LB, but die fast enough to even out things. PoJ must have a negative xp modifier or something, worse xp than Dulak (And yes, I tried every ship, and even the buildings... xp is near worthless there.. 3 kills of the wandering guardians, or off ship #4 = 1% at 53 for some reason)<br />
<br />
If anyone knows a &quot;sweet spot&quot; for a solo shammy to grind some good xp... I'd love to hear it. As per pp/hour.. I personally don't care about pp right now, I am ONLY concerned with getting to 65.</div></div><hr />

It's hard to get good xp these days solo, you are better off grouping in the planes. From about 51-54 I did PoN, then stayed and switched to AA. The xp flows there at those levels if you get in a good group with non stop pulling (just the spiders, trees and ravens). If I remember correctly, I was getting well over a gold an hour, think I even made a whole level in about 3 hours.<br />
<br />
If you insist on soloing, check out Katta guards. You might be a little low, but worth a shot. There's a great thread a few posts down you can check out.<br />
<br />
You said you are not interested in pp, but a pretty good solo spot where you can make xp and pp are the archers/scounds in echo caverns. There are 2 archers on a 25 min timer, but each drop 2 bows worth 23pp each, plus plat drops. The archers are a joke and hit like sissies, plus when they get under 20%, they stop attacking (static spawn). The scounds would prob be a bit tough, but doable, mem your disease dots, buff up you and pet to the max. Also, scounds aren't single pullable until 56 there, so just root one and kill the other, then when they respawn next time, you only have one at a time. I still go there myself once in a while, xp is not all that great now, but its easy, and it's a nice quiet spot.<br />
<br />
You can also try Maiden's Eye, but stick to the non casters, such as the goranga lookouts and wanderers. Lot of trains here though (I always camped near the zone in case of adds), and they do roam close together, so it can be a bit tough to single pull. They are from around 52-55 in level or so, with a good amount of hp, so fights will take a while, but should be really nice xp.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just wanted to say, that if you indeed are only concerned about 65, and not about pp, then soloing is the wrong way to go. Group in the planes, no loot there, but amazing xp.</div></div><hr />
