<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, so I was feeling a little crazy yesterday, group was disbanding in PoD, so I get the cleric to Virtue doggie, and figure I'd buff him amd myself to the max, and try to solo some yard trash. Now, I always thought that you could cast cleric buffs on pets, I know ours work, and I thought before I had a temp on dog that stuck. I know these mobs in PoP hit hard, but my pet, with virtue, IoS, Kragg (thats about 2k right there...on top of pet's base hp, which I have no idea), was down to like 35% in a matter of seconds. Basically, dog didn't last too long, which made it one long ass fight with a stupid pile of goo....after which I decided it was time to go elsewhere hehe. So anyway, do these cleric buffs work on our pets? Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

At level 55 your pet's level is lvl 36. Against a POP mob he would be toast no matter how many hp you give him. I solo the goo's pretty easy with the 61st  lvl pet spell(pet is lvl 59). Prior to 61st lvl your pet is basically a dot. But after the you get you 61st lvl pet, he can tank.<br />
Then it is alot of fun trying different ways of soloing. Also it makes farming greenies alot of fun.<br />
