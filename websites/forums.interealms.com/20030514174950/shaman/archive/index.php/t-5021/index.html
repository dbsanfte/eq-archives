<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering, if Lord Rak will return your tear if your faction isn't high enough. I've done everything up in order so far, just waiting to get a  reaver raid to hand in ring to Neh. Seems like Rak is up a lot more than Neh. I don't want him to &quot;eat&quot; my tear. Some NPC's will return stuff to you after a few patches a while back. Does anyone know if this is true with epic mobs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, if you do everything in order and get every faction hit along the way you will have the faction you need so there is no pointin worrying about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rak and Neh both spawn from reavers with identical spawn times around 2 hours.  <br />
<br />
I don't know if a reaver raid would trek all the way up to Neh just to kill that one reaver.  You might have better luck tagging along with an enchanter going for their epic bit from the ghost or a mage going for their epic bit from Neh.</div></div><hr />
