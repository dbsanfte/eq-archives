<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blaiz Wildarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I m in BB right now argueing wether or not there is such a thing as double dmg or not, i know there is but i cant back it up as i havent had one yet, my archery is 120 right now, so whats the deal here? when dose it start happending? isnt it only on stationary targets? dose rooted count as stationary? someone gimme some answers plz :confused: :confused: :confused:<br />
<br />
EDIT: p.s. i am talking about archery in case u didnt know cause i didnt really say it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lasalle Stormreaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It starts happening on stationary, non-rooted targets once you hit level 51, regardless of your archery skill.  Btw, good job on getting archery up so high and you're still 26.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blaiz Wildarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok thanx for info, actually i m now 30 i just havnt change profile yet, do that later, and just got done with some more kiteing so now 127, i dont know y people keep saying it take like 1000 arrows to make it go up 1 skill point, seems easy to me, maybe it slows down later? o well thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it will slow down a bit but yea those skill arnt to hard to raise with the right gear and right buffs .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i noticed that my max crit and damage went up the second i hit skill 160 in archery (at lvl 43).  this was during a series of archery skillup sessions i'd conducted to repair the damage of spending all of my 20's and half my 30's in dungeons in close quarters.<br />
<br />
someone in game also mentioned to me that there is a chance for damage bonus at around this skill too in certain circumstances. this seemed to be true for me.  my max crit was on a motionless target i arrow pulled.  when i root and pelt or arrow kite i don't seem to get the extra damage.<br />
<br />
seems skill for EVERY skill slows down considerably in the high hundreds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blaiz Wildarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea think your right about skillz being hard to raise in high hundreds not shure y, skill hell lvls?, as of tonight i m max'ed out for my lvl at 155 and feelin pretty happy cause now i m waaaay better then most higher lvl rangers i have met thus far :cool:  o yea and noticed that my dmg is finally going above base lol, still need to find some more dex items though, Where have all the dex buffs gone anyways?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i maxed my bow skill at level 50 whent from low s 20 to 200 in about 10 hour of fear kiting dark blue mobs plus i was getting exp :)</div></div><hr />
