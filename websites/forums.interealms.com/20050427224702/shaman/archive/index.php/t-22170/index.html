<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the best way to get through to the Hate's Fury zoneline tactics-wise? Seems those buggers see through invis (undead, I'm assuming) and we keep losing people as we attempt to bum-rush the zone line. Any suggestions? <br />
<br />
It seems once someone gets attacked (and it's almost ALWAYS a caster), people panic. And my suggestion of sticking together and slowly fighting the rest of the way was overruled as being too slow. And both groups did not have an enchanter or bard, so mezzing wasn't an option.</div></div><hr />

Well My self 59 Shaman and My 54 Monk fight there a lot and I can tell you this. There is no way to make it there invis all the way. Make sure all have sow and then invis to lugglads. Then make a dash for Hates. I have never had a problem. They are just to slow to keep up. And also I have never ran into a caster mob either. Now one must know where one is going. If you do not you will end up dead. But if you know the way and have sow its cake. I usually dont even get touched. This duo I have has a hard time fighting the mobs in Hates we can just barley do Zone in.</div></div><hr />

Okay...so they ARE undead? Wasn't sure on that and was seeking confirmation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Most are undead.  There may be a live mob that sees through it.  However, the best way is just to dash through to Hate's.  I actually prefer going down the tunnel through the undead cavern.  IVU through here, and up to dock to Hate's.  Then the mad dash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RoenLuve</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can say I fight there a lot in the past.  I go through the south cave entrance and IVU and run like hell to get into the zone.  There is a random mob that see's through IVU so you can't stop.  If you have someone who can take the hit either a tank or Cleric with DB then you can make them go first and wait a sec at zone for all others to zone in.<br />
<br />
Only other choice is kill your way in....</div></div><hr />
