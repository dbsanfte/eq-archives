<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have finally been warned by my ISP for using a single account on two comps. knew they would someday get around to me. Well i have a ISDN dual channel thingie that i use both ISDN channel to play EQ on with a single dial in number which is what they are getting upset about.<br />
<br />
What im after is a router (i think this is what i need) that i can use both channels for and then split onto two or more computers. I need to know what i am actually after (i looked up routers on a hardware site and my brain shut down due to overload and lack of comprehension). Ideally with suggestions for good (ideally easy to work but i can work it out eventually) cheap items that I can use. Budget is ideally below 200 sterling (300 dollars roughly i guess) though as cheap as poss would be nice. I need it to split to 2 comps directly (more would be better) or to fix to my network on the ethernet?<br />
<br />
Help please! I know we have some good techies here.</div></div><hr />
