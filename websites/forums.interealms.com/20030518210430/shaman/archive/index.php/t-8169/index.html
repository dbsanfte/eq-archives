<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all!<br />
<br />
What a fine wealth of knowledge here! Many thanks to all for posting and sharing, I've read through many posts and most all are very good reads. Thank you.<br />
<br />
In my adventures I've gathered some spiffy items, or so I think, and I'm lookin to see what you all think of them? Wondering if I'm on the right track and with all the very wise Shamen here, I know I cam to the right place!<br />
<br />
So sit back have a brew and take a peek at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=466031&quot;  target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt; My Kit &lt;/a&gt; and tell me what ya think and please, all suggestions are welcome!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you have more hp at 29 than I had at 50.  Gear was a bit different of course, but good job there!<br />
<br />
I would start by selling all your JB armor and getting some Sentry Gauntlets and Kylong/Ry'Gorr ams.  A Sentry Bracer or 2 would be good replacements for your RMBs.  When you do upgrade your feet, try for something with hp/resists on it.  Pure AC items are ok, but will not save your azz as much as a ton of hp will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the advice! I'll look into the changes you suggested. Anyone else have any helpful suggestions for this man o' mojo?  =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
np, I wore a straw spun belt till my 30's.  Just grab your epic boots with some friends or get some tribal war boots if you have a little cash.   <br />
<br />
Other than that, these would be good replacements for what you have:<br />
<br />
Shissar Scaled Gaunts<br />
<br />
Iksar bp (if you have the cash, god knows I didn't at your level), or barbed ringmail or frog tunic or seb tunic<br />
<br />
Giant scalemail arms - same ac, with wis and more hps<br />
<br />
Sentry bracer, or grab some friends and an alt and get your coldain military bracer early<br />
<br />
Jarsath scale legs<br />
<br />
Oh, and I'd equip your dark ember over your spine chill in most situations.<br />
<br />
You'd gain some wis and 100+hps with all those suggestions together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Koyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the suggestions. I made a few purchases last night and knew I should've bought those Tribal War Boots when I saw em! Missed them though - ugh<br />
<br />
Upgrading my BP seems to be the most costly.. gotta bum 7k from the wife to get an Iky and she's not going to like the idea of her &quot;pony savings&quot; going *poof* heh<br />
<br />
Anyhow, thanks for the tips.. if anyone has any more - I welcome em! *grins*</div></div><hr />
