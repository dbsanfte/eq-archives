that dropped in sshraeahah apparently. Hadn't seen it anywhere before. Anyone know what the effect does? Lol im still hoping to get a vindi bp :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Won't stack with focus on test, but as we've seen in the past there can be some differing in the ways spells stack between test and live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can't see the image that you attached right now (using lynx), but I assume that you are referring to the chain bp from the Cursed.  It's nice, but Vindi still has AoB.  And no, Focus won't stack with the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no focus? well *** then screw that. That sucks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">vindi bp has higher resists, stamina and wisdom are easily capped and 75 mana isn't a whole lot, really.  sure it adds up, but overall in comparison between the two, i'd say its a tossup.  <br />
<br />
if i were a shaman that did a lot of raids, i think i'd actually take the vindi bp over this one, for the slightly better resists.  my stamina is 205 unbuffed and i don't even have ntov gear.  my wisdom is between 210 and 220, depending on gear-swapping.  who doesn't have Koadic's Endless Intellect (+25 wis) and Riotous Health / Talisman of the Brute (+50 sta) up at all times during a raid anyway?<br />
<br />
its a silly debate over which one is &quot;better.&quot;  like the &quot;best shield&quot; argument, the &quot;best&quot; is subjective and the answer varies depending on the situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Awesome BP. I use a Vindi BP and I would take this one over that for sure. Which mob drops this again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Drops from Vyzh`Dra the Cursed in Ssra. This pretty much goes to Rangers and Rogues since they can't wear a Vindi BP.  Stats are good but until it stacks with Focus its not worth it.  Any shaman in a guild capable of killing Cursed most likely has a Vindi BP already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye drops of the cursed. Got 2 of them in our first 3 kills. Both went to rogues and I expect it to keep going for rangers and rogues. Shaman can wear vindi bps and we have pleanty of them. Rangers and rogues can't.<br />
<br />
Not that it matters to me since I have 255 wis unbuffed and over 255 sta buffed so i'd much rather have a vindi bp with 15sv all and take the better resists on a much easier peice to get.</div></div><hr />

.<br />
You'd think so, but I'm wearing my trusty old Runecrafters still. :)  We kill cursed, emp, vt, etc., which puts Vindi pretty low on the priority list, where he should be.  He's killed instantly by the 2nd and 3rd tier guilds as well.  We kill him when he pops at 5 AM and there's 18 people who feel like going to Kael.<br />
And yes, I agree, [Anything] of Judgement is pretty much the be-all-end-all for that particular slot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Korgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Is the FT:V Tunic off the Burrower not among the favored Shaman BPs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>xemical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't see why the burrower BP would be favoured over mail of judgement.. less Everything on it. Way less saves.. FYI the Judgement lines are found in Vex Thall, we had this bp drop the first time we went in and cleared it. I have to say VI must know something about what SHM want in gear, because by the time you get this your str / dex should easily be maxxed, even agil / sta are there too but with this much on one item you can remove other items and fill with straight hp / AC / Mana gear.</div></div><hr />

I want a bp with an effect that stacks with focus.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i'm using burrower over vindi bp since i dont have ft capped otherwise yet :) cant always be waiting 2-3 sec for c4 to cast all the time, so other types of mana regen does really help.<br />
<br />
'course mail of judgement seems a nice upgrade, /sigh, i'll be wearing this barbed rubicite belt till my death :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Those are ALL Good BP's...  <br />
<br />
The Mail of Judgement is off of Aten Ha Ra in Vex Thall.. so, while it is THE BEST Shaman BP, it's pretty darn Rare.<br />
<br />
AC is capped... so while the Mail of the Void is 55 AC, it's not a huge benefit to a Shaman.   While that BP is a MASSIVE Bonus to a Ranger or Rogue.. Mainly Rogues who have a relatively Small selection of good BP's.<br />
<br />
The Void Effect on all 3 Cursed BP's won't stack with the Focus line, so while we would almost Never use the effect.. Rangers and Rogues sure would.   On a Need basis.. these usually go to Rangers and Rogues First....  I had a Chance at one but passed on it as I still see my Vindi BP as being close enough in Quality to it as to not make it worth taking it from a Ranger/Rogue.<br />
<br />
Burrower Tunic.. Special case...   50 AC.. Nice...   FT5... Very nice...  but much less HP and Stamina than any of the other BP's listed here.   Personally... I don't care about FT...  I can Cann5 and Torpor.. that beats FT15 Hands down.<br />
<br />
But honestly.. it's your choice on any of these.   I would take a Mail of Judgement over my Vindi given the chance but not the others.. but that's just me.    <br />
<br />
Any one of these BP's is an Excellent High End BP depending on your tastes and what you wish to do with your Shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I hate to say it, but my favorite BP is still the FT.  I change it out when we're fighitng dragons that require large amounts of resistance, but other than that, the regen just can't be beat.  And as far as the AC component goes, if you got the Aggro on most dragons, yer one flat bear anyway!  The FT VII would be nice, but With KEI and Obulus Death Shroud, I'm usually better mana-wise than most other classes.<br />
<br />
He he, my biggest problem seems to be using Torpor as a CH, I hear whines from almost EVERYONE, even if they're not meleeing!  Imagine this, I Torpor a tank between mobs, and he gives me grief for bringing his HP's up, even though he can click it off anytime!  :)</div></div><hr />
