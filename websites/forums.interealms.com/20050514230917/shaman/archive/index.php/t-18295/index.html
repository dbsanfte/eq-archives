<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">O.K.  Maybe a silly question, but still something I will try when I get back to the computer many moons from now.  I have recently been playing several games on PS2, and something hit me, something I am sure other's have thought about with respect to EQ.  I will use Final Fantasy 10 as my example.  When you get farther along into the game, you can use what was earlier thought &quot;weaker&quot; spells, or combines, depending on which character you were attacking with, to either REALLY hurt or sometimes straight up kill a mob.  My questions to the weathered folks in here who have been around the block a time or two.  Have you ever tried throwing a few lower level(significantly lower level) spells, or spells that seem somewhat &quot;useless&quot; onto a raid type mob to see what happens?  I truly doubt that SoE would have done this, but hey, it's worth a shot.  I have been reading message boards all over the internet, not just shaman, but other classes as well.  I have been reading about other games as well.  One of a few things that caught my eye is when people have a full group, or even just several folks from the same class, all seem to rave about how much fun it was, or how easy mobs went down.  Now, is it really far fetched to think that there may be something to that?  Does anyone else think there may be something to haveing a small gathering of folks, 1 person from each class, take on a normal &quot;raid force&quot; mob, just to see what happens?  I am not asking for anyone to go out an try these things, I am just curious if it has been done, and what the outcome was.  When I return, I will for sure have my guild give these crazy-thinking, ridiculous, moronic, retarded theorie's a shot.  I just can't get past the idea that these large mobs require sheer number's to take them down.  There has got to be more to it than that.  That, or I am just giving SoE WAY to much credit!  Your thoughts please.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lower level spells usually get resisted to easily for something like that to be possible.  And if you look at the spell lines that most classes are using, you quickly realize that most of the spells are simply upgrded versions of spells that they have used for 2 or 3 years.  Quiscence is a prime example.  Its the SAME spell that was released with the KUNARK expansion with 2 coding changes.  Enchanter mez?  Take the best mez from the earlier expansion and add about 10% to its duration.</div></div><hr />

sicken on yourself = don't get mezzed :D<br />
Burst of Flame - Good for tagging pulls (but we wouldnt have a spell slot... I'd use MD if I was gonna tag for the quick cast time)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This no longer works Grizlor. Playing on a PvP server and I have to dot myself to stop mez.<br />
<br />
Your dot now has to do more damage to you than your regen to be counted as 'damage'. It used to be that any damage (sicken as example) would count for mez breaking even if you took no damage form it, but SoE has changed it so that it no longer does so.<br />
<br />
My regen is pretty high (with replenishment) so I need at least Plague (49 version) to do enough damage to me while I am mezzed. <br />
<br />
I know. It sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">O.K., spells aside, what about the idea of a full group of same class toons?  Or a gathering of folks, 1 from each class?  There is a tiny bit of evidence that makes me believe that there &quot;may&quot; be a connection.  What about that charm quest that gives you an XP bonus for a group of the same class?  More than likely it was made for novelty pruposes, but hey, why not give it a shot?  Granted, I am not gullable enough to believe that this is the perverbial key to EQ gaming, but it may help with some named mobs.  I belive the theory about 1 from each class more so than the full group of the same class.  Just some food for thought..... :rolleyes: <br />
