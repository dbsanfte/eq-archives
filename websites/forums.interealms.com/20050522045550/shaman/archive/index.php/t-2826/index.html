<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen several threads that came up over the last few days that are &quot;dead horses,&quot; including a thread devoted to dead horse riding (they don't ride too well, bit broken in).  <br />
<br />
Is anyone interested in working on FAQ for the shaman class?  I'd like to compile one and then have a link to it somewhere on the main forum page or maybe make it a sticky post on the top of the General forum.  This way we can cut down on some of the redundant questions.<br />
<br />
Please post here, send me a private message or an email (talamay@dementia-faktory.org) if you are interested in helping in creating questions and answers.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i think some of the material there could be a good basis... what i was thinking was a full HTML FAQ document.  a table of contents with the topic types (equipment, spells, character creation) and the related questions.  then hyperlinks to the pages with the answers.  long answers would have a seperately linked page. <br />
<br />
this wouldn't be in a single post that would get lost, but would be linked to another web site, probably on sunmoon's interealms server :).  <br />
<br />
i've started a text file as an outline.  here's the general idea:<br />
<br />
Character Creation and Development<br />
Which race should a beginning shaman be?<br />
<br />
What is the best way to spend AA points?<br />
<br />
The topic would have a link to a seperate page with the answers in that section.  Each question would be a link to an anchor for the question/answer on the topic page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heya Tal.  God knows I've been in enough arguments/discussions on the topics.  :)<br />
<br />
If you need help, I can probably write a decent summary of character creation and development or AA points.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I seem to remember there being a nice start at a FAQ-From-Hell within the past three or four months. Someone -- was it Ysgwythyr? -- put up an outline and we started filling in the gaps. I don't recall how far along it got, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Start one, we've seen lots started recently but nobody finishes one.<br />
<br />
Perhaps people will contribute if it looks like something will come of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i'll put up what i have when i get home.  its only questions categorized right now.</div></div><hr />
