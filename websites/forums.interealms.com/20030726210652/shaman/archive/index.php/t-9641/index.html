More fun from drinal. Included in multiple threads are a music video, a macromedia flash game, and a newly released song. Not to mention legal threats and visits from the COO of Ezboard. All centered around the biggest psycho ever, Tatinae!<br />
<br />
Here is a link to a Picture of our friend, good old Tatinae!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gonna need abit more explination...<br />
<br />
Heres what i understand:<br />
<br />
*something happens*(WHAT HAPPENED?)....Personal information is posted on the boards...People freak out, some jumbled stuff that i dont get and would like to know what happened.  Tat calls the briyan guys house, pretending to be in the FBI.  Bri freaks out, hes only fifteen afterall, and posts some stuff on the boards.<br />
<br />
Whole big spiral from there, i dont really understand much of it.  Care to explain?  Some of the poor photoshops hanging around were funny...though the links you posted have exceeded their bandwidth.  the &quot;recap&quot; was removed btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SuperNinjaPoster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lets start from the beginning.<br />
<br />
1. Tatianae is a normal person who posts alot of arguements on drinal.<br />
<br />
2. Someone posts tatianae's real life name, &quot;mis-spelled&quot;. tatainae flips out and spams the mods wanting it removed.<br />
<br />
3. Morbeas posts her picture while shes having this little fit, and a bunch of people have a good laugh at tats expense.<br />
<br />
4. tat is asked to take a couple weeks vacation away from the boards so it may all blow over....which it does.<br />
<br />
5. a few months later, it appears that tat spams the mods, and some people who arent mods about legal action, and other nonsense unless morbeas is punished for posting her photo. Odean bans morbeas for 10mins...saddly enough morbeas is at work, and never notices .....l-o-l.<br />
<br />
6. odean then bans tat cause he can't put up with any more of her ****.<br />
<br />
7. Tat then comes back with anonymous character names, and continues to troll the boards.<br />
<br />
here's where the funny **** begins.<br />
<br />
8. shinro declairs the 11th &quot;tatianae international masturbation day&quot;<br />
<br />
9. the stock price of klenex and oil of olay skin lotion rises.<br />
<br />
10. Zagdrusiay reprograms a bonking game so that tats head will appear instead of what ever image was suppose to be there...thus the object of the game is to bonk tat's head. Meanwhile every time you bonk it, a random phrase is said like &quot;i'm going to sue!&quot; or &quot;i'll eat your soul&quot;.<br />
<br />
11. Tat remains quite while everyone laughs themselves to the point of tears.<br />
<br />
12. Zag follows up with a music video of tedules ever popular &quot;tatianae you stupid crazy whore&quot;....complete with bouncing tatianae head that helps you follow along with the lyrics. (once again the drinal crowd is moved to tears).<br />
<br />
13. tatianae calls up elaylies mom....why?.....she's mental...who knows why.<br />
<br />
14. Odean posts up tat's 300,000 IP addresses *cheer AOL*<br />
<br />
15. Zand is able to find out the city she lives in, her name, and her phone number.<br />
<br />
16. the night in shining armor Mr. Sdemello swoops in to save our not so fair maiden with baggage tatianae, thus erasing all info, and pictures of tatianae.<br />
<br />
17. The flame boards die down for a bit until Briyan the swashbuckling butt pirate of drinal spams the boards at 1am asking to remove all of his posts as he cries himself to sleep on his pink pillow.<br />
<br />
18. later we find out that tatianae called briyan's mom, and briyan was sent to his room, and received a spanking...he didn't much mind the spanking, but the grounding is rather sad  .<br />
<br />
19. The finger was pointed to morbeas for orchestrating this whole tat bashing.<br />
<br />
20. tatianae's photo shoot with KristalaStormdancer shows a more demonic side of tat rofl.<br />
<br />
and that's about it.</div></div><hr />
