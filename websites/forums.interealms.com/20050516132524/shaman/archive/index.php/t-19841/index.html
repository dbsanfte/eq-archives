<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Which first you think. <br />
<br />
<br />
Im thinking it would be nice to have consistent heals for more but i already have level 1 in healing gift and crit heals are so nice.<br />
<br />
And yea i know is hould have got them a long time ago, but i wa smore intrested in nuking and combat AA's ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are both great AA's but I would give the nod to healing gift for being more useful for us.  From what I have seen of Gates so far, having some serious blast heal power is important.  The difference between a 1300pt tnargs and a 1300+19%pt tnargs isn't usually enough to save someone's life if they are in danger, but an extra 1300pts from a critical heal definately can.  Also, it is cool to crit, so it is a more fun AA to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having a guaranteed 1560 pt Tnargs is much better than a random 2600 pt Tnargs imo.   Unless you are Crit'ing more frequently than every 5 casts (you aren't) you are better off with healing adept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yea, plus i already got one level down in it. With the relase of GoD i find myself making nice AA again, so i guess it doesnt matter, ill have them both soon im sure.<br />
<br />
I guess Gift it is, unless someone else comes up with a reasonable debate why not.<br />

&quot;Having a guaranteed 1560 pt Tnargs is much better than a random 2600 pt Tnargs imo&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Do the AA's work together?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Adept before Gift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm planning to do:<br />
<br />
gift 1<br />
adept 1<br />
adept 2,3<br />
gift 2,3<br />
<br />
In that order.  2aa seems like a low price to pay to get some nice crit &quot;eye candy&quot;.  But adept does seem like a more solid choice over all.  Then finish up by making the crits more frequent with gift 2,3.<br />
<br />
Even if you choose to do it the other way, seems the benefit per aa point for level 1 of either ability exceeds the benefit per aa of subsequent levels, so doing level 1 first seems best.<br />
<br />
Gift 1 = 2% crit chance / 2 aa = 1% crit / aa<br />
Gift 2 = 3% crit chance / 4 aa = .75% crit / aa<br />
Gift 3 = 5% crit chance / 6 aa = .83% crit / aa<br />
<br />
Adept 1 = 2% better heal / 2 aa = 1% better / aa<br />
Adept 2 = 3% better heal / 4 aa = .75% better / aa<br />
Adept 3 = 5% better heal / 6 aa = .83% crit / aa<br />
<br />
Bang for your buck wise, the first two levels of each are best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did what Kazim did, you spend less time with banked points doing nothing at all for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">adept adept adept adept adept. Gift is good, adept is better. <br />
<br />
Tell me what you would find more useful, a regular heal for 1550 on the cleric in your group who is taking some hits, or a crit for 2600 on a level 4 monk in PoK who is begging for a heal so he can go solo in FOB.<br />
<br />
You cannot control when crits happen. You can count on 390 more points of healing power to save a life, but you cannot count on a 1% chance of a critical saving a life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not this again.<br />
<br />
I agree with Jinheim 100%.  Adept is basically useless for our one heal but gift will actually save someone.  There was a huge thread about this not long ago.  <br />
<br />
I also argued constantly with guild shaman and others in my guild about this. I ended up with both eventually, but I did get advanced gift 3 and then worked on RC2, LR5, SC2 and VP1.  Only THEN I started on adept.  I have absolutly no regrets about doing it this way and highly recommend no one waste points on adept until you break the 150+ aa mark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What do you prefer, really improve your healing abilities or slightly augment the capacity of your heals?<br />
<br />
I picked up the healing Gift road and don't regret it. Only difference is, i have Leggings of judgment still, which have a 23% healing augment, so i am biased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">adept before gift, most definately<br />
<br />
I used to think otherwise, until I had them both maxxed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Get both, GoD knows our ****ty healing abilities can use every boost possible ;).<br />
<br />
Seriously though, i went adept, gift, adept, adept, gift, gift. It's mostly a point of different views on the games, do you like big flashy numbers and a slim chance to save someone once per month (maybe once per year someone important :) ) or some constant, but much less noticable increase in your healing power?<br />
<br />
Much like Kazim i tend to get more AAs in their early levels, where the costs are relative low to maximise my 'bang for the buck'. When i get like 3 or 4 of them unfinished, i check what is most important for my actual situation and finish those AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My thought on the issue is this.<br />
If I'm in a situation where I'm chain healing someone, they are in big trouble.<br />
They need to get from whatever their health total is to a &quot;safe&quot; level asap.<br />
Usually this is a result of a resisted slow, and the tank is taking a major beating, especially if I'm the only healer too.<br />
I'm probably stuck in the &quot;tnarg chain&quot; healing cycle until the danger passes for that person.<br />
Healing for 1300 or healing for 1500 doesn't do much IMO.<br />
You are still stuck in the healing chain until something else happens to get that person to a safe health level.<br />
On the other hand, with healing crits, they do go off with a fair regularity.<br />
A healing crit for 2600 going off gives you a chance to get that person to the safe health level where you don't have to worry about them quite so much.<br />
You can try to reslow, and get out of the tnarg chain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think im going to get level 2 gift then work on adept up to level 2 then get level 3 gift then level 3 adept =)<br />
<br />
So i like to see crits, shoot me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I know that Gift works on lifetap style procs, is the same true for adept?  <br />
<br />
The 50pt Vampyre Talon proc I have on my epic is not much but considering that it only cost 300+ AP and how much use I get out of it in Droga it is not a bad investment.  I tank on almost every mob I kill in Droga so it gets a lot of use. The 75pt proc was way too expensive at something like over 1K.  <br />
<br />
If adept does work with this very situational proc more worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Listen to Jujuu. The situation he describes is exactly what you will experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Definately get both, but gift will have a bigger impact on whatever you are using tnargs for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I got advanced healing Gift 3, first .. now i'm meandering about getting random aa's i need, like finishing up radiant cure, and VP and SCS .. after all that i'll go through to advanced healing adept 3 .. <br />
<br />
<br />
on adept vs. gift .. if you raid a bunch .. gift is definately a better deal than adept .. a burst heal of 26-2800 with an improved healing item is definately better than constantly healing for 1500  .. which i come close to anyways with an item.<br />
<br />
a few hundred more hps healed is nice .. but a burst of double the amount every few casts is definately better .. and makes healing random rampage / ae  victims much easier<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I love the eye candy factor of heal crits!  However, GoD has changed my view on these two AA's.<br />
<br />
In GoD I find myself using my blast heals much more frequently and plan to max out gift before getting the final level of adept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I recently got HA/AHA, before HG (which I still don't have any of)...I can definitely see the logic of this thread.<br />
<br />
If GoD had been out before I decided which I was gonna get first, and I didn't detest it, I'd probably have gone HG.<br />
<br />
I figured consistent healing was better than a more rare super heal...but hey, it's not like I want to be in a stituation in which I'm consistently healing with tnarg's anyways!  What do I think I am, a druid/cleric/paladin?  Ha!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Depends on how much AA you're gonna spend.  If you are going to max it out, Healing Gift is the way to go.  A heal doing 1300 or 1560 makes no difference at all when mobs hit for 1k.  I went with max healing gift and love it.  16% chance of a critical heal is nice and goes off quite a bit.  If you are not going to max either out, I suggest using the AAs on something else cause neither is usefull un-max'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>JaeredMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You'll get different answers depending on various playstyles.  I agree with Juujuu and Jinheim about Healing Gift being more useful to shaman though.<br />
<br />
I chose to do HG/AHG first since most of my time is spent raiding where the difference between a 1300 or 1500 heal is virtually nil, whereas when I crit a heal it actually is useful.  Once those are maxxed you'll find you crit heal pretty often which really does make our healing ability much greater, even if it's not 100% reliable.<br />
<br />
Healing Adept will add a few hundred hps to your heals, but if you spend alot of time hunting or raiding in areas where mobs routinely hit for 1k or more that difference becomes more and more negligable.</div></div><hr />

Do they wrok with each other? Or is gift always going to be 2600. I mean adept woking with my scaled avatar sleeves AND working with gift, wouldnt be bad.</div></div><hr />

Now thats a Tnargs worth having ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">the way it works is .. you take your basic heal .. apply the healing adept.. and you have a number .. lets say X<br />
<br />
you take the bonus from your item from this number X<br />
you also take the crit from this number X so you end up with<br />
<br />
(X * 2) + (item healing bonus from just X)<br />
<br />
feel free to correct me .. but i know the crit calculation is taken care of before the item bonus is added .. so you can't really double up on the item bonus .. but you can double up on the adept bonus</div></div><hr />

<br />
how often are you hitting a crit?  like melee crits it's eye candy.  tnargs aint gonna keep anyone alive for long if **** hits the fan crit or no.  if it gets to that you're just holding the line until a CH steps in... if you're looking to invest AAs go smart and go for better mana heals before big number crits</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Most of my healing these days is done spam healing on tanks when bad things happen during raids.  An extra 100-200 hps does me exactly zero in this situation - but a crit might (and has!!) kept that tank up where he normally would've gone down.<br />
<br />
As usual, what works out to be more &quot;efficient&quot; or &quot;effective&quot; on paper is NOT what does us the most good in practice.  (at least not for my own play situation)<br />
<br />
My vote is crits (gift?) 100%.  (though now that I have max crits, I'm of course going for the other)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I'd also put my vote in for hg first.  It's not worth it really at low levels, none of the healing AA's are.  I got exactly zero healing crits between buying hg1 and getting the 4 AA's to buy hg2.  But, when you max ahg and you're critting a significant portion of the time, oftentimes back to back crits, it can really help.  Yes, there are times when you crit and the tank was only 1200 hps down and it feels wasted.  But, hg and being lucky in getting crits has saved my ass a number of times.  The way I sometimes think of it is that a crit will save me the time that I would have taken to cast another heal.  So 1 crit = almost 5 seconds to do something else, such as get a slow on if it's not already been done, or to heal someone else in the group who is taking or took dmg, or get a Q on someone, or just canni if you're low mana.  On the other hand, with maxed aha an unfocused tnarg's does 1547 hps, all the time, every time.  That's an extra 247 hps per cast, which is 1/5ish of a single maxed hit from most of the mobs in GoD, and isn't gonna make a huge difference unless you're casting tnarg's many many times.  An improved healing 4 item will give you on average a 1430 hps tnarg's, which is 117 hps less than you'll get from the 24 AA spent on aha3.  Yes, they stack though.  I'd personally recomend getting hg3, then ha3, then ahg3, then aha3.  Crits can make more of a difference, but more solid heals are something not subject to the rng, and healing adapt makes healing gift crit for more.  I personally did hg3, then ha3, then aha3, then ahg3, and wish I'd done the advanced ones in the other order.  Also of note, ahg is a lot cheaper than aha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Shaman heals are situational.  That means that no answer about how to heal can be right all the time:  sometimes one thing helps you more, sometimes another thing does.<br />
<br />
Shaman heals start from a low baseline.  That means you want to do everything you can to strengthen them.  In the end, you want an Improved Healing 4 item, plus every Healing Gift and Healing Adept aa there is, plus Quick Buff aa to cast Quiescence in 3 seconds, plus Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery so that Quiescence lasts 6 to 7 ticks.<br />
<br />
So what order to you want to get them in?  That depends on the zones and mobs you're playing, how lucky you are, and where you see the shaman's roll in the healing order.<br />
<br />
The advantage of crit heals is, if we get into an unexpected bad situation, we could still get lucky and survive, if a crit heal goes off at just the right moment.<br />
<br />
The advantage of steady augmented heals is, we know what our capabilities are, and can rely on them to take care of business.<br />
<br />
So in an emergency raid situation where only the shaman is available to keep the MA alive, a crit on Tnargs for 2600 can save the day, if we get lucky enough to have one.<br />
<br />
In a normal LDON with an ambush from a random unslowed wanderer, 1600 point Tnarg + 1600 point Tnarg + 1800 point Quiescence is enough to keep the tank alive.  Comfortably.  Reliably.  But 1300 Tnarg + 1300 Tnarg + 1200 Quiescence and hoping for a crit is not  comfortable.  <br />
<br />
Crits are fun, no doubt about it.  Getting a crit heal in to save the tank's life and winning a raid encounter that you were about to lose:  that's terrific fun.  <br />
<br />
But.<br />
<br />
If you have the aa to crit 16 % of the time, that means you get it 1 out of 6 on average.  So when you land in a raid situation where the shaman's crit heal can save the day, you're going to hit a normal heal instead of a crit 5 times out of 6, the MA is going to die, and the raid will be wiped.  But 1 time of 6, you'll get a crit, and get to be a hero.<br />
<br />
Any raid that is depending on the better survivability generated by 2600 hp of shaman healing -- especially, any raid that is counting on the shaman to hit a critical heal at the moment of truth -- is a raid that will fail, 5 times out of 6.  <br />
<br />
In contrast, if you are the main healer / slower in a level 65 normal LDON, 1800 Q and 1600 Tnarg means you know you can get the job done.  Not because you crit at just the right moment, but because you're reliable.<br />
<br />
I know some people who seem to be much luckier than I am.  If I felt like I could count on my luck, I might have a different opinion.  But as it is, I myself would rather count on the steady reliability of 1600 point heals and 1800 point quiescences.<br />
<br />
But.<br />
<br />
If I had very limited time and mostly spent it on raids -- which means it is going to take me a long time to get all  the healing aa -- then I'd give serious consideration to maxing crit heals.  If it's any kind serious raid, you're never going to be the main healer:  but when it all starts falling apart, if you're still standing you will fire off a heal on the MA:  and sometimes it will crit, maybe providing just enough healing for the last cleric's CH to land.  And who wouldn't want to be there for that.</div></div><hr />
