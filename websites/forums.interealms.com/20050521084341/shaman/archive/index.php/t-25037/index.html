<br />
Khati Sha event in AC<br />
<br />
Warder of Death - slowable with magic<br />
Warder of Life - slowable with magic<br />
<br />
A sacrifice<br />
A spell jammer<br />
Reanimated prisoner<br />
all slowable with magic<br />
<br />
Elite Grimling Deathguard - immune<br />
Khati Sha the Twisted - immune<br />
<br />
There are also various minions, some slowable and others not<br />
<br />
I've been curious about this event for some time, I don't think anyone on Saryrn ever attempted it, or if they did I don't think it was succesful.  Is this event broken, active, doable, can anyone tell me more about it please?  SoT has killed almost every boss mob in Luclin, I'd like to add this fella to our trophy wall, but I can't find much info about it.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kilgaroz, I know CA tried the script several months back but found it buggy.  Also think that Team Japan did it once when it was released, other then that he hasnt been done.  The problem is the encounter is fairly difficult for the reward.  You have a encounter harder then Tier 3 PoP yet drops loot of AL/HP ssra level.  Because of this, he hasnt been killed much server wide so info on it is few and far between.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We tried a couple of times back on TT server.<br />
<br />
Basement wasn't a problem, but we just could NOT keep the Sacs from jumping into the pot and chealing the upstairs Warder, whichever one that was. Not enough mez/OT or something.<br />
<br />
Some details at http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2559 and http://beastlords.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=38719</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We tried Khati Sha... last spring roughly?  Late at night on an off night for raids.  Numbers were fairly low.  I remember sadly few details at this point but we did pretty well up until the point of getting to the bossman himself and his 4 guards.  We wiped on about 2 attempts without really pinning down the encounter.  It was just a little to late at night with numbers dropping.<br />
<br />
IMO it is a really neat encounter and terribly overlooked.  All the more so now due to the fact that most will view the encounter as not &quot;worth&quot; the effort for the loot involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Halrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We attempted the event several months ago. We used 5 groups of Ssra/early-VT geared.<br />
<br />
the key as I remember it was to engage the sacrifices with 2 groups  and not aggro the upper warder (thereby not getting the aoe to go off) until you are ready to burn him. DPS was key - especially rogue/ranger melee dps without having to get spells cast time messed up. Once it was dead, these groups ran downstairs to help in the cages.<br />
<br />
Downstairs used 3 groups 1 in each cage and the other split between. Chanters &amp; necros mezzed the skelies, everyone assisted the MA in each cage. We had an MA just taunting the warder (was it mezzed? was a long time ago), he engaged as soon as it popped. I did quick heals on warder MA to make sure the c-heals landed.<br />
<br />
Once that was dead, we headed down into another room and killed the mobs handily, though they were pretty high level (60+), where the door seemed to be bugged. First time we got to this point, the door never opened for us. Second time we got the door opened. <br />
<br />
We went in and fiddled around with the bridge for about a half hour. I think we finally found that someone had to jump into the lava and click on the bridge or on a spot to get the bridge up (no lev in that zone).<br />
<br />
Going across, a turn or two later we found a room of mobs. Having no map of this area, we were kind of winging it. That was where it went wrong. Lots of higher level mobs for that era, we got a bunch of them at once. I remember there being a door in the floor at that point, which we went through... and aggroed Khati &amp; the whole room. I think if we had known the area better, we might have been able to get a good couple pulls out of there, but the monks might get deaded a few times. Well that was the end of our raid, it wasn't pretty... but we got to see it.<br />
<br />
I think after that disappointment, we found that VT was a much more efficient use of our time as we geared up for killing Rallos Zek and getting into the EP's.</div></div><hr />
