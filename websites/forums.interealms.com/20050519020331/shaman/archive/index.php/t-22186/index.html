<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">GoD was released on 10 February.<br />
5months passed since GoD was released.<br />
I realized my friend and I have not enough GoD spells even now.<br />
Probably it came from the fact we do not like GoD content.<br />
Now, Dev team seemed to retune GoD content or class ballance under the hyposis that we have all spell.<br />
They said,'ballance of Nihil has enough speed!, it resolves shman's problem. You have already had a great Heal on time too!' They talk as if we have all spells or can purchase easily.<br />
<br />
So I am just wondering how many spells do you have, guys.<br />
If most of shaman(whom Dev team should target) has 2 or 3 spells, prob the problem to get GoD spell is simply my own small problem.<br />
May I ask?<br />
<br />
P.S. <br />
Following some advices, I changed options. <br />
And thanks to reply to old post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have them all.  I did, however, get them all after the change to the turn in type spells.  Trush and Daluda from KT and slow from sewers (got lucky there)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have GoD for 4 months and I have zero of my spells.<br />
<br />
In light of Jaradis's post, let me clarify my own post so I don't mislead:<br />
<br />
I have no spells because my experiences in GoD have been so boring that I have no interest in going through the effort to get the spells. And quite frankly I'm sick of having to jump through hoops and expend massive time to get spells when I level up. I'm done playing that game, I'll just get my spells if they come my way but I'm not going to spend hundreds of hours chasing them, I dislike that whole system and find it extremely annoying.<br />
<br />
Now I am sorry if that comes off as a rant, I am just trying to explain my previously concise post since people are saying they wanted more specifics on people who don't have the spells.<br />
<br />
The no spells posts like mine should not be interpreted as saying the drop rate sucks, the drop rate might be fine, I think most of us are simply bored/annoyed by GoD content and the system.<br />
<br />
And once again I don't mean to be rude or rant, just people wanted more detail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">have none. and had a luclin spell drop off named in sewers after the change.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You probably should have made 'no god' and 'no spells' two different options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">have GoD, farmed a few trials, have NO spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm with Samanna on this one....<br />
<br />
The option &quot;I have no spells or I do not have GoD&quot; should be separated.<br />
<br />
A person who does not have GoD can't very well complain that he can't get spells if he or she is not first willing to get the expansion set that has them.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warren</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Doesn't matter what options he puts, the poll is going to be flawed anyway.  I can already tell you that the &quot;I have no spells&quot; is going to win by alot, because there is no way to distinguish between the people with no spells that are actively putting in the effort to get their spells but haven't gotten them, and those that do nothing but xp or farm trash in Natimbi and Qinimi, or fight outside of GoD completely and don't have their spells.<br />
<br />
And for the record, I have 2 spells (Balance of Nihil and Breath of Trushar) both of which I got in Kod`Taz farming named hours on end.  The one Eril rune that dropped in one of my groups we all passed on so that the mage in the guild could get her uber pet (hits for over 100 and does some nifty shielding and procs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sure, that's why I asked to make it as another option of the poll ( Pinot Noir failed to make a poll the first time ;) )<br />

<br />
Ok, and about that now:<br />
<br />
Now, Dev team seemed to retune GoD content or class ballance under the hyposis that we have all spell.<br />
They said,'ballance of Nihil has enough speed!, it resolves shman's problem. You have already had a great Heal on time too!' They talk as if we have all spells or can purchase easily.<br />
<br />
The dev team wants to balance us with GoD spells to always make more money. Those who didn't buy GoD (like me) because they were waiting for something more atractive may (see the may :D, almost used might :D) want to buy it now. But your poll is interesting, and can show that even if they want to balance us this way, they should also change the drop rate/way to get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have had GoD since day one and I still have had no luck. Hopefully, now that they have, supposedly, increased the drop rate I'll see a spell in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shoa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Spells drop now relativly often in KT from Nameds,  mostly see 2 Spells drop of a Named. Got Nihil from Ferubi before the Patch, and Trushar after the patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excellent point. Exactly what I was thinking ... which may be why I am swayed to saying, once again .... EXCELLENT POINT!!  ;) <br />
<br />
Without accurate info on how much time spent trying to get the spells any opinions about having/not having doesn't do the topic justice.<br />
<br />
Before the changes to GoD, I had Nihil within 2 weeks of the expansion. Would of had sooner but another shaman in our normal XP group in sewers won the roll for the first drop. Since then I have been slacking and not playing in GoD ... which, I think, may be having a slight impact on my lack of getting the other 2 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have all my spells.<br />
<br />
Nihil I got from Umbiki before any changes to drop rate.<br />
Daluda's I got after they made spells drop in KT, but before they implemented the new runes.<br />
Trushar I got in KT before I got Nihil... I think. It's been a while.</div></div><hr />

I think someone said about 50% of named drop spells and that's probably about right.  But named are pretty random - I remember one 4 hr session where not one spawned, and then another where we killed 4.<br />
<br />
0 spells of any kind in Sewers in about 5 hrs (2 visits). Since revamp 0 spells in about 6 hrs in vxed (2 visits).<br />

Few druid/ranger/beastlord/mage spells from Pooka and Crag but thats it out of virtually 100+ hours in that zone alone farming.<br />

no GoD spells. <br />
<br />
i should point out that i'm not in a raiding guild at the moment, and have been working towards getting flagged for EP+ by doing open raids on my server (Ayonae Ro), but that i also play my 65 sham almost exclusively (meaning in total 2 alts levels 23 and 20 that i have played for a combined total of about 4 hours in last 2 months).<br />
<br />
both of those facts are notable, because i'm committing lots of time to char development, but have also not had a guild to work with to benefit most easily.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
once i get a few more flags and aa i'm going to apply to some of the raiding guilds on my server--have had a couple invites extended but prefer to wait while i work on some of my entirely self-motivated things before i commit to guild structure. maybe GoD will come to me faster at that point.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">At first, thank you very much all.<br />
Your vote is very usefull for me.<br />
And I am so sorry for my stupid mistake to set option.<br />
I should have added 'I do not have GoD expansion'<br />
If I made a proper Poll, that might have been impressive..<br />
<br />
Anyway, that is a little bit interesting  and very helpful for me.<br />
Even if the result of poll came from the fact that most ppl did not spend enough time at GoD contents, there are 2 interpretations.<br />
1. GoD content is not interesting for most of shamans.<br />
2. GoD content is not available for most of shamans.<br />
<br />
At recent re-tuning of GoD, they made easier to access Kod'taz<br />
(I hope it works well..).<br />
I hope all shaman could get 3 spells as soon as possible.(of course me too!)<br />
Because, in my opinion, Dev team will make next expansion and class balance under the assumption that all of us have all GoD spells. :p <br />

3 of us died during the battle. Of the last 3 standing 2 got killed just after they took down the named and linked up the loot. Included with the rune was a really nice melee cloak too.<br />
<br />
The druid kited the adds around and I ran back. I had Spirit of Cheetah already up to do a suicide run if needed. After I zoned in I saw the druid loot it and die a split second later.<br />
<br />
I thought, well, at least someone got it. Still crushed that I missed a chance at Nihil.<br />
<br />
Unfortuantely, the druid had all his bags full and forgot to make room for the rune. It was on his cursor when he died so it got eaten. :(<br />
<br />
Been to Vxed and the sewers quite a few times. That's the only rune I ever seen drop and no one even got it.</div></div><hr />

As soon as they changed the code so you have to kill 20 mobs before any rare pops,  I have seen NO RARES in any expedition I have done.   These are mainly sewer trials and a few tipt/vxed runs.  It's absolutely retarded that there are no rares in any expedition now.  Now it's either you are there to farm or you are there to beat the trial .. and no one wants to just farm they want to win.<br />

<br />
Not good news.<br />
<br />
I checked ... on this.  Basically, the spells were removed and replaced with runes that you can turn in to get the spells you need.  The drop rate was lowered to compensate for the fact that you're now going to always get a spell you need when a rune drops instead of the random chance you had before.  The NPCs that drop the runes/spells hasn't changed.<br />
 <br />
So, yes, the NPCs drop runes, but at a lower rate than they used to drop spells.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, we're already asking why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Juror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">None.  I bought expansion when it first came out.  I hunt in Gates a couple times a week and group sometimes does Vxed, Tipt, or Sewers.  Mainly we are in Ferubi, Riwwi, or Barindu.  Since I am not in a raiding guild, my chances of ever getting spell is incredibly slim.  I wonder if developers realize how many 65 shamans bought their spells.  I did... all of them.  Too bad I can't buy these spells from uberguilds too.  I am sure that they need the money.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Honestly, I am strongly opposed to the way GoD spells are being handled.<br />
<br />
With work, I can get any of my PoP spells without so much as one piece of Elemental gear.  Not.  One.  Piece.  I don't need to look for a drop in the bazaar either.  I simply go to BoT and hunt Named.  Yes, it would take a while, but I can get everything I need in BoT.  A non-locked, &quot;reasonable to fight in&quot; zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I found the differences between GoD and PoP case.<br />
Not only ND or CD, but also accessability to camp poiint is the problem for GoD content.<br />
Please compare the moving time PoK&gt;BoT and Wayfarecamp &gt; Balindu (except Kod'Taz). Please imagine about CR.<br />
It reduces the energy to retry. (we can not even bind in front of Tipt/Vxed trial.)<br />
Of course we could not bind at PoP zone except PoTranq or PoK, but accessability is significantly different.<br />
<br />
If I will try to make a Poll again (I will not do because I am not good at make options...)<br />
I would like to ask about GoD like that.<br />
what is the main reason for you to avoid GoD?<br />
1. accessability<br />
2. zone difficulty<br />
3. poor loot (including PP)<br />
4. poor exp<br />
5. I can not get any member to go with me.<br />
6. I do not have GoD.<br />
<br />
Dev team should collect our impression of their content after they released (especially if they do not play by themself) instead of asking 'how about DVD for EQ2? or How about E-baying account from us?'<br />
<br />
In my opinion, I never refuse to purchase spell at Bazaar.<br />
It is one of the options for the ppl who can not play long enough to wait for Spell drop nor find OPTIMIZED group.</div></div><hr />

I am not asking to zone in and buy them up from vendor at wayfarer camp.  I don't mind working for them.  Spells would actually mean more to me if they took some time to obtain.  I just haven't seen them drop in pickup groups or the occasional expedition / trial with friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">1.) Vxed is not a raid zone. You just need the 4 sewer trials to get in.<br />
A group with a skilled enchanter, modest tank and good cleric + 3 others can do this with some difficulty. This is the first place in GoD where you visibly see peoples skills increasing as they learn how to deal with it.<br />
It may take a month or two, but with a regular group (or even a trusted pick up), you should see your spells <br />
<br />
2.) Sewer trials can be done with any skilled group with reasonable gear. (2nd best LDoN is more than appropriate). I will say it's a little harsh on the casual player, <br />
<br />
3.) If you don't spend alot of time in GoD, you really don't need these spells. The effect they bring to your average BoT/PoV, or even EP group is low.<br />
<br />
4.) BoT is substantially more difficult to get than the others, but that's because it only drops in harder zones, which is the way some spells should be. (ie the game should be a challenge, with adequate rewards for facing the challenge, otherwise purchasing GoD would just add the extra spells to your spellbook.)<br />
<br />
Be happy they have a reasonable drop rate now, pre patch (when I got mine, through no small effort, and a huge amount of luck) they were hellish.</div></div><hr />

I can't find my other post on this thread (/sigh), but I had previously posted that I had no GOD spells. Last night I got my Yxittu (I don't believe I spelled that correctly) stone off a named mob in the Sewers of Nihilia: The Crematory. We've been farming the sewers, Tipt for augs, and just fooling around in Vxed (Ugh, came within 6 mobs of being flagged, lol). It did take me a month-and-a-half to see Balance of the Nihil. Several runes had dropped up until last night, I just have awful dice. It just takes patience and some work, as it should.<br />
<br />
Balthag had it correct. The sewers, Vxed, and Tipt are not raid zones. With solid gear you should be able to handle at least the Sewers, and as he said, LDON gear will suit you just fine. The mobs there hit for less than the mobs in hard LDON adventures (roughly 650-ish, I believe). They're all slowable pretty easily, a few mitigate. 95% of the mobs in the sewers are DB to a 65. Mobs in Vxed and Tipt are DB, White and Yellow cons to a 65, and there are plenty more white/yellow cons in Tipt as opposed to Vxed. You can farm Tipt in roughly 30-45 minutes, kill the first named, and get a pretty decent aug (I have a +30HP/Mana aug, and there is a +2 Mana Regen/+2 Regen aug that drops there as well) very easily.   <br />
<br />
For the record, my guild is not Elemental, we're still working our way through lower tier POP targets. We can easily do a sewer expedition with a 65 Paladin as a tank, and I believe she's 8200 HP buffed. You certainly don't need to be an uber player or a raider in order to enjoy GOD.<br />
<br />
One thing I have a question on Balthag: I don't think you need the four sewer trials to get into Vxed. I do not have any flagging completed, and have been able to enter Vxed and Tipt with no problems. Perhaps the flagging is required only if you wish to advance through to Kod'Taz? Or perhaps one of the folks I group with is flagged, thus allowing the group to zone in?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Tolann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I have Balance and that's it.   I got it in KT off a named in the form of the turn in rune.   I practically lived in GoD working my way up to KT.  Did all 4 sewer trials, some xp in ferubi, completed tipt a few times.   had several runs in vxed.  <br />
I'm seeing KT as being the best place to find the spell rune drops.  sounds like nearly all the named can drop them.<br />
Oh, BTW, I got to KT all on friends and pick up groups.  You don't need a guild to hold your hand to get to KT.  And believe it or not, there's even pick up groups in KT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Ypu only need the 4 sewer trials to start a vxed/tipt trial (ie only one person in the group needs it), 5 unflagged can enter as long as the person who speaks to the nihl has them. Maybe there is an xp only way too, i can't be sure.</div></div><hr />

Zero spells.  I'm one of those guys who actually enjoys  buying spells in bazaar.  Nodrop spells are exploitive of the player base and suck.</div></div><hr />
