<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>michael strong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,.. where do most of you without access to a web server post your files and pictures and stuff for the posts on the various web boards? I have a geocities account that i pay for and ez board will still not import my file link. i just get a red x after i close the link to my files on geocities. i see so many that have them and i have spent much time making fun stuff to decorate my posts,.. any advice? I have made my own community, obviously am admin,.. and enabled posting of pictures and all the rest. I wish i was more in tune to how to do this,.. please help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use the free webspace given to me as a comcast broadband customer for the small things i need to host.<br />
<br />
I also pay $6.95 a mo for a full website that I run. ( hosted by www.jodohost.com, no im not a reseller, just a normal customer, not making anything from this) but thats prolly more that what you are inquiring about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">www.1asphost.com     Totally free, totally unlimited.  They just want you to have a website, though. XD</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KhunDawg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">www.hostitnow.com has a 3 buck a month option if I remember correct.  Real hosting with no BS or catches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a friend that hosts my domain for free, but I used to be very happy with microworld.com - $20 one-time fee, free thereafter. Nothing fancy, just some space and .forwarding for email. My old dart league is still hosted there.</div></div><hr />
