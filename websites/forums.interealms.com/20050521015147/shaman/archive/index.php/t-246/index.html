<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sokath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok does anyone else find the way people ask for buffs at times VERY annoying...<br />
<br />
I don't mind buffing you because that is one of my many jobs, BUT<br />
<br />
1.  I only have 8 spell slots some buffs i have to swap out be patient<br />
<br />
2.  No your Dex buff is NOT more important than slowing and root parking the 4 mobs that were just pulled it will have to wait...<br />
<br />
3.  Simply saying &quot;haste&quot; is not considered a buff request it sounds more like you just learned a new word and are trying to show it off.<br />
<br />
4.  Adding &quot;plz&quot; to the 'haste' helps a little...I suppose.<br />
<br />
I am sure there is more...but its late I am tired and I am a mystic now =p<br />
<br />
Sok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kyrrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You for got the dude after haste plz.  That's what makes it a formal request...   ; )<br />
<br />
Of course the haste gem looks an awful lot like slow....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't like it when strangers walk up and say &quot;SoW,&quot;  but if I'm grouped, I don't mind shortcuts like &quot;haste&quot; at all.   I'm a pretty fast typist and I can generally get out, &quot;hey, can I get a new clarity, mine dropped,&quot; in between slowing mobs, teasing the bards in gusay and carrying on various /cyber conversations with my legions of adoring fans.  But, I know other people are two finger typists who are struggling to mash taunt and kick and if all they can manage is &quot;haste&quot; that's just fine.  I do like it when it's followed by a &quot;thanks&quot; or even a &quot;thx,&quot; but that isn't really necessary either.  We're all there to do a job and communicating needs the quickest, most effective way possible is part of the job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sokath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess thats true Gloriana...I didn't really look at it that way...<br />
<br />
But i have to agree with you SOW! annoye me too =o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree with gloriana, i dont mind at all when groupmates use shortcuts, it helps when someone just says &quot;haste and regen&quot; rather then them waiting or not saying anything, but if im not grouped or someone outside my group asks they better be darn polite or they'll get nada.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand if the tank says &quot;haste going&quot; and he KNOWS we have it on ourselves or pet as a timer we DO get to smack him around. Dems da rulez.<br />
<br />
As for buffs outside of groups in todays game where true newbies are rare it depends on how they ask. IF I decide to buff I do not charge and usually give them &quot;da werks&quot;. <br />
<br />
Before anyone says that's mean I spend a mana bar most everytime I go into newbie zones giving out HoS. HoS because I don't have to worry about getting the too strong for level message and it lasts a long time but they still have to work to kill things.<br />
<br />
As for SoW, haha, try to find someone who isn't these days.</div></div><hr />

*shrug* They want a buff, they can ask for it.  Unless it's a buff I've also cast on myself, I'm not &quot;timing&quot; it, staring at a clock all night is not my idea of fun.  The effort for them to notice a buff is blinking and ask for it is a lot less than the effort of me to keep track of it, especially with deaths and dispells, etc.  It's just an option when you're grouped with me, if you want it, ask.   Is it that big of a deal?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well if I'm a buffing Shaman in a single group, not raids, then it's my job to keep track of TANK buffs and what's up and what's not.<br />
<br />
When I'm buffing I don't need everyone telling me they're gone. I know that and you don't have it because A) I don't have the mana, B) You don't need it or C) It's coming just be patient.<br />
<br />
Tanks are allowed to report dispells only once and it's obvious when someone dies they will need rebuffed.<br />
<br />
ADDED: At least that's how I see it. I only group because there are some things that need groups. Out of preference I would never group and avoid these issues altogether.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It depends on which buff it is as to whether or not they need to tell me.  If it is HoS, Sta, Str, Agi or Regen I use myself as a timer (Str and Agi from JB armour otherwise it would only be Str).  Haste and Dec is a waste on myself.  I agree with Gloriana about the staring at the clock thing - it aint gonna happen.<br />
<br />
With RTarget I actually tell tanks in a raid to ask for ANY buff that is running out - then I can hit my rtarget key and sort them out.  Saves me the effort of trying to target them.  I also have a tell hotkey that lets them know if they move out of range they aint getting the buff again either.   Nothing irritates me more than a tank asking for a buff and then running off to look at a tree or something.<br />
<br />
2. No your Dex buff is NOT more important than slowing and root parking the 4 mobs that were just pulled it will have to wait... <br />
<br />
<br />
Gotta agree with you 100% on that one.  Was grouped in Dok the other day and if I didnt give Dex or Agi or some other stupid stat buff within 5 seconds of the MT asking for it he then sent me a tell every 2 seconds.  I let him try this a couple of times before pointing out that if he tries it again I will un-mem slow/heal etc and only keep up the stat buffs and let the mob beat on his ass instead.  He soon only asked once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You know what's funny, how many of us know that only haste, regen, HP buffs including stamina and SoW for getting away are the only ones that mean squat for the majority of players anyway. I've never seen a fight turned because someone had STR or DEX on. When I'm soloing my warrior I don't go looking for stat buffs but will die for a haste or regen but stat buffs are the first thing they ask for in a group. LOL.<br />
<br />
Now don't get upset I'm talking about the 50ish game and lower. I'm sure the rules change in the high-end game but there is a lot of game to talk about before that comes.<br />
<br />
Edit: Now why didn't my sig show up on this post only? Hmmmm, it's checked.<br />
<br />
Edit again: It looks like only your first post in the thread shows your sig. Good idea..Mystery solved.</div></div><hr />

I think I better go RTFM or supplement as they call it, I never heard of that. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't know, &quot;haste&quot; does sort of get to me after a bit. Maybe it is because its such a short duration spell or something. There are times when it feels like I'm casting it every 10 seconds :p<br />
<br />
I do remember having a conversation once with a tank about that buff. He asked why I wasted it on my pet. When I told him it was my way of timing the spell he said &quot;thats the dumbest thing I've ever heard&quot;. Which confused me, so I asked why. He then said &quot;your pet can't tell you when it wears off&quot;. So he proceeded to say &quot;haste&quot; even after I had refreshed it. I think he had it timed wrong ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should have told him your pet is very smart, it even points at idiots.<br />
<br />
As for the haste I don't know why it couldn't be doubled in time for double the mana or have an improved longer version, the same with regen. I hate that and I even know from a warriors side, it seems like I need them every other pull. I don't usually ask, I figure the Shaman will figure it out when he needs to heal more which isn't cheap.<br />
<br />
Also whats wrong with having buff wear-off messages for GROUP only or maybe a special channel now for raids that automatically reports on names you have eneterd and are members of that channel? Something like that would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wyrm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">what peeves me is when im in the middle of a fight and someone either A) sends me a tell and says &quot;bum some buffs dude, man etc.. or B) i just logged in zoned in and i have 20 ppl asking for every buff i have so they can gain levels &quot;like 10 in 20 mins man&quot;<br />
and oc course my all time favorite hey pl me im a poor newbie. which i reply im usaully busy and then i get the &quot;i have a 60 level so-and so and starts to yell at me. /shrug i dont mind buffing or helping someone control their adds so they can take em all. i just dont like pushy ppl i guess. as far as group it doesnt bother me really, unless they get nasty about it. just my 2cp<br />
edit: of course im talking about low-mid level game here. im only 30 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just so love it when UnknownBuffBeggar_01 expects you to drop everything, run across a zone, or even better yet turn around and run back to where you ran past them a minute ago and give them their Oh so precious SoW!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If your in your single group somewhere and your with people you don't know do you tell them how you handle buffs? If you did it might help a little on my main SK I usually group with a shaman friend and we have it worked out he usually has em all timed if one is dropped for more then a minute I have to ask for it ect ect. But you should try telling them this next time, most of them have never played a shaman or understood the class so maybe that will help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Random strangers, I usually ignore - especially if they just stand there and spam &quot;sow&quot; over and over; or if they're asking before I even get fully logged on.<br />
<br />
In xp groups, it's pretty easy to keep track of what's on &amp; what's wearing off...  Teaming with a monk for many levels, I learned my priority on buffs - HP's, AC, Regen, with Slow &amp; Heal first, as needed.  Stat buffs, only if I have spare mana.  My attitude is simple - I know how much mana I have, and how far it'll stretch; you can ask for whatever buffs you want, but you'll get what I think you need &amp; what I can afford to give.<br />
<br />
As far as group buffs wearing off (raid situations), I usually rely on groupmates to tell me when something drops - normal raid, have Focus, Regen, Aego, Group MR, Clarity, etc, etc...  With so many identical icons, it's hard to keep track at times -  and with all the yellow spam going, it's hard to watch for something to wear off.<br />
<br />
I guess it would be nice if every class had a distinct icon for spells, instead of the generic arm, shield, boot, hand, head and whatever else.  Heck, even if every icon had a class name on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Buff those who are respectful or those whom you have an obligation to buff.  Don't take any **** from them tho.  <br />
<br />
Laugh at the rude.  Almost nothing will be more effective in showing them how uber you are and how worthless they are.   <br />
<br />
Venerable means &quot;Respect mah authoritay beaotch!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Deleah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ah yes.  This is the one reason I hit /role as soon as I pop into FP, OT, FV, or DL for any extended period.<br />
<br />
I will buff a person, np, if I'm just hanging around doing nothing, but when I get the &quot; Hey can you buff me/give me money/give me weapons/pl me?&quot; thing the person will normally get quite the diatribe in /tell.<br />
<br />
Ah well.  The life of a buff machine.<br />
<br />
As for group situations, I try my best to pick one person (normally the warrior or rogue I group with all the time) to time the buff on, and then I ask them to let me know when it drops and I will redo the whole group.  General rule of thumb for me is to re-haste every 3-4 mobs tho, so both methods do work.<br />
<br />
Interesting point on the stat buffs (forgot who said it and too lazy to scroll up), I know that the rogue I group with ALWAYS needs HoS and Str on him, as it brings him damn close to 300+ point backstabs.  This is in the post 45 game tho, and I really don't remember him saying anything about str etc when we were younger.  Mind you, with the days played I have in my shammy, that's not suprising, lol.</div></div><hr />

1) You f**king jerk, it's respectable to buff people.  If you do not give me Sow NOW I will never offer ports with my druid.<br />
<br />
2) Thx for sow now buff me.<br />
<br />
3) I'll give you 5pp to PL me for 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
4) My slows are much better than yours.  You are simply a back-up healer.   (I was level 52 at the time and an enchater told me this one)<br />
<br />
5) You will cast when I say so and will only cast what I say.  Otherwise I will never group with you again.  Shaman are a dime a dozen.<br />
<br />
6) How dare you talk back to me.  You will never make it past level 40 with that attitude.  No one will ever group with you.  <br />
<br />
7) The only thing a shaman is good for is slowing and if you have an enchanter then you don't need a shaman.<br />
<br />
8) We don't need you.  We already have a druid for heals.<br />
<br />
9) Shaman don't get sow, only druids and ranger.<br />
<br />
/quotes off<br />

<br />

<br />
1) It would be nice for the enchaters that happen to be higher level during a raid to let me know that they are attempting to slow the mobs that even blue to me.  Don't they have enough to <br />
do with C'ing, haste, and mez?  <br />
<br />
2) People ask me for buffs while I am soloing and then proceed to clear out all the spawns I was camping while I med.<br />
<br />
3) Level 58 druid casts sow on me overwriting my current buff.  I run slower with it.  Click it off.  Cast sow, run faster.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
I could say more, but this is just a computer game and I already feel better saying what I have.  I don't work with the people in real life nor have to live with them, so really it is not a big deal.  Just wish they didn't play EQ.  ;)<br />
<br />
Toh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">When I get a pushy person asking for buffs, I use the internal timer I was born with.  I buff them when my piss-o-meter reads low enough to do it.  If I'm too pissed, the spell is just going to fizzle anyway. ;)<br />
<br />
When I'm grouping, I tend to group with friends a lot, so they're used to me and I'm used to them.  If a buff goes, they know I'll get to it when I can.  But if I just slapped torpor on myself, I'm going to canni so the ticks of health aren't wasted when I top off my own health.  If someone is making a big pull, I might not want to mem buffs or be low mana right as we get a big mob or a train pulled on top of us.  <br />
<br />
One guy who should know better told me I can buff him when he arrives with the mob.  I've found that can make mobs very angry!  The last thing I need and the last thing the tank who is trying to establish and keep aggro needs.<br />
<br />
Haste, I grew to really hate as a spell and still do.  It's duration is very short, and it's very mana-intensive, and if you are casting it on three to five guys every few minutes(even more, if you're with more than one group) and still trying to keep up a fast pull rate, it can be very trying.  So personally, I don't waste any more mana than I have to by casting it on myself as a timer.  I tell them to let me know when it drops.  Even with torpor and canni 5, I still hate hasting tanks, but generally try to do it.  But if I have to choose between having enough mana to heal someone or give them a more important buff, haste drops to the bottom of the list.  Haste is the main reason I like having an enchanter around in an experience group.</div></div><hr />
