Looking over the 61 - 65 spell list and I just really can't believe some of the absolute crap we got for spells. <br />
Who the hell needs a new Dex buff? I could maybe see for those clerics that melee and like to use Yaulp 4/5 but do the powers that be really imagine 5 cleric/ 1 shaman groups that a group version of the dex buff would come in handy for? I know a parchement or 5 is gonna get wasted on that gem of a spell. Group/Single strength is in the same category. Do they even know what Focus/Harnessing of spirit does?!?! And while I am on the subject can someone PLEASE explain to me why the new single target focus upgrade has a SHORTER duration? And ***(!!!!!) is up with the group version having LESS hps??? <br />
Agility buff upgrades maybe.<br />
Strength buff upgrade. no<br />
Dex buff. same<br />
AC buff upgrade ok. <br />
Stamina yes. <br />
Group disease/poison yes. <br />
Improved disease slow? Doesn't gaining levels matter anymore? It does for Turgurs, why not PoI?<br />
New nuke, whatever.<br />
New DoTs. Yes!<br />
Better root, well ok.<br />
New pet. Finally!<br />
Hps buff. Gimme one that makes sense please. <br />
<br />
What a bleh.................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We had this thread 2 months ago, and pretty much came to the conclussion that stat buffs really suck except for sta and that 1/2 our spells for PoP were wasted cause they were stat buffs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only thing that bugs me, is the duration on the 61 to 65 buffs. Less than it should be. That's why I'm not going to level above 60.</div></div><hr />
