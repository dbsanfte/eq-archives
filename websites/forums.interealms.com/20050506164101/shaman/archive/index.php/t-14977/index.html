<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zazk Buffurbootay</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need some advice. I went through a period of inactivity for a few months and need to get advice on best path from here. I am 60 with all spells ( no ancient ) and have the resources to get the rest of the spells trough 65. Questions are<br />
1. go to 65 now ? ( for better resists and spells) <br />
2. hang at 60 and get cann 5 ( have rs1 only atm )<br />
3. 2 boxing with a 60 sk viable for exp or is grouping now the thing to do?<br />
<br />
I appreciate, in advance, the help from me colleagues.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This question has been much discussed, but the consensus seems to be to level to 65 unless you are a big soloer and like the old-world zones.<br />
<br />
If you plan to be grouped in POP, levels are very important.  And frankly this is the fastest route to 65 anyway.<br />
<br />
With the XP changes it's now possible to get decent AAXP in pre-POP zones so this advice is even more true than it was before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you don't raid in pop, then don't level up to 65 because AA just goes up much faster at 60 where you can rip through stuff in pov or cod with your shk+shm in a group. (I don't know how well he'll tank, but he can pull) and seb xp solo was about 1.5-2% per kill AA at 65, you 2 boxing should get more like 3% per kill + amazing loot.. <br />
<br />
If you raid a lot, you also need to consider the highest shaman in the guild so you can land your spells.. nothing like him slowing something then dying only to have slow wear off because yours bounces..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, but the argument for levelling to 65 is<br />
<br />
   A) AAXP isn't that much slower at 65,<br />
<br />
   B) You can actually GET A GROUP in CoD or PoV at 65, and time spent LFG sucks.<br />
<br />
I'd still level first.  In the time it takes to get Base6+MC3+CannV you could easily be 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If fun == efficient for you then level to 65.<br />
<br />
I think AA is fun so I have a about 80 and now I am going to 65 because the price of spells is way down and I can afford them.<br />
<br />
Do whatever you think is fun.</div></div><hr />
