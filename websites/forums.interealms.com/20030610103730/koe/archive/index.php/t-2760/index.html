<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well Hammer isn't in today and from what I've been told so far by his assistant is that his wife is in labor.  I'm sure I'll know more later and defintely by tonight but wanted to let everyone know that the time has come.<br />
<br />
This will be their 3rd child (another boy) for Hammer (Greg) and Kairris (Trish).  Other kids are Samantha (4) and Nicholas (2).  Trish will very much have her hands full and I know that Greg's online time will be reduced significantly for some time to come.  I'll post here with more info as I get it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well still no baby Hammer, she was in and out of contrations yesterday and is probably going a bit nuts right now especially since he made the HUGE mistake of coming into work today.  <br />
The inlaws are at the house so I guess he can get away with it for now (/shiver).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hammerstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yup, Still waiting on the pop.<br />
<br />
Anyone know the spawn time for BABY_03??<br />
<br />
For all of you frustrated with camping RARE_MOB_01 think of this I have been camping this little bundle of joy for 9 months now and still no pop. All of this in an increasingly hostile enviroment where I went from ally to Scowling in the matter of a few days hehe. Just kidding Trish is doing great but she is frustrated and wants to have the baby already. hopefully soon !<br />
<br />
I will keep y'all posted :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Here's hoping you dont wind up walking her up and down the halls to get that baby to spawn, Hammer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Luck !</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
All I can say is good luck and enjoy guys :) Hope the little one comes along soon :)</div></div><hr />
