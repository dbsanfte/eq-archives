<br />
It used to be if a mob was killed by a dot you'd just see, &quot;Mob_01 died&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now you get, &quot;Mob_01 has been slain by THE SHAMMY&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yeah ... the shammy killed it.<br />
<br />
Again.<br />
<br />
Heh.</div></div><hr />

you have slain trashmob_52</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Plus its great for showing the Melee up as far as DPS goes !!!!!!<br />
<br />
Most melee are using parsers during fights and calling their DPS figures in guildchat, so I decided on our next VT crawl, I would attempt to show them up ......<br />
<br />

These DoTs were maintained from 85% health to 0%, which clocks me in at around a sustained 200dps  :eek: <br />
<br />
http://www.legacyofages.com/members/ShammyDPS2.jpg<br />
Hehe, started a bit earlier on Aten Ha Ra (at around 91%) and started getting summoned around 15%!!!<br />
<br />
Was a fun outing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nice work Tekno, way to represent!!<br />
<br />
Kudos to you on somehow keeping 8 dots up on a mob for that long, and extra kudos to your guild's main tank for keeping up with the aggro generated by 4 poison dots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe :)<br />
<br />
Was bored on that VT outing, we had plenty Shammies there ....<br />
<br />
Um, I was beaten up pretty good (lived thru both, due to Cleric fast switch hotkeys!!!!)<br />
<br />
Both mobs are quite gimpy compared to PoP mobs .... There were lots of misses from both VT mobs, but my AC was 1452 with 6.1k HPs and LR5.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aknok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did you really keep all those dots up ALL the time ? We all have some lucky ticks where all dots eating away at the same time. Id be interested in seeing an overall parse of fight like:<br />

<br />
*) Excluding lifeburn since it will only run for 7 ticks and can not be maintained.<br />
<br />
+) This is actual DPS during entire duration of fight, not just merely sum of DPS of each DOT, not bad ehh ?<br />
<br />
Admitedly I was running on fumes towards the end. <br />
Could have done a little more dmg if I didn't have to reposition pet during fight.<br />
Pet damage not included btw, but it IS rather gimp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Evil guild-necroes should stay out of the Shaman hunting grounds :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe,<br />
<br />
By the time the mobs are debuffed and I got nothing to do, is usually around 85-90% mob health .... so technically wasn't the entire fight .... <br />
<br />
There is also the initial cast times for each of the DoTs ....<br />
<br />
I was refreshing each DoT before it ran out (so yes, it was sustained once I got into the rhythm of what to cast when - which I had already worked out on the yard trash nameds on bottom floor).<br />
<br />
It generates an immense amount of aggro :)  I had the mage hate reducer item on, and I had a chanter in the group chain hate reducing me .... and I still ended up tanking the mobs at the end .....<br />
<br />
Its more of a &quot; look what we could do in theory &quot; discussion, if we didn't have to keep heals, slows and buffs memed ..... I just took it one step further from theory .... its possible, but it takes all your spell slots, generates massive aggro and still doesn't significantly put your sustained DPS way out there (I am sure if other classes went all out in a similar fashion, 80% of them would out damage us :) ....<br />
<br />
Hehe, only one upside to Shammy DPS .... finished most fights with above 50% mana left  ;)  (was canning as fast as possible between DoT refreshes though - mainly cause I was unsure how long I had to sustain them for ) ...<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I guess that's more reason for guilds to recruit more shaman. The extras can be used for DPS :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>pwredby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the only problem w/ our dot dmg is we get summoned pretty fast stacking dots, where as necros can FD after they stack their dots, and then stack more dots, and FD again to lose aggro. On most boss fights, Seru, VT bosses, Emperor SSRA. I usually put in Saryrn, Bane, Pox, Ultor. I would say usually around the 4-5th time puttin in those dots I get summon. I basically just stack all 4 on them. If I only do Bane and Saryrn, usually by the 6-7th time around I'll get summon. Therefore we usually don't get to do much dmg. Unless sony decides to lower aggro rate. When I solo Ogres in PoTactics I usually put Ancient Bane, Saryrn, Bane, Ultor, Pox, since they don't summon and and I keep them rooted I can put out made DPS, but any time other than solo, my DPS drops way low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ooogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had the mage hate reducer item on<br />
<br />
As someone who has a high level mage I have to ask....what mage hate reducer item? If you are talking about the earing then that's just a really old rumor. The earing actully is a mana preservation item for DD's.<br />
<br />
Nice job on the DoT stackage btw. Very cool to see.  :D</div></div><hr />

Admittedly, this isn't an option for everyday use but maybe for parsing purposes (like Aknok mentions), this might be useful?<br />

<br />
That's probably the only reason I'd wanna take Amorae to PoA :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sadly my guild typically has ~10 necro's and 4 shaman on a raid. If each of those wants to generate some DPS that's a mighty two DoT's each. That's before considering debuffs, druid DoT's and DoT effects which reduce the total even further.<br />
<br />
30 debuff slots on the mob is another very real limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bah!!!<br />
<br />
Dodgy mages .... when the effects first came out, I was told the earring was a hate reducer .... never actually thought to follow it up ....<br />
<br />
Ok, so I just had a chanter hate reducer up  :p <br />
<br />
As far as aggro goes, I got a heap of it, but our clerics just transfered heals to me .....<br />
<br />
Once on aggro, it was hard to channel DoTs thru the hits, and admittedly, one or 2 wore off as I was trying to put them back on .... but none of them were down for more then 1-2 ticks ....<br />
<br />
It was just a theory I was testing, and like I said, I do not doubt that 80% of classes could probably outdo that DPS if they went all out too ...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">just dig up my parse from VT dps :<br />
<br />
TXD : 43k damage, 7minutes, 101dps . immune to disease dot, so use poison dot and die<br />
mini Aten : 41.4k damage, 8minutes, 83.8 dps ; 7% nuke dps , other dot<br />
Klass : 47.6k damage, 12minutes, 63dps . 25% nuke dps, 5% melee dps , other dot<br />
Klass : 63.8k damage, 11minutes, 96dps . 20% nuke, other dot<br />
<br />
I got summon after mob enrage during TXD, Mini aten, and 2nd Klass, so that is max agro I can do to make me 2nd high agro list; that is agro with only 1 poison dot + other dot(disease, epic, rain) since you can't handle agro form 2 poison dot, I been try use 2 dot + disease, but alway got summon after 30-50% and got too much agro and have to stop doting or die</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, not really. There are 15 debuff slots? 20? Not sure. But let me tell you this: I stopped casting epic dot on mobs because other peeps dots (and mine also) didn't take hold. Sorry to burst that bubble.<br />
<br />
So long<br />
