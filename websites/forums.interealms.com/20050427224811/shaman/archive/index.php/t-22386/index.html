<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got a couple of my friends together last night and we were really bored, so we went lookin around for some dragons/big nameds to kill. Klandicar was the only one up. We figured that trying him would be more fun than anything else we could do at the time.<br />
<br />
Group makeup:<br />
Me(65 shm, 2 insta clickies)<br />
65 war(ele gear, 9500hp, I'm 2 boxing, 2 insta clickies)<br />
65 Druid, elemental gear, 150ish AAs, no clickie<br />
65 cleric(crappy gear, 19 AAs) no clickies<br />
65 chanter(2 boxed by cleric, 300ish AAs, but cleric has never played him and hates 2 boxing) and no clickies<br />
<br />
We started out doing great, we decided to pull kland towards the west shoreline so we wouldn't get any adds. I went around and ended up pulling 2 dragons that may have added during the fight and some of the burrowers nearby.<br />
Now the path to Kland is clear and I pull him towards the shore, pulling with malos, and kite him around till the group is fm. I get him to the group and immediately agro him with the warrior. the chanter tashes and then I start slowing. I got lucky and slowed him on the second attempt, and it was all goin good. about 4 minutes later I started reslowing him, which took me about 5 or 6 tries. The druid emptied his mana bar early in the fight with his nukes, and by this time Kland is about about 55%. The cleric then says he's oom, without any fore-warning, and I start blasting heals away at everyone. By the time I was getting lom, we evacced, and kland was at 40%.<br />
<br />
Last night was a fun night, and we plan on going back till we kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khrent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ya we attempted him to with 6 guys, 65 ele/time beastlord X2, Time/God Paladin 10k buffed hps, 65 shaman with vt gear and a cleric/druid with bazaar gear.  It was just me and my brother so we couldn't keep the clickies up enough to stop the dispell so we got him to 40% and then the hastes wore off and we had to evac at 30% since he was barely dying and we were running oom.  This first 60% probably went faster than the last 10%, dispell is the thing that got us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">we added a necro to our group and were able to take him down without any problems whatsoever. talk about some fun =)<br />
<br />
grats to the druid's twink monk on a ST key that will never get used =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cremora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">killed klandicar by myself, 2 chars<br />
warrior + shaman, took about 25 minutes or so.  <br />
 had journey walk stick on war to tash kland, then kept him slowed. once slowed rampage isn't too bad even on a shaman.  trushar on my war most of fight, daludas shaman if she takes a rough ramp. finished the fight with 70 mana or so. <br />
war has vanazir + 270 aa<br />
        ~8800/2150 unbuffed?<br />
shaman has TA + rosrak tunic + eterno mask ~ 280 aa <br />
        ~4800/5900 unbuffed? <br />
time trushar/quies on people well so dispell doesn't strip it, and its np <br />
right clickies is must obviously</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JuyshinRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">did kland with 3 people:<br />
<br />
myself (TA, time+ geared)<br />
65 paladin (mix of velious, luclin, planes gear)<br />
65 ranger elemental geared<br />
<br />
i was bored and decided to go find something to do, made my way to WW and found kland up. i decided to see how few people i could do it with and decided to play around with him solo (knowing i would have no chance). malos, run to dn, zone. back out, trushar myself, stand under him and malosinia, click ta while malosinia refreshes, malosinia, repeat until ive taken too much damage and have to zone to dn again. finally get malosinia to stick after a few attempts at this. trushar myself, stand under him, being to try to slow... sticks pretty quickly to my surprise even without using tash stick.. awesome haha. by this time    <br />
the other 2 are already on the way, i try playing around solo by pulling him to dn zone in but never gonna happen, but once hes slowed its was real easy to keep him slowed until they arrived.<br />
<br />
pre-slowed kland is a joke, even with a not so well geared paladin tanking by todays standards....  could definately see duo with a well geared warrior... without ranger dps/limited healing i wouldnt have had the mana to keep myself and paladin alive for a longer fight.</div></div><hr />
