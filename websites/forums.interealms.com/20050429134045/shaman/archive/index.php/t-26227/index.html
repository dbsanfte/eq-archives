<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My mage is level 57, almost entirely arcane specced, with enough fire to get pyroblast.  I spent 10 minutes killing level 56 and 57 yeti in Winterspring.  I managed to kill 12 yeti (simple melee type of mobs.  negligible spell effects), including the need to rebuff my int and ice armor buffs midway.  This is constant killing, basicly pulling almost the moment I have my health and mana back from food and drink.  If another person wasn't hunting in the same area, I could have squeezed another 1-2 mobs because of a bit of searching for another pull at one point.<br />
<br />
Can some paladins, and other classes as well, do a similar comparison?<br />
See how many mobs you can kill in 10 minutes with heavy mana usage and food/drink if possible.<br />
Also see how many mobs you can kill in 10 minutes by stead &quot;slow&quot; killing without need for large amounts of food/drink if possible.<br />
(shaman are an example of a class that can do either, which is why I mention it).<br />
<br />
A mention of weapon, ac, important stats, and talent types would be useful too.<br />
<br />
My mage can kill 1 mob every 50 seconds, including the need to drink back mana and eat for health.<br />
Isn't this a similar kill rate to paladins, who take about 45-60 seconds per kill, with zero downtime?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why don't you leave Bigfoot(feet?) alone man huh? They are just misunderstood.<br />
<br />
Will try at some point, although I didn't like killing yeti if I remember, been a while since been there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mill, <br />
you probably hated the freeze blasts that hit you all the time when fighting yeti...<br />
<br />
Juujuu<br />
From a Shaman perspective, I believe I could match the 50 sec kill rate, maybe beat it, but would need to take food/drink breaks to do it...<br />
<br />
Generally, having just finished all the Winterspring quests except for Ursius (I cannot solo that puppy yet, heh...tried and ended up wolfing and running), I found that usually, I was taking around a minute a kill, solo, mostly just melee, maybe the odd lightning shield...but thats because I wasn't in a rush and didnt want to waste drinks...can't just summon them up like a mage can.<br />
<br />
Will try to find my logs for that timeframe and see if i can get some exact times, but I wasnt really focusing on killrate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Okie i'm lvl 60 paladin. Two hand damage specced.<br />
<br />
Using a heavy hitting 2h mace 50dps but fits perfect with the seal of command procs do to the slow but high weapon damage. <br />
<br />
I killed 11 in 10 minutes using consecration alot for the heavy mana usuage. <br />
<br />
Went 1h and shield and I got through 8. <br />
<br />
Remember i'm set up to be higher end of paladin damage with my weapon setup and skills with 2h. When i was 57 I was using a 45 dps sword with no stats and had to actually heal some than. Now I have trinkets that proc and absorb damage so healing need wasnt exsistant. I was free to do as much damage as i needed and just ate a little when mana was out.  <br />
<br />
I'll do it again in a bit in a more normal 2h fashion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">bet I could get 20 or so in ten minutes. Good thing I am way too drunk totry. right now. will though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My 57 shaman has the 45dps 2h staff reward from the Maraudon quest.<br />
I'll try the same thing when I can.  (hopefully today).<br />
I'm fairly confident the damage output over time will be comparable.<br />
I just picked the yeti because they were the same level I was, and I was killing them already at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It takes me longer to run to the next mob on my rogue than it does to kill it.  I think Mill's right, I could pretty easily do an even con every 30 secs if there were 20 mobs available.  If they're caster mobs I could probably do 30 mobs in 10 min, maybe more- honestly the fights are lucky to last 8 secs, most are 4-6.  When a caster starts at 30% health after a crit ambush the curtains are already falling.  There simply isn't enough time in 4-6 secs to take any significant damage to slow you down.  <br />
<br />
The balance to this of course is that there aren't many areas with enough mobs to feed your blades without downtime waiting for respawn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
arent there some 54 and 55 yetis in western Winterspring?  (The only time I stopped to kill there I got an owlbear and a chimera to add, and I didn't seem to resist the chimera's lightning bolts, so I left in a hurry.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want the ones on the fellwood/wintersping border. They are 54-55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The problem with paladins isn't their dps when soloing, it's that they can't hold and keep agro and function as a main tank in instances. The reason you hear Paladins complain about dps is because with no taunt button, dps is their biggest chance of being able to taunt and do their job and not be relegated to the role of plate-clad druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My 54 Hunter with shardtooth bear pet kills even con 54 owlbears, thistles, and furbolgs in less than a minute each.  Even faster if they are Pathfinders, because they fight from a distance with their bow and I can open up with aimed shot, if it crits (+1200 about a third of the time) then they are at 2/3 health to start the fight.  I've got all AH or common drop gear, but do have 323 agi, +25 (agi pot since I'm an alchemist) which gives me a constant 348 agi.  Once my pet levels up to 54 (53 now) and I upgrade my bow, I should be able to take an even con (54) down in 45-50 seconds or so.<br />

Dome data from a hunter would be nice, but a single kill is not the issue.<br />
<br />
the question here is one of number of even con kills in a 10 minute (or longer) period.  For mages and other casters, time to drink is part of the equation.  For melee, time to bandage is part of the equation.<br />
<br />
As a hunter, you may (or may not) go through your mana bar and need to drink.  You do need to feed the pet occasionally.  so a longer period is going to be more informative for comparison.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
side note - I wil be off line until Sunday night, so wil not be able to make a comparison withmy druid until then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here we go with even cons again heh.<br />
<br />
The only level 60's I've fought recently were the stupid elves up in Eastern Plaguelands (58-60's) actually.  Not sure I can solo one of them without potioning during the fight, let alone kill 10 in 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
The crap people will complain about /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Since you asked for more hunter info, I'll provide the following.  Seems that I was being overly conservative in my first post (or just not paying attention).  I went back out to my favorite spot in Winterspring last night and killed furbolgs just for grins.  I had the following results:<br />
<br />
Level 54 NE Hunter with a level 54 Shardtooth bear pet, good equipment, nothing uber, need bow upgrade (several better ones available at my level, have not finished Mauradon yet for bow off of Princess, for example).  Self buffs only, plus an agi +25 potion, since I am an alchemist, for total agi of 348.  Did not use intellect, defense or firewater potions for this test run.  Full Marksmanship build for max ranged dps.<br />
<br />
lvl 54 mobs - 10-15 seconds to kill, no downtime between mobs for 10 mobs, don't have to run much since I can pull with bow from 41 yds out, usually only waiting for bear to reach target.  Can kill pathfinders in less than 10 secs since I can open with aimed shot without worrying about them charging me.<br />
<br />
lvl 55-56 - 15-25 seconds per kill, again, no downtime, varys depending on type of mob, Totemics (shaman) drop faster than Den Watchers.<br />
<br />
In order to go non-stop for 10 mobs I have to restrict my special shots to conserve mana, and perhaps heal the pet once or twice.  If I use potions and bandages, then it is non stop for at least 10 mobs.  My regular shots do about 150-200 hp damage, crits are 400-500 damage, and aimed shot is +1,200, on these mobs.  Have cleared both camps in the entrance area, 15-16 mobs, in less than 15 min without really trying to do so as fast as I could.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I did this test a few times with my shaman last night.<br />
My shaman is level 58 (didn't buy the spells yet though).<br />
My shaman has about 2300ac.<br />
My shaman is wielding a 52dps staff.<br />
I went through 12-13 of the same mobs I tested with my mage when I was doing basicly the straight melee method.<br />
All I was doing was meleeing, healing myself, rebuffing windfury, and occasionally dropping some totems if they would last long enough to go through 2-3 mobs.<br />
I also tried doing the same with drinking back mana and burning it asap into stormstrike/earth shock/lightning shield.<br />
I just barely killed 12 mobs in the 10 minutes.<br />
I didn't buy any food though.<br />
If I had, I would have saved a bit of time instead of healing myself after getting FM, and would have easily squeezed in another mob.<br />
<br />
So from what I've been seeing, most everyone has the same long term kill rate over time.<br />
Still need a rogue to post what their results are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I decided to give this test a go myself while factioning up for entrance to winterspring, killing the 54/55 level Deadwood Firbolgs.<br />
<br />
Stats as follows :<br />
55 Warrior - fury spec with 7 in defense, and 5 in arms (improved parry/improved defense, 2 in toughness)<br />
Dual Wielding 35.9dps mainhand, 34.5 dps offhand, both with +6dmg from blacksmithing stones.<br />
AC 3546<br />
HP 4339<br />
Str 201<br />
Agi 132<br />
Sta 326<br />
no buffs on me.<br />
<br />
From start of one kill to start of next, average 45 seconds. Had to stop and eat every third mob or so. Used one potion on a triple pull. Killed 12 in the 10 minutes, probably could have gone an extra one if I hadn't had to run around looking for respawns. <br />
Each mob probably took me down 1/5th health unless I had a particularly unlucky run.<br />
Stayed in battle stance the entire time except for the triple pull where I went Defensive.<br />
<br />
Looking at those stats, in straight one on one combat with equal level mobs, I can pretty much mow straight through them one after the other. I'd be curious to see an equivalent test on primarily arms or defensive specced warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Looking at the comparisons so far, I'd be willing to wager that the kill rate is about the same no matter what your build.  WoW character builds attempt to be balance around damage dealt, damage taken, and downtime between fights.<br />
<br />
As a warrior or paladin, you take little damage, have little/no downtime between fights, but kill slower.<br />
As a mage, I kill fast, take sizable combat damage, but have big downtime between fights.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a rogue comparison in here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When I was grinding with my rogue using a dagger crit build, I could probably kill 7-8 mobs before bandaging in my late 40s.  The 50s were a bit slower, probably only killed 3-4 before bandaging.  This was with remorseless attacks and since then I've respecced to a assassination/subtlety build using swords.</div></div><hr />
