<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, it's not really an issue any more, but I have found that when I /assist the puller, I go into attack mode on the mob. No problem, he's too far away; I slow, switch targets, slow others if multi-pull. I then might hit F2 to cast on another group member - but I'm still attacking, so I hit my autoattack key. Problem is, this stops my attacking AND targets the nearest NPC. Pretty odd to me. I don't recall this happening like a month ago, but now it does.<br />
<br />
I have since edited my eqclient.ini file to read AttackOnAssist=FALSE, but I was wondering if this was expected behavior - turn off attack and the nearest NPC is automatically targeted.</div></div><hr />

Had exactly the same problem a few months back.  The deal is that a while ago, they added the ability to toggle between your last two targets and that is mapped to the ` key (apostrophe above the tab key).  To get rid of this behavior, you need to remap your keyboard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OMG, just read this, thanks SOOOO much, I'll check this out next time I'm in game!!! And I do use the '`' (left tic) for attack, rather than the 'A' key. It's nice and handy, right there by escape and everything... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boilerterry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/assist off will also set you to no auto attack rather than tinkering with the ini, only have to issue the command once, it is saved</div></div><hr />
