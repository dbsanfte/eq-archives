<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I sometimes experiment, and try things that aren't supposed to be done by shaman (at least as a trade skill, whatever)<br />
<br />
Since VI decided to let everyone make celestial temper, with no skill checks, I decided to try a few other things.<br />
<br />
The one thing I tried immediately, for use with the new pottery items, was to make my own white lead (supposedly rogue only forever).  Guess what?  It isn't.  Dunno if all classes can do it, but Shaman definately CAN make the white lead component for Divine Glaze, required for imbued idols, etc.<br />
<br />
Just thought I would pass that little discovery on for anyone that might care.  Have yet to find anything else of value.</div></div><hr />

The white lead, or the celestial temper?  I know about the temper being done by anyone, but have never seen any documentation about anyone other than rogues being able to do white lead.  Not here, not EQ Traders, nor anywhere else, for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have made white lead several times.  You buy the ingredients from the rogue vendor and combine them in a mortar and pestle, but anyone can do it and you'll never fail.  And you're right, it doesn't say that on EQ Traders but it should...I'll poke Niami and get it updated :)</div></div><hr />
