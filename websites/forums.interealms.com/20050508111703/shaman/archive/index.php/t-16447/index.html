Well go check Lucy &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4095&amp;source=Live&quot;&gt;and you'll see&lt;/a&gt; there's no resist adjust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Many spells behave very differently in pvp on players compared to npcs.<br />
<br />
Frequently simply experience is the only way to know.<br />
<br />
Anyone tried it on a player yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It lands, sometimes.  If they're rootable, they're baneable.<br />
<br />
Once it sticks nobody has time to get it off it pretty much auto runs full course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tested it during beta on someone with 150 MR after malos.  Resisted it 5 times in a row before I gave up.</div></div><hr />

Hrmpf!<br />
I was really looking forward to this spell seeing it is a curse based Spell.<br />
But hell why is it MR resistable if it is a curse? DO the NPC Ae's being resisted by mr? No!<br />
<br />
Seeing as our whole dots are kinda pointless on RZ most of the times, I was really looking forward to this dot:p<br />
<br />
Am I the only one who thinks this spell should be a unresistable Curse?<br />
<br />
Back to Dots getting resisted most of the times /shrug<br />

I believe Korucrust (however you spell it) has something to say about that!</div></div><hr />

Got me curious there, as the only Curses I encounter are Luclin/pop elemental etc. and I dont seem to remember to resist a curse..<br />

<br />
he has two AEs, both curses.  one is disease based, other is magic based.  both give curse counters.<br />
<br />
And i'm using lower case letters at the beginning of sentences, so it's time for me to sleep now.   :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  And I'm not trying to be rude (a rarity!), but what makes you think that SOE thinks about PvP at all when they're throwing up new content.  PvP balances to new stuff has always come after it's been introduced, or not at all.</div></div><hr />
