<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Woolwich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me or are there REALLY no PoP maps out there except the Plane of Knowlege map contained in the manual?  I mean, neither eqatlas.com or eqmaps.com has any PoP maps but the POK one.  Did Verdant tell the map sites not to put out new maps because of copyright or EULA infringement?<br />
<br />
Anyone know where to get good PoP maps other than these sites?<br />

you can say a lot of things about the safehouse, but the mods are kind of anal about keeping things in one place (this is the third or fourth thread on the glade, for example, which is asking about where the pop maps are; i know this because i have now posted this same response 3 or 4 times; on safehouse those threads would get automatically closed and forwarded to the &quot;main&quot; thread on said topic) so my suspicion is that any map that anybody has shared with the safehouse folks will end up in this thread.</div></div><hr />
