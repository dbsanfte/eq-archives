<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A newly reborn Warrior took his steps out into Everfrost and began his journey in Norrath.  His hunting partner Xirius, a Barbarian Shaman and he walked the lands of Everfrost looking for adventure whereever it took them :) (with the experience of a Level 6 Warrior from Phase 4 Beta, well, not really exp, but I knew how to fish really really well in Beta :P)<br />
<br />
The path he followed was long and rough, taking him through many difficult times, but still he remained strong and vigilant, meeting tons of new friends and adventurers that he fought with every step of the way.  Most of all, he's considered himself very honored to have and been fighting along side his guildmates past, present and future who are the most honorable and noble on the Veeshan Server.<br />
<br />
Tonight, that Warrior reached the pinnacle of the Warrior class.<br />
<br />
Waran Rhinelander, &lt;B&gt;WARLORD&lt;/B&gt; of Halas.<br />
<br />
____<br />
<br />
I'd like to thank every member of KOE for playing a HUGE supporting role in Waran's advancement though the levels.  I've learned a great deal amount about the high level game and being a Warrior from the tanks in the guild.  I can't begin to thank you enough for being there when I needed it.<br />
<br />
A special thanks goes to Rizz.  I could have never made it to 60 without his leadership and training to become one of the High level tanks in the guild.  Rizz, like I said in my tell to ya, you've been a great teacher, a great leader and a great friend.  Thank you so much :)<br />
<br />
This part goes to Daelen, hehe.  Bro you've been there for me through thick and thin.  We met a week after the game came out and have been grouping together ever since.  I could have never made it this far without you at my side.  First as Aanlain, then as Boladorn, now as Daelen.  You truely are a great friend, thanks bud!<br />
<br />
As for every member of KOE, my previous guildmates and friends of LOA and my numerous friends that I haven't listed individually...YOU are the reason I play this game.  Each one of you are incredible people and incredible friends.  Without you, this game, this online world wouldn't be home to me.  Thank you for making this game so bright, and so much fun for 2 1/2 years and beyond :)<br />
<br />
As for Waran, you'll be happy to know that I'm committed to leading more raids (Keep looking at the events board ;), hosting many many more RL St. Louis Gatherings, and stepping up to be more of a leader in KOE.  Now that I'm 60, I want to expand what I do for fun and I see leading raids as a HUGE step of advancement for me.<br />
<br />
Once again, THANK YOU KOE from the bottom of my heart.  I could not have done this without you :)</div></div><hr />
