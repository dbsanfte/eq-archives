<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Friend with a late 50's chanter duoed in veksar with a 65 pally, just slowing for him, while he ripped through the undead mobs. No way you can modify the XP split, but undead will make it faster. N.B. our poison &amp; disease spells are almost totally resisted by the undead there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh, Veksar, good idea.  Shaman can bind the pally there, too.  I was going to say Halls of Betrayal for the same reason (undead) but Veksar will work just as well, and it's a LOT easier to get to.  Just remember, if you crawl all the way to the courtyard (which is very likely) if it's just going to be the two of you - keep an eye to the wall that adjoins the zonein area.  Avoided a handful of corpse summons by dying next to that wall, and simply dragging through it.<br />
<br />
Exp bonus in both zones is pretty extreme.  Loot in HoB is a bit better, though.  If you're a faction freak, HoB will help with Chardok, Veksar (weapon turnin quest) will get you into Cabilis.<br />
<br />
I can't think of any other places that'll make as much use of the pally's benefits toward undead.</div></div><hr />
