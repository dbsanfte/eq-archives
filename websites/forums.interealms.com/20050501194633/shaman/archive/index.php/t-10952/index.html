I thought that got &quot;fixed&quot; quite a while ago (so they wouldn't stack).<br />
<br />
I remember stacking it with all three of those and maxing my Warriors STR easily. Then the &quot;fix&quot; was applied and HoS went to the back of the spell book.<br />
<br />
Are you saying it's working that way again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">maniacal str will stack with HOS if you cast it before(or maybe its after? it's reversed from how it was..whatever)<br />
<br />
But i think Jinheim was talking about stacking with IOS - not HOS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have IoS so I can answer your question.  Even after the changes last week the following is true:<br />
<br />
IoS stacks with Tali of Kragg, every stat buff.<br />
<br />
IoS does not stack with HoS/FoS etc.<br />
<br />
I havent checked yet to see if it now stacks with Yaulp or VoS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">HoS stacks does not stack with Strength (lvl 49) or with Dexterity (lvl 49) whether you cast HoS first or the others.<br />
<br />
HoS does not stack with IoS.<br />
<br />
IoS stacks with all the stat buffs (that I can cast at lvl 56).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i can verify that it doesn't work with the lvl 49 versions<br />
i only knew it worked with maniacal str and maybe the lvl 58 dex? i'm only 57 so don't know for sure<br />
because a guildie told me about it, didn't believe it til he showed me. <br />
<br />
I still wouldn't bother doing str and hos, and I have IOS anyway, which stacks with all your str dex sta talisman of kragg etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I tradeskill I drop all buffs and then buff myself with IoS and all the stat spells.  Just in case.  :)  I'll cast IoS on casters too cause HoS overwrites some of their self only buffs.  Think the Talisman spells do to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">He he he conflicting oppinions :)<br />
So in the end is this spell WORTH paying for when i hit 49? (soon) or just pass?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't think it's worth buying until you have Talisman of Kragg, since you will be casting HoS until then for pure HP.  <br />
<br />
Unless you are a smither working on skill and have low Wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At present, HoS will stack on top of both maniacal str and mortal deftness, if you do HoS last.  So even after having focus, if someone has a proc weapon and is far from maxxed on Dex, I sometimes still use HoS + Dex + Str.  I dont have IoS so not an issue for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">on the same sort of note have you noticed hos is NOT stacking with things it used to. specifically mage self buffs, and druid self buffs? its been driving me crazy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kareck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you want to max out all the mellees stats you must cast the talisman line of spells or their single equal ie maniacal strength,etc BEFORE you cast hos. It will not work however with the lower level spells like Dexterity for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">what is funny in that is that SOE/verant claimed a lil ago that it is not INTENDED to stack.. but.. again since a previous patch.. if you cast first:<br />
<br />
maniacal strength then HOS -&gt; it stacks<br />
mortal deftness then HOS -&gt; it stacks<br />
maniacal strength then Focus of Spirit -&gt; it stacks<br />
mortal deftness then Focus of Spirit -&gt; it doesn't stack<br />
<br />
(didn't tested lower version of single buff as the aim is to max out the target, nor did test with Focus of Soul.. still 60..) :)<br />
<br />
let's see how long it'll take them to &quot;fix that bug&quot; :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My guess is they will leave it like this for nine months, and correct it without a patch message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Boy then all those parchments will REALLY be useless eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You can cast Maniacal STR/Mortal Defness (or the group versions), then HoS and it works, but you can not cast them if HoS is already on, even if you just want to refresh the existing ones.<br />
<br />
This does NOT work with Focus, just HoS.</div></div><hr />
