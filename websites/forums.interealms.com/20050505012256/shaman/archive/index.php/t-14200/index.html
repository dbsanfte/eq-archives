<br />
If &quot;someone&quot; wink wink nudge nudge, say no more, was about to take up the art of turning in specs to save up for oh say... Fo7, i mean if this was a shaman im talking about, which class would probably weild the highest return in profit.<br />
<br />
In theory mind you .. wink wink nudge nudge , say no more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used tosell extra parchments and runes from exp group for wizard-cleric turnins, this was back in december though when they were rare as hell. so i made hundreds of k in plats . dunno what they eftch now but im betting  wiz/cleric spells is still the best way to go</div></div><hr />

I know folks WTB Strike of Solusek for 175k+ and have seen more than 2 willing to pay this amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok so looks like<br />
<br />
druid/wizzy/cleric<br />
<br />
i plan on going back to exp this week cause ive done my VP key ( well last camp as we speak ) VT key and most other keying time sinks and i really been slacking on AA for a while. Fell pretty gimp with no Fo7 and BoS still.<br />
<br />
Thanks much /bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Runes I usually turn in to the druid or shaman vendor, because all of their rune spells are good and you're not going to get a worthless spell.  Some don't sell as well (ferine avatar, mark of the forest) but they will still sell.  Usually a guaranteed 40k+<br />
<br />
For specs I think chanter and druid are the best, for the charms and buffs that are in such high demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SoS (wiz) is a rune spell, if he gets a rune he'll probably be trying to get Fo7 himself.<br />
<br />
As for specs, druids have some decent ones, and there are a gazillion druids out there, so easier to sell =P  Enchanters and clerics have a few decent ones, but there's a bigger chance of getting junk there.  Wizards have a couple nice spells too you could probably unload quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chukzombi, anyone ever tell you you're the spitting image of Vin Diesel?<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">damn... I knew it... I knew that i'd already seen this face somewhere else than on this board... just couldn't remember where...  :D<br />
<br />
good point meecham</div></div><hr />
