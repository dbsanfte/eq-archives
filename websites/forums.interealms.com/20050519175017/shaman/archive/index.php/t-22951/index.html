<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, guys.  I posted up a question I had on the veteran's board on EQlive (occasionally I have to make a nice post instead of needling the dev's about not doing any work).  However, no one seems to know the answer so far.<br />
<br />
Anyone here know?<br />

Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm really suprised no one has been able to answer this so far--this is a pretty big deal.  Depending on how the answers turn out, you could be losing 20%of you total experience earned just by having 10% regular exp on.<br />
<br />
Of course, neither am I aware of a parser that handles experience.  I dunno.<br />

<br />
Perhaps more than that. I vaguely recall some safehouse thread regarding splitting xp/aaxp giving less total xp gain than just sticking to 100%.<br />
<br />
Toss this into the mix and, besides your point, the problem compounds even more - if true.<br />
<br />
I will try to find that thread to link later when I have more time to browse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The way I thought it worked is a given mob gives X amount of experience to anyone of the same level that kills it. But some races require more experience per level. If thats the case then it shouldnt matter as everyone gets the same amount of experience. And AA's require the same amount for everyone regardless of race.<br />
<br />
  Also I think there was originally a bug that caused you to get less exp then you should if you split exp between regular and AA but that it had been fixed long time ago. Of course I have no proof thats how it works and could be totally wrong on all accounts but I never was one to stare at my exp bar anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail,<br />
I vaguely recall some safehouse thread regarding splitting xp/aaxp giving less total xp gain than just sticking to 100%.<br />
What I recall was that if you have anything OTHER than 100% regular exp or 100% AA exp, you will lose a smidgen of experience due to rounding errors involved with large numbers being split into percentages.<br />
<br />
I believe (and I'm by no means certain) that in order to save on computations that the #'s are being truncated at some level.  So if a mob gives you 3425425 experience points and you are currently 48,543,286,534 into level 65 and 48,532,747 from your next AA ding (and I believe the numbers for total net lifetime exp earned at 65 is probably a much bigger #), then somewhere the SOE experience calculators are taking a shortcut when it comes to accurately splitting the mob exp and adding it to the total real exp/aa exp values.<br />
<br />
Now we have leadership exp to also add into the mix, and I'm not aware of any thorough parses on how those splits are made.  Personally, to be on the safe side, I always play 100% into either regular or AA, and never split the two.  For leadership exp I turn it on when I'm leading, and leave it off otherwise, just to be safe. ;) <br />
<br />
The amount of exp being lost in the split may so miniscule as to not even be noticed, but dangit, I don't want to lose any to a calculator (I lose enough through deaths as it is! :p ) rounding or truncating. :D  I don't mind taking a chance with leadership exp because I have no choice.  I'd GLADLY sink 100% exp into leadership if I could.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The folks at the SH got their results from SEQ people.  They are correct.  Using anything but 0% or 100% to AA will result in xp loss.  You really wouldn't expect them to round in favor of the player would you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damn.  I need to go full normal exp I guess to fill up my 65 bar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have always gone 100-0 or 0-100, because I was concerned about the different ratios I was earning the 2 at, /shrug. Not like XP is currently hard to get, but with OoW coming, it would be nice to know the true stats. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think certain racial penalties shuold be eliminate once a player hits 60. Regen and Barb large race penalties should be removed, or at least reduced. Stun Immnuity for Ogres is solid enough to warrant a penalty, but cut it back to 5%. Thats a lot when your talking 65 to 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Using anything but 0% or 100% to AA will result in xp loss.<br />
<br />
It could  be that SONY has done the math correctly on leadership points, so that no additional penalty accrues to those with racial penalties, when splitting exp and aa.  But I would hate to count on that.<br />
<br />
I am usually leader in my groups, pulling leader aa points as quick as I can.  <br />
<br />
But.<br />
<br />
Whenever I decide that my regular exp bar has drifted down too far -- say, 2 blues away from dinging 66 -- I give up leadership, and switch over to 100% normal exp.  Grind back to within a few pixels of ding.  Then switch back to 100% aa, and leadership.<br />
<br />
I expect you have received no answer, Chotoi, because nobody knows.  Not just us players:  nobody at SONY knows.  They don't know because they didn't ask the question carefully enough when they coded in switches for aa and leadership points, and because nobody has gone back to ask those questions about code that is already written.<br />
<br />
So since nobody can tell you a real answer, the only thing that makes sense is to assume the worst case coding scenario, and always do <br />
<br />
either<br />
<br />
a) 100 % regular exp, and swallow your exp penalty<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
b) 100 % aa, with leader points if you want em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally, I think a much bigger issue should become:<br />
<br />
&quot;As a Troll, why should I STILL have to pay such a HUGE penalty for what amounts to a MINIMAL bonus. I dont mind paying levels 1-60, because it actually HELPS there, but now, its trivial for 60-70, and I would like to see it eliminated, or at least reduced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats my issue. Ogres can argue theirs, but you can bet your ass MOST of the Trolls and Iskar are sitting around going &quot;Here we go again, I gotta get a WHOLE extra &quot;level&quot; of XP (1/5th of 65-70, 20%, whatever) for a benefit that isnt really that great.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Blazz, you're kidding right?  That extra 10-15 regen/tick lets me level at least 15% faster than everybody else.  I just hope Sony doesn't realize how much faster, else us trolls and iksars will get slapped with an even bigger penalty.  So shhh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My understanding was that a particular mob gave a set amount of xp, which is then split between the party according to levels. A modifier is then applied to what you got (bonus or penalty as the case might be) and that determined what you actually got. Except, in the case of aa exp, there is no modifier applied, so everyone gets it at the same rate.</div></div><hr />

DOH man, I forgot. <br />
<br />
<br />
psssst, its not even 10-15 anymore sitting. The bumped everyones sitting regen up by like some MASSIVE sick number a few months back, so at lvl 65, I dont think I get more than 10 extra hps a tic, sitting. Sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm all for getting rid of -for example- the iksar exp penalty IF nobody minds the other races being able to take regen, darkvision, and &quot;hardened skin&quot; AA to give them the same benefits iksar will then have for free.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Just cope with the fact that you have to live with the choice you made.  I didn't choose barbarian because I wanted a DDD cup size and lack of exp penalty (I didn't know there WAS an exp penalty).  I gave up green skin, nightvision, snare neck, and regen for the ability to be able to see and be welcome in more cities.  THAT little benefit matters even less than your sitting regen rate in today's EQ.  The grass is ALWAYS greener on the other side.</div></div><hr />

My point is that I already paid for the benefit I for being a troll. None of the things you mention mean a single thing past 60 in most cases. Every level I have has costed me more. Why should I continue to pay for benefits that are barely beneficial? Tell ya what, turn off the regen. Turn off the vision. I can buy better snare weapons and give them to my pet now. Hell, take it away, but give ME that choice. I am not saying I didnt get benefit from 1-60, even up to 65, but now I am not. <br />
<br />
Also, at some point between when I chose and today, the designers UPPED the regen of all races, especially when sitting. In fact, level for level, the difference is negligible from 1-40. Yet trolls from 1-60 still pay the 20%, and I am not saying they shouldnt. Just now, at THIS level of the game, the penalty is WAY too severe for the benefit.<br />

Um, I am in favor of ALL racial XP penaltys be removed completely, with the POSSIBLE exception of Ogres, who MAYBE should go down to 1.05. Sheesh, Regen isnt even the &quot;preffered route&quot; for AA's 1-6, lots of people suggest Metabolism. You want more regen for some AA, all the way to Troll level? You got it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I agree that the penalty is not worth the benefit.  I do not agree that all the benefits are worthless.  Until there is no advantage over other races there should be a penalty.  As has been said, at this level of the game these differences shouldn't exist.</div></div><hr />
