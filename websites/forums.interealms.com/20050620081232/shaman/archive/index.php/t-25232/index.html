Selling World of Warcraft In-Game Content for Real Money - Block on 12/10/04<br />
It has come to our attention that certain individuals are selling Blizzard's in-game property for cash on auction sites such as eBay and on personal websites. The World of Warcraft Terms of Use clearly state that all of the content in World of Warcraft is the property of Blizzard, and Blizzard does not allow &quot;in game&quot; items to be sold for real money. Accordingly, Blizzard Entertainment will take any and all actions necessary to stop this behavior. Not only do we believe that it is illegal, but it also has the potential to damage the game economy and overall experience for the many thousands of others who play World of Warcraft for fun. In order to promote a fun and fair environment for all our customers, we are actively investigating those individuals who engage in this inappropriate activity and reserve the right to take legal action against these individuals to protect World of Warcraft for all those who &quot;play by the rules.&quot; If you are found to be selling in-game property (such as coins, items, or characters), for real money, you will lose your characters and accounts, and Blizzard Entertainment reserves its right to pursue legal action against you as well.<br />
<br />
We also want to remind potential buyers in the game to please refrain from buying in-game property with real money. We understand the temptation to purchase better items, but Blizzard, and not the seller, does own all in-game property. In addition, we feel that characters can find ample equipment and money within the game through their own adventuring and questing. Please understand that if you do purchase in-game property from sellers on eBay and personal sites, we may temporarily suspend your account, and at the very least, delete the offending items.<br />
<br />
Thank you for understanding our position. Blizzard Entertainment is committed to maintaining the atmosphere of fair play and fun in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Jeez cant people at least wait for the game to be out a few months.<br />

Most other games have prospered despite auction sites, there's no reason to worry about it much.  They should be worrying about getting their game working better, rather than spending effort stopping something that probably helps them more than hurts them.</div></div><hr />

What causes problems is when people want to ebay gold so bad that they do things like dupe and macro to get that gold.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">buying gear in this game for rl cash is lol<br />
if you're playing, you're going to see good gear drop. if you have to resort to this to gear up a toon in WoW, you might as well quit, imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's definately NOT a waste of time on Blizzard's part.  To the casual observer, there doesn't seem to be much harm if someone is someone is silly enough to trade RL money for pixels.<br />
<br />
However, Yantis/IGE really do hurt your game by throwing the economy into shambles.  In EQ, they employ cheap, overseas labor to mindlessly grind out plat.  As idiots buy and spend it, this surplus lowers the overall value of plat.  Now Yantis has to maintain the need so the other thing they do is work the bazaar to keep the price of rare and premium items ultra high.  Suddenly, that epic drop is 120K instead of 75 and the cash you get from regular, honest playing is severely undervalued.  So yes, it does hurt you even if you don't participate in ebaying.<br />
<br />
They are a nasty parasite and I applaud Blizzard's zero tolerance policy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with Barm.  The time to take action is NOW, before the problem gets too serious.  YES, actively look for and fix duping bugs; YES, make public statements like this one; YES, conduct &quot;sting&quot; operations.<br />
<br />
Rather than banning the farmer/duper accounts, it would be great if they could just come up with a way of making so the gold/gear in those accounts &quot;rots&quot;, or just never drops at all.  Let the bastards continue to waste their time doing their dupe sploit, but then take away their profit for it.</div></div><hr />

I fully disagree.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they are doing sting operations already as Jin stated, then that shows you how serious they are for the same reasons you listed for them not doing it. Move fast and strike hard and early, respect points ++.<br />
<br />
As far as other games &quot; prospering &quot; despite selling sites, i have to strongly disagree also. EQ survived the big plat buying/item buying push after PoP, but it decimated the economy. It made hours of killing in PoG and OS or PoTactics completely and utterly useless. I worked hard for those camps i did, painfuly hard and i just cant justify letting someone come in and do this. Not only does it cheapen my hard work, but now that 100k item i was saving for and bleeding at the finger tips and wrists for, is now a 500k item. Im not exagerating on those numbers. <br />
<br />
Thats just wrong to let happen. Call me biased.<br />
<br />
<br />
And what part of the game needs to be focused on so strongly that they cant multitask and do this also ? The game is great. Sure classes need to be tweaked, but how old is EQ and how balanced are they?  Simply its not easy and requires constant fine tuning, which they are doing and they will keep doing for a long time.</div></div><hr />

Let's say you are a well paid doctor or lawyer or whatever, and you like to play Everquest.<br />
Your time is worth something in the neighborhood of $100 an hour.<br />
Spending an hour in game farming stuff you might be able to make about 5k pp an hour depending how good you are.<br />
Or, you could spend $100 on ebay and just buy 500k pp or whatever the exchange rate is at the moment.<br />
What makes more sense, someone like that working an extra hour at the hospital, or spending *multiple real life days* in game farming up stuff to make the same kind of cash.<br />
Ya.  Real &quot;dumb&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I hate ebayers, Barm's description of them as 'nasty parasites' is right as far as I'm concerned.<br />
<br />
However, aren't we hoping the Blizzard's design for WoW is rather more robust than EQ?  In EQ the majority of the population geared up by farming plat that could then be used in the bazaar to buy gear that raiders didn't want.  In WoW perhaps we will all have the opportunity to get gear for ourselves without raiding.<br />
<br />
If this is the case then the impact of ebaying companies is going to be much reduced. In EQ they came to monopolise the supply of gear to the casual player.  If in WoW the casual player has the means to equip himself, that's not possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It wasn't the ebaying that ruined the EQ economy, it was the rampant duping and exploiting game mechanics to generate absurd amounts of platinum.  Even a non-duper could, with the right 2-3 box setup, generate 300-400k per day thanks to unbalanced game design that went unchecked (/wave CoD).  Sony did not bother to fight it.<br />
<br />
I still have a sneaking suspicion that the game company's &quot;All in game items and money are wholly owned intellectual property of *game company*&quot; statements would not hold an ounce of water in court.  That is why the IGE's continue to operate, because the game developers are afraid they will lose.   They should focus more on shutting down the duping and exploiting to keep the economy intact.  Then ebaying has no overall negative effect, because gold will be too expensive for people to bother.</div></div><hr />

This has not been tested yet in court and by no means is the legal equivalent of a signed contract.  Trust me, if Sony et al could shut these companies down with an injuction, they would.

<br />
You leisure time is worth as much as anyone's.  You can do what you want with it just as anyone else can do what they want with it.  If someone wants to spend money to have someone put an item in their trade window and click trade, that's fine by me.  It doesn't affect me in the slightest what other transactions people do.  I play the game for me.  My accomplishments are what I've done, and I don't care how other people get their gear.  When you stop worrying about the other guy and worry about yourself, you'll have a lot less stress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">People buying plat doesn't directly hurt anyone.  The same amount of money is still in the market, it is just distributed differently.  Instead of sitting in the bank of someone who has no need for it, it goes to someone who will spend it.  The only way this hurts you is if you gauge your success against that of other people.  If someone having money they didn't &quot;earn&quot; in the same way that you did bothers you, that is on you, not them.<br />
<br />
What does hurt you is when people exploit some kind of bug or create a bot that gives them an influx of money that is much much greater than what the developer's intended, and then sells it.  As before, money is being distributed to people who are going to spend it, which is not a bad thing in and of itself.  The bad part is that all this extra cash is entering the economy.  People can set their uber items for high prices because they know some schmuck with tons of ebayed plat is going to buy it from them.  You can't blame the seller for this, though.  It's just good business:  An item is worth whatever you can get for it.  The losers here are the people who don't exploit/macro and don't buy plat.  They have an income that is comparable to what is intended, but is nowhere near enough to keep up with inflation.  As such, nice items become nearly unobtainable for people without the means to farm tons of cash.<br />
<br />
Example:  In EQ, AoN's used to go for about 50-60k.  That used to be a decent sum of money, but not unobtainable for most people.  I'm sure most of us probably spent that much on spells during one era or another.  Enter macroquest and the tradeskill bots that make an item with vendor components and sell it back for a small profit.  Also enter millions upon millions of plat into the economy.  AoN's are now nearly limitless in value and the price can vary widely.  I saw them for 150, I saw people asking for 500.  I sold mine (originally bought for a fungi tunic and 10k) for 350 and later bought one back for 200.  These huge numbers and wide variety are due almost completely to the massive amount of plat in the market.  Plat was worth so little that it was hard to set any price more specific than &quot;very high&quot; on anything of value.  I had the capacity to farm high quality sellable drops (whose prices were inflated) and could get a few hundred k in a couple of days, but the average person, whose main source of income is gem and cash drops with the occasional minor item drop, could never dream of getting that much money together.<br />
<br />
So, basically, Blizzard needs to go after the exploiters and botters.  They are the source of any economic woes and are much more easily defeated than people who buy/sell in-game money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hear hear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Selling gold/plat online doesn't hurt the game, period.  Like some other posters mentioned, it's the exploits that ruin the economy.  People are going to do both, but when you pair them together like Yantis did, it can hurt the economy.  They should just ban people who exploit bugs.  No matter what, it's kind of hard to prove someone exploited something unless you catch them in flagrante delicto.<br />
<br />
When I first started playing EQ, I had little time, so I bought some platinum from a friend who was leaving the game (he wouldn't just give it to me, the jerk).  Having that money actually kept me playing the game longer.  So I don't think farming money from normal means will put that much of a dent in a game's economy and it results in more profit for the game maker.</div></div><hr />

It would also be hard to quantify how selling items from the game injures the plaintiff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would be true if plat in EQ were finite, like the number of twenties printed by the US mint -- and to carry the analogy a bit farther, plat dupers would be like counterfeiters.  But plat is not a fixed amount.  It's created when you sell items to a vendor and those items are created by killing a spawn.  You might remember a while back when just about every server had a strange cleric/enchanter duo killing the beetles at the necrosis/guardian camp in Seb.  These duos never left the camp and never logged off.  Those accounts were being played by people paid to farm gems, working in shifts.  SoE removed the gem drops from those beetles which means they saw it as a problem.  It takes a little longer, but the effect is exactly the same as the plat dupers you hate  -- the artificial creation of large amounts of coin.<br />
<br />
I don't care what other *players* do.  A few years ago, I didn't care about ebayers either.  But I've seen what happens to a game's economy when external forces begin to milk it for profit.  I read once that Yantis make over a million dollars a year.<br />
<br />
As they sell plat they begin to run into a problem.  The sheer abundance of plat begins to lower the value of their product.  This is a million dollar opertation so they need to do something -- thus they work the bazaar.  They work OVER the bazaar.  They need high prices  on dropable gear or people wont pull out their credit cards.   This is the part that hurts all the people saying, 'it doesn't affect me any'.<br />
<br />
Even if they destroyed every fungi tunic or AoN that some honest player puts up for a reasonable price they will profit in real life.</div></div><hr />

Police can choose which laws they want to enforce.  They are the executive branch.  Every unmarried couple caught having sex in the middle of a raid never gets charged with fornication or whatever they call it on the books.  Most states have old laws that are still in effect, but never enforced anymore.<br />
<br />
People generally break laws they feel have little risk of punishment attached to them.  Drug use, sodomy, sex out of wedlock, jaywalking, etc.  Since breaking the rules of a game has absolutely no effect other than making you use a different credit card and IP address when you get caught, most people will take that chance.  Anything Blizzard does to crack down will cost them more money than it saved them.<br />
<br />
I completely endorse buying gold and money online, because they'll likely end up buying my auction items with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Police can choose which laws they want to enforce. <br />
<br />
Can you document police not enforcing laws across the United States?<br />
<br />
They are the executive branch. <br />
<br />
Actually that's the President, perhaps you meant &quot;Executors of the law&quot;?<br />
<br />
Every unmarried couple caught having sex in the middle of a raid never gets charged with fornication or whatever they call it on the books. <br />
<br />
Can you cite an example of a recent raid in the US where an unmarried couple was not arrested and also quote the law they broke?<br />
<br />
 Most states have old laws that are still in effect, but never enforced anymore.<br />
<br />
While this may be true, what does a 150 year old law have to do with modern day cyber-property and intellectual rights?<br />
<br />
People generally break laws they feel have little risk of punishment attached to them.  <br />
<br />
Ermm. No. People break the laws when they feel the reward outweighs the risk OR that the chance of getting caught and subsequent punishment is outweighed by the reward / benefit.<br />
<br />
Example you say? Speeding.<br />
<br />
Drug use, sodomy, sex out of wedlock, jaywalking, etc.  <br />
<br />
The Supreme Court has ruled that sodomy is not a crime.  Sex out of wedlock is more of a biblical concept.<br />
<br />
Since breaking the rules of a game has absolutely no effect other than making you use a different credit card and IP address when you get caught, <br />
<br />
This is your claim (and the point of your post apprently).  What I and others feel (and can point to in EQ) is that breaking the rules of the game (via duping and gold hacks) is that such actions DO ruin much of the game for the casual player.<br />
<br />
 most people will take that chance. <br />
<br />
Would you qualify &quot;most&quot; as 51% or greater?  I am laughing if you believe that 51% of the paying customers in WoW are resorting to breaking the rules.  PLEASE provide a link from Blizzard or a spokesman.<br />
<br />
 Anything Blizzard does to crack down will cost them more money than it saved them.<br />
<br />
Can you show a cost analysis for this claim please?<br />
