<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sadorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, Merry Christmas to everyone!  I've come back after almost a year off, and decided to start out fresh and new.  In the past four years, I've played almost every character, save for the shaman.<br />
<br />
So...I've been trying her out, and love it to death.  My problem is this, I've played a cleric and druid, and know point for point what their roles are in the different groups I've been in.<br />
<br />
In all the time I've played (used to play on torv) I've honestly never grouped with a shaman.<br />
<br />
I know I'm a priest class, but my heals are weaker than my druid's were.  I assume I have some leeway in tanking, although my offense is maxed and I miss a lot.  AND...I know I'm a great buffer.<br />
<br />
So...what exactly is my role?  If I'm playing main healer, do I not buff? Im not supremely twinked...136 wisdom, so after I buff the main tank, I'm almost out of mana (only lvl 27).  If I have a cleric or druid in the group who loves and or expects they are the main healer, should I buff everyone? Should I be assisting the melees, or sitting and slowing/ac stat lowering, with dots?<br />
<br />
I know I'm fairly low, and most of what I am doing now isn't placed in top importance, but I like to know a classe's role so as I level, by the time the 50's hit, I'm confident in my role and can make the transition with ease.<br />
<br />
Hope I made sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First and foremost you will be slowing.  Shaman buffs last long, so once you've done your buffing you won't need to do it again for a while.  <br />
<br />
You are a healer, and can even be the main healer in a group.  We're not the best at it, but we do rather well.<br />
<br />
Melee is something you do when you're bored, soloing or on a raid with plenty of other shaman. :)<br />
<br />
Granted I am higher now and have group buffs, but I always buffed all the melee classes in my group.  If there is a cleric or druid in the group, they tend to be the healer while you slow, cripple, malaise and DoT.<br />
<br />
We truly are a jack of all trades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Slowing is the essential role of the shaman. To combine with that you can debuff, heal, or dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">first read the posts in the medicine cabinet.<br />
<br />
your heals will be weaker than anyone elses becuase you get slow.<br />
<br />
you are a priest class so you will always miss a lot. just go into options and turn your misses off.<br />
<br />
your role will depend on the group make up. shaman are like the jack of all trades of classes and can fill a few roles. if your healing and have mana buff by all means. at your level id worry about regen and haste and maybe a hp buff on the tank. after that add buffs as your mana permits. if your in a fast pulling group you can get by without slowing as the mobs die quickly, if not slow every mob that is pulled. even if your main healer and have the mana. id also take slowing over buffs other than regen and haste. a slowed mob does less damage so makes healing easier.<br />
<br />
as for playing a good shaman. coming here regularly is probably one of the better things you can do. enjoy</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Thanks :) that's how I've been looking at it. Playing the shaman almost reminds me of the days way back when I played my bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">(edit:  by the time I hid Submit, everything had already been said, but I'll leave it up anyway!)<br />
<br />
First, read the Medicine Cabinet.  <br />
<br />
Second, adapt.<br />
<br />
Buff before the fight, debuff during the fight, do some damage with nukes or dots, and act as backup healer. <br />
<br />
....Unless your the main healer, of course.  In which case, you can still buff before the fight, slow the mob, maybe some damage, but focus more on healing.<br />
<br />
....Unless there is an enchanter in the group.  Then you might do some of your buffs, but let the enchanter do haste, and if mana is tight, let them do slows as well.<br />
<br />
....Unless your tirtiary healer.  In which case, you might focus on slows and adding some DPS, maby add some croud control.<br />
<br />
....Unless your the only one who can take a hit (caster/rogue group), in which case, slow, dots, and let things beat on you while everyone else kills it.<br />
<br />
Unless.......<br />
<br />
Basically, shaman are about flexibility.  With the exception of slowing, we aren't the best at anything, but we can cover healing, tanking, buffing, DPS and crowd control if there isn't someone better in the group to deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bazlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So...what exactly is my role?  If I'm playing main healer, do I not buff?

Should I be assisting the melees, or sitting and slowing/ac stat lowering, with dots?<br />
<br />
To answer your first question, or to make my stab at it, the main two reasons groups want a shammy are for our slow and our buffs.  If you check out our slow spell (can't remember the lvl, but it's Turgur's) on Castersrealm, you will see that shamans have the best slow, hands down.  Our melee stat buffs also cannot be beat.<br />
<br />
If you are main healer, it is still your best bet to buff as many of the melee as you can, as those precious stat buffs will help you out in the long run when it comes to keeping your party alive.<br />
<br />
If you have a MH, then (in my experience) you have a somewhat relaxed job.  Buff your melee, slow the mobs, backup heal, and throw the occasional dot or debuff at the mobs.  As far as meleeing, and this varies greatly by player, but I can count on two hands the amount of times I have actually meleed in group.  I think it is, for the most part, a complete waste of time and terribly non-efficient.  I would rather med and have mana for those optional dots and short duration buffs than try to hit some mob with my melee weapon.  <br />
<br />
Hope that helps, but, as with all opinions, your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">WOOH, you're gonna have fun in groups. Yep, jack-of-all-trades says it best, IMO ...<br />
<br />
1. Buff your group to the teeth. I daresay I'm like a lot of shaman in that the 20-or-so pages I've got my buffs organized over aren't my favorites in the spellbook, and buffing's not my favorite thing ... but we have absolutely INCREDIBLE melee stat buffs. Use them! Whether I'm in an adventure or in a planes group or helping my guildies elsewhere, you will ALWAYS see me take 30 seconds to rebuff the group/raid. It's always appreciated.<br />
<br />
2. Adapt in groups. Slow the mobs your puller brings you. If he brings more than one, and you're the CC, pop a slow and peel one off him, root it away, dot it, and set puppy on it. Or hell, if you're made outta Rubbermaid like I am, forget the dot, slow the MT's mob, and ST the add with puppy IN THE FACE. Rinse, repeat if your puller is having One Of Those Days. While the cleric is busy healing him, pop a quick spam heal on your other group members if they need it. Toss in a dot or a DD. Cleric dies? No problem -- especially at upper levels. ST dies? No problem -- haste yourself quick and jump into the throng with puppy at your side. MT dies? Not a problem, root the mob and make him die a slow, horrible death while your tank is rezzed. Gnaw your arm and refill that mana pool in between spells. When one arm gets low, gnaw the other. That's why you've got two. &quot;I cannibalize, therefore I am.&quot; Learn it, memorize it, live it.<br />
<br />
3. Puppy likes to fight, too. When you get him, use him!! He's your most efficient use of mana for the damage you get over the time you get it (lots of posts around here somewhere to that effect) ... you and he can ST an add, or he can keep an add busy all by himself while your group finishes off the first. Give him an HP buff, and haste him. Mine whines when I don't give him his haste spell. And Light above, PLEASE remember to give your puppy some toys, and never, EVER leave the hut without an extra pouch of treats ... he might /con green to you at times, but never doubt he could really do some damage if he discovers you've forgotten his treats and toys. Trust me.<br />
<br />
4. Debuff. Slow. Rinse. Repeat. Pared down to our core, this is SHAMAN in four words. You are a slower. You see a mob coming at you ... fine. Not a problem ... take a quick breath, make puppy heel and sit like a good boy, and debuff the SOB. Knock his resists through the floor, stick a slow on him, and watch him try to kill your MT ... heh ... it's funny watching a mob try to kill someone when he acts as though he's had molasses poured on him.<br />
<br />
5. Read the Crucible daily. Your daily dose of knowledge, right here. Capsule, tablet or powder form. And read the Medicine Cabinet FIRST THING.<br />

Hope I made sense.<br />
<br />
First Druids didn't have better heals than a shaman a year ago, so I find your statement possibly biased to begin with.<br />
Secondly, how can anyone not at any time ever group with a shaman?<br />
Third you don't have to buff every thing... At 27 you don't have a haste yet, so you can ussually get away with what ever the hp buff is at that level and sta. let the melee's ask for what they want, don't give them the world... When you get higher, and have spells like HOS and Focus this will be a non issue...<br />
Stat debuffing a mob is pointless unless it procs/furries/rampages which you wont see in a while.<br />
At your level, slow the mob when you can, and throw in a DD or Two.<br />
Should be plenty...<br />
<br />
Or Better yet, just keep doing what your doing, you'll get the hange of it sooner or later... the level pre 50 are all learning levels any way.<br />
Hell you could be casting charisma buff on all your groups mobs and no one would notice...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well most everyone has posted what I would suggest.  Though I'll probably repeat a few that I think are important.<br />
<br />
1. Buff every thing you can manage.   Buffs save you TONS of mana in the long run by lowering the amount of damage your tanks take, and speeding up how fast they kill your targets.  (Some disagree but BUFF the pets too with dex &amp; Str type spells to increases pet procs and how often they hit for max)<br />
<br />
2. If you have more then 80% life then you’re forgetting to canni.  Get in the habit weather your sitting during the med tick or not Canni.  Live it, Learn it, Be it.  As shaman you should never be OOM for more then 2-3 ticks if you have mana.  Know how low you can get on HP and not get agro it'll mean life and death to you and your group.<br />
<br />
3. We slow.  Slow+Mob= YOUR GOING GET HIT.  We are not like most other priests.  We can take a beating.  Stand there and take it like Shaman and let your tanks get it off you.  Never show the mob your backside. (This is why AC &amp; HP are the things we seek so we can stand there and show the tank we got bigger ones then them  :D)<br />
<br />
4. Our puppy is truly our best friend.  No one else will be so loyal as to take one for the team and die for you.  So ALWAYS have your pet up even if he just sits there.  He will buy you a good few seconds to run, memorize a spell, slow the mob, or many other things.  Just remember he's your pet not your group mate and let him die.  Too many times I get a little over attached to my puppy and try to save him in bad times no end up getting my self killed when I should be doing something else.<br />
<br />
5. Last of all.  We are capable of doing many many things.  Just be sure never to get caught up in that mind set that you do one thing and only one thing.  We are shaman and only limited by our resourcefulness.... and our hit points LOL... :D<br />
<br />
Good luck with your shaman btw and hope I was helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hiya, <br />
<br />
  Just to be contrary, I'm gonna disagree with most of what's been written here. :D At 27th lvl, most of your buffs are pretty useless. Exception are SoW, regen and haste(don't recall if you have that one yet or not). Adding 20 or 30 points to a stat at that lvl isn't worth the mana. The same goes for slow, given how fast most mobs die at that lvl and the fact that your slow doesn't doesn't do a whole lot, it's rarely worth casting unless you're solo or in a duo in which case it can be situationally useful. Playing a shaman at that lvl really isn't in any way comperable to mid/high lvls. <br />
<br />
  On the bright side, your heals are almost as good as a cleric's, your melee is still decent and your poison DoT can do respectable damage for cheap (mana wise) if the mob lives long enough. <br />
<br />
  Overall, just don't get too set in your ways. Try different things, see what works and what doesn't and be prepared to see your role change again and again over the next 20 levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sadorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">First Druids didn't have better heals than a shaman a year ago, so I find your statement possibly biased to begin with.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Heheh, guess I should have mentioned my druid was 50 and my cleric was in her 40's when I left a year ago...compared to my 27 heal...I feel like I'm trying to use my &quot;newbie&quot; heal lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rokktor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't know jack about playing a shaman from a firsthand perspective.  I know the game well, been playing since two months after release.  Started as a druid, powerleveled a bot warrior and got a taste of melee, then a shadowknight and a cleric bot.  I have since stopped the cleric bot after the highest res.  Now I'm grooming a shaman bot (L49).  That is my perspective.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, you are not expected to melee.  In fact, you're hardly expected to contribute damage.  Maybe send your pet, and if you have gobs of extra mana then cast a DoT spell.  Basically, the only time you need to damage the mob other than your pet is emergencies or when you are able to keep up with your other duties without causing the action to stop because you need to meditate for mana.<br />
<br />
Now I don't know about cripple and malo all that much.  I'm not really an expert on shaman tactics.  But as a tank, I want you to do whatever you can to get the target slowed in the shortest amount of time without getting yourself killed.  As a knight, I am not too worried about how soon you slow it, I will keep it pinned to me.  Some tanks can't/don't do this, but most try to.  <br />
<br />
If that means you need to use debuffs to get it slowed, more power to ya.  All I care about is that it gets slowed, and gets slowed right away.  Once slowed, the game moves at a more manageable pace.  Clerics can keep me alive better, and if they aren't paying attention I can take other steps to keep myself alive.  But it's important that the game is slowed down so that I have time to react and do my job, which is staying alive and making sure the mob hits only me.<br />
<br />
The entire game is a domino effect.  Each person does their job, so that the worst case scenario (wipeout) does not happen.  Puller's job is to bring in as few as possible, crowd controller's job is to get the pull sorted out, slower's job is to slow down the game to a manageable pace, tank's job is to keep mobs hitting them, healer's job is to keep the tank alive and correct any other unexpected damage, rest of the group's job is to kill as fast as possible so you can repeat.<br />
<br />
Buffs are maybe in between all that.  You need to factor them in, but you need to know what is important.  You don't need to cast STA buffs on casters.. they don't get a lot of HP per STA so it's not usually worth in day-to-day situations (ok, if you're some uber d00d in PoTime then whatever, that's not day-to-day to most of us so nobody wants to hear you toot your own horn, it's irrelevent).  You don't generally need to cast a CHA buff on a tank (again, I know about those Death Pact type spells.. blah blah blah.. it's not day-to-day so shut it).  The first mana you need to spend on buff's is for things like HP on the main tank, haste on melee classes if they don't already have a haste buff.  STA on the main tank.  <br />
<br />
After that, tell people you are done with standard buffs and will take requests.  Don't just assume the main tank wants STR.  Most do, but not all.  At level 65, I don't bother getting STR buffs.  They don't add enough noticeable damage and I don't really care about small increases because the tank role is more defined at higher levels.. tanks aren't expected to put out huge DPS, the group just wants somebody who can stand out front and survive while keeping the mob on them long enough for the rest of the group to kill it.  Rangers are generally the same way.. I see them requesting DEX from shamen, but most rangers have enough STR with their self buffs already.<br />
<br />
Basically, as a buffer you will be well-served to understand how other classes work and what they truly need.  A plate-wearing tank will be asking you for HP, STA, Haste.  A ranger will ask you for DEX and Haste.. sometimes HP/STA if they have some reason to fear for their life.  Rogues are the as rangers except STR instead of DEX.  Enchanters, I dunno, probably want HP to stay alive through mez and maybe CHA to make mez stick better.  Other casters will most want HP when they are afraid of getting hit.  Make that a last priority because most of the time they will not get hit.  Try to optimize your mana by giving buffs based on biggest impact to the group.  Buffing a wizard's STR will not help much, though he might want it to carry back fine steel weapons or something.<br />
<br />
As for tanking, umm no.  Maybe up to your early 50s it's technically possible.  But shamen who do it generally don't understand how much better plate classes mitigate damage until they hit PoP.  You have those HP and chain armor not so you can't tank, but so you have a slightly better chance of not having your brains plastered against a wall when you draw aggro from your slows and debuffs.  Those HP are also useful for the cannibalize spell.  Don't get accustomed to tanking, you simply cannot do it in PoP and most things that you can tank will be below you to the point that they aren't worth fighting.<br />
<br />
Your offensive melee skills are also bad.  Yes, you can swing a spear and single attack with very low skills.  You might hit for like 50 every now and then.  You might outdamage your pet (at L49 my dogdog seems to outdamage me already).  But that doesn't compare to the amount of damage true melee classes are putting out.  Yes, it's better than nothing, and if you constantly have a full mana bar and are bored then go ahead.. but don't think you're doing your group some kind of favor.  <br />
<br />
Send in your dog, it will probably help just as much as you meleeing, and then you can meditate and make sure the group is taken care of.  You will not get groups because of how much damage you can do.  Heck, as you level up even your buffs are about third place on the reasons why groups love you (your buffs are generally just &quot;nice to have&quot; but aren't imperative in day-to-day groups).  The number one thing in your arsenal is slow.  Every group in PoP wants a slower, it's practically a requirement.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, when I'm setting up groups, the fact that a shaman can heal is more important to me than their buffs.  I try to avoid forcing them to be the primary healer because I know they can get themselves into enough trouble trying to slow, but I like the fact that once a mob is slowed, a shaman can patch heal behind a cleric, that's a nice bonus.  Especially if there's a bard in the group who is providing the clarity, or if the group recently bought C3 in PoK.  Because I can buy C3 in PoK, but I can't buy slow casts.. I would say shaman are above enchanters for desirability in many groups.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this gives you another perspective.</div></div><hr />

Shaman that meditate for mana need to be smacked, and smacked good. Eat yourself. That's what your arms are there for. Some will tell you they exist to hold your spear and your shield and puppy's leash ... I say no. Eat them. &quot;Me consumo, ergo sum.&quot; I eat myself, therefore I am. Meditate for mana ... no. Stand and suck your HP into your mana pool. <br />
<br />
You're right we're not expected to melee. I doubt I will ever log on during a raid night and have the raid leader tell me I'm the MT-ST. I doubt I will ever been in an LDON group or a planes group in HOH or some such place and the group will say ... ok ... shaman, tank-type ... yep, shaman tanks, tank-type slows. But ... don't tell me I can't tank if it's necessary. Hell no we're not an MT-ST class. We're an EVERYTHING class. When the feces hit the rotary air-flow device, we can step in and take a beating. I've not met a shaman in his right mind who expects to put out as much melee damage as a pure melee does. But root the thing, slow it, stack a couple dots, and then go melee with puppy, and YOU tell ME what kinda damage we dish.<br />
<br />
In an LDON group, my puller brings two ... MT takes one, I peel the other off and give him to puppy for some fun. This means the MT is fighting an unslowed mob for a short period of time. Do I care? No. Why? The puller in my LDON groups is generally a ranger. The tank we fight with has the HP-AC to take an unslowed mob for quite a bit longer than the puller can. In that kind of a situation, your mob is the second priority. You need more time to react and do your job? React quicker.<br />
<br />
We know how to buff. If you don't want a buff we give you, click it off.<br />
<br />
If you wish to give us another perspective, please don't tell us you know jack about playing a shaman from a first-hand perspective before giving us your opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with Thurdar for your level.  Your heals at that level are the exact same as a druid.  Your slow at that level sucks compared to the rate of death of mobs, and stat buffs are only really good for keeping the melee from complaining =p  Regen at that level is nice. SoW is always useful.  <br />
<br />
Mainly my advice is, DoT, Nuke and heal at 27as needed. Solo some too.  I learned alot about my class trying to solo harder places.  You will ease into the main roles as you go up.  You get a better slow at 29 that is useful, and also a haste buff.  You get a HP buff at 34 or 39 I think, and dogdog at 34.  As you get these you will get used to your role in groups slowly changing, and finding yourself becoming more diverse.<br />
<br />
You're melee will go down as your level goes up.  You could probably melee decently up until 24.  You still could at that level, but now you're probably better served spending the time canni'ing and applying more dots/nukes/heals.  <br />
<br />
Once you get higher in levels, listen to everyone else :)<br />

Saying that we absolutely cannot tank in PoP is very untrue.  I have tanked for xp groups in HoH for extended times, and I've also tanked mobs in Sol Ro's tower when the only tank has died or (quite often) offtanking.  I am not a good tank, I am nothing compared to plate melees, but it can be done if needed.  My gear is also subelemental, and I'm missing most defensive AA.  A well equipped shaman should have no problems in tier 2 and 3 if its really needed once he gets the mobs slowed.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter if your slow at that level sucks, slap it on the mob anyway, it's what you'll be doing in 90% of the groups you're in from level 50 on, so you may as well get in the habit early.  I don't know many shamans who EVER are without the following spells memmed: a slow, a heal, a canni, a root and either a DoT or a debuff.<br />
<br />
If you're not chewing on your arm or leg, you're wrong.  If you're mana pool is full, you're wrong.  If you're at full hp, you're wrong.  Learn to Canni Dance, do it till it's an unconscious reflex and you find yourself canni-ing without even realizing.  Nobody likes a shaman who stops the group cold cause they're oom.  If you are at full mana and there is a mob in your camp, DoT it, nuke it, slow it, debuff it, throw a heal on a hurt groupmate, do whatever is handy that you haven't already done or that might need to be done.  If you're at full mana and there are no mobs..buff or heal your group.  If you're full mana and out of mobs, find a better place to hunt.  If there are multiple mobs in camp slow them all then do some Crowd Control, off tank it, sic Fido, whatever floats your boat and works for the group you're in.<br />
<br />
Oh, and whoever said that a shaman can't tank in PoP, you're DEAD wrong.  You may not be as good at it as a genuine plate wearing tank class, but you CAN do it in a pinch and once you have the right AA's, you can be all about getting IN TEH FACE with anything you can slow.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the other Prophets out there, but I find that Shamans thrive in chaos, so spend some time learning what you're fully capable of doing, and that means spending time here getting your daily dose of wisdom from those who have it to share.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rokktor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shaman that meditate for mana need to be smacked, and smacked good.<br />
<br />
Big GD deal.  I don't care if the semantics are &quot;sit and med&quot; or &quot;canni for mana.&quot;  My point is the same.  You're a caster, stay out of melee and get more mana so I don't have to wait on your ass between pulls.  Whatever that means to you, I don't care, just don't be doing dumb crap that causes your mana to limit the kill rate.  That is all I said.  Stop being a retard.<br />
<br />
But root the thing, slow it, stack a couple dots, and then go melee with puppy, and YOU tell ME what kinda damage we dish.<br />
<br />
Again, wisen up please.  &quot;Ooooh I do so much damage.&quot;  Good for you, I bet you *really* outdamage a level 1 rogue.  Now compare this to a wizard with your same level and approximate AA.  Or a necro, or a rogue, or a ranger, etc.  And compare the shaman l33t damage with the number of HP a mob has.  It's nothing to scoff at, but don't try to make it sound like people want you in groups because of DPS.  I mean, are we playing the same game?  That's a laughable suggestion.<br />
<br />
We know how to buff. If you don't want a buff we give you, click it off.<br />
<br />
Again, more nonsense.  I'm telling you, that beyond standard HoS/Focus and STA, I don't want to be spammed by your buffs.  You could easily fill my buff bar as my clarity fades.  Enchanter recasts and I miss it.  Don't give me GD charisma and agility.  Just don't do it.  Even if I have the slots, I will be using those during the fights for self taps.  I can't make this any more obvious at how stupid it is for you to suggest that a shaman knows exactly what a group member needs and should buff at will.  Not all shamen know what they are doing, you seem to be one of them.<br />
<br />
If you wish to give us another perspective, please don't tell us you know jack about playing a shaman from a first-hand perspective before giving us your opinion.<br />
<br />
That's about the most assinine thing I've ever read.  &quot;Don't give us another perspective, if you don't have the same perspective we already have.&quot;  Ummm, are you stupid?  I mean, seriously.  This game isn't rocket science, don't act like it is and that nobody else can figure out what others classes do well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that would be me.  And you sir, are clueless.<br />
<br />
Yes, a wizard in Time gear and 400 AA can tank slowed mobs in Plane of Nightmare.  Great.  So it's possible, yes.  /golfclap<br />
<br />
Just because it's possible, doesn't mean it's efficient.  Most decent groups are looking for efficiency.  By that logic, most of the groups that you, as a shaman, will join, will not have you tanking.  So telling a new shaman &quot;d00d j00 kAn tanX0r&quot; is stupid and just promotes the dumb ebay style of play.  The people who listen to that will start tanking early on, and continue doing dumb things like melee instead of canni/med later on.  <br />
<br />
Ever hear the phrase Battle Cleric?  Before they got a few offensive spells, back in original EQ, we all used to dread those bastards.  As I prefaced in my original post.. if you are full full mana (i.e. C5 and bardsong and FT15) and can't really do anything more, then go ahead and melee.  But some of you make it sound like the life of a shaman through 65 is to be a ranger with better spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope you realize that at 27 you are at one of the more frustrating levels as a shaman.  I felt I was weaker than ever at around 18-23; at 24 I got Canni and Regen and had a big jump in power, using Cannidance; but by 27 or so that was flagging already, and IIRC the lvl 29 spells are not really anything to cheer about.  At 34 you get the pet and a good round of spells, at 39 it gets even better, and from there on to 65 you get more and more capable and more and more powerful.<br />
<br />
Things to try -<br />
<br />
Solo: Slow mobs and tank for your dog.  Use DOTs and DD if you have mana, and keep yourself healed.  This is important to get your defense skill up.<br />
<br />
Group: If you are main healer at 27, you're going to be hurting for mana.  Necessary buffs for MT only and ROTATE THE BUFFS - i.e. don't fully buff and then med, cast one buff, have the tank pull, cast another one after the fight, etc.  This gives you a chance to canni back the mana.  If you are not casting, you should be cannibalizing.  Use the Cannidance (see the Medicine Cabinet).  If your best slow is running you out of mana, try your second-best slow.  SLOW IS YOUR BEST WAY TO KEEP THE TANKS HEALTHY: DAMAGE NOT TAKEN IS DAMAGE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HEAL.<br />
<br />
If you are not main healer, debuff as much as is practical.  Learn when to cast slow so you don't die.  Stand RIGHT NEXT to the MT if you cast slow on inc, or right next to the mob if you cast after it is in camp and engaged.  Trust your MT to take aggro from you.  After engaging, cannidance again if you can, or just cannibalize if you can't sit.<br />
<br />
A horse is REALLY nice because you get mana regen while cannibalizing without using cannidance.  However, cannidance is still better than a horse if you hit every tick, because you get the health regen as well.<br />
<br />
Keep regen on yourself constantly and cannibalize down to 80% or so.  Some people cann farther down than that, but it's nice to have the HP in reserve in case you have to tank, and I figure that as long as HP is not 100% I am not wasting health regen, so it really doesn't matter where I am with that.  Sometimes I'd dip to 60% or 70% if I had a lot of rebuffs to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nanuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Long time lurker, occasionally posting, but no longer able to access old account made a new one so I could start to participate.<br />
<br />
My background is I have played my shaman since april 2000 as my main.  I remember the levels of 27 through 34 quite well.  Heck I remember the 40's very well too.  During level 28 I was really wanting to change characters.  My heal stunk, at least on the small group of friends I played with.  That coupled with so many other 'little' things, mostly my 'friends' griping that I shouldn't be doing this or that even though it was thier first characters as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway 29 just seemed to give life to me.  At 34 I felt the taste of great things to come and it continued each level.  In the later days, all my friends started to agree with what I had done in my earlier days.<br />
<br />
First off.  In my opinion get in there and MELEE!  Get that defense maxed!  I tried doing this as often as possible, usually being laughed at.  However at later levels when I was able to tank the mobs a WHOLE lot longer than those sissies that just sat and medded and nuked or healed when needed.  When slow gets resisted, you definately want to be able to take a hit or avoid one entirely so that you get another chance at it.  As an example, in my guild in one of the phase 1 trials in Time, we had a shaman as an offtank on one of the splits when we were a bit low on offtanks.  He never died, we killed all the mobs, and went to phase 2.  So, as a shaman being able to take a hit is VERY much needed in my opinion.<br />
<br />
As for what our role is.  Adaptation as mentioned above hits right on the money.  In fact I wouldn't mind a few more spell gem slots to save me from swapping so much. LOL.  Assist heal, assist dps, crowd control, you name it we can do it, mind you not the best, but effectively.<br />
<br />
Rule to live by, Don't Panic.  Best way to learn this is get in things that aren't cookie cutter easy.  Push yourself on taking on new roles.  Don't always do the optimal group.<br />
<br />
Slowing and debuffing is the key role we play as so many have said above, just don't neglect the other areas.  Sadly I have seen so many shaman that are so one deminsional it just shocks me.<br />
<br />
Last pointer I'll leave several have said it before, visit and learn from the crucible.  I know I can say I have even learned a lot in all my lurking and hope that I may be able to help out now and in the future here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Aye, Karshak. Much anger there is in Rokk, and not a whole hell of a lot of sense. That's cool, it takes all kinds to make a world and that includes Norrath, IMHO. <br />
<br />
That said, I don't find it productive to get into a personal flame-fest with you, Rokk ... waste of time. As someone else said, and as the numerous PM's I have gotten attest to, what I said is dead-on, like it or not. Do me a quick favor, please, and delete the word &quot;retard&quot; from your vocabulary. One can do a fine job of displaying one's ignorance without using the word. <br />
<br />
Now, on to more important matters ... our class and capabilities. I may not be the smartest or most well-equipped shaman in Norrath ... but I certainly know how to play my class. I also know what I'm capable of. I've been doing it for 65 winters. <br />
<br />
That said, certainly a shaman is NOT the class that does the most damage in the game. I don't recall having said it was ... what I do believe I said, or at least alluded to, was that with a couple of dots stacked, puppy's help and a slow, our less-than-stellar pure melee damage is enough to take a mob without breaking a sweat. Yes, shaman can tank in the planes, I've done it. Yes, shaman can tank LDON, I've done it (before anyone asks, I've not done a hard adventure yet). <br />
<br />
You don't want to be spammed by my buffs ... well, to each his own. But do you consider a cast of Ferine Avatar every 6 minutes and 30 seconds spam? NP, I'll save it for the ST. *shrug* Nope, not all &quot;shamen&quot; know what they're doing ... that's a given in any walk of life, Norrath or RL. However, there are a few of us out there who make it a point to get to know some things about other classes and what buff sets are most beneficial in different situations. If we don't know, there are those of us who ASK.<br />
<br />
No, I'm not stupid. If I do, in fact, do something stupid, I have no doubt that my girlfriend will step up and rather quickly inform me of having done such ... *wink* ... You did, however, begin your original post by informing us that you knew jack about how to play a shaman, and then proceeded to give us a dissertation ... about something you admittedly know jack about. I realize I'm not the smartest Barbarian in the world, but that one went right over my head.<br />
<br />
:confused:<br />
<br />
That said ... Sadorea, you've picked an excellent class for versatility ... you will be able to fill nearly any role your group situation requires of you. Aye, you're at a tough level, but stick with it ... it's gonna get real fun, real quick. Good luck to you!!</div></div><hr />

As a backup healer in Hard missions with a main healer (clr/dru) I do about 180k minimum and 230-250k at the high-end (inculding pet). This is with malos/slow at highest priority and backup healing/damage at a 2nd obviously.<br />
<br />
For comparison the rogues I group with usually do about 400-430k with JTB + DoD or DoD + Ifir.</div></div><hr />
