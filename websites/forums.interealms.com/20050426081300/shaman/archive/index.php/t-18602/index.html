<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Persop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I have been a long time lurker on these boards but have finally registered so I can post this and hear your replies. <br />
<br />
I have a 61 Shammie on Brell and its like I've hit a brick wall. No idea where to go to get xp or if I should do AA or reg XP. My old haunts like Dulak have dried up with the XP bar not moving after 6-7 kills for say 2/3 of a % point. <br />
<br />
Anyway here is my situation: No Malo or Torpor but both Bane of Nife and Pox. On Brell have only seen Malo and torpor for 50k each. Don't have anywhere near that money.<br />
<br />
Almost exclusively solo as the dialup ISP I am on has a 2 hour timer after which you have to relink. Its a generic thing to the UK so I cant change it. Also cant get cable or DSL as I live too far in the countryside. Given this I have never joined a guild as raiding is nigh impossible with the time restriction. <br />
<br />
I really like the shaman I want to get him to 65, I want to get him all these lovely AA points I read about but like I say, some advice on where to go and what to do now would be appreciated. Thanks.<br />
<br />
BTW currently have 0 AApoints as having read the boards it seemed wisdom was to go straight for 65. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get 62 as soon as you can, no matter where you get it, then go to HoH, and BoT. Once you get there, 65 comes very quickly.<br />
<br />
To get to 62, i would recommend going to the following zones.<br />
<br />
PoV, PoStorms (Grouped)<br />
<br />
Any other zone with Blue mobs! (solo).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">like he said, get to 62, much better xp spots open up then.<br />
<br />
For now, grab a mage or sk/pally and duo trash in PoN, I did that before around 60 and it was great xp, more than 1% a kill at least. In two hours with a friend, I'm sure you could get at least 35% of 61. With mage you got your pet toys, and their bad ass pets, just grab a virtue cause you will get hit a lot, even if you want the mage pet to tank. <br />
<br />
If you got a sk/pally, cast away of course without much worries of getting hit....never actually tried it with a tank (did mages a few times), but I'd guess the mobs don't die as fast, but you're most likely healing less too, so it's a tradeoff (there was some minor downtime between pulls the mage way).<br />
<br />
You can try soloing there, but they hit really hard, your dead if you get an add (or you have to zone-root never lasts long on them), and it's sometimes hard to single pull the trash. What I found to work the best, regarding downtime after a kill, was to use root to split up the tanking between you and your pet, with you tanking most of the time, but stepping back to heal, re dot, etc. I cast rage a lot when soloing (no voice of berserker), which lasts 20 minutes (I think?), if I could find single pulls quick enough, I could take down 3 before I needed to recast it. At about 2% a kill, you're looking at a full yellow, but that's high end, I'd guess you could average 12-15% an hour there.<br />
<br />
Also, the trees took a bit longer to die than the spiders and ravens, and hit harder (even though there all around the same level) and I didn't notice much difference in xp, so if you can choose a different target, I'd do that.<br />
 <br />
One disclaimer, I had NO pox while soloing or grouping here, you do, I'm sure that's a HUGE help here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im in the UK and I dont have that dial up rubbish, I use better Dial ups, like clara net and zen, not freeserve and all the rubbish like that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taiyed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I play on Brell, and once you get 62 you'll be 65 in no time.<br />
<br />
As far as Malo/Torpor prices... I'm a heavy bazaar watcher (it does pay off, I found Fo7 for 30k) and Malo can be had for 20k, and Torpor 25k or less.  There's also research, with Torpor components being more common than Malo.<br />
<br />
Grind out 62 in PoV/PoS and head to BoT!  I'd really suggest getting Malo ASAP as it makes life 100% easier slowing those PoP mobs.  They rarely resist once hit with Malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taiyed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OH, and I've never seen Malo or Torpor at 50k!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Getting 62 is probably the closest thing to a hell level you'll have to deal with these days.  The amount of xp required to go from 61 to 62 is a huge step up from the amount between 60 and 61.  <br />
<br />
Your best bet here is patience and perserverance.  Put up your lfg flag and go from plane to plane /ooc'ing that you're looking for a group.  A good tier 2 group is the fastest way to push through this level.  However, any xp is good xp at this point, so don't be too picky, take any group you can get that nets you xp.  <br />
<br />
Some of the places I ground out level 62 were droga (bring a decent group and you can do well here), LDoN, any plane I could get a group in, Chardok B, and Veksar.  Some were better than others, some were easier than other, and some were just fun for a change of pace.  <br />
<br />
The trick is to just push through it, once you get 62 and can get a group in BoT, you'll be able to grind out to 65 in a few days time.</div></div><hr />
