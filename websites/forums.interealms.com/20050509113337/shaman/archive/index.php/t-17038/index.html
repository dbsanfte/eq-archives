<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>xmortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello guys and gals, I want to say that I've been reading these forums for a very long time even though I've never had more than a mid 20's shaman of my own. I used to multibox my friends 62 shammy once in awhile, but never had proper respect for her until lately. You guys have a great community, and it's great reading these boards. Glad I finally joined, and hopefully will have something to contribute.<br />
<br />
Anyway to the point,<br />
<br />
I decided to come out of retirement after a long break. A friend on a different server than all of my mains, wanted us to start with a real world friend that was in the top guild on Cazic so we started over there planning on doing a Shammy/Necro duo. <br />
<br />
I have a 34 Frog Shammy now, and I'm having fun. Just got Dogdog and was reading up on pet usage from a shammies point of view, and I was wondering if there were any recommended tactics for power leveling now that the pet is involved? I have access to a 51 druid, and 59 warrior to help with leveling. Up until now I've been buffing and thorning myself and doing it that way, or when I need to work on casting skills I buff and thorn and pull with the warrior, and then cast at the train pounding on him, and practice my canni dance. (My main is a bard on my home server so it was easy to adapt from twisting to canni dance, and I did it naturally before I read the details). This seems effective, but I wanted to see if there was any other tactics now that Dogdog is around.<br />
<br />
Secondly, is a fungi worth getting at this point? If I'm figuring right pretty soon, the other characters are going to be of diminishing returns to use while leveling. Currently Using my own buffs, and soloing I notice that the health regen seems to be the determining factor... No worries no druid mentality I'm all AC / HP gear, but when duoing with my buddy as his necro, I'm having trouble keeping up and most downtime seems to be my fault.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions or advice would be helpful as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you're probably doing it the best way now.  For pure speed leveling, nothing really beats thorns and mass pulling, just be sure not to slow and be sure you get at least a few hits on every mob.  It is good that you are using the warrior to keep your skills up.<br />
<br />
The fungi's value depends on how often you keep your pocket druid around.  The fungi is amazing at lower levels, but since your druid can heal/regen you, there are probably more worthwhile investments for the money.  <br />
<br />
The single best advice i can give you is not to go too fast.  Its easy to fall into a trance powerleveling and forget to keep skills up, and just plan to do them later, only to find yourself at level 55 still using level 24 spells and wearing crap gear with crap skills.  Every short while I'd stop and do some real soloing, or grouping, to be sure you have a solid grip on the class.</div></div><hr />

Oh I agree completely.. at least once every spell level, I take a day and group, or solo. This helps me understand the progression of spells, and buffs etc.. I buy every spell, and use it to understand. I keep all skills maxed, and make sure that all abilities are up to par before moving on to the next spell level. I've played a troll shammy from 59 -62 so I know those levels and spells, but I think you get a healthier respect for what you can do at higher levels if you've had to use the lower level versions of spells... Such as watching the dot damage done, or noting the root ratios, or watching the Canni progression etc...</div></div><hr />
