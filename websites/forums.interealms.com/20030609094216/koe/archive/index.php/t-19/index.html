<br />
In the Keepers of the Elements, we have many good people.  I am not just talking about personality; I am also speaking of skilled players, brilliant tacticians, and of course people that care about one another.  We are all very fortunate.  I think there are many of us that have common goals, common interests, and common ideals.  This is what makes our guild so special.<br />
<br />
We also have a few people that put unneeded, or unwanted stress on the rest of the guild, and the officers.  I will not be tolerating poor behavior any longer.  We are all adults here, and this is,     just a game.  There is no room for pettiness, whining, or a lack of courtesy here.<br />
<br />
Having said all of that, the following is for the individual that wants to take advantage of the kindness of my guild-mates, and of the environment that we have created here.  If the shoe fits, wear it.  This message comes with the support of all of the officers in the guild, so bear that in mind.<br />
<br />
If we see any of the following, we will be speaking with you directly, we will be polite the first time, and direct the second.  There will not likely be a third time.  It will most likely be recommended that you are deguilded.  We the officers will no longer be your babysitters.<br />
<br />
    The issues:<br />
<br />
    Loot<br />
From this point forward, we do not want to see anyone bitch about loot.  Everyone in this guild knows what our loot policy is.  You were required to read it before joining.  If you would like clarification on some part of it, please feel free to ask a question, or make suggestions as to how our policy can be enhanced.  If you read it and are not happy, please deguild at your earliest possible convenience.  This will be better for you, and be better for us.  We will no longer tolerate loot whining.  If you feel the need to be jealous of others, get out now.<br />
<br />
    Grouping<br />
We are not here to provide you with groups or coddle you and make you feel loved.  If you are in this guild, it is because someone within our ranks recognized you as a good player, and a good person.  It is our expectation that you be self-sufficient enough to go out  and start a group, if there is nothing available within the guild.  We have no problems with people asking in /gu if a group is available.  We have     serious problems with people who throw a temper tantrum if a group is not available.  If we see it, we will be talking to you.  If it is constant, we will be recommending you leave.  If you don't like it, get out.<br />
<br />
    The Message Board<br />
There will be no personal attacks on this board.  Period.  There is no reason to personally flame someone who you play a video game with.  If you make a personal attack, please log out of this board, and don't log back on.  Who are     you to place judgement on someone else?  This message board is a convenience for guild communication, not a place to flame your guild-mate, or anyone else for that matter.  There is nothing wrong with disagreeing strongly with someone, but be an adult.  If you want people to flame, head over to the Veeshan board on eqvault.com.  If we see personal attacks, you will get one warning.<br />
<br />
    Guildchat/Tells to Officers<br />
Guildchat is not a place to flame other guild-members, or spam the entire guild.  There are over 100 people in our guild.  It is important that this channel be available for communication.  Whenever possible, please try to take things to tells.  This is an issue, but not a major one.  This is not some draconian regime.  Telling jokes/etc. is perfectly fine, all we ask is that you be as courteous as possible.  One thing that I do when sending someone a tell...  My first tell always starts out with, 'Are you busy?'  If the person is busy, I let them be.  If it is an emergency, I say something like 'Sorry to bother you, but this is really important'  Be courteous of others.  Officers log on to play the game too; not to be bombarded with tells.  This does not mean we are not available for you, or that we do not want to be your friends.  It just means, be coureous.  If we do not respond to your tells, do not take this as an insult bear in mind that we might be in combat, or in tells, or afk.<br />
<br />
    Courtesy to those outside of our guild<br />
Personally, I don't give a rats ass what you think of anyone outside of our guild.  We in KoE are the good guys.  We expect you to act like it.  We don't care how someone else from another guild acts, we expect    you to act like an adult, and treat everyone politely, and with courtesy.  We are certainly not saying you cannot defend yourself, or represent yourself, and we are not saying you have to stifle your opinions, We are saying that you had damn well better present them in an adult way.  If you see one of our members grouped with CD, FoH, Legion,     whoever please feel free to keep your, 'when are you leaving for Another_guild_02' comments to yourself.<br />
<br />
I am certain that I could go on, but this is all for now.  I will add to this as I come up with more.  If you act like an adult, and are here to have fun, none of the above should affect you in any way.  If you are confused about anything, please read the Etiquette Guide (&quot;http://forums.interealms.com/koe/showthread.php?threadid=9&quot;) as it answers all pertinent questions.  If you live by this guide while you are in this guild, you will NEVER have a problem with me, or anyone else.  If you still have questions, please feel free to post them here.  I also challenge each and every one of you to post your support for this thread.<br />
<br />
  ADDENDUM: <br />
This is not an agree/disagree post.  This is how it is going to be from here on out.<br />
<br />
Best regards to all of you,<br />
