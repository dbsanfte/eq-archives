<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm happy that some guilds are in Planes of Elements exploring and killing boss mobs.    I hope to make it myself someday ... but till then I'm hoping runes continue to drop at same rate for the latter guilds as dropping for current ones.   <br />
<br />
Example of what these drop rates do for some guilds.   On my server there is a bot parked with some spells for sale.   Oh say ... Seven (7) copies of Quiescence for 75,000 plat per.   Or maybe Strike of Solusek for 130,000 plat and couple more Tears of Marr for 75,000.   Nice to be on the top ... and nice to get bakers dozens of Runes.   Again ... just hoping that the drop rates don't go to crap as some wish them.    Lastly hoping that the market continues to be flooded with spells like 61-62 have today ... with some of them selling for 250-300 plat.   <br />
<br />
Quiescence may never get to 300 plat ... but surely this isn't what the Dev's had in mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the bot parked with all the 60th spells is probably not an uberguild selling off extras.<br />
<br />
It is much more likely to belong to an enchanter that has solo'd bosses in BoT using charm and gate and has every spawn down to the second.<br />
<br />
We are in elemental and yes we have gotten alot of runes. But no where near enough to sell any of them.</div></div><hr />
