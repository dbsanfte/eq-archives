<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Airwhale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I figured it might be interesting for me to place down my general stratgys for my shamans roll in group play now, so that others might comment and I can improve! So, rip me apart. To give you an idea of where I am, I just dinged level 60 last night, and the only AA I have is run3.<br />
<br />
In a group at any time, I知 generally doing one of seven things. Pulling, slowing/maloing, healing, placing Dots on things, crowd control, regaining mana, and buffing.<br />
<br />
Pulling:<br />
________________________________________________<br />
I find that, as a shaman, I can pull fairly well. Better than a warrior, but worse than an SK (and much worse than a monk/bard). I often find myself performing this role in pickup groups, or groups without a tank. The main advantages to me pulling are 1) that the mob comes pre-slowed and 2) I have a pet to distract mobs (a la SK pulling)<br />
<br />
This will all change once I get my VP AA =)<br />
<br />
If there is only one mob, I do the following.<br />
<br />
1) Malo the mob and send the pet in (and now that I知 level 60, my malo cannot be resisted! Woohoo!) The malo is not enough to pull the mob away from the pet, so my pet is now getting beaten on.<br />
2) I cast slow on the mob. This is enough to shift the mobs attention from my pet to my frog.<br />
3) I back up to the tank and let him pull away the now slowed mob.<br />
4) Heal myself if I am hurt, then I do something else<br />
<br />
If there are two mobs, I do something like the following<br />
<br />
1) Get as far away as I can.<br />
2) Send the pet in on mob 1, while I malo mob 2. I try to get both to hit at the same time.<br />
3) Slow mob 2. By this time, pet has taken moderate damage. MT at this point should start wacking at mob 2.<br />
4) Malo and slow mob 1. By the time I知 done with that, Pet is dead/almost dead and mob 2 is off of me.<br />
5) Root-rot mob 1 while group is working on mob 2.<br />
6) Heal myself, and recast pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
If there are three mobs, I warn group that we may wipe and do the following:<br />
<br />
1) Get as far away as I can.<br />
2) Send in pet on mob 1 while I root mob 2. If it resists root, I die. Group wipes. Wheeee!<br />
3) Mob 3 is now beating on me. I slow without malo. If it resists, I知 in trouble, but I usually have time for another slow or a root. If it sticks, I知 sitting pretty.<br />
4) Malo and slow mobs 1 and 2, order depends on how pet is doing. Group may still wipe at this point!<br />
5) Root mob 2, and root-rot mobs 1 and 2 as root breaks. Heal self.<br />
6) If group survives, recast pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Malo/Slow<br />
________________________________________________<br />
<br />
If I am not pulling, I will try to malo as soon as the mob is pulled/i.e. well before it reaches the group. This usually does not draw agro to me. Then I stand by the main tank, start casting slow, so that the mob will only get a few un-slowed hits in. This usually draws agro to me, but, since I am right by the tank, it痴 a simple matter for the tank to get him off me.<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
________________________________________________<br />
<br />
If there is no Cleric/Druid, I spend the rest of the fight looking at my partys health bars. If there is a cleric, I just try and look for signs that our cleric is taking damage or can稚 heal the party fast enough.<br />
<br />
I usually use my 2k Hp/10 second cast heal. This heal is adequate but not great. I also have chloroblast up (I think 400 hp/2 sec) in case I need someone to be healed quickly.<br />
<br />
Damage<br />
________________________________________________<br />
<br />
If dps is slow, I will throw some of my high agro poison dots on them. Agro management with these is tricky, esp. if I want to stack them. Thus, I usually try to stay as far away from the group as possible to reduce agro, and then I fire away after the Main Tank has wacked on the mob for a bit. I need to get my lower agro curse DoTs from ldons I知 waiting till I知 level 65 so it won稚 take as many adventures.<br />
<br />
Crowd Control<br />
________________________________________________<br />
<br />
If there is more than one mob, I will slow the one the MT is not hitting, which will pull it off the MT and onto me. Assuming the slow sticks, I place my poison DoTs on it, root it, and go back to slowing. If the MT is having a rough time, or I am the main healer, I let the slowed mob beat on me and move on to slowing the mob the MT is fighting. (which will not draw the mob to me.<br />
<br />
Regaining mana<br />
________________________________________________<br />
<br />
I have about 4k hp buffed. Therefore, I usually canni down to about 55%, heal myself with my 2k hp complete heal, then continue canning or start doing something else.<br />
<br />
Buffing<br />
________________________________________________<br />
<br />
I try to do the following:<br />
Everyone but clerics and casters get HP buffs,<br />
Everyone gets IoS<br />
Everyone gets Sta buff<br />
Tanks and pets get Str.<br />
Tanks, pets that proc, and wizards and mages get Dex ( I heard a rumor that dex helps spells crit.)<br />
Bards and enchanters get Chr.<br />
If there is no cleric or druid, everyone gets AC buff<br />
Tanks and pets get haste.<br />
If I think of it, everyone gets regen.<br />
MT gets Agi. (There have been parses that show Agi being almost worthless in high levels not sure if that is true or not, but I cast it less now.)<br />
<br />
If anyone asks for anything, I cast it on them without questioning why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sound like you are doing more than your fair share :)<br />
<br />
Here are a few suggestions:<br />
<br />
Healing: You don't mention Stoicism. Do the quest, get it. It is incredible.<br />
<br />
Stat buffs: Don't bother casting them on pets. The effect is none to negligible. Use your discretion on PC's. Personally I'd only IoS the cleric &amp; the dress-wearers, but thats me. I've never heard the rumor of dex increasing spell crits &amp; i'm old enough to recall the &quot;anti-camping radius&quot; myth.<br />
<br />
Pet-pulling: You're blowing a lot of mana having to recast dog. Do this instead; Summon a low lvl pet that cons green to the mobs you want to pull. Buff dog with hps &amp; AC or Temp. if you have a cleric in the group. If outdoors, SoW dog. Position yourself at max range, cast stoicism on dog, immediately sic him on the closest mob. The Instant dog engages the mob, hammer /pet back off untill he's running back to you with the mob in tow. If dog survives the initial melee, you'll have only 1 mob inc. I have a seperate chat window with pet hits &amp; misses in it specifically for doing this. Tank can then acquire aggro on mobs while inc by simply tagging it. Obviously this strategy involves having stoicism, so get it asap :)<br />
<br />
Odium &amp; anathema. Get them. Do hard ldons to acquire more points &amp; get these two dots as soon as possible. I was retired throughout LoY &amp; GoD. When I came back, friends told me to get these spells immediately &amp; boy I'm glad I did.</div></div><hr />

Interesting point this and something that seems to afflict only the shaman class.<br />
Ive often done it myself and seen other shaman do it and that is to do nearly all the work for the damn group.<br />
Dont know why though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your methods of using you Shaman are great and your obvious enthusiasm is awsome to see.... many are please with this great class and what they can add to most groups.  I have some suggestions and tips that work for me, so please take them or leave them as you see fit and play however you feel will best benefit you and keep the level of evjoyment up for you.<br />
<br />
Your Pulling Methods sound solid for now, however they will have to change when you get a little higher into the levels and the dogdog gets killed in half a round by the NPC's that you are attempting to kill.  Typically what I do is run out and use some tribute or a mage item for Extended Range IV (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3510&amp;source=Live) and Malo then run back to the group, stop turn around and then cast slow as my spell gems are refreshed. *note - this method doesn't really work in OoW as most of the NPC's are really fast and will beat on you, best to let the melee pull in WoS and higher<br />
<br />
Malo/Slowing are normal... If others are pulling, usually 1 arrow that has hit the NPC will take that agro off of you from Malo, then stand next to the tank and slow instantly, taking the chance to steal agro from a good number of tanks, or hang tight a few seconds and let the tank secure the hate and then cast slow.<br />
<br />
Your Healing is sound as well, you will learn to love Torpor (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1576&amp;source=Live), and most will tell you how much they hate it.  More often that not, Melee will cry about not being able to move around so the casters are the better target for this spell, when you get to 62 get an Imrpoved Healing IV (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3501) item or tribute effect and replace Kragg's Mending (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2435&amp;source=Live) with Tnarg's Mending (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3233&amp;source=Live), but I am getting ahead of myself.<br />
<br />
As for Croud Control, root is your friend.  As you progress a little into the future, you may have a tough time having 2 NPC's beating on you/the tank and will have to root an NPC on incoming and then switch target as the other comes ballelling towards the group.<br />
<br />
Onto Regaining Mana, I agree wit the method thath you are using, but now that you are levle 60, Torpor is that way to go... at half that mana you get to regen 1200 HP's which will speed up the works, not to mention that fact that you can be casting Cannibalize IV while being healed by Torpor, reducing that chance that you ever get too low on HP's by accident or unforseen agro.  I assume that you are buffed with VoQ or KEI whenever possible as well, but only mention it as to add length to this long and boring reply.<br />
<br />
Last but not least, Buffing.  Now that you are 60, it is much simpler to <br />
Khura's Focusing (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2530&amp;source=Live)  (STR and DEX are included)<br />
Talisman of the Brute (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1580&amp;source=Live)<br />
Talisman of the Cat (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1579&amp;source=Live)<br />
Spirit of Bih'Li  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2524&amp;source=Live)  (while outdoors)<br />
Pack Shrew (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4055&amp;source=Live)  (while indoors)<br />
Regrowth of Dar Khura (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2528&amp;source=Live)  (I know that there is a higher level version of this, it is a group spell and is easier on that mana pool and buff time)<br />
Ancestral Guard (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3381&amp;source=Live)  (when there is no Cleric around)<br />
and haste... always haste the melee... especially the rogues (Backstab refreshes faster if hasted)<br />
And, if the casters prefer to use their oun buffs that don't stack with Focus,  then by all means Infusion of Spirit (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3454) them. (Brute and Cat still stack with IoS)<br />
<br />
That is how I play my Shaman, other will give you different advice but the best advise that I cangive you is keep up that good work and play the way that you enjoy playing, take advise from people and use what you like and finally don't be afraid to ask that more experienced players for advice from time to time.<br />
<br />
Have fun.  :)</div></div><hr />

Yes, same as Torpor.  It acts like a snare and that is the &quot;downside&quot; for the efficient heals.<br />
<br />
And good point about Stoicism (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=15952) I forgot all about it.  That post has the Blood of Nadox (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3842&amp;source=Live) quest as well... very useful spell to get.<br />
<br />
Yeah Wulf... Shaman seem to do a fair bit of work, but a canni hotkey to do 5 in a row... that works till you get the ancient 65 or the new 67.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My apoligies. I was too high lvl to consider Stoicism when it came out. Thought it was a Mini Q, not a Mini Torpor.<br />
<br />
&amp; Wulf, aint it the truth. Kills me to be in a group with my friends &amp; them keep saying &quot;boy you're quiet today&quot; while I'm mashing buttons furiously :) The new Cann has helped a bit. I can sometimes get a whole sentance out on occasion now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My apoligies. I was too high lvl to consider Stoicism when it came out. Thought it was a Mini Q, not a Mini Torpor.<br />
All good, actually, its a good solution to the problem of the costly Torpor spell if you are not in the plat.  + rep bump to you for practicallity. ;)  ... besides, he has to be in that neck of the woods... well sort of to do the Blood of Nadox quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Think the reference to stoicism was in regards to healing himself from canni. or healing casters.<br />
<br />
If he was able to afford malo (or fought for it) he should also consider getting the lvl 60 heal over time, torpor.  It has a little under twice the healing capacity of stoicism.  <br />
<br />
In terms of pet pulling, or pulling at all.. I think you'll find that as your level increases, you'll do less pulling.  Most unslowed mobs lvl 63+ are going to kill your dog way too fast. (for instance, my pet is dead in under  second in the zones I fight in) Its generally a better plan to have a tougher class pull.  Any melee will do.  In addition, people forget that if outdoors, druids and rangers are excellent pullers.  Between bards, druids, rangers, monks, necros, and sk's, I think you should always be able to find a puller.  <br />
<br />
Stand a bit ahead of the group, and cast malos on inc followed immediatedly by slow.  If you time this right, slow should land a second after the tank engages, hopefully allowing him time to taunt/proc. Remember, while you have been use to being in mobs faces to this point... those days are numbered.  In addition, tanks mitigate damage way better than you do.  Its much more efficient to let a tank absorb damage when possible.  <br />
<br />
After you get Torpor, however, healing yourself to full life after root parking an add and getting beat on, will cost you so little mana, that it is once again inconsequential.  <br />
<br />
If two mobs are pulled into camp, after the initial malos, toss tigirs (AE slow) to attempt slow both, then follow with Turgurs.  If the mobs you are fighting are too mean to risk having 2 beat on you (like if both AE slows bounce, and the tank can't get it off you) then you might want to not try this tactic.  <br />
<br />
The more you have to do, root parking, pulling, etc.. the less time there is to canni.  Your time is much better spent tossing as much mana out each battle (in any form), and then furiously canni'ing it back before the next mob is inc.<br />
<br />
Obviously, if you can't find the right group makeup, you have to adapt.  And the shaman is the true jack of all trades.  However, in terms of getting the most out of each nights play, its always better to spend a little extra time forming a more ideal group.<br />
<br />
The shamans main roles are, as you know:  Buffing players, debuffing the mob, damage the mob, and healing players.  The more you stick to these traditional roles, the more efficient your group will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Airwhale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I actually do have Stoicisum, but I stoped using it once I got the level 58 CH... for some reason I thought it was faster and more mana effecient.<br />
<br />
And, I can't afford torpor right now, sadly... 30k on my server.  I think I'm just going to skip it and wait for Q.(edit: malo was only 5k)<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for all of the advice people, really good! esp. Balkamp, Ungkor and Brothur... I'll try using some green pets and an ER iV item.  I'm excited by the thought of single pulling things from a large group! I felt resigned to just deal with all of them at once. I also am not using my AE slow at all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Now tell me what I am doing wrongYou picked &quot;Froglok&quot; when you were at the character creation screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;I stoped using it (stoicism) once I got the level 58 CH... for some reason I thought it was faster and more mana effecient.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are correct.  However, it is a nice medium downtime heal for casters until you get torpor.  Heal over times are also unique in that, you can cast them early when you see someone getting beat on (like the cleric), then go do something else, like get the add off them, or slow it, etc..  <br />
<br />
Basically, you are in the &quot;twillight zone&quot; of shaman healing.  You don't exactly have any good means of healing, as mobs are getting tougher and tougher, and 10 second cast times for 2k heals is almost not enough sometimes.  <br />
<br />
At lvl 62, however, you'll get tnargs, which will give you a fast blast heal.  At that point, you will probably never mem CH again.  Couple situations its still worth casting the CH, like on yourself if you don't have torpor, or on the MT if its sufficient to keep pace with the content you are fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>apocobring1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">haha<br />

you wanna try a class that really multi-tasks<br />
play a bard without the /melody command =P<br />
<br />
but yeah - there are tiems where i have asked people to just stop attacking my mobs while we were in group<br />
<br />
i must have some sort of fetish for pain, though...i play a bard and a shaman regularly /bog</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Airwhale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My guild leader gave me this advice. I thought I would post it here in case anyone wanted to comment on it.<br />
___________________________________________<br />
Okay, I'm not going to rip *anyone* apart and certainly not in general discussion.  ;-p  However, I do have a couple tips for you.<br />
<br />
1) We've already discussed staying too far away from the group in dungeons.  Standing away from the mob is a good idea, but standing too far away does 1 of 2 things in many cases.  First, it could draw adds, especially in expeditions where re-pops are sometimes unpredictable.  Second, it could draw agro anyway and then you have a ping pong situation with you out of range for tank to draw agro or cleric to heal you.  Careful standing too far from group in any zone with bad spell pathing.  <br />
<br />
2) I'm glad you've picked up a tactic for pulling.  Expect to use it in pickup groups.  Expect not to use it in guild groups.<br />
<br />
3) Backup healing.  Backup healing is an odd role to play because requires intense concentration, particularly when you are doing other things like slowing/maloing.  Remember that your big heal still snares people, so use it sparingly and preferably not at all on the melee classes.  Chloroplast might be better to use on them.  If the cleric isn't keeping on heals enough that you have to repeatedly chloroplast, you've got a bad cleric or something else is wrong in the group.  (You probably have a bad cleric.)  I always call my heals and you did a great job watching who I was healing and how fast others were taking damage.  The general rule on healing:  Heal the person taking the most damage first.  If a caster is taking damage, heal them right away and use the fastest heal you've got.  You may have noticed that Den and Div both go down pretty fast.  When you've got a real tank (warr, sk, pali), remember that the cleric deliberately will not heal them until they are around 40%.  If you don't see a heal call when the tank hits 35%, start casting.  If you see a CH call and the tank seems to be taking damage faster than that 10 seconds allows, toss 'em a little heal to get them through.  I am notorious for taking chances with CH and I love having a good backup healer around just in case I'm wrong.  One other thing...if you hear me call DB, that means I've cast Divine Barrier on myself and I *cannot* heal for 25 seconds.  I only do this if I've got two mobs pounding on me or if I can't get a root off on the other one.<br />
<br />
The more we explore OoW and GoD zones, the more I find myself wishing for a backup healer.  These zones are stress-intensive on the healer.  Mobs seem to be almost immune to taunt and easily agroed by casters.  On top of that, they hit damn fast and damn hard.  If I'm tossing quick heals right and left, I'm losing massive amounts of mana.  It's great if someone else can pick up some of that for me, especially someone that can regen their own mana.<br />
<br />
Last thing...try not to canni with mobs in the camp.  It isn't that important that you have a lot of mana all the time.  If you are trying to just get enough to toss a heal here or there, that's fine, but if you're cannibalizing for dots or nukes, all you are doing is giving the cleric heart failure!  <br />
<br />
You're doing a great job!  *hugs*</div></div><hr />

I dissagree wholeheartedly.  Untill you get the (65 ancient or the) 67 canni, you have to canni all the time to stay in the mana, especially if you are back up healing.  If you are at 100% health you are wasting potential mana... I am usually at 80% or less when I do not have 100% mana.  If you are finding yourself low on mana, reduce that nuking(1st) / dotting(2nd) slightly to keep in line.  Add as much DPS as you can while not having to constantly stop pulls for medding, and not ignoring your buffing and slowing duties.<br />
<br />
Everyone knows about Shaman and canni.  Except for cann v (the AA one) in which case you make a hot key for it to announce that you are still ok.<br />
<br />
The rest of the post is very accurate, but by the time that you are likely to be regularily in OoW and GoD you should have Q so just let the cleric know that you are going to use your HoT to help out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Only time I would say be cautious if there are mobs in camp when you are canning (esp with canny5) is if it will take you too low on health.

/pause ?? , /cast #  <br />

I have a hotkey to canni 5 times in a row with a very slight space between in case i have to cast some other spell instead, canni all you need all the time... get used to it, untill you get the next canni at 65/67 you will need all you can get.<br />
<br />
And, 40% is still safe as long as the conditions are good and you feel confident to do so.  Pick up groups are no lower than 50% though.</div></div><hr />

How do you canni 5 times in a row?  I can only get three:<br />
<br />
/cast 3<br />
/pause 50<br />
/cast 3<br />
/pause 50<br />

Back when I first got canny5, I was in a group in HoH.  I &quot;thought&quot; I was canning during downtime (was still wimpy, canny5 took me to about 13% then), well, the ranger pulled 2 just as I hit the button... Somehow, to the grace of a fast cleric and a pre-torpor, I managed to hit unconcious but live.  The closest I've ever come to a canny death. /knock on a wooden bard head<br />
<br />
As for normal canny 3/4/etc..  Aye, never canny down past what you feel comfortable with.  Get to know your clerics, pullers, tanks, you'll know how far is too far. (30-50 depending on trust of their abilities)<br />
<br />
I can comfortable &quot;freak out&quot; my friends by canning at low health and hit 1-2% life.  Especially if there is 1 new person in an established group. (downtime only)<br />
<br />
Slow canny is also fun, wait to see how long it takes someone to comment a &quot;be careful&quot; or &quot;umm.. you gonna stop anytime soon?!&quot;.  Mwahahaha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Everyone knows about Shaman and canni.  Except for cann v (the AA one) in which case you make a hot key for it to announce that you are still ok.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wasn't giving the clerics heart attacks from Canni V half the fun of it?  I know it was for me!<br />
<br />
A few other tips--<br />
<br />
Unless fighting in a fairly green/lt blue zone...I always Malo(s) the mob as its coming in.  It's just a waste to have to recast slow slow slow if the mob isn't malo(s)'d + the other casters will thank you for debuffing resists.  Also, malo(s) is a low agro spell unlike Tash, so you can plop it on an incomming mob without stealing agro.<br />
<br />
As for slow, depending on the tank, you may need to wait a few seconds and let the mob get whacked down to 90% before casting.  IMO with most Pally's and SK's tanking you can slow right off the bat (if they are holding agro like they should) but with warriors tanking, you need to let them whack a good 10% of the mobs health, otherwise you will have an angry mob in your face and soon, an angry group.<br />
<br />
Torpor....I kinda liked it...  but the snare/slow really made it situational.  I found it most useful casting on myself after a canni V but also its a lifesaver in raids where AE's are flying and you're squeezing out some more mana for a few more heals.  Especially useful on raids for casters taking AE's and dots.<br />
<br />
Sounds like you're having fun tho, and you have a good grasp of strategies.  Things will change especially when you hit 65 with Q and when you get Canni V and lvl 67 canni, but you'll figure it out im sure!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I would agree, always cast malos on the inc.  The only time I dont is when there are multis and one of them has already picked to wail on a caster.  That way I know I can take a beating better than a caster if it resists slow and if slow lands then there is no problem at all and I can turn my attention to the one that the MA has snagged.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing with casting malos is that it forces you to not get agro right away.  When grouped with a warrior that cant get snap agro like a SK (their new omens agro FRIGGIN ROCKS), you need to delay casting slow or you'll get agro over them.  But you also dont want to wait too long and then keep biffing slow.  So what I do is just malos on the incoming, since the only thing that is less agro than Malos is proxy agro, and then I always land Nihl after malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">A method that I use when grouped with monks or poor agro tanks is to malo, then instantly root with my Scaled Avatar Leggings (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=16801), and then slow, only losing about .5 seconds on the casting of the slow. <br />
<br />
As long as the root lands and that intended tank is closest to the rooted NPC, then the agro works as normal.<br />
<br />
** note.  Be sure to make your party's melee know about this as the closest player to the rooted NPC will get the agro. **</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">3) Backup healing.  Backup healing is an odd role to play because requires intense concentration, particularly when you are doing other things like slowing/maloing.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
When you've got a real tank (warr, sk, pali), remember that the cleric deliberately will not heal them until they are around 40%.  If you don't see a heal call when the tank hits 35%, start casting.  If you see a CH call and the tank seems to be taking damage faster than that 10 seconds allows, toss 'em a little heal to get them through.  I am notorious for taking chances with CH and I love having a good backup healer around just in case I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Last thing...try not to canni with mobs in the camp.  It isn't that important that you have a lot of mana all the time.  If you are trying to just get enough to toss a heal here or there, that's fine, but if you're cannibalizing for dots or nukes, all you are doing is giving the cleric heart failure!  <br />
<br />
<br />
Few comments...<br />
<br />
Backup healing should no longer be odd to you by now. Get used to it. Learn when to duck out of nukes/etc. to toss a blast heal. Get yourself a beneficial spell haste item like a wicked bone atali or something and a healing focus item. They are huge. And the whole 35% thing is not a defacto rule. Most clerics I know prefer that their CH lands at 35-40%, not to start casting it then (assuming your somewhere that is at all challenging for your level). Many higher tier PoP and OoW mobs will require you starting blast heals at 50-70pct just to get them to hit. For really high dps mobs I will often watch a cleric call his 10sec CH and if there is any question at all if it will hit or not, I'll start my blast heal almost imediately and watch. That gives me almost 3 seconds to decide if I can duck out of the heal and let the cleric's CH land full or let my blast hit to buy it an extra round. If you ever see your cleric duck out of a CH to blast heal, you need to blast heal too. Give the cleric some room to get the next CH on the tank. Learn your tanks, watch mob dps (damage spikes), and you'll be a fine.<br />
<br />
As far as canni... CANNI! If you aren't casting a spell at any given time you're doing something wrong. If you aren't slowing/maloing/doting/nuking/buffing, you are casting canni. If you are full manna, you are refreshing buffs and then cannin. And forget those hotkey's that do multiple canni casts. Buy yourself a Nostromo n52 and be done with it. You'll be able to auto-canni indefinately (or till you die)  and stop at will. You can and should canni durring a battle.</div></div><hr />

This sounds like 3rd party software and as such would violate the EULA for SOE.  There are many 3rd party programs out there, but that is cheating... at least that is how I see it.<br />

...although I gave mine to my Bard bud a while back. Since I already had the regular keystrokes sort of in muscle memory, I didn't put any effort into getting the most out of the Nostromo. It would have been totally different if I'd started the game with one, though.</div></div><hr />

Samanna it still seems grey to me... I like black and white on these things.  I use what is availible to me from SOE, so for now, I will hold out.  If I see someone &quot;officially&quot; saying that I will not be banned for using a gamepad, then I will reconsider my opinion.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I still groan everytime I hear a fellow Shaman OOC'ing that they are in &quot;need&quot; of a KEI.  With Canni 5 and Pained Memory, I'm probably averaging almost 150 mana per tick.  Add in the modest Flowing thought that I have, 3 from Mental Clarity, and whatever I can scrounge from sitting to med (which I don't do often since I'm fairly busy between casts of Pained Memory) and I am probably getting over 180 per tick mana generation without any non-Shaman assistance (KEI, Oak, Spiritual whatever).<br />
<br />
As for not cannibalizing during a fight, I'd have to disagree.  I debuff, slow, cast Rains and fire off some heals to save the poor druid/cleric's mana. Despite all of that, I am still frequently back to almost full mana without a KEI by the time the next pull arrives.  If the main healer gets low on mana, I renew ALL of my buffs and get to full mana by the time they have recovered 30 to 40% and are ready for the next pull.<br />
<br />
We Shaman are penalized severely (in the form of inferior heals and greater mana costs) by the developers because we have the ability to slow our opponents and because we have what is arguably the fastest mana regeneration (via our own spells) in the game (I say arguably only because there are quite a few Necromancers that hate to admit that our mana regeneration out-paces their own, especially now that Omens has upgraded our capabilities.)  To not use one of our most powerful tools because it makes the other healer(s) nervous doesn't make much sense to me.</div></div><hr />

My apologies if it sounded like I was against Shaman using non-Shaman buffs when they are available. I am not against accepting a mana regen buff when it is offered, I simply don't consider it a &quot;necessity&quot; for me to fill my role in most of the normal (non-raid) groups I join.  On alts, I've grouped with Shaman who insist on leaving to get a fresh KEI when the one they have runs out.  It especially stood out to me when I realised that some of these Shaman were either not using, or rarely using using Canniblize spells/AAs to supplement their mana regeneration, yet appeared to be having problems with running low on mana.<br />
<br />
I personally prefer to be self-sufficient as much as possible. I won't turn down a buff (be it HPs or Mana Regen) but if I don't have anything but my own buffs I am quite content to go on doing my job.  Recently I was in a Wall of Slaughter group (yes, I still do pickup groups there when the other Omens zones are dead) when the Cleric left to go get a KEI back in PoK.  Rather than wait for the Cleric, I took over as main healer until he returned and we continued steady pulls.  The entire time I was in that group (maybe 6 or 7 hours) I never once had an Enchanter's mana buff (KEI, etc). I only had the Druid's Oak HP/mana regen buff perhaps half the time, while we had a Druid chain-pulling 2 and 3 monsters at a time for us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont go out of my way to get KEI etc if its offered in group i take it thats about it.<br />
But  I cant honestly remember the last time I was full of manna in a decent pulling group.ie chain pulling basically.<br />
If you are full of manna the 1 question i would ask you is WHY?.That manna as you admit is easy to get back so why not cast another dd etc instead of canni to fom.<br />
I tend to run at about 40-60% manna 99% of the time.<br />
Being MH in WoS unless you were in the south part of zone id very much doubt you were ever fom if puller was bringing them in steady.<br />
<br />
The 1 place i do really appreciate some kind of manna buff is in instances where youre always going to be on the move.Theres nothing worse than standing there hitting canni while the rest of your group are half a mile away beating on another mob.<br />

If the situation is such that slow resists make me fear for my life, then I malo.<br />
<br />
And as far as canning goes, I cann all the time. If I get low enough I pop a stoi or kraggs on myself then continue to canni. I would always be holding up the group if I malo'd every mob and didn't canni during fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Couple of tips:<br />
<br />
Pulling: If you have a 2-pull situation, root one and pull the other (or, better yet, have adruid root 1 as you mal/slow the other). If you have a potential massive multi-pull, summon a lower level pet, and use it to pull. If the pet is a green /con to the mobs, they will not aggro when it starts biting your target mob, so /pet attack followed by /pet back off (repeatedly) will single pull. However, if pet dies, you get the whole lot, so buff pet with SoW (or shrew) and any hp buffs (at 65, use Quiesence for super safe pulls)</div></div><hr />
