<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A couple years back, I played a half-elf warrior as my main.  I transfered to Stormhammer about a month after it opened, because the guild I was in on Saryrn dissolved and I was kinda' curious as to what SH had to offer.  <br />
<br />
About a week after my transfer, I was running through East Karana on my way to Freeport for a GM event.  The event wasn't scheduled to start for about half an hour, so I was giving myself time to get there by leaving my smithing in Qeynos a little early.  As I'm running along, I spot an NPC that I'd never seen before... a human, running at almost SoW speed, carrying a large golden-colored staff.  <br />
<br />
I targeted the human NPC, and he con'd indifferent green.  Of course, being the curious warrior that I was, I ran up and intercepted him.  After a few spams of the &quot;hail&quot; key, he finally replied with something along the lines of &quot;grumbles a few words to his staff&quot;, then started running again.  <br />
<br />
So, I did what any curious warrior would do in that situation... I plugged an arrow in his backside.  As the NPC started to attack, I realized that I still had my +str weps equipped and started fumbling through my bags for a better blade.  Pulling out my old Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword, I started to attack.... <br />
<br />
I realized that he was only hitting me for maybe 10-15 damage a pop with his staff.  Pretty weak for an NPC with what I estimated at the time to have about 2K hp.  I beat him up fairly quickly, and as he died, he shouted something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!  They cannot keep us apart Micah!  I must have you, I must be with you forever!&quot;<br />
<br />
So I loot up the body, and low and behold... the staff is named &quot;Micah&quot;.  It's a 5 dmg - 40 dly 2hb... ranger only.  No other stats.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I've never been able to find any information on this mob, or the staff.  I used to have screenshots of it, but they were lost in the great Western Digital 40gb failure of Aught-Three.  Now, my old warrior's account is finally history, and the item is gone forever.  <br />
<br />
Has anyone ever heard of this mob?  or this staff?  I realize it *could* be a Stormhammer specific type thing, but I'm not too sure considering that no GM event was taking place at the time of the kill.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, also... this was right around the release of the Jaggedpine Forest, shortly before they closed Maurader's Mire.</div></div><hr />
