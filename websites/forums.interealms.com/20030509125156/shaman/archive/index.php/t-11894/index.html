<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried some Kodiaks in the Great Divide at level 36.  They are good exp.  The caves are just below the enterance to velks.  There are a few kinds of kodiaks with feral cave kodiaks being the lowest and ferocious cave kodiaks being the strongest.    I would stick with the ferals if posible at my level.  I set up camp near the wall and pull out of the caves.  There are some wanderers so you need to be cautious about those,  Nice thing is you can zone into velks if you get into trouble.  I was getting about a half blue per kill.  The loot here is pretty dismal.  Occasional kodiak claws and hardened kodiak armor.  The named, Icetooth can be tough at low levels so be careful if you see him.  This is another viable option for levels 34-39 or so.   I would recomend checking it out if you are looking for a new spot.  Bring a group and go into the caves for real good exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree, this is excelent, no risk xp. however, this is the most boring xp I have ever gotten. <br />
<br />
with the amount of people not using old world zones I would say that probably there are better loot, more fun, and all around better places in the old world to gain XP solo at this level.<br />
<br />
currently I am in Lguk leveling my warrior and just on zone in at lvl 44 most of the mobs are still dark blue to my shaman you can easily pull singles and once you have the front clear you can pull minos and whatever else from a little farther in that wonder around (for knowledge, the warrior is currently 33 and the lblue stuff to my shaman is dblue to the warrior, most of the dblue stuff to my shaman is white ^). if you get too much and can't handle it you can zone out. loot is good, it is exciting because you are in a dangerous place (with a relative low risk). and the best part is after spending a day or so down here you can go out with a hefty ammount of cash and loot. just park the dog near the zone, and pull with slow, dot and melee. <br />
<br />
possibly that or maybe the mobs that used to be in CT. I think I am going to go there next and see what I can find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just something to add, if you get a melle partner this place will fly.  I am level 36 and was with a 38 warrior and we were able to move into the cave duo.  Was getting about a yellow every 30-40 mins.  Can be dangerous so don';t let sow drop.  Good place to practive pet controll and crowd control.  I would deffinately recomend this if you have a group or partner, otherwise, there are probably better spots (High HP on mobs imo).</div></div><hr />
