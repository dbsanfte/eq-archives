The American Idol diary really cracks me up.<br />
<br />
http://fyd.fuxored.net/idol.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;This is also very fortunate for the contestants because, should there ever be an accident during one of those moronic Ford Focus cut segments and someone becomes trapped, Ejay can rip the door off with his freakishly large super-jaw and help them escape.&quot;<br />
<br />
ROFL.<br />
people are walking by my office wondering why I am cracking up here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You're going to have another crappy TV program heading from over this side of the pond to yours soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Popstars The Rivals&quot; - http://www.popstarsonline.net/<br />
<br />
Basically get a load of wannabies laugh at and make fun of them, then select 10 girls to live together and 10 guys. Then we the public get to vote one person off each side (over 10 weeks :( god damn it!) until we end up with two bands a boy band  and a girl band. Then we buy their records to make one of then the christmas number one!<br />
<br />
It's hell. The programme has being going for ages and there's still 13 of the buggers left. I hate it. The only good part was the clips of people who think they can sing when they can't now that's entertainment.</div></div><hr />
