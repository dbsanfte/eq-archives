I like to solo and was thinking I may start a shaman if this is true.</div></div><hr />

Shamans are very effective soloers.  They have the ability to buff, heal, slow, dot, dd, debuff; all the essentials.  Slap a debuff, a slow, some DoTs on the mob, and then go in and melee it to death.  This method has proved to be very effective.  Shamans have very little downtime compared with other caster classes.  Canni combined with Regen is very effective, and when you hit 44 you get stoictism, which can cut your downtime to almost nothing.<br />
<br />
Also Shamans are very effective and wanted in groups.  Once you get your 75% slow, you should have no problem in finding a planes group.  Hope this helps!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am currently 35 and I have mostly soloed all the way.  I usually try to fight yellows and reds.  I rarely get down below 1/2 life and mana in a fight.  Just buy high AC gear, buff yourself up and go slaughter.  I usually chain pull when I have KEI and AEGO.  I find that it is becoming easier to solo mobs with each new lvl of spells.  We are great at mellee and can solo mobs that other classes only dream of being able to solo.<br />
Shaman are also great in groups.  We are the masters of buffs and slows.  We can dot / blast if our mana is full and cover the clerics behind when they pull too much agro and start getting beat up.<br />
I have played a druid, beastlord and warrior all into atleast the 50s, but I have to say that the Shaman has been the funnest for me by far.  I can't believe that I have been playing this game for nearly 4 years and just recently figured out that Shaman are the best class in the game : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shamans are great soloers, however i wouldnt say they are the best. Necro's can really put the stank on mobs solo..and Enchanters w/ charm hehe. However, if you like to solo, and you like to tank/melee some too, and not much of a sit back guy/gal, shaman is awesome, i still tank (in my 50's) alot, my offense, defense, piercing is maxed, and i can pump out several hundred points of damage with my REIF. We are effective soloers, and good ones, but its situational as to whos the BEST soloer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shamans i have found so far to be great for soloing , the thing that wins me over is the ability to tank,*to a Point* and still have awsome spells,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 1-59 and 61+ I'd say necros easily out solo shaman. They have a wider variety of dots and methods then we do. At 61+ they can stack an amazing amount of damage with splurt(1.6k), pyrocur(2k), funeral pyre(2k+), devouring darkness(1.6k), dark plague(2.5k), saryrn's kiss(1.9k) and blood of thule(2.2k) and of course have their lifetaps. Their 61 and 63 pets are far superior to our 61 pet. The 63 rogue pet puts out some sick damage when aggro kiting. And with enough AAs they can dire charm a nice 500dps undead pet.<br />
<br />
My bread and butter at this point is BoN. 1648pts of damage in 42seconds is nice but I don't have pox so that leaves me with wimpy plague(1k) and ebolt(1k) to stack with it and an unreliable ToP rain. We have to wait till 64 for our next dot which is also very slow acting. So yea we can solo but it takes a long time to kill things at 61. And if you fight certain mobs which have insanely high PR even after a malosini then there goes BoN down the drain.<br />
<br />
That said though, I stll prefer my shaman. It's easy to find groups when you are not soloing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kinvas Dragntayl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow nice info on this thread. I feel I must come clean now. I had a mid 40's Shammy telling me how he was the best soloer in the game and being a Necro and that is all I get to do (usually) is solo it kinda ruffled my scales. I just wanted to see what other shammies take was on this. <br />
<br />
My arguement was that I am still not the best (I thnk chanters hold that) but I am as good or maybe better than a Shammy. I group with a 61 shammy often and we make a very deadly combo. I am a 52 Necro, I take a hit on xp grouping with her but the loot is good =).<br />
<br />
Anyway thank you all I will continue to lurk as I like to study all classes so when I do get a chance to group I know what everyone is up to.<br />
<br />
<br />
Although I would just like to say next time you are out building a group ask a necro to join we are very misunderstood and bring a lot to a group that most people dont understand. We do solo well but in a group we bring with us a free tank 49 pet has 2300hps and can quad for 55, we keep ourselves alive (if the necro plays right) with our liftetaps, if it gets ugly and you are facing a wipe out we can always fear the mob to get some extra time or just leave the pet there fighting as everyone gets to zone or evacs. Heck I can even heal for 300 soon to be 500. We are self supporting extra killing power.<br />
<br />
So if you have an open spot snag a Necro you will be pleasantly surprised if you have never grouped with one before. This has been a payed announcement from the Necro Society.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heheeh, good post Kinvas.<br />
One of the officers in my guild is a necro, and I have a ball grouping with him.  Our 2 pets, his dots, plus my debuffs and heals.  We do very well together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have a great respect for necromancers.  Two of my best friends in game are a married couple, the husband plays a female gnome necromancer and the wife plays a female barbarian warrior.  They make a very effective, if somewhat odd looking, team.  With the ability to snare, fear, DOT, life tap and use a powerful pet, I feel necros are the most powerful solo class.  But for some reason they aren’t overly popular in groups.<br />
<br />
I soloed my shaman up to about 38th level without a lot of difficulty.  Getting SoW at level nine helps a lot.  So I feel shaman can be very effective at soloing, but I feel necromancers are more effective at it.  That having been said, shaman have the advantage of being very desirable in groups as well.  After playing a ranger and druid to 51, I was surprised at how popular I became all the sudden when my shaman started gaining levels.  <br />
<br />
Like any other class in the game, it really comes down to your likes and dislikes.  Both necromancers and shaman can be effective at soloing, but each class has its own feel.  I liked the potential of my necromancer, but I found I enjoyed playing my shaman more.  If your looking for a change of pace that isn’t too drastic, give a shaman a try and see how you like the play style.</div></div><hr />
