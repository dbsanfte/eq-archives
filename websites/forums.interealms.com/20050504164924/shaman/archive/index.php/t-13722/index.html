<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>laeelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know what kind of DPS an well equiped 65 shaman has when trying to deal damage?<br />
<br />
I know that shaman are not a DPS class, but i'm trying to decide what class to 2-box with my necro and i'm wondering what kind of damage ya'll would be able to add..<br />
<br />
needless to say, 75% slow is godly =)<br />
<br />
At a rough guess I was thinking about 70dps ... anyone know for sure?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you want dps go druid . <br />
<br />
as for when two boxxing you will have troubles raising dps over 50 with your shaman as our dps involves a lot of dot stacking or nukes/rains . pet will add a decent dps though , around 35 dps with sltw , focus , two mage summoned items . <br />

I'm thinking ...<br />
<br />
Shaman or Beastlord<br />
<br />
I would like to have the ability to slow..<br />
<br />
But while shaman have much better spells (and better slows) i'm not sure if I would be better off with a beastlord..<br />
<br />
the main reason i'm doing this is not for leveling, but for what I like to call &quot;fun soloing&quot; ... like when I killed a dragon construct in DN at 54 (it was yellow) ..<br />
<br />
I love doing outdated content for fun, and I think a beastlord would be a really really good addition to my necro...<br />
<br />
but so would a shaman... this is the last place I would need to tell about the power of slow.. 65% vs 75% is actually a large difffrence. =)<br />
<br />
As things stand now, i'm leaning towords a beastlord just becasue they (like necros) are one of the most underestimated classes in the game..<br />
<br />
beastlors have great DPS, great pet, ok healing, and second(third?) rate slowing..<br />
<br />
thanks for the information =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BoS is about 54 DPS, BoN 34, BoU is 22, PoB is 18 for 128 dps, + dog (20?). Just plan on having a non summoning rooted mob before you stack this, you can draw aggro of a stunning pally if you are not carefull with that set. <br />
Since you can do BoS and BoN repeatedly while canniing your mana back in the meantime you can do about 80 DPS continously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And don't forget dogdog. Non aplha he parses regularly at 18-22 ish dps. Haven't tried parsing alpha dog yet. <br />
<br />
And don't underestimate the puppy gun. Spirit call at it's base level parses regularly around 35 dps for all 3 dogs. Useable one minute every 12 minutes. 5 dogs would probably average 58 dps or so.<br />
(and be honest here... who hasn't yelled &quot;WHO let the Dogs OUT ....&quot; while doing it too)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you want to kill &quot;big mobs&quot; solo for fun, shammy is way better than beastlord, because the ability to debuff magic resist and land a good slow and heal matters more to that fight than dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't forgot shaman's regen. Hehe shaman slow + regen + doggy with a necro = awesome. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">was the *wince* in your title a pun? :p<br />
<br />
Many of the people on this board say shaman+necro combo is one of the most potent ones out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Maximum is well over 200 DPS and it can be sustained for more then 2 hours.<br />
<br />
But you need a long, long battle to reach that combined with a special set up for your group, lots of clickies and lots of timers to keep track of things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Shaman + Necro make a great duo, but it was a little too hard to 2 box for me.  Both are very busy characters that take a lot of attention to really play well.  My skillz just werent up too it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I havent got Blood of Saryn yet, but my usual dps setup on boss mobs is Dogdog, BoUltor, Pox of Bertox and ancient scourge of nife.  If the resist rate is low I can usually squeeze bane of nife in there also, but throw in a few resists and I start getting summoned/whacked.  This is with a warrior with EB tanking.  Take that as ye will =)<br />
<br />
Of course if the resist rate is especially bad on dots, I'll just chain Velium strike, it puts out quite respectable dps with my ice focus and bar the period when ranged dps taunt was screwy, I'm yet to get summoned for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I typically chain velium strike after slowing (by chain, I mean cast it as often as possible without getting permanent agro).  In your average BoT fight, this works out to 4-5 casts, which if you time from the first time the warrior hits the mob until the mob dies, usually seems to hover around 70 dps.  I have been considering tossing in a blood of saryn to start, but it occurs to me that doing so would likely result in my tanking instead of the warrior. <br />
<br />
Note:  I use a warrior in my example becaue my regular group has a warrior as the MT all the time.  With a paladin, you of course have more room to play around before you get agro.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I should mention that I use a ceramic rod of storms and that I am referring to sustainable DPS over the course of time.  You can do more damage, but it would probably not be sustainable.</div></div><hr />
