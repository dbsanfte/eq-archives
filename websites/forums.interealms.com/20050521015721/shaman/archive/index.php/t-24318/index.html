<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bcarshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know where the nameds spawn on the 66/67 level instanced zone.<br />
<br />
Has anyone found both nameds on the Firepot 68+ zone?<br />
<br />
We found one in a dead end area near the end of the dungeon.  Kyv Heartpiercer was the PH in a room with 3 Ukans.  Kyv Bowkeeper was the named.<br />
<br />
Who is the other named for that zone and where does he spawn?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

Before the hallway to the last room there are two dragorn commoners. One is next to a pile of rocks and the other is off closer the the corner. The one in the corner is the PH for the named.

Head in. And keep going straight. You will get toa + intersection where you can go both ways. Keep straight. There will then be a Y intersection. Bear right... Named is in Endcap room. Beware He eats Kei with a curse spell. It is a pain in the ass. With a stun Spin proc. Dops some ac 40 70 Hp legs Chain classes. And something else.<br />
<br />
Other named is a Girplan mover. He is Down near the other one where the quickblade spawns in the 67 instance. But a little farther in. Right after a Little square room with a couple critters in it. Hard pull there to avoid three. <br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bcarshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SnowwSilverhammer, is that for the fire pit zone?  The map sounds like the Watering Hole (Dranik A) version.<br />
<br />
You listed two nameds, but neither was the Kyv Bowkeeper that I got in the firepot (Dranik B) zone.  Do you know where the other named is in Firepot?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
