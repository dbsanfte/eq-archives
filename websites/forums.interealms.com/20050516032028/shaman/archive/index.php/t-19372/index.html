whacked to a group heal, right before my eyes.<br />
<br />
RIP Grizlor!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems like alot of mana for a hybrid spell though.  I have never really followed hybrids, and don't know what's the norm for them, but you would think since they are rarely sitting to med they don't have that much regen to their mana pool to really be able to use a 900+ mana group heal.<br />
<br />
oh well.  wonder if the pallys like this spell, or are ticked that they lost their other heal.</div></div><hr />

I would love this heal.<br />

Edit: Spellin'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it used to be touch of the trushar or something, a 1250 pt, single target heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention, I find hybrid FT items to be a whole lot easier to get then FT for my shaman.</div></div><hr />

only 3500-4k? We have 5 pallys on our guild roster, 2 of them in VT/elemental(inactive) and the other 3 in elemental. the 2 inactive are at 3k mana, and the other 3 are 4500 and 5k(x2)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The #1 paladin (6586) on my server has more mana than I do (6318), and only slightly less than the #1 shaman (6689).  I can also say without hesitation than the paladin is the most powerful character that I have ever grouped with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They have to be still working on that spell.  Wave of Marr, the level 65 Pally group heal, is almost the same.<br />
<br />

<br />
The only reason I can maybe see for 2 of them is that they have a 30 second delay between use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That is the biggest problem with all those superfast hybrid spells that are balanced by long recasts. You give them a slight upgrade and you end up doubling the power of the class in that area.<br />
<br />
Sure it uses up more spell gems but if you know ahead you will need those 3 group heals, or need to be able to chain nuke or whatever you can do it.<br />
<br />
Sadly though I can not think of another way to implement something that lets a class only nuke or heal every x seconds other then stopping their casting altogether  :(</div></div><hr />
