Ridiculous, in my opinion, especially that they drop off Vindi.  I can just see friggin pick-up ST groups in the future.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that's over exaggerating, but I just don't see the point of it.<br />
<br />
Shrug.  I don't need anything else from there anyway, heh (not that I ever really NEEDED anything anyway.)  <br />
<br />
However, it sucks for the lower tiered guilds who were just starting to be capable of killing Brood Dragons, to have to compete with guilds were just capable of killing Vindi, for instance.<br />
<br />
Edit, the more I think about it:<br />
<br />
Man! Vindi, of all mobs.  An 8 hour pansy-ass mob.  Talk about increasing mudflation.  MOTG isn't exactly hard to kill, either.  <br />
<br />
Of course, all remaining ST mobs are going to be killed much quicker upon spawn in a few months.  Hell, imagine a guild full of Vindi-capable people just farming priceless, not to mention the primal they'll get along the way.  That's quick mudflation.<br />
<br />
It's things like this that lead to clogging the high end game even more.</div></div><hr />

Gee, maybe because it's totally wrong risk/reward wise that killing Vindi nets you an ST key?<br />

Keep them on the Brood Dragons where they belong.<br />

<br />
If you dont want competition just say so but insisting that the game should stay permanently like it was over a year ago is silly. Risk vs reward changes all the time and especially after a new expansion has been released. Learn to live with it :)</div></div><hr />

I don't care about competition in ST.  We have enough primal.  I haven't even been inside of ST in months, (yay yay VT key!) but that doesn't mean it doesn't affect me.<br />
<br />
Sleeper Keys dropping off a mob like Vindi is asinine.  Period.  Increasing mudflation in such a way is bad for everyone.<br />

I can see the reasoning for the change.  It's to give CoV faction guilds more chances to get their key without wrecking their faction.</div></div><hr />

You sound like a rich kid who's just been informed that his prep school's tuition has just been cut in half so that they can allow more people to attend that school. :P<br />
<br />
Get a grip.   While I agree that it doesn't make much sense in a storyline perspective for giants to have access to parts of the key to ST, from a gaming stance, Gloriana is entirely correct.<br />
<br />
So suck it up rich boy, the ghetto players are movin in. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Umgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It makes no sense to me, unless they are planning on implementing a quest to reimprison the sleeper and repop the warders. (Then it makes alot of sense)<br />
I don't think they did it solely to allow CoV ally guilds to get in.  Having to change faction to get something you want is part of EQ.  They don't do it for regular quest items, so why ST keys?<br />
<br />
Just makes no sense to me, to allow alot more access to keys, unless you are going to put more stuff in there (IE warders).<br />
It will just create more headaches and problems between guilds when racing for prog and motg.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it will be very nice for everyone to get to experience the zone.  I was really excited when I first got to go in, even with the sleeper already awake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bashir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Right on Azmodai! Not everyone can sit at home in their underwear playing EQ 18 hours a day because they have no real lives to speak of. This will give other folks the opportunity to go to a zone like ST that were previously unattainable without hours and hours of camping. Everyone pays the same monthly fee that you do Morbad. You are not better than someone who can't sit bug-eyed at their computer for hours on end, letting their muscles atrophy to obtain that uber item. As was said before, get a grip. And while you're at it, get a life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I come from a guild that is probably capapble of doing vindi, but we haven't quite nailed him yet.  We are very interested in some day visiting sleepers tomb, but we would like to do it the old fashioned way.  I have been apart of other guilds vindi kills and zland kills and I can't say zland isn't THAT much harder than vindi, just requires a different strategy.  <br />
<br />
Of course, the 8 hour spawn time issue makes it alot more trivial to get ST keys.  If verant leaves the keys on vindi, and doesnt change his spawn time, then I will be pretty dissapointed.  <br />
<br />
However, coming from a guild that is just on the edge of being vindi capable, the 8 hour spawn time has been a blessing for us.  It's a pain in the ass to find a mob up that is worth killing, and in a guild like mine, we don't have alot of experience with Complete Heal rotations, main tank switching (our damage output is low) etc.  Having a mob like this, is very nice practice for us, and it would suck if we had to race for the one chance to kill him every 3 to 7 days, not to mention that having him drop ST keys would make him even a bigger target for other guilds. <br />
<br />
I really hope this change is a mistake.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">CoV guilds shouldn't have a hard time keeping their faction. One Vindi kill (and his cohorts) equals the score back to max ally pretty quick. Given that Vindi is an 8 hour spawn it is never hard to get to him to restore Klandi trashed faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">&quot;You sound like a rich kid who's just been informed that his prep school's tuition has just been cut in half so that they can allow more people to attend that school.&quot;<br />

Ah-ha! That usually degrades the quality of education over time at a given facility.  That's why I'm totally against school vouchers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Like Fatsow said, do you really think Vindicator is any easier than Klandicar or Zlandicar? The only problem is Vindi's respawn. However, it's already been confirmed that Vindi does not drop the shard everytime. It all balances out in the end if his drop rate is only like 25%.<br />
<br />
No big deal in my opinion. Most servers failed the intelligence check and woke the sleeper already anyway, so all this hubbub over 3 golem spawns? Simmah down.</div></div><hr />

Who wants to outfilt their guild on a Rare drop. lol. That take forever. However i give this a thumbs up, this coming from prolly the 1st/2nd Active Primal count on E'Ci.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">As others have stated, I believe the issue is that Vindi is an 8 hour spawn and a fairly easy mob, thus trivializing and expediting a key that is something to be very proud of.  It will just water down the sense of accomplishment of some players that already have keys.<br />
<br />
That's how I think people are feeling about this.  I don't feel that it has anything to do with the fact that more people will have an opportunity to explore this zone.  It's not rich kid poor kid, that's kind of silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The question I have is, why would anyone want to wake the sleeper? The only reason I can think of is to block dothers guilds/players from getting higher end loot. If that is the case it seems pretty selfish to take away a major stepping stone in the game to make yourself feel superior.<br />
<br />
Of course, there may be another reason to wake the sleeper and if so, I would like to know about it.<br />
<br />
Either way I do not think they should make one part of the key so much easier to get than the others. That just doesn't make sense</div></div><hr />

<br />
You answered your own question.<br />
<br />
According to Dictionary.com, one of the definitions of &quot;game&quot; is:<br />
<br />
A competitive activity or sport in which players contend with each other according to a set of rules.<br />
<br />
Keyword, competitive.<br />
<br />
Is Everquest a game?<br />
<br />
Do you try to beat other people in Monopoly?<br />
Do you try to beat other people in Blackjack?<br />
Baseball?<br />
Football?<br />
Old Maid?<br />
Hungry Hungry Hippos?<br />
<br />
Anyone who plays the end game of Everquest knows it's competitive, unless you're so far ahead of other guilds on a given server it doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Of course, you don't want competing guilds competing with you.  It means headaches, fights over spawns, and general displeasure in this game.  You would gladly have them disappear, if at all possible.<br />
<br />
Another definition of game is:<br />
<br />
An activity providing entertainment or amusement.<br />
<br />
Fighting over spawns doesn't amuse or entertain me.<br />
<br />
Waking the Sleeper was, on my server, a way to throw one guild in particular off for a while.  That's just one example of buying Boardwalk, so to speak.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but EQ isn't happy happy be nice to everyone time.  Does a baseball player let a guy on the other team score &quot;Just to be selfless?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bashir - Neat.  You're the first person I get to use the ignore button on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Originally posted by morbad <br />

<br />
<br />
So according to you you don't want EQ to be a game anymore as defined by your first entry - competitive.  Sounds like you've been hanging around Bill Gates a bit long, rich boy.<br />
<br />
I don't really care about ST, but personally, for some odd reason, after reading your whiny post, I really want to go there just to cheese guys like you off, who think that ST is your private playground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Baledin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Morbad, it's attitudes like yours that keep genuinely nice people from playing this game more.<br />
<br />
Way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">You're confusing competitive with some guilds as to not being nice.<br />
<br />
I'm a pretty damn nice person in game.  I help people.  My guild helps people.  If someone needs a piece of equipment that's rotting, and we don't need it, and they can get to it relatively easily, we give it to them.  I'm all for that. I buff newbies.  I help old ladies cross East Commonlands. Etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When new zones open up, it's nice to have them to yourself for a couple of months.  If that means stalling a vying guild in some way, that's part of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />

Unless this is a call for more cheese with that whine? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The sole reason to wake the sleeper is because your guild was farming the warders first, and some other guild threatened to get in there as well, and you want to hinder their growth. Primal weapons make a monumental difference in a guild's DPS...stopping a rival from getting that bonus (well, cutting it off substantially, since the 3 golems still drop it, but nowhere near as frequently as the warders) is powerful incentive.<br />
<br />
Equally, the reason invariably given by the guild who woke the sleeper for doing it is &quot;we wanted to progress the storyline&quot; and &quot;the script is just so cool&quot;...studiously ignoring the fact that their members a) couldn't identify roleplaying if it fell out of the sky, landed on their face, and started to wiggle...and b) The script is (a year and a half later) still horrendously bugged, and usually doesn't work.<br />
<br />
It is all about the greed. Oh, and stupidity. The local uberguild on Luclin never killed Ventanti until they woke the sleeper...and the monk robe didn't drop. So our server has NONE of those incredibly nice robes. They screwed themselves over, just because a rival guild had gotten enough keys to threaten their dominance of the warders. It was retarded.</div></div><hr />

Riiiiiight.......<br />
<br />
As for putting sleepers keys on vindi, it doesn't make a lot of sense.  There's nothing to be gotten from the zone except priceless, and the weekly 5 guild rush for 3 mobs that might drop primal.

<br />
Are you confusing the ST key quest with the VT key quest?  The ST key quest does not require hours and hours of camping, simply killing one of the 5 dragons (Zlandicar, Sontalek, Klandicar, Yelinak, Lendaria) that always drop the talisman (well, that's the way it used to work).  Loot the talisman, make a stop in DN and trade it for a key.  Voila.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This might be ok, if it drops off vindi then thats insane, even with a 25% drop rate.  Thats 1 key per day average off a mob 2 groups can kill (Yes, I have did it with 2 groups, just need a tank with a ton of hps and 2 or 3 good clerics + DC enchs \ good rogues \ monks).  I could see it dropping off AoW \ Tormax \ Statue though, those are tough and little more reasonable...cept AoW may be a bit too hard for ST keys hehe, considering most guilds that do him have a ton anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind if you can kill Vindicator, you can kill Statue. So having a key on Statue but not Vind won't keep the lower guilds out of ST, it will just slow them down a little. The only problem with Vind having a key is respawn, not difficulty.</div></div><hr />
