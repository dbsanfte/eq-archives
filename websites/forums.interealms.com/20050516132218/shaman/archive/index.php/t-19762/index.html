<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys.  Do we have the capability of having a moderated live chat discussion on this board?  I'm completely talking out of my rear on this, but if we could convince a dev to have a live chat with the shaman community, or at least a couple of representatives of the shaman community from the crucible, I think it might help assuage a lot of annoyed shaman!<br />
<br />
Personally, my biggest beef isn't necessarily that we get hosed every expansion (though I'm not pleased about it), but that we seem totally relegated to obscurity.  A relatively massive outpouring of shaman expression, and all we got was, &quot;we passed this message on to the devs.&quot;  While that's more than I think I've ever seen in response to any kind of feedback, it's still not exactly satisfying.<br />
<br />
So, any thoughts as to whether we could host a live chat?  Or perhaps there is a better medium in which to hold it.  My pipe dream was either (a) a dev and 4-5 members of the shaman community, each of whom was elected to speak about different areas such as healing, DoTs, buffs, AAs, etc. or (b) a dev and maybe 2-3 shaman, including at least 1 who is of the opinion that shaman are largely okay (like Jinheim).<br />
<br />
I'd kind of like to nail down a potential medium for such an event before I really investigate the feasibility of it.  I don't mind taking point and trying to get ahold of Brenlo &amp; Co to try to set something up if they're willing.  We could post the logs of it here in the Cucible for those who weren't reading live.<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
P.S. Ya, I know this is a long shot, but in the past the devs have been willing to participate in similar discussions.  I just don't want to have any kind of scenario where they'd be in a position to get mass spammed or be put on the defensive at every turn.  Discussion &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; flames.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry, Chutoi, I don't know. You might try to PM Sunmoon to ask :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not a mod but I think thtas a decent idea Chutoi. Would be nice to know they actually listen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good idea, and I would be happy to participate.<br />
<br />
You mentioned me as one of the people who believe shamans are &quot;largely okay&quot;.  I don't think our class is as underpowered as many do, but I do think we need some improvements, especially in light of the upgrades that other classes have gotten in GoD.  You don't have to worry about me working against us for upgrades - I am just more moderate (and imho, reasonable) than a lot of people are.</div></div><hr />

Translation: When other Shamans ask for upgrades I like to act as if everything was fine and pretend to be leet, because I am really powerful in LDoN normal missions. If I can get something that makes me more powerful, while stating over and over that a &quot;leet&quot; Shaman like me doesn't need them at the same time, all the better  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

You have no idea what you are talking about and are 100% wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I do not feel my class is underpowered so much as starting to become such...<br />
<br />
I feel it worth fighting for to see we dont become obsolete.<br />
<br />
Jinheim I have to admit some of your posts have left me wondering if you were for or against Shaman getting some tweaks.<br />
<br />
Good to know you can see the forest through the trees though :)<br />
<br />
I will fight and fight adamantly but I dont want to see huge sweeping upgrades that would make us a bit too powerful.<br />
The proposal was fairly good imho. Not too much. Not too little.<br />
We did not ask for all those things just pointed out where we were lacking and left it up to them.<br />
<br />
A chat would be a great idea but frankly if SoE was going to participate it would be on their terms with them moderating on their chat.<br />
<br />
I do not see it happening but it would be a great thing IMHO.<br />
Especially since pretty much anything relating to Shaman in GoD was blatently ignored during the last Dev chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That sounds like a good idea. If it somehow works out, how do we pick the talkers and the topics? Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Always flaming someone. It gets real bloody old after awhile. I have read many of Jinheim's posts. I have not seen him be anything short of well-spoken, nor have I seen him make rash statements -- at least not without backing them up with knowledge/data. Simply because he is, as he put it, one of the more &quot;moderate&quot; people who posts and doesn't go completely crazy over the idea of &quot;fixing&quot; shaman doesn't mean he's &quot;against&quot; anything SOE might do to help us out. And yes, I do realize Jinheim is a big boy and can defend himself, but what has been said in this thread regarding him is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
On to more important things.<br />
<br />
Chutoi -- great idea. I'd be more than happy to participate in something like this if it were possible for Sunmoon to set it up. Perhaps we could have a way of PM-ing questions to Sunmoon, who could then &quot;ask&quot; them officially for us? Someone here said SOE would not participate unless it was &quot;their&quot; chat on &quot;their&quot; terms ... that may be possible, yes. And I can see SOE saying &quot;well, if we chat privately with the shaman, we'll have to do it for all classes...&quot; While that's not necessarily a bad thing, to my mind, it's awful time-consuming for an SOE dev and probably something they'd shy away from. I do like the idea and will contribute anything needed to help make it reality.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You have no idea what you are talking about and are 100% wrong.<br />
<br />
He's not, and i will add the main complain is not being &quot;underpowered&quot;, but being less desirable in many ways than a druid or a beastlord, wether it be in raids or group.<br />
<br />
You're just one more person who missed a point: we complain about being falling behind in terms of utility, while other classes got either dps upgrade and group spells, things we totally lack and destroy our stackability and aura in a group.<br />
<br />
The occasional moment a shaman feels very good, when he saves his group because of a cleric who died or satisfy himself with healing in normal missions, are exceptions, not the norm.<br />
<br />
You have a spot in the top guild of solusekro Jinheim, you don't have to worry about being left aside of GoD.<br />
Me neither, even if i feel it is pretty ridiculous that when we have our 8 shaman online, our main purpose is to always have a MBG up in case something bad happen, and nothing else, while eating up a group spot that won't help the group, because we cannot heal, nor do decent damage.<br />
<br />
It is just sad that you believe the &quot;we are fine&quot; posts which are made everyday about a shaman who handled an EXCEPTIONNAL (understand: something that DOESN'T happen everyday) situation, are a reaction to a statement which was never made: that we are underpowered.<br />
<br />
We just have not much use save MBGing focus in raid, and groups can do fine with an enchanter/bst who adds more to the group than us, at least outside of GoD from what i could see of it so far.<br />
<br />
It seems you agree with my last statement, but you don't show it at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have had this argument a hundred times in the last two months.  If you do not agree with me yet, then you never will, so I am not going to bother going through your post and replying to every individual point.<br />
<br />
All I am going to say is that I do not feel we were grossly underpowered before Gates.  I am not saying that we did not need improvements: we certainly did.  However, instead of getting the moderate healing, damage, and buff upgrades that we needed, we got zilch.  Every other class, though, got improvements to their primary areas.  This sets us behind the pack and I feel it needs to be fixed.  Are you clear on my stance now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope everyone appreciates Jinheim's position.  He has been a voice of moderation throughout the discussion regarding shaman balancing.  Being a Plane of Time equipped shaman, he's seen virtually all aspects of what a shaman can become in LDoN.  And for the most part, pre-GoD he's been satisfied.<br />
<br />
There was a precedent set in the design of upgrades for shamans that began after the Kunark expansion.  The precedent was that because of a shamans ability to slow, buff, and regenerate mana, they were more powerful than any other class, and therefore, needed the fewest and smallest upgrades.  This thinking has dominated every expansion (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19149&amp;highlight=analysis) , and was clearly applied to the problem of priest balancing.<br />
<br />
This precedent has reduced the overall relative power of shamans.  Jinheim has argued persuasively that as of the last expansion, rough parity has been achieved.  I won't dispute this conclusion, although I don't agree entirely with it.  But if parity was achieved in LDoN, GoD now represents a clear disparity between shamans and other classes in virtually every aspect of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As good an idea as this is, it'll never happen.<br />
<br />
SOE and its employees are not members of the EQ community.  They don't post to message boards or spend hours analyzing game mechanics because they're devoted to the game.  If they do so, they do it because they're devoted to getting their paycheck.<br />
<br />
Most of the creators of EQ have moved on to other projects.  I can't look at class balance, zone design/mob placement in PoP (the whole &quot;dreadlands&quot; feel that you get in nearly every zone), or nearly everything I've seen or read about GoD without thinking how these are not the people who created EQ.  Expansions are half-assedly slapped together, with most &quot;innovations&quot; (flag system) being more a pain in the ass than awe inspiring (Ring wars and ToV, anyone?).  The people making the game now don't see it as something they've made, they see it as something they can squeeze more money out of, through expansions, before they move onto their own project.<br />
<br />
Live chats happen when they want them to, when they think it'll help the PR of a new expansion.  Live chats do not happen when a class is crapped on and asks to be talked to.  Look at monk mitigation.<br />
<br />
So bitter I am.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I support his concept.<br />
<br />
Nominations from me would be:<br />
<br />
Chutoi  <br />
Jinheim<br />
Gloriana<br />
<br />
<br />
Valsuvious has made good, knowledgeable and level-headed posts here, and is now sharing info from his Beta experience.  He would be a good candidate, as well.  <br />
<br />
but the group must be small, and I would hope that, if a 4th rep was allowed, that could be someone to represent the &quot;up and coming&quot; shaman - those not yet to 65, or at least short of the Elemental Planes.  Not really sure who that might be - is Snapdragn still qualified on those terms?</div></div><hr />

You might want to actually read the post before you disagree with it. Giac just wasted a post essentially calling Jin an elitist bastard, Jin responded that Giac's interpretation of his motives was offbase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would have to watch from the sidelines....I would be too willing to let them know how I feel. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hail,<br />
<br />
I'm not in the EP and I think a moderated discussion would have merit.  A free-for-all debate however would be a nightmare that would make what happened in The Newbie Zone to Glori's One Voice post look like a Tupperwear party.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;Learn some manners, idiot&quot;<br />
<br />
Add your name when you leave a message like that, moron(I don't care about the negative rep, just the message). You know who you are.<br />
<br />
For clarification: I didn't call Jinheim an elitist. I have no problem with elitists. I called him a wanna be elitist who pretends to be able to make up for what the class is lacking with EP&amp;Time gear(when many of us stating that there is a sigificant power problem have been wearing mostly Time gear for 5+months btw) and for saying &quot;I have no problems doing this and that, if you honestly think we are underpowered you must be doing something wrong. We are fine, but I do think we need some improvements&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have no interest in turning this into some flame thread. Jinheim has made a number of informative posts and I have never had a problem with his contributions to the Crucible regarding this. I do not agree with his position in this balance discussion and when I read the post in this thread I had to voice it. <br />
<br />
I am straight up, not using ****ing rep dumps or anything to say what I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Whoever left that rep hit with those words, I'll be looking into it. That crap doesn't belong here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">gwain is right.especially the middle paragraph of his post here,i agree 110%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Great idea, but it won't happen.<br />
<br />
Not a shot at anyone here, but SoE has stated it will not have anything to do with boards supported by those who violate the ULA.  That banner put holes in the idea before it was ever posted.  Of course, it's unlikely SoE would commit to a moderated chat anyway, so really, nothing lost here.</div></div><hr />
