<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Going to try using one single thread and update is as necessary instead of creating a new thread with every patch requiring UI work.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any problems with or questions about my UI post here and I will see if I can help fix the problem.<br />
==============================================================================================<br />
<br />
Screenshots of my UI:<br />
<br />
Bank: http://home.comcast.net/~aruman/bank.jpg<br />
Plain: http://home.comcast.net/~aruman/plain.jpg<br />
<br />
The full set of files are available here: UI Files (https://home.comcast.net/~aruman/arumanui7.zip)<br />
<br />
Pet Window update: Pet Window update (https://home.comcast.net/~aruman/petwindow.zip)<br />
<br />
Changes:<br />
<br />
4-12-05<br />
Modified the Pet Window to show 10 pet buffs instead of 5.<br />
<br />
02-24-05<br />
Updated UI for DoN. Didn't use a patch since there were a number of files I changed.<br />
<br />
Added Target, Casting Bar, and HoTT to Group/Stat window.<br />
<br />
If someone doesn't like this I can probably take the time to return to the old Target/Casting bar and add in the HoTT to it.<br />
<br />
Let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am going to try this out now, I only have the old UI. Thanks for taking the trouble and sharing this with us :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Let me know how you like it.<br />
<br />
I am also open to any suggestions anyone has, but be aware I am not one of the people that likes all the fancy graphics.<br />
<br />
Simplicity and functionality are more important to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I could not agree more, simplicity and functionality is the way to go.<br />
It is working really really well for me, I love how everything is right now, I am much more effective too.<br />
<br />
The only thin I would like to change is the Personal window, you probably have other clickable slots then me (below group and stat information) Which file do I edit to change the slots?<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that: it is really great. Thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The latest patch introduced some changes to the UI, now for instance the Xs to close windows are not displayed, could you let me know if you find a fix? I really liked this UI.</div></div><hr />

Do you mean you want to change the static clickable items under the hotkeys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, That would be nice, it doesnt bother me at the moment as I cant afford any clickable items yet, but when I get some I might want to change which slot that is displayed.<br />
<br />
If you can give me a pointer to which file to edit, and maybe where in the file I find that information.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for updating the files so quickly!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Open the EQUI_HotButtonWnd.xml file and start at this line:<br />
<br />
&lt;!--First Slot, Third Row for Neck Inventory 			3,1		--&gt;<br />
<br />
What you want to change is the number in the EQType as shown here:<br />
<br />
&lt;EQType&gt;5&lt;/EQType&gt;<br />
<br />
To change this from neck to left wrist you would change the 5 to a 9, as shown from the list below:<br />
<br />
1 = Left Ear<br />
2 = Head<br />
3 = Face<br />
4 = Right Ear<br />
5 = Neck<br />
6 = Shoulders<br />
7 = Arms<br />
8 = Back<br />
9 = Left Wrist<br />
10 = Right Wrist<br />
11 = Range<br />
12 = Hands<br />
13 = Primary<br />
14 = Secondary<br />
15 = Left Fingers<br />
16 = Right Fingers<br />
17 = Chest<br />
18 = Legs<br />
19 = Feet<br />
20 = Waist<br />
21 = Ammo<br />
<br />
The background image for the slot is in the line above the EQType. You can look at the default UI Inventory window if you like to get the default background images for the appropriate slot.</div></div><hr />

No changes needed if you are a Shaman/non-melee and using this UI.<br />
<br />
If any melee happen to be using it let me know and I will post a small fix.</div></div><hr />

Updated for Gates of Discord.<br />
<br />
A few minor things to do (reformat window selector mainly).<br />
<br />
Sorry about not updating the UI for the Combat Disciplines... I never saw the bump's from peopel asking for the changes.<br />
<br />
Shaman don't get them so I didn't think to update them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I love our UI been using it for a long long time, well slightly modded verison of it.

I know it can't be shown as a % yet.  but is it possible to just add the bar?<br />
<br />
I've been tring to figure out how to add that in to one of your older verisons of the group window, the one without the stats/LFG symbol on it.  Mainly looking to add just leadership and not raid leader exp since i hardly f ever will be raid leader.</div></div><hr />

I'll look into that. I want that there too I think.<br />
<br />
*Edit: Just took a look at the Leadership window. I am sure I could add the group or leadership bar fairly easily.<br />
<br />
Will give it a go and see what happens.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Updated the zip.<br />
<br />
It's nothing fancy, just adjusted some things in the container window for augment interaction, and added a number showing your current mana as a number int he middle of the mana bar.</div></div><hr />

I don't anticipate that the UI xml will change before release so these files should work. The UI will only work with OoW so don't use it with live EQ until OoW goes live.<br />

I could  make you a custom pet window, just PM me how many buffs you want visible and I will see what I can do for you.</div></div><hr />

Thanks mate but you already do enough for us with your UI I think.  I just wanted to check if I was missing something and there was an easy way to make it larger.  I can make do but thanks very much for your help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">It's not that difficult to change. Mostly a matter of resizing the window, and maybe a few tweaks for the other buttons aas far as position.<br />

Did encounter one problem however....when i went to loot a mob, the loot window opened as normal however there was no DONE button to click and I had to wait for the corpse decay timer to run out before I was able to exit back out of the loot window.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Alania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Unfortunately I've been coming home from work to late to look it, but honestly I don't know what to think of this...  I know this UI isn't intended to be for a cleric but cleric is my main.  With my target in my group box it could be beneficial in making me pay closer attention to other group members but the MT  and at the same time closes my vision off to so much more of the screen, I have my group box in my lower right hand corner, probably will end up only being a matter of adjustment.  Thanks for trying to please us all Aruman, thumbs up to you!!<br />
<br />
Personally I like it~<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I just look at it being space saving, not really for a specific class, but I do tailor it to my needs and post it here.<br />
<br />
Just looking for any feedback on what people think of it.<br />
<br />
I am going to separate the two sides a little more so it isn't so 'crowded', which someone pointed out to me.<br />
<br />
Working on that Bandolier and the Potion windows. Should have update in a few days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Alania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">I've gotten so used to your target/cast bar over my main chat having it on the opposite side of my screen just seems a bit deadly hehe  here is the way I use your UI, 98% of it is yours with a minor twinking of my buff box and compass perhaps this will show you what I'm talking about without me seeming like I am babbeling mindlessly like I as so often found to be doing :D it will also show you what I had invisioned when requesting the add of HoTT, just trying to be helpful not a total pain in your ass!  I'll adjust to however you decide to do it, I am very set on using your UI, I don't like clutter and your UI keeps my screen clean and organized.  Thank you for all your hard work!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">So another version with the HoTT combined into the Target Window would suit you better from the looks of it.<br />
<br />
I could do a version that way also, which will eliminate one extra window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>GheffGutterbrains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">I'm slow on posting... but I wanted to give you thumbs up on the UI.. pulled it down to replace celtic framework (still use the transparent droggy icons though).. Very nicely done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">been looking for a replacement UI for this one since DoN, and I can't find one I like, I have gotten so used to the way the spell box, hotkeys, target/casting box, and so much from this UI that I really don't want to use any others.<br />
<br />
Thanks Aruman for putting out such a great UI and for keeping it updated, can't wait for the next update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>sinlaormiceblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">I have been running your UI for about a month, and WOW it was sooo much better, it was like a whole new game, course i was a warrior for 5 yrs and took a bit to get into caster mode. switchin to default for teh DoN stuff was like goin back to a atari 2600! i just dont use them atm cause im so used to yours. thanks for your hard work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I will be posting a new version today... was just doing some minor tweaks.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
New version is posted. Sorry for the delay.<br />
<br />
Let me know if there are any issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">*bump* New version up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Alania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">thanks Aruman!!!  You do rock man!<br />
<br />
If you end up doing another version witht he combined HoTT/target bar let me know :)  Thanks for all your ahrd work, I do appreciate it!<br />
<br />
I tried the new group window, I ended up either killing or ignoring people or both lol  I am going to use the old group window, the old target window and the default HoTT box as I was before, at least then people don't die and me look like a bad cleric hehe<br />
<br />
I use cleric and chanter 2 box team, both I use your UI on, I might try to adjust to the new group box on chanter then on cleric once I do, if I can, but for now it's best I stick with the old one and not kill anyone /snicker<br />
<br />
Thanks for everything, I'm very pleased with the work you put into keeping your UI up to date!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Sorry if asking this is redundant, but what is the slow timer that is in the screenshots? Is it an actual timer that shows you when slow will wear off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">When the slow lands, you set where you like when you want to refresh the slow, or click where the arrow pointer is at to show you when the slow will wear off.<br />
<br />
In effect, yes, it will give you an idea where the slow will wear off visually.<br />
<br />
If you want to go design your own for your UI for whatever you want to time go here: http://www.timermod.com/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Cool, thanks. <br />
<br />
By the way, is your compass file standalone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I edited the graphics file, so not really, if I understand you right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Ah, kk. Was just wondering if I would be able to use it just by using your compass file, but it sounds like no. hehe<br />
I like your color scheme for it since my monitor is burning out (I think) and everything seems dark (my brother's computers are brighter, and mine's brightness is set at 100%.<br />
<br />
I tried using the timers (using the mp3 window) but all I ended up with were the first 5 short buffs being called &quot;DO NOT USE.&quot; They stay that way till a bard song or my epic is used, then they are blank till I zone and the message returns. I should probably redo my UI but I'm lazy~ =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Alania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Aruman my friend, I'm going nuts here lol can you please tell me how to get the MP3 player to work with your UI? Pretty please?<br />
Thanks a million!<br />
Alania</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">Same way as everyone else: Alt-K<br />
<br />
I don't use that at all, but it is still available, and it's the default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">The DO NOT USE seems to be something wrong with my UI, not the timers. <br />
<br />
I've not been able to get alt K to bring up my MP3 player for a long time. I think it might be off the screen area or something. Probably the same problem Alania is having.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">That seems more liekely... I used Alt-K to test just now and the MP3 player window came up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Niroht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Awesome UI Aruman. Just got one thing to ask: Is there anyway to change the clicky slots taht are in the ui? I want to change the ring slot to legs slot for the Elemental pants so I dont have to open up my inventory. Right now I think you have tunic, earring, ring, waist, primary, and secondary I believe. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help and keep up the excellant UI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Yes, I posted somewhere in this thread how to go about doing that.<br />
<br />
It just requires you to change the type for the click slots, and the graphic for the background of the slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Niroht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">My bad man skipped over it some how while skimming through the pages at work while managers walking in and out. Damn people actually expect me to get up and do something when no customers around. The nerve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Working on a new pet window that shows more buffs. Look for it some time this week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Added a link to a Pet Window update that shows 10 buffs instead of 5.<br />
<br />
It is available in the first post in this thread by clicking the Pet Window Update link.<br />
<br />
Let me know if anything else in it needs modification.</div></div><hr />
