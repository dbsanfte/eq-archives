<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone done the totemic leggings quest recently?<br />
<br />
I tried to hand Vrynn some banded leggings (medium, not small or large) and he promptly handed them back to me.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done this quest recently, or does anyone know of any problems with it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aammon Aammonite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did the Cann2 quest last night and here is what happened to me.  I handed all 4 items to the quest giver and got three of them back and the spell.  I think is your case that someone had handed Vrynn a pair of banded leggings recently and had not finished the quest.  So if you give vrynn the rest of the items needed for quest you will get your totemic legs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I took a chance and handed all 4 items in at once.<br />
<br />
He returned the banded leggings, accepted the bone barbs and gave me the totemic legs, the, accepted the snowball and dufrenite.<br />
<br />
Note that he gave me the totemic legs *before* accepting the snowball and dufrenite.<br />
<br />
Since I originally did the quest wrong about a week ago (handing in barbed bone chops instead of bone barbs or whatever they're called), it makes me wonder if he'd remembered what parts of the quest I'd already completed.<br />
<br />
Are NPCs now remembering how much of a quest you've done, so that you can go back days later and finish it off?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As far as I know they always have remembered.<br />
<br />
The snag being that they don't remember *who* gave them the items. I suspect that these days, hardly anyone is doing totemic quests, so no one came along in the meantime to complete 'your' quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That makes sense. I'm only doing them myself because it's an easy way to re-equip and I like the plate look. ;)</div></div><hr />
