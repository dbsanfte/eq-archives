I don't really understand how exactly it calculates DPS, since I sometimes get some very wierd numbers (like if I only nuke once in an entire fight, my dps will be 925 -- it would seem to me that regardless of how many times I nuke, it should be my total damage done divided by the number of seconds in the fight, based on when the fight actually started).  In any case, that is a special situation and in all other situations it seems to be right on the money.  Aside from the DPS, though, EQ Companion does alot more and has some really nice features.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way EQ Companion calculates DPS is by dividing total damage done with fight time.<br />
<br />
Fight time is calculated separately for each fighter and within each fighter, for each attack type (slash, kick, etc.). It starts from the first time you do damage (or try to do damage but miss) and ends with the last time you do or try to do damage. This works out really well with melee fighters, and really, is the only way to calculate melee DPS accurately. For non-melee it does not work at all, though.<br />
<br />
If you only cast one DD, the fight time will be 1 second and hence your DPS will be same as what the DD did.<br />
<br />
I have received a lot of comments about this and in the next release I will change it so that if you only do non-melee damage, your fight time will actually be the time the whole group was fighting.</div></div><hr />
