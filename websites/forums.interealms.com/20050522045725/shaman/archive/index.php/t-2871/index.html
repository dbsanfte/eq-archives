<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snakeking</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">perhaps a n00b question, but if you own a horse, can you sow it?  if so, does the innate speed increase of the horse stack with the sow?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know someone with a 70k horse, he clicks his jboots most of the time when he's on his horse, the jboots (sow) don't make him go any faster, but if he jumps in water and his horse poofs he still has jboots up<br />
<br />
So to answer your question, you can sow it, but the speed increase doesn't stack.<br />
<br />
Also, the innate run speed increase (AA skill) does not stack with ANY other form of speed increase</div></div><hr />
