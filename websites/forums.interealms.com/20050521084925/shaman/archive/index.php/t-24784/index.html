<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I have said in a previous thred many Shamans have mentioned wanting issues number 9 and 10 removed from our class issues list . <br />
I am not 100% sure that I can remove these Issues as they have not been adressed however if the community as a whole wants them gone I will do my best to acomplish it .<br />
The problem is im also geting some shamans who DONT want these issuses removed . For this reason im going to make this poll . In three days I will check results and abide by community decision .<br />
If it is decided that i should try to change the list I will make a poll with several of the more &quot;commonly discussed&quot; options and use said poll to narrow them down to the two issues that would potentaly be used as replacements .<br />
This is the most &quot;fair&quot; way i could think of to handle this.<br />

9. Reduce the cost of alchemy components. [currently being evaluated]<br />
10. MGB Shrink. [currently being evaluated]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Waiting to see some alternative issues to replace them before making a decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">would be happy if just 8 issues are sorted out , will take them forever to do anyway , going on their past track record .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm with Blazz on this one. I'd like to be sure #9 and #10 are going to be replaced with something thoughtful before I vote to have the current ones removed. I do, however, think the current ones are convenience issues that muscled their way onto the list while more pressing matters waited in the wings.<br />
<br />
Has SOE said they would allow us to redo the last two issues? With all of the dialogue about the original lists, I was under the impression we were stuck with what we originally asked for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would rather see 10 rephrased as &quot;out of group shrink.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yup (to the alternative issues first), maybe &quot;they&quot; (sony) see that as motivation to change them to<br />
mgb true-north (yeah, shamelessly stolen from klonn from the sony board, but i like that one :))<br />
and mgb-summon-food (of course 1 bread, no stack :))<br />
<br />
and completely agree glori's rephrasing statement</div></div><hr />

     I would rather see 10 rephrased as &quot;out of group shrink.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
/agree--since it has already been kicked around on the list for so long, maybe instead of going so far to remove it, it should just be tweaked a little.  I still feel that it is a fairly minor issue taken in the whole context of our class but hey--it's been on that list for a long while.  Let's make it go away for good by fixing it instead of ignoring it.<br />
<br />
#9 would be to me something like &quot;hey cool they reduced alchemy component prices&quot; but not &quot;hey i'm cancelling my account because im tired of gawdawful alchemy prices&quot;.....if I (or my small group of hunting buddies) need a particular potion that bad, I make it.  If I don't have the pp, I do whatever necessary to earn it.  There are many other problems with the whole alchemy skill besides just cost factors (heh I want my &quot;Grandmaster Alchemist&quot; title ;) ).<br />
<br />
Summation: reword #10, boot #9 (maybe replace or maybe just left out)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Agree with above<br />
<br />
Change MGB shrink to &quot;out of group&quot; shrink<br />
<br />
Remove alchemy one completely, its such a fubar'd tradeskill that its hardly worth being called a tradeskill. Some things never change :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">and add &quot;make epic 1.5 range equipable&quot; pretty please :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That would be nice.<br />
<br />
Polishes his shiny new &quot;roadkill with a stick up its bum&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Keep in mind that the &quot;top 10 list&quot; doesn't need to be 10 items.  The mods on the eqlive forums have even recommended that any class willing to cut their list down to the real meat and potatoes should do so.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't care about Alchemy but I don't think MGB and/or /tgb'able shrink should even be a &quot;class issue.&quot;  It should be a bug fix and the reasons why it can't be fixed just don't make sense.  I find it difficult to accept the &quot;too difficult to code&quot; response from devs about adding a confirmation box to shrink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I personally don't care about mgb shrink at all, or alchemy components.<br />
<br />
The main shaman issues to me are that we get a better pet and more combined buffs so we don't have to cast 8 buffs on people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">alchemy components...if you want to make more money selling potions then up your prices. lowering the cost of components means people will just sell them for even less.<br />
<br />
mgb shrink/pbae shrink/translocate shrink/mass shrink/raid leader has a button to autoshrink the entire raid.....there are a million answers to this issue and its hardly a CLASS issue in any sense other than shaman are the ones stuck with the job.<br />
<br />
one non issue and one thats not really a shaman issue  both on our top ten list...</div></div><hr />

Alchmey prices aren't about tradeskill money (maybe to some people) but are about class features that should be improved.  Us having a more improved alchemy prices/abilities (though this is getting better) would give us more utility<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hmm I have to agree at least in part, it is pretty stupid that the shaman version of a pumice costs around 100plat to make when you can get one from a vendor for 15 plat.<br />
the same can be said for alot of things but seriously Soe hasnt got a clue how to properly impliment anything on this scale and have proven it time and time again. <br />
<br />
look at chanters, C2 is a lvl 54 (52?) spell, but you have to be at least lvl 45 to get it cast on you...wait at lvl 45 you can get kei...thats PERFECTLY logical!<br />
<br />
or this one, find a mob like the researcher in PoI, the one who wont fight back, you can work all your melee skills up to max on this guy with 0 risk involved, but if you get caught you will be warned and possibly Banned for doing so...but wait, casters are free to stand in pok and chain cast on nonresponsive npc's for risk free skill ups and will never be warned or banned for this behavior.  Bards are allowed to go afk in the bazaar for DAYS practicing their brass and pbaeing the hell out of 50 people and increasing the amount of lag in the bazaar by a massive factor but will never be warned or banned for doing so...yeah THAT MAKES SENSE!<br />
<br />
in short its my honest opinion that while alchemy components could be better priced having soe look at them will only make certain that they **** it all up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd drop the list to 4 issues if I knew that they truly would get fixed:<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Larger direct heal. I don't care about efficiency<br />
2) Fix DoT/Nuke Parity. Agro, Resist rates, and efficiency versus time investment are way outta whack.<br />
3) Lower Cast time on malos to 3.0, and the recast to 2.25<br />
4) Re evaluate Omens spells. Consolidate buffs some and make Pure spirit work. Fix the pet.</div></div><hr />
