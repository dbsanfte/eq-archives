<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tuuktalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried this game and I can say this: it sucks. If you like EQ steer clear of this game.<br />
<br />
Negatives:<br />
<br />
No Dungeons (Im serious there are NO DUNGEONS)<br />
No good loot (all items are player crafted including spells)<br />
Vast areas of totally empty space<br />
Limited varieties of MOBs (content is severely lacking)<br />
Buggy (Ive had slideshow framerates even after 10 patches)<br />
Constant nerfing (If you think EQ is bad....)<br />
The worst customer service Ive ever experienced (2 weeks to respond to a ticket and didnt fix the problem)<br />
Graphics subpar and animation choppy (characters)<br />
Everyone wears the same armor, but YAY you can color it different (finally)<br />
Almost zero risk/reward (read: no pulse pounding exitement) When you die you get a death point- no loss of exp and death points can be removed if you have the cash<br />
No swimming, no falling damage and only dragons can fly (you walk under water and if you fall in too far from shore you drown- you cant come up for air)<br />
NO ROGUES!<br />
Class specialization is a total mishmash - a cleric can cast fireballs, lightning bolts blah blah if he practices the mage school enough.<br />
Need I go on?<br />
<br />
Positives:<br />
<br />
Good UI - clean and functional (finally)<br />
Landscape is decent (but empty so who cares?)<br />
Crafting system is straightforward and easy<br />
Every character gets a limited form of SoW (on a timer)<br />
Teleportation portals<br />
Player crafted housing (still just a pretty 3d object- almost zero function)<br />
And thats about all I can think of thats good about it.<br />
<br />
So basically this game is horrible and I feel sorry for anyone who paid money for it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No Dungeons (Im serious there are NO DUNGEONS)<br />
<br />
True.  But dungeons are planned for the future.<br />
<br />
No good loot (all items are player crafted including spells)<br />
<br />
When I first found this I too thought it odd.  Now I look at it a different way.  The named mobs don't drop uber lewts so they are there to be killed by you or me, rather than being pharmed 24/7 by the same small set of misfits.<br />
<br />
Vast areas of totally empty space<br />
<br />
True.  You have to explore and find out where the mobs are: you don't just run into them.<br />
<br />
Limited varieties of MOBs (content is severely lacking)<br />
<br />
True.  Though there's been enough for me so far: 3 months and level 60 atm.<br />
<br />
Buggy (Ive had slideshow framerates even after 10 patches)<br />
<br />
True, but it is getting better.<br />
<br />
Constant nerfing (If you think EQ is bad....<br />
<br />
Only seen one significant nerf (to archers and I approved of it) in 3 months.<br />
<br />
The worst customer service Ive ever experienced (2 weeks to respond to a ticket and didnt fix the problem)<br />
<br />
My only experience is one email I sent and that got a reply within 24 hours.<br />
<br />
Graphics subpar and animation choppy (characters)<br />
<br />
I prefer them to EQs.<br />
<br />
Everyone wears the same armor, but YAY you can color it different (finally)<br />
<br />
Everyone wears different armour because its all heavily customisable.<br />
<br />
Almost zero risk/reward (read: no pulse pounding exitement) When you die you get a death point- no loss of exp and death points can be removed if you have the cash<br />
<br />
The death system makes dying occasionally a negligible problem.  However, the player accustomed to zerg raiding in EQ with insta clicky resses is going to be hit hard by it.  What I really like about it is that I can explore really hairy places without the spectre of an unrecoverable corpse hanging over me.<br />
<br />
No swimming, no falling damage and only dragons can fly (you walk under water and if you fall in too far from shore you drown- you cant come up for air)<br />
<br />
NO ROGUES!<br />
<br />
True.<br />
<br />
Class specialization is a total mishmash - a cleric can cast fireballs, lightning bolts blah blah if he practices the mage school enough.<br />
<br />
I like the class system.  You can combine skills from different classes, but without everyone ending up as a combined war/mage/thief class that I've seen in other games trying to do this.<br />
<br />
The BIGGEST problem in Horizons affects only a certain class of player.  If, in EQ, you enjoyed logging on, being told by your guild leader where to go, where to stand, what to do, then Horizons is not for you because that support mechanism just isn't there.<br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, you want to plan for yourself, explore for yourself, do stuff while relaxing with a few friends then Horizons is OK - if a little undemanding.  Why Tuuktalus should be sorry for me, given I am enjoying myself now far more than I did in the last two years of EverRaid I have no idea.<br />
<br />
If you like EQ steer clear of this game.<br />
<br />
I'd have to say that if you liked EQ then Horizons may be fun for you, but if you liked EverRaid then avoid it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tuuktalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My last statement should have read &quot;I feel sorry for whoever paid money for this and felt lied to and robbed for being a paying beta tester&quot; The game was released about 6 months too early IMHO and I payed about 80 dollars to find that out. If you did or do enjoy the game, more power to ya.<br />
Im sure the game has improved and will continue to improve - bugs, customer service etc, because if it didnt, noone would be playing right now. <br />
But after my experience I wont be back under any circumstance (barring a complete refund of my money, which will never happen).<br />
A few of the flaws (as I percieve them) are fundamental to the devs vision and will never change and therefore I will never enjoy them.<br />
<br />
Oh and people do pharm in HZ) Read arbotus, golems etc, especially after the (XX is dropping different treasure nerf) I used to do it myself.<br />
<br />
Lol also you'd make quite a salesman Crusty)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I have to admit there's some justice in what you say: I have painted too rosy a picture, and yes pharming does occur.<br />
<br />
But mobs like arbotus and golems are not unique mobs that spawn very rarely.  So even though they are farmed its not difficult to get a piece of the action.<br />
<br />
But the real difference here is that the rarer named mobs dont as a rule drop good loot so the 'leet dewds' generally leave them alone.  You go up against them for the challenge, not for the drops - if drops are all that motivate you then Horizons is a bad choice of game.  It seems to me that I've killed - and been killed - by more named mobs in Horizons in the last 3 months than I got to face in 4 years of EQ.<br />
<br />
You say that you feel the game as released was incomplete.  Again I think theres some truth in that: but if Horizons adds instanced dungeons - properly done and without the LDoN dps race nonsense - then it could become a great game.  Instanced dungeons would allow for uber drops off uber mobs without the 'leet dewds' farming them out of existence.  The current Horizons world would then form a good solid base within which the dungeons would exist.<br />
<br />
My biggest reservation about all this is the pace at which Horizons is developing is so slow, that WoW will kill it off before it has a chance to flower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hawbes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry, did beta and that it for me. Heard they nerfed dragons hard core, so went and spent my money elsewhere!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>fariskilynn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah.. first of all you people dont know what nerfing is.. they balance things a bit.. you whine &quot;nerf nerf&quot; they change something to make it better, or fairer you whine &quot;nerf nerf&quot; you all want a little cheese to go with your whine? HZ is a good game.. and it gets better and better, I'm sorry to say.. but learn what a nerf is before you complain about them happening.. dragons were never nerfed.. they lost 1 ability &quot;Lair Shaping&quot; big deal.. they have gained ALOT, and and gaining more every day, as is every other class in the game, its your right to not like a game.. but dont accuse it of nerfs unless you know what a nerf is... that goes for HZ and for EQ.. because there have been very few &quot;nerfs&quot; in either.. and the ones that did happen in BOTH were because of players whining about something not being fair... and the such...<br />
*steps off her box and goes back to being ignored*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tuuktalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im not sure you know what a nerf is either as you failed to explain what one is. But since you seem to think you are the all knowing Nerfologist please explain to us just what a nerf really is. You say they are balancing it up a bit- didnt they have months and months of beta to figure that out? Oh wait it still IS in beta, my bad.<br />
<br />
As for whining, apparently (to you anyways) because people complain about something they dont like in a game (that they pay for) they are whiners. So basically by your standards a game as ridiculously buggy as Horizons should have never been fixed to appease the &quot;whiners&quot;. I havent logged on for quite some time but Ill bet the framerate still isnt above 15 fps in Tazoon or 5fps in a &quot;raid&quot;. But hey I shouldnt whine about it- Ill leave that to the people that are still paying for it. <br />
<br />
Id like you to copy your post and put it in the Horizons and EQ general forum and see what those people think) Id wear a flame retardant suit if I were you...</div></div><hr />
