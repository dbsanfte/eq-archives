<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there id like to start  off buy saying that i think the shm class is a verry well rounded class and can rilly hold there own in a pinch. that been siad ill get on to my poit. In my yeas of EQ i have found that a losts of ppl tend to play many differnt toon's and some but not all play there toon cuz at the time it was the most uber. <br />
<br />
I have found many a person who dose not know how to play there class and for some reason it rilly pisses me off. i tend not to play as well wall grouped with the person just in case thay get the idea to start up a shm cuz thay think there uber, the last thing i need is that same person to start a shm and then play awlfuul and hurting the shm name. i also find the same true when i play my monk for just the other day i was playing in solb when a group shouted for help i went to the reskue and ended up KS 5 bats from them, afeter that 3 ppl said monks were uber and were gona start one right away, i wish i did not help them ( <br />
<br />
so do you find your self not showing off or playing as good when your group with such ppl or do you tend to play even better to make up for there lack of knolage and or skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So in an effort to avoid hurting the shaman's good name, you are going to play poorly, thus giving others the illusion that shamans are a weak class.  That'll teach 'em.  How about, play the game as best you can and stop grouping with idiots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Posting for postings sake?<br />
<br />
How about being yourself and doing the best you can regardless?  How about putting the good of the group ahead of yourself?  How about learning the finer points of emergency healing?  Root parking? Buff timing? Or pulling that mob off your poor chanter so they can concentrate on mezzing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some people fit better into certain classes than others, I think.  Just because they suck at one class doesn't always mean they suck as a player - might just not have found their niche yet.  Luckily for me, this class has fit me pretty well.  And because of that... 198 days played on a 60th shaman with 6 (and a half!) AA points - and out of a handfull of alts, only one is 35th, with the rest 20 or under. (Druid, used to be guild taxi when we were smaller)</div></div><hr />

Hahaha... I've done that same thing several times when I get into a pickup group.  It's good to get to feel like the hero every once in a while. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) spelling=bad, scatch that ... spelling=horrible to an epic degree<br />
2) The idea wasn't so hot.  There are plenty of poorly played shaman, but showing off to convert more shaman will only add to the problem as indicated by the posters monk story ... what I could make out of it.  <br />
3) PLEASE be a joke.<br />
<br />
IMHO, play the class you want because you enjoy it, not because it kicks ass.  I love my shaman, I love my ranger.  I play my shaman well, but I play my ranger badly (I'm just out to have fun with my ranger, not to perform).  As much as I love to see more people catch on to the shaman class, I also enjoy seeing people enjoying their rangers, their SKs, clerics ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bah you play your shammy BADLY!  I heard a shaman 4 levels below you beat you last night in a DUEL Tarthug! Oh..wait..you did say kill me.. nm.. <br />
<br />
<br />
;)<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW Buff timing is the largest pain in the ass i've ever seen.. much prefer just cycling it and getting myself first and using the rest as a reminder..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I liek to do baking combines when grouped.  Nothing takes the edge off a tough CR like some Batwings Crunchies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">can anyone translate what the original poster said?  i can't understand through all the grammatical and spelling atrocities.  normally i don't bag on grammer and spelling, but chrikey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I could really care less what folks think about how I play, but I'd have to have a lobotomy to do so.  <br />
<br />
I make it a point to tell folks I'm not a healer whey they shout that they're looking for one, and then give me a tell because I'm LFG and haven't responded.  They don't believe me til we start fighting and they don't need heals beyond regen.<br />
<br />
And my ranger is sad, too.  He keeps trying to cannibalize.  Thankfully, I've moved something benign to that spell slot now.<br />
<br />
edit:  I think the gist of what he asked is whether we dumb ourselves down to match the idiocy of some folks in our group, or work harder to overcome it.<br />
<br />
Personally, it's all about efficiency for me.  Max gain, least effort.  If I can't overcome poor companions, I'll give them a 5 minute notice cuz, uh... I have to go help somebody in my guild.  Yeah.  That's it.</div></div><hr />

Is experience THAT hard to get?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I always try and play at my best.  Now this can lead to frustration as I am pretty serious when I log on to play.<br />
<br />
I'm not after &quot;phat l3wtz.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not here to pull 1 MOB every 2 minutes while we talk nice-nice in group.<br />
<br />
I AM here to pull, fight, slow, as fast and as efficiently as possible.<br />
<br />
I expect you to know your class. If you play a Shaman I expect you to be canning down below 80% when the MT is at 20% and me the Enchanter is at 50%. <br />
<br />
That's a beef I have. I KNOW how a Shaman should function in group after playing one and reading this board. I KNOW how a Monk should function after playing one to level 60 and beyond. (I am convinced AA is Buzz Lightyear experience.) I am DARN CERTAIN how an Enchanter should function having played one to level 54 and saving numeroous evenings from CR without them even knowing it. (5 pull? I laugh at a 5 pull. Now an 11 pull is a bit tougher)<br />
<br />
I WISH I could direct every Shaman to this board. But I am not the most tactful person (SHADDUP) and <br />
<br />
/t Shaman_01: Hey bud, not to criticize your play style - but you might want to go to www dot shamanscrucible dot com.&quot;<br />
<br />
/r Why?<br />
<br />
And there's where I have to break someone's heart.<br />
<br />
BECAUSE FEKTARD YOU AIN'T GETTING IT DONE. YOU'RE FRIGGIN MEDDING IS WHY!  CANN YOUR A55 BELOW 80% YOU NON-SLOWING FEK THIS IS VELKS AND THE SPIDERS ARE POOSAES.<br />
<br />
One of us usually leaves soon afterwards.<br />
<br />
I could go on - but I don't want to offend anyone with my 'diatribes.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bexar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hehehehe, Shandy, I thought I was the only one that used the (Ahhh, sorry guys gotta run, some of my guildies need help&quot; ploy, better than saying &quot;Sorry guys got to find a real group, but please feel free to continue talking about your Girl Scout cookie sale without me&quot;. And I agree with Faern, I always log on with the intention of playing my best, of course some nights are better than others, and nothing is more frustrating than some bone head tank thinking it necessary to tell you that he can not understand why you can not cast and maintain 4 stat buffs and 2 shields on 3 tanks plus slow, haste, and heal without needing an occassional med break, after all he can do it with his lvl 30 Shammy, think this about where I say &quot; Sorry guys got to go help a guildie&quot;, hehehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Bah; I LIKE it when people say 'Wow.. you're a good shaman!'.  When people I've grouped with or raided with in the past page me and say, 'Hey! We're taking a group into Cazic Thul and need a good shaman, wanna come?'<br />
<br />
I like it when people tell me my Monk pulls better than anyone else has for their group.<br />
<br />
I take PRIDE in doing my job the best I can.  I don't like people to give my classes a bad name.  I don't want us to get the rep Druids have; as kiting, inconsiderate bastards who don't know what to do in a group when they get one.  If you wanna play bad, go make a freaking druid!<br />
(edit; I know some REALLY good druids, but they seem to be the exception rather than the norm :p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Bextar-  Funny how the one or two people in those groups you actually wouldn't mind playing with will send tells a few minutes later saying &quot;I got fed up with it and left, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
And I suppose I lied earlier when I said I don't care.  It *is* really cool to get tells from people inviting you on raids.  I've gotten in on a few new places by word of mouth lately.  Extremely awesome.</div></div><hr />
