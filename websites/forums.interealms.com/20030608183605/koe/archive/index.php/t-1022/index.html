<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ransure Crystlethorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hrm, Im thinking of limiting it to lvl's 150 and up... as sub lvl 100 will have problems in the Guk revision 752...<br />
<br />
Knarlz, you can still come bro... but please everyone, try to be at least lvl 150 for this raid.  200+ would be best ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dang, I only have a 12 gig vidio card, and my isp is only 4 nano, so I havent been able to run Everquest * Rielm of Constapation *.<br />
<br />
So I'm capped at the 150 lvl at best. <br />
<br />
At least the server side patches have let me get my alcohol  tolerance to 500, and with a few more blue diamonds I can get brewing up to there also.<br />
<br />
I love the new stat brews, although the added 300 wis still puts me under the soft cap.<br />
<br />
I would probebly be at least 112 except those &quot; Sleepers Tomb to ToV &quot; pulls you keep doing. You really should work on that.</div></div><hr />

This 203rd lvl SK will be reverse-kiting Trak and pharming his arse :)  My intravenous ISP connect should be hooked up fine to my skull, in fact by then i will never leave my house due to the Uber RL patch VI will hook me up with...  they will feed me iron rations, milk, and the occasional Ogre swill while raping my credits from the cyber bank.

and I'm really getting tired of Droods and wizers quad kiting the avatars of war, I  mean really peeps!, leave your greens for the rest of us.<br />
<br />
Once again  I'm afraid I must ask you all to bring some black marble stacks on raids to help out the poor clerics, you all know how expencive those buffs can be.</div></div><hr />

After all, you need VI's new Holy Trinity - Paladin, Bard, and Beastmaster - right? We are essential to any raid force! You have to love the new pally upgrade in the last patch too!! Divine Aura now lasts for 45 minutes and allows you to attack while remaining invincible!! I am so glad I decided to stick with my paladin for the past 6 years... it's finally paying off :)<br />

new spell!  :  Abundant Lag, <br />

I can't wait till level 100 when I get Disable Server.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Gratz me on 96!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
I may make it to 150 by this raid :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
I hate the Warrens loot code on everything. My lvl 96 spell - summon primal codpiece - ( lore, no drop, Human Bixbie, Clr Dru Sk ) drops off of the sleeper. Do any of you have lvl 80ish gimps still farming him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I do Knarlz....I have a rogue that is still mid-80ish with his epic v4.5. But I'm thinking of deleting him....he is only BSing for about 10k a shot....not as good as they used to be. I'll let you know if I keep him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thanks Aneron,<br />
<br />
It's sad that they nerfed backstab on Wisp Rogues, but I quess it was unbalanced having lev and permenant light source. <br />
<br />
You might want to delete him and start a Mammoth rogue. Although dex is low, great str, and armor looks cool, two tusk backstab at lvl 75 is great I hear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">2 Words.... Virtual EQ, we will all be standing in our living room with a pair of goggles and gloves on with a sword in our hand knocking over the lamps and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Guys, I'll come, but we all know us Beastmasters are nerfed so hard all I can do is stand at the back casting my crappy debuff spells which Shamans overwrite anyway. <br />
<br />
Of course I could bring Drolgin, but I mean - 2hs is so horribly broken, even a level 172 Paladin with the Fiery We-have-run-out-of-original-things-to-call-the-latest-version-of-the-paladin-epic of Doom and full Infundibulum armor isn't gonna help you any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">OMGIhitlevel97andgotanewspell  WHEEEEEEEEEE<br />
<br />
Summon Dorf!<br />
3 charges<br />
<br />
I tried this last night and a level 172 paladen popped!<br />
I'm afraid to use the 2 remaining charges.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also with the new GM's on a 3 year +/-  3 month spawn timer, I hope this doesn't interfear with the guk run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Was that Neverflee you summoned? hehe<br />
<br />
Ohhh I want to go....I just got my new spell .......Heal the whole zone.....although it is MAJOR aggro for the cleric but with that nice new Rune spell that Chanters get now I tend to live through the fight.<br />
<br />
So please count me in on this one. A level 180 Goddess of Healing:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Grayeyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Do you know where your infundibulum is, Drolgin? :D</div></div><hr />

buwahahha  just teasin bro, we all know that's not you  /wink</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
PS: Hiya Varrix *hugs*  Good to see you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Boy its good to see someone posting some high lvl events.<br />
Its just so frustrating camping things these days. <br />
Cazic Thule is getting old, they should make him spawn in sets of 4, so I can at least quad him for a better chance at all the merchant seller junk he drops. Plus, with my new spells: Skin like Godhood and Zone Upheaval, it should be a short run. Maybe I'll just take my lvl 60 twink instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Bleh!<br />
<br />
My wristwatch can't handle DX32a. back to running EQ lite on the old Cray 12<br />
<br />
I hit 100 the other day but de-leveled so I could fight in the newbie area of - Everquest -  The Attack of the Gimps.<br />
<br />
I kept getting steamrolled by the Equadorian all female cat guild, Gatos de Boombooms aka Kitties with Titties.<br />
<br />
I wanted to buy one of these dragons to ride but with only 2meg  PP could only afford Vox. So why bother.<br />
<br />
Oh well back to the experience grind. I want to hit 150 by raid time, even though it is a younger generation event.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ransure Crystlethorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">People, I just got word from a source in VI that Guk will be revamped by raid time... So, expect lvl 180ish Froglock Krupinkinnerium Knights and lvl 200ish Zolinaristarinism Shaman in the King room at that time... The King should only be around lvl 175, but with 5 or 6 gaurds, it will make mezzing tough.  <br />
<br />
Looks like the min lvl requirement will have to be at least lvl 175... but please be prepared.. and those without full Infundibulum need not apply.. this is a skill run... so I need some people with serious equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I'll rearrange my schedule and see if I can attend this. Venom should be able to make 150 by the, is in Undefilable See-Thru Shama-na-na Plastique (Full set out of ToV, sub-basement to HoT), and I will try to get the epic committee to set up a run to the Plane of Prexus so I can take out Prexus and his mermen for my epic upgrade, The Spear of Phat.  If anyone has my level 149 spell &quot;Tupid's Insects&quot; (Zone slow, 110%, mobs implode slowly), let me know. Rare drop off of Bile Bixies in Kithicor.<br />
<br />
See you there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ransure Crystlethorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">So is everyone still in for this?  Im thinking we should have a 1500 AA minimum to attend....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Canoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">lol I had forgotten about his thread, needed a well deserved bump, thanks ransure! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Rave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I will bring Ravelrd out of retirement for this!<br />
 <br />
After the raid, you want to go duo the pool room in Sol B again? :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Garike Swiftpaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Hmmm, nothing written in stone for that day right now, although, I did have a couple possible options filled in for that day. So far its a toss up between the raid, watching Rocky XCMVIII, or trying out the new virtual driving goggles.<br />
As for now, put me down as a possible please. I should have my new class Basilisk character to around level 160 by then.<br />
 <br />
Thanks for the awsome idea on the uber raid!!<br />
 <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Ransure Crystlethorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Hrm, if they get the Sol B expansion out by then so we can pull 40+ at a time I might consider it Rave... but that necro better be up to snuff by then!  No more working on your gimp monkey... :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Deneve</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">i got a tupids insects scroll, it dropped from a PoK guard when we ran a raid to the bank there, damn, tradeskills are hard when you need a 50 man raid to make it to the bank....specially when the bankers DT :(</div></div><hr />
