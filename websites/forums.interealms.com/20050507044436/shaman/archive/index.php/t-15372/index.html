<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MiilkinOreoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello..<br />
<br />
  Just wanted to say hello and finally I was smart enough to find these boards lol.. I have recently decided to play a bit again but not as much as I used to a year ago.. I quit a year ago because I figured I'd be doing a lot of things and also enjoy my life in College as a 18yr old freshman woman trying to find hott guyzz to make out with *j/k* but really I thought that I would be seriously busy with everything in college but it turns out that 1/4 the days I was doing college work/friends and the rest of the day was filled with sleep, tv, and crappy computer games..<br />
<br />
I used to play on Morell Thule but decided to play this time around on Stormm *newbs* because it sounded kinda fun and there were actually a lot of nontwinked ppl in lower end zones fighting with eachother.. It brought back a lot of memories..<br />
<br />
This is my first time as a Shaman and I'm a hott troll with Dcups.. lol :) but I have never played a shaman before so this whole thing is new and now it got really fun for me.. I just hit level 10 and the level 9 spells actually somewhat make me feel a little more like a shaman. I used to be a Enchanter and Druid on MT but gave my account to my brother whom still uses them and offered them back but I didnt want to take his 2boxxing away so he bought me a whole new getup of EQ and all exp to start fresh...<br />
<br />
I'm about to be 19 and if I write stuff thats to sensitive on these boards or just stupid pardon me because I'm 18 and a female.. Yes i have two of those things in my shirt.. Lol on MT a lot of ppl thought didnt believe I was a woman because of just the way I talked about games and everything in general.. but I grew up with 3 brothers and no sisters.. and my mom constantly working so I was just around guys my whole childhood so I adopted their taste of interests *EQ*<br />
<br />
Well I babbled on and I'm sorry to post this here but I just wanted to introduce myself formally before I start asking questions or posting and ppl ask *Who the hell is she? dumb broad* so atleast you ahve a little background on me :)<br />
<br />
K Time to dot and spear some things for a little bit :) Nice meeting you all and g/l<br />
<br />
PS. I know EQ is drawing closer to an end with a lot of ppl quitting *like I did* but I just came back out of boredom and all other mmorpgs kinda are boring.. I just hope the next generation ones are a lot funner and better then the ones out there now :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome back =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MiilkinOreoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Welcome back =)<br />
<br />
Thx :) I kinda had a questino too.. but i forgot to ask lol.. Since I'm a troll I wanted to do the newbie quest armor for Spiritchains or whatever its called in Neriak Foriegn Quarter.. but I cannot find blocks of crude bronze.. except for 5pp a piece in bazaar which is ridiculous because I have 2pp lol..<br />
<br />
Is there any place other than Orcs in Crushbone that droppem? I really would hate to lose DE Faction for it then I couldnt go home lol.. or do you need to kill like a lot of orcs like 200+ to be KOS? I forgot about faction in EQ lol.. thx again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well let me be the first to welcome you here to the boards. Not all of us are grumpy shamans and even the grumpy ones are happy to share their knowledge. Feel free to ask any question you have.<br />
<br />
Now just a few things that will help you out in the near future. HP is the best thing you can get, then AC then lasty Wisdom. At lvl 24 IIRC we get Canniblize it takes 50 HP for 20 mana, not great but its a start, with more HP you will be able to munch on yourself more often and thus regen more mana.<br />
<br />
I know your on the newest server so the &quot;economy&quot; balance isn't there yet.<br />
<br />
(Some stuff here are general tips, you might know them or not I try to let everyone know.)<br />
<br />
One of the best places for any shaman is the shaman channel. So in case you can't remember or didn't know how to join other channels its /join serverwide.crucible:crucible  then you use /1 or /2 depending on how many channels you have. Sometimes odd fights break out, but they are very rare.<br />
<br />
Next thing as I am sure you have already figured out after having an enchanter is to make two separate windows, this is very useful overall for listening to people talking to you, or hearing the people chatting without your text sending the whole thing up.<br />
<br />
Other then that I can't really give any more advice, most of it is learned from the wisdom of the others who have already passed through these boards and onto other things. However it is up to us young ones to pass it on to the others.<br />
<br />
I am usally found in the shaman channel mostly listening but I ask a question or two everyonce in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">By the way, what expandtions do you have enabled?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MiilkinOreoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thank you..<br />
<br />
I will be in the curicible in a moment :).. and thx again for the tips about hp, ac, wis.. makes a lot of sense.. I have Kunark, Velious, SoU and PoP Enabled.. I dont have LoY yet.. Lol i should have just said all but LoY :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That ore I believe drops off of the Orc Pawns in Nek Forest, East Commons, West Commons, and all the general newbie/Lowbie zones around there that they roam.  Depending on what religeon you picked there is also a few necklesses you can quest for as a troll.  If you pick Inny as your deity you can eventually get a snare casting neckless that will be handy for you.  Good luck and have a halfling a day to keep thier populations down.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hi im litgruv,  i like sunsents, long walks ont he beach, soft psychedelic jazz adn warm sunshine carassing my face on a rainy day.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hi.  I'm Ben.  I like to shoot things from so far away that you have to calculate atmospheric mirage into your ballistics.  I also play EQ and program computers.<br />

Welcome to the shaman community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">make sure to read the guide at the top of this forum. also to lower your flame level there is a search function for the website. enjoy your shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Korginard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Try this link for Crude Bronze: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16131<br />
<br />
It lists just about everything that drops it and it looks like it's pretty much all over! Although I love this board for Shaman advice, Allakhazam is definately your friend when you want to research equipment and quests :)<br />
 It looks like Kobolds in Steamfont, Innothule, and Tox would be the lowest level mobs and thus the easiest.<br />
 If you want to try Tox be sure to use the Paineel Book instead of Erudin, as the Kobolds tend to be toward the south end of the zone near Paineel<br />
 Welcome back and enjoy your Shaman :)<br />
