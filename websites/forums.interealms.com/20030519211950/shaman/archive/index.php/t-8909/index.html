<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been a long while since I posted about an upgrade. Lvl 61 now and have all wanted spells up to 60 (except Greater Rem Curse).<br />
<br />
My guild is NEVER going to go to VT, currently farming HoT and done a couple of Vindi/Doze kills (I got BP yay ! ). Guild target atm is VP, ST and then NToV - this will take a long while as we are mainly a casual guild :). Can anyone suggest doable upgrades given our current guild targets - we will probably be looking at taking a pop at CT soon.<br />

Currently considering Crimson Darksplint bracer (sell Bracer of Comprehension, this one pretty cost neutral) and OoIV for range and retiring SBS to resist gear. <br />
<br />
Note, I'm now very close to stamina cap when buffed also :).<br />
<br />
Edit: Forgot to add we are on +CoV/Coldain faction and very KOS to giants :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm, based on your equip and description, it sounds like your guild is extremely similar to my own, though a few months behind (a casual guild that also raids).<br />
As such, I'm probably in a decent position to recommend gear.<br />
<br />
Note that all prices are based on Fennin's economy, so please don't hold it against me if they're radically different from AB's.<br />
<br />
Tracking Wolf Collar (from 8th shawl war) is 10ac 5wis/int 40hp/mana with a slight dodge mod, nice upgrade. Runs 7-10k.<br />
<br />
Either Glassy Frog Eye (2ac 5dex/wis/int 40hp/mana +saves)<br />
or Silver Hammer Earring (3ac 6wis 25hp 55mana +saves) would be good ear upgrades. They run 9-10k and 4-6k, respectively.<br />
<br />
If you have PoV access, I would suggest you work on collecting metallic liquids and razorfiend talons to get yourself a pair of Valorium Rings of Gallantry (5ac 8str/sta/agi/dex 65hp 40mana +saves). They sell for ludicrous amounts, 30-40k, but as I said you can self-attain the components.<br />
<br />
Myself, I prefer a Heirophant's Cloak to Lodizal. It is 10ac 4-to-all 75hp/mana. Runs 17-19k.<br />
<br />
Orb of the Infinite Void is a great shield, but if you'd rather not shell out all your money on a single item (I opted to buy mine, and don't regret it), look into a Skull Marked Shield (22ac 7wis 50hp/mana) for 3-4k, or a Bone Braced Buckler (25ac 10str 10wis 55hp/mana) for 10-12k.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much you mind item swapping, a Barbed Rubicite Bracer (13ac 5wis 35hp) at around 2-4k would be a good JBB replacement. I don't know the stats on Ogre Cultural Chain offhand, so I can't say how it compares.<br />
<br />
For belts, a Barbed Rubicite Belt (12ac 3dex/sta/wis 40hp 25mana) like I wear is probably your best 'value' at around 7k. But if you wish to splurge, a Girdle of Mithaniel (8ac 12str 10sta/wis/int 55hp 45mana) is definately a superior item, at 24-28k.<br />
<br />
For shoulders, I personally have switched to a Peerless Dragonwing Mantle (14ac 55hp/mana) for 7k from my old Obulus Death Shroud. My reasoning for doing so was getting the level 62 heal: Tnarg's Mending. It's a patch unaffected by ODS anyway, which was always the biggest use I had for it. I do still swap the ODS in for buffing on raids, so you may or may not wish to rid yourself of it completely.<br />
Other valid shoulder choices include Death Watcher's Shroud (15ac 5sta 7wis 15hp 30mana +saves) for 8-10k, or Pauldrons of Witness (7ac 5dex 7wis/int 35hp/mana) for 1-2k.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope that at least a few things here are helpful, feel free to click my sig to see what I use.</div></div><hr />
