<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">this period is when u can solo WELL and u need to enjoy it to the full<br />
<br />
Personally i didnt solo much before 40- was too much hard work for not enough gain imexp, and spent most of 30 in sol b wackin kobs&lt;always loved dungeons tho&gt;<br />
<br />
Thers some great spells at 39, wich really give u a bit extra BAM powa. Also ur pet is not such a wimp.<br />
<br />
40+ id split between 2 mobs - spectres in feroot and gnome guards in steamfont. both bloody hard and both MUCHO fun to fight.  great loot too.<br />
<br />
Against spectres i sugest pulling with vos, then /pet attack as it glides towards u. Then slow(optional) hers the real trick&gt; use flash of light! reverse kite the bugger  BAH i should be charging money for this tip lol<br />
kepp reapplying FOL, and dot as needed, when it starts to run, follow it and melle its ass.<br />
at 44 u can try mixing it with root and poison ddor cold dd (poison casts faster)<br />
It is possible to single pull the oasis spectres, just more folk around to pull them i find.<br />
Loot: scythe sells for 12pp to vendors about one in 6 spec killed.<br />
<br />
Gnomes- again use the FOL tactic, pull single gnome near the tree- far easier after 44, but is possible at 40. Reall important part is experiment- hit it with FOL and watch its pathing, u should find its bit buggy, wich means it doesnt run too fast for ur pet to bite its ass!<br />
<br />
its great watching the woried nuubies trying to vainly heal the guard as u wack its ass. one my funiest eq moments happened here-  lvl 6 wizzards comes up to me whikle i was edding. Looks at me *blinks* turns to my pet ans says- scuse me friend may i have a teleport to wc pls?  i said nothing(too busy giggling)  then he turns back to me and asks if the my friend is afk. :)<br />
Priceless!<br />
<br />
ohh yeah at lvl 40- u can solo pull kodiaks to velks ent, great place to pull- next to zone if it goes wrong, and u can beg buffs sometimes too. inc the odd rez heheh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">would this strategy work for a barbarian shaman too?  and does your pets taunt have to be off to reverse kite with FoL?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mongore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, I am sure it would work for a barbarian shaman that is willing to loose gnome faction I guess. And your pet doesn't have to be off the mob for flash of light to work. Although sometimes the mob will keep attacking your pet after you have FoL on it to correct this just tell your pet to stop attack and then sick him on the mob again while it is running this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Politetraethyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have had the same experience with people asking my pet for SOW and ports. I play on a Team-PvP server (as an Ogre) and I was supporting a guild PK raid to Crushbone. Our lowbies needed some experience and excitement so we figured the elves would be surprised when a bunch of DEs, Trolls and Ogres were supporting the built in mobs of CB.<br />
<br />
Anyway as I went about buffing my mates a low level elf walks up and hails my pet by name (I am pretty sure he was something like Gobanker or some other obvious pet name) and asks for a sow. Of course my pet doesn't respond and I figure I will med and see what comes of this. My guild was of course laughing their asses off in guild chat.<br />
<br />
This guy eventually gets incensed that my pet is not responding to his &quot;Sow plz&quot; request (which BTW is pretty annoying in the first place, but I digress). What was funniest is he kept on with it and began calling my pet names for not responding!<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure he was giving my pet tells - I wonder if there was a player who thought it would be funny to use the name my pet had and was receiving &quot;Dood - gimme a sow u fuxor!&quot;<br />
<br />
If not then I wonder what this guy thought when my pet couldn't receive his tells. Doesn't matter much since my guild killed him after the stopped laughing at him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lefusgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The gnome that you are talking about is Watchman Halv and he's a 35th warrior. I'm a 41 Barb shaman and I've been able to solo him since 39th. I just buff myself, throw Talisman, Shield, Furious Str, and Haste on my pet. Pull with Togor's, let pet tank long enough to make sure slow landed and also to land VoS. I always get aggro with VoS so from there on I apply Envenomed Breath and tank the rest of the fight.<br />
I am kos to the gnome guards now, but I've never liked gnomes anyway.</div></div><hr />
