<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raketh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just thinking, would group Q be overpowering? Since shaman have a superb mana regen it would basicaly be a endless uber group hp regen spell. Shaman would be able to cast it for an endlss amount of time because the mana used would be gotten back by canabalize in a few seconds (which would be healed by the group Q anyway). The only way i bet they would put in group Q would be to have a huge amount of mana attached to it (such is the way of all new shaman spells, which is rediculous). <br />
<br />
I have quit playing EQ due to the way shaman have been treated, but i still think about how the game balanaces out while i troll the boards. What would your guys solution to this problem be? would you say shamans just deserve it?</div></div><hr />

Since it seems sony is giving them avatar, I dont see why it wouldn't be feasible</div></div><hr />

I would love to say us Shaman deserve it, but hearing you put it that way, you do have a point.  I think that would be too powerful.   Granted, it would give us something to do during raids, but it would be hideously boring I would think.  <br />
<br />
And even if it cost a ton of mana, that wouldn't be a great problem.  We CAN regen mana pretty good, even for our over-priced spells, it would still be able to be chain cast.  <br />
<br />
No, no group Q... except MAYBE as an AA that has a 15+ minute recharge.  I'm not sure how i'd feel about that, as i'm not level enough for Q by a ways still.<br />
<br />
I dont think you CAN fix it, as a spell, and as an AA it seems...unimpressive of an idea because of the recharge it would have to have.  <br />

Raketh, could you please re-post your concerns for a Group Q in the Proposal Thread stickied at the top of the forums?<br />
<br />
Just trying to do a little clean up :)<br />
