<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ROAR, first shaman to solo lodizal on my server, first one to try as well.  took me 40+ minutues since i forgot to make a pet *smack myself on forhead repeatidly* and only damage i had was epic and 2 bane of nifes plus my weak piercing.  But dizzam was fun. and the whole guild was surprised i could acutaly do it, shows what they know abotu shamans!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>fandain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nice going, would love to try lodi, but i know for sure i will be ks'd, so my question..was the zone empty? did nobody try? was your guild guarding u?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
Congratulations!  Don't think this would be very feasible on many servers due to kill-steals, but nice job!!<br />
<br />
btw, just curious really...<br />
Why is the Shield of Falsehood in your Magelo?<br />
Everything else in your bags made sense to me.<br />
Oh, and I'm very jealous of some of your gear! :p<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always wonder tho if<br />
<br />
/petition I am going and solo Lodizal for the first time on this server if you want to come watch.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hehe i first need to /bonk myself again for leaving faithfull Loner out of the picture.  As for being able to kill him without being KSed, i play on Firiona Vie server (the RP one) which is about as popular as crowded as the PvP ones.  When i got there a guild tried to KS me as i was buffing up, a tad bit annoying but theyall bit the dust trying to pull him.... so i took over.  It ended up with like 20+ people watching me but all i could see was a turtle anywayz.    And for all you inquiring minds, he droped 2x arch lich POTG, ice spear of the soloisist, shield, map, boots, ring.  gave ice spear to a guildy who needed, kept map for myself and gave shield boots and ring to a few good friends, gonna try and sell the spells cause some PP is nice :)<br />
<br />
*summons Loner and never lets him leave his side*<br />
<br />
and i just been to lazy to take shield of falsehood out of bags.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:  grr why cant i get sig to show up now /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Your sig isn't showing up because you've already posted once on the thread.  If you post more than once, the sig won't be posted again.<br />
<br />
Congrats on the solo kill that is definitely something to be proud of despite what you say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wooo!   Gratz!   I'm looking forward to the day I solo that bastage :)<br />

<br />
But its very fitting that the person i'd consider the best shaman on the server to be the first to solo lodi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Snearmt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">WTG ...can I ask if you have Malo? or Can you cast on Lodi with out it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">grats :)<br />
<br />
I know i would be KS'd if i tried to solo lodi, even though at my current level id die in like 3 strong hits :)<br />
<br />
When im 60 though, and have torpor and all, i wouldnt be able to solo him, cause guilds flock to the zone whenever he spawns and take him down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Gratz! I tanked him for a group of friends a while back while they killed (I just tanked, had an ench that had a cougar dired, hahahaha, wiz, and druid nuking it down), and he seems like he wouldnt be that hard...just gotta keep it slowed and doing dmg, lots of hps but he misses quite a bit.  I want to try him one day myself, would be nice to be able to upgrade my best solo from Emp Chottal.  Again, GRATZ!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Congrats!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I lead with malo then malosini followed my turgurs, rinse repeat.  And when i was 59 was helpign a group kill lodi, with no chanter, i think i bounced about 10 malosini's till it landed then landed slow on 3rd try so i wouldnot wanna try without malo.   unless u feel like slow kiting till it lands.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Very well done!<br />
<br />
Anyone have a link to the thread where Nixx first soloed Yeldema (if it even exists any more) and the thread where someone posted a log of them soloing Lodi?</div></div><hr />
