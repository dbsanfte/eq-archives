<br />
<br />
What ones have the best procs?<br />
<br />
Where do we farm these? <br />
<br />
And are they worth the effort...compared to using fine steel?<br />
<br />

Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The best place to farm weapons for pet is in the bazaar.  I don't want to sound sarcastic, but it is really convienent.  You can get velium procing weapons reallly cheap, well under 100pp each.  I just do a search for either 1hs, 1hp, 1hb from 0 to 100 pp.  You can usually find plenty of neat little procs.  As far as what procs are the best, stun procs of course are great against casters, snare procs against mobs that flee and damage proc (like velium) for dps.<br />
<br />
Some examples are gnoll hide lariat and serrated bone dirk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I personally buy rusty daggers from the fisherman NPC in PoK. they cost only a few silver and are lightweight. <br />
<br />
However once I get my level 61 pet, I plan on changing this. The level 61+ mage summon weapons are very very nice, but from what I have observed the shaman pet does NOT adaquate levels to trigger the proccing DD's even at the 55 pet. However at 61, considering how the pet becomes a level 58 warrior, I am assuming the procs will trigger, which will really really increase DPS.<br />
<br />
on my server Mage summoned weapons run about 10pp each and girdles cost about 20pp. Thats 40pp to make your pet dual wield, proc 120 DD's (and I believe some have stun component) and have +600 hitpoints. Not too bad for the price of a KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skitzoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Farm the tizmak caves in GD for velium weapons. So easy. Just run around in there until you see one with a weapon in his hand and take him out. A good majority of them carry weapons.  I usually go there every other day and get a bag or two of weapons, Takes 10 mins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just buy rusty weapons from one of the everfrost vendors by the halas ramp, she never runs out, they are cheap and light and cost only silvers each.  <br />
  Everytime I've ever put any sort of proccing weapons (or my last set of rusty weapons) on ol dog I'm nearly guarenteed to go LD and waste my money and sanity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bhone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ikkies or those with faction can buy 1hs weapons for 3g from vendors in field of bone and other newbie zones.<br />
<br />
with a spiritstone, i just hop over there when i need to dump loot, sell to newbie vendors, and restock a bag of weapons.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My favorite weapons at the bazaar are gnoll hide lariats which proc stun and serraded bone dirks which proc engulfing darkness. Prices range anywhere from 5-200pp depending on the seller. Not easy to find peeps selling them, lucky to find 1-2 of them a night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i slaughter the coldain in GD...they tend to drop a toon of velium procing stuff...besides who cares about dwarf faction!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the new mage summone weapons are unreal... 13/20 with 150 pt procs that are great for interrupting casters.<br />
<br />
If you are using a lower level pet, get the fist of ixiblat -it procs at a much lower level than the  blades do.<br />
<br />
Other than those, my preference is velium weapons.  I can swing thru eastern wastes, or thurgadin and pick up a bag full in a few minutes killing.<br />
<br />
The more specialized weapons like gnoll lariats are nice, but too much work for a regular supply.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use the 61+ Mage summoned weapons a lot with the 61 pet when soloing in PoG.  I like to let the dog tank, and I notice he can hold agro much better with these proc weapons.  I can malo, slow, annul the mobs DS, lay on Bane several times, and hit a few JBB blasts and the pooch still keeps agro if I am careful.  I use Mortal Deftness and HoS, rather than focus, on the pooch to help the procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">While working on my Stoicism quest I picked up about 4 bags of crappy weapons (nearly every mob in the area drops a junk weapon of some sort). Those will keep my puppy armed for quite a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A lot of good ideas here on sources of non-proccing weapons.  I am still using up the stuff I picked up while doing the stoicism and Bolld of Nadox quests.<br />
<br />
I am always poor - I don't even like to spend plat on KEI LOL!  I don't like to pay any extra for proccing wepons, because I rarely solo in  asituation where they will help that much.  The main adavantage is the dual wield, and even rusty's will get you that benefit.<br />
<br />
If you have the cash, and a pack full of stat food, then buying proc weapons makes sense, it certainly does add to the dps from the dog.  just not nearly as much as the first step up from the dual wield.  I still sell FS (and the equivalents), but I hang on to anything with a proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Vendors in shadowhaven have a nice supply of spiny daggers n such.  A couple silver each is nice, just to make it DW, for procing weapons you can't beat mage summons.  Though gnoll hide lariats are great when ya need stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">99% of the timethat I arm doggie, I just pick up weapons from where I'm fighting, if solo, or make the mage take care of it when grouped.  I only bring my own Alpha set when doing special things like camping Emp in Seb solo.  For that in particular, I pack along Serrated Bone Dirks, give dogdog two to go with his FoS, to be sure of procs.  Having him leave the fight area is really worth stopping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Has anyone tried giving dogdog a pair of Yak's??? <br />
<br />
I love giving my dog yaks. I had a nice collection of them from all the time I spent killing frogs for my wood elf illusion hat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Don't forget,those crappy ranger yaks that you can't sell pup pup will use, haven't checked to see if he'll proc'em, but 99% sure he will.<br />
<br />
p.s. forgot to ask, has anyone checked to see if he'll use an adamitite bo stick?  nice proc on that, and npc aoe's don't hit the npc I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">To be honest i'll give dodog a weapon if i loot it of the corspe of something i'm killing and its not worth much but otherwise i don't bother anymore. Why you ask? Only 15% damage increase (i may be wrong so correct me if i am)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hmm, 15% damage increase over the course of a day equals some nice XP.  Two rusty daggers here please.<br />
<br />
Imp Damage Focus = ~15% damage increase<br />
Mana Preservation = ~10% mana reduction (which can be used for more damage)<br />
These are both highly sought after, ID especially for the &quot;only&quot; 15% damage increase.<br />
<br />
ONLY a 15% damage increase?  /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'll buy two mage weapons - and a belt, and a muzzle - if I'm going somewhere particularly nasty.<br />
<br />
Otherwise it's generally chill daggers, which are very common on velious vendors.  Why use two weapons when one will do?  Bag space is limited after all.  :)<br />
<br />
Shields of the Slain Unicorn would work quite nicely as well, I'm sure, but are lore.  Can't think of any other common and cheap secondary only weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I always try to get 2 pet kits.  The 55 dogdog will proc the &quot;fist's of Ixiblat&quot; (spelling?).  Add the muzzle and belt or girdle and he's set.  I've sicked rover on a yellow hunter in maidens sat back tossed the occasional dot on it, healed rover and ended up about 20m at the end of the fight.  Stoicism for heals on rover.  I'm 55 so I'm guess Hunter to be 56 since he's yellow.  Not bad for a pet that's light blue to me.  That is an unbeffed pet to boot, not even alacrity or spirit quickening.  The first time i did it was ready to log and sent him in Kamikaze just to see what would happen, when i realized he wasn't doing to bad I sat it out and started healing him!  Got 1% xp from that.   :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Wooden practice daggers are sold by a vendor in shar vahl, take the pok stone there and once you get in to the 'town' part make a right &amp; the vendor's right there.  They're like 1 sp and won't weigh you down.  Always an option if you can't find any merchants with rusties.  I didn't find this guy, someone in crucible channel pointed it out (forget who, sorry).<br />
<br />
15% damage increase?  I can only guesstimate based on what I experience but I'd say more like 50%.  The difference between alpha and non-alpha'd dog is a big one.  One night farming seb, I was particularly tired and must have /pet health'd 10 times, thinking I'd forgotten to haste puppy, turned out I hadn't alpha'd him.  Its a very noticeable difference.</div></div><hr />
