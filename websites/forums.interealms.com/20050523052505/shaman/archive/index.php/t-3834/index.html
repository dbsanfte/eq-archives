<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya there!<br />
Well, I've been away for about a year, and coming back now. Anyhoo, to start with I decided to duel my buddy -- his 50 paladin vs my 51 shaman. The last time I was in EQ, it would have been a silly duel -- he'd have no chances after being slowed and I'd be regenerating. I remember actually fighting a warrior before, without using dots or nukes (warrior lost).<br />
But somehow my buddy is feeling very confident in himself :) Is there something I'm missing? Did PvP strategies change much in the last year? My plan was to buff my MR, regen (and rage), haste, togor (or turgur) him, drop ebolt and melee. <br />
Any suggestions/corrections?<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He can cure slow, disease, and poison.  He can also dispell.<br />
<br />
If he doesn't suck, he'll just remove ill effects and then heal himself.  He has greater heal at that level, doesn't he?<br />
<br />
I dueled a level 52 paladin when I was 53.  He sucked, though.  I just slowed him, dotted him, and JBBed him.  He was too clueless to remove the effects.  The only thing that made the fight hard was him using freaking LOH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The reason he is feeling confident is probably that melee weapons with very good pvp ratios are easy to come by. For example, Strength of grodan, 41/50 (i think).  Paladins have also seen a boost in general melee power using 2handers and gotten new heal over time spells as well as cure disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have both a shaman and a pally... Paladins DO have cures, but they are horrible. He can try all day, but I doubt he has the mana to cure your disease (I tried curing ID once from someone... after 20-25 casts he still had it on)<br />
<br />
If he is smart, he can have potions/pumice.... if he remains defensive, and jousts occasionally you are in for a tough fight. (This is assuming he knows what he is doing, coming from a pvp server, most everyone carries pumice, etc)<br />
<br />
Your best bet is to use disease on him, and keep him busy with your pet. Never underestimate that silly mutt in pvp =) They are not great, but if you ignore them, they do tend to become a pain. If his resists are low, of course... EB is a wonderful thing in PVP, especially since I believe they just removed the movement nerf on DoTs.... can anyone confirm that? I swear I read it somewhere....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pally's can be nasty in PvP. I attacked a Pally with my mage on a PvP server once and had the pally almost dead when he hit that freaking LoH hot button before my nuke cast. IMO that is more annoying in PvP than Harm Touch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Mages are one of the worst pvp classes there are.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah, why do all the bluebies comment so much...<br />
<br />
As for mages being bad pvpers, you are smoking crack.  They own in pvp.  While they don't have lure spells, fast casting DD's and epic pet to distract own.<br />
<br />
As for why you pally friend is so confident, with all the changes in the game, shamans have kind of lost their edge in pvp.  More of a support class at the end game pvp.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
1) Cheap resist gear:  Even with malo and me tashing them with jstick, it is hard to land spells on anyone.  At 51 level, I am not sure what I would do as you don't even have malo.<br />
<br />
2) Better cheaper weapons:  2H weapons own for pvp and as someone mentioned, they are a lot cheaper for uber one.<br />
<br />
Recommend you check out his MR.  If he is smart he has MR buffed to hell.  If he doesn't have high resists, then you can own him.  But if he does, ruh roh.</div></div><hr />
