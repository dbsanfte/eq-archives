<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Micheall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We have several clerics in need of the drop from Chardok, and I'm trying to get some information on how to best approach this raid, never having done it before.  Any clues, ideas, recommended force, strategy, and OMG don't do's you folks want to share?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Firion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't lead this raid, but I've been on it a few times.  Some basic general info:  Three groups of 55+ should be sufficient.  I wouldn't recommend trying to compensate for levels by adding numbers, the coordination required and the difficulty of managing multiple targets with a larger group get a bit hairy.  A rogue is a necessity, as is a FD puller.  Two FD pullers who can work as a tag team can be very effective in some of the tight spots.<br />
<br />
Stay together, don't straggle.  The respawn rate in the royals area is pretty rapid, you need to keep moving and stay ahead of it.  The worst wipeout I ever saw was when half our raid was through the locked door and the library respawned on the other half.  I don't remember any of the mobs being awfully tough individually, the trick is to avoid getting swarmed.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cleared down him in 1 hour the other day with 12 people<br />
<br />
bring a really solid enchanter, and you can AE most of the way down.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't see pulling the castle area w/o a monk, try to take the mobs in chucks of 5-6, worked really well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've lead this raid quite a few times and basically you guys have it right.<br />
<br />
1 Rogue is a must for the locked doors. You can either aoe it (2 chanters and some aoe folks needed) or have a monk pull it. AOE goes alot faster. 18-24 folks is ideal. More really aren't needed and less can be fun.<br />
<br />
Use tanks to keep the golems busy if you are aoeing. They resist alot. Or at least they did at 60. perhaps 61+ chanters can stun them. <br />
<br />
When you head towards the king room, make sure everyone has lev and stays to the LEFT so they don't fall into the King room. <br />
<br />
We tended to just try and single out the king room and then get lazy and aoe it. The king isn't very rough, minor fire aoe. He can gate if I recall, so be ready to go to his spawn point if he dies.<br />
<br />
The queen is tough, but since they tuned her fire aoe she isn't as bad as she once yet. In both cases the mobs have probably between 15 and 21k hitpoints max.<br />
<br />
Alternatively cheat and pay a mage who is nonkos to COTH the entire raid down to the semi safe area before the king. Then go wack him and port out. 15min tops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lauranthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also when heading towards the king room try to go one group at a time, single file. It helps avoid crowding on the way in which can lead to people falling.<br />
<br />
Also, shrink everyone who is not already short. Things get tight in there with 3 groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TheRiov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen this done in 15 minutes with a good AE team.  (24 people, 7 druids, 5 clerics, 3 enchanters 4 wizards ) Enchanter pulls 20 mobs and begin AE Stunning. Wizards Supernova. Druids and clerics cast Upheaval.  Repeat.</div></div><hr />
