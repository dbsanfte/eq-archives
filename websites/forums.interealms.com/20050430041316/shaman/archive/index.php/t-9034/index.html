<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This place blows Dreadlands away once you reach lvl 44 for soloing and duoing (grouping too I would imagine, but you'd better bring your own - I've never found enough people already there).<br />
<br />
Tackle the hornets in the SW corner of the zone. It takes a while to find a good pulling spot with all the trees and wandering mobs but it's very worth it.<br />
<br />
If you're soloing, avoid the ember and Solarae (sp) hornets. They have a LOT of HPs. Duoing they aren't bad at all if your partner is a damage dealer like a monk or a ranger.<br />
<br />
To compare the exp in this zone, last night I duoed in both DL and BW with a 50 monk, me at 47. The only visual bump I received in DL was when we killed a Ravishing or a Steep. In BW, every blue kill was like killing a ravishing and a steep or better.<br />
<br />
It takes longer between pulls, but since you get so much more exp, it's worth the wait.<br />
<br />
Enjoy.<br />
<br />
[edit] forgot to mention loot. The loot is exactly like DL - minus the crap that drops that sells for only silver.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was soloing in DL tonight at level 45 with a fungi and C3.  It is taking me almost one and a half hours to get one yellow compared to one yellow every 45 minutes in OT when i was level 43.<br />
<br />
I will give BW a try tomorrow night and see how it compares to DL.  I don't think it can get any worse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>t0ad5</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the xps is also good at the giant fort closer to the sky fire zone.   i didn't go there till 48 and at 49 one type of giant became light blue now and again.  if you go there watch the ancients as they are a tougher fight but they have a chance to drop some spells.  in about 2 hrs with an sk i got about 500 plat(from selling items ect), 2 gold, and 1 spell (splurt).  not bad<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I checked out this spot just about an hour ago. The bees are fairly good exp (1% per kill at 44) and are pretty weak, hitpoints wise. However, like the original poster said, the Solariea or however you spell them bugs are mean bastards. They have crazy amounts of HP and hit for about 100 on average (Usually between 90-110) If one of these resists your slow or outlives your slow duration (what it did to me) it starts pumping out damage like nothing else.<br />
<br />
Avoid them.<br />
<br />
However even though the exp was good I'm not sure I'm going to return. It's kind of tedious running there and back for KEI's, or selling loot. If I'm going to run that distance I'll probably just head to a place which has faster spawns and weaker mobs, Bloodgill gobbys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the scorae hornets do hit hard but they do have chances for spell drops! (rare, I admit) but they do occasionally drop spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes I was hunting the hornets in the SW corner of BW and one dropped a druid spell. Cricle of Winter or Circle of Summer, I gave it to my drOOd friend. We had been there for about 2 hours before it dropped.<br />
