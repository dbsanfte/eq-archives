I doubt very much it will be one point, but will it double each time (1,2,4 etc., that seems a bit excessive) or will it do something like 1,2,3 etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am also wondering what the arguement will be about AA vs leveling is 65&gt;all AA as before?  Me stuck in middle of Arch will be well into class by the release will have an interesting delima.  Get 65 first or EQ, AM etc which are soo valuable.  Or will lvl 65 be greater than all?  I kinda hope they might force you to be Hunter or something like that before even leveling to 65 so maybe it will force you to progress through some AA before leveling to 65.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valencia</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm also wondering about a couple of things.<br />
<br />
It appears as though some of these abilities will have AA prerequisites:  for example, Fury of the Ages will require Combat Fury and Coup de Grace will require Finishing Blow.  But how many levels of the prerequisites are needed, if any?  I can see this as a HUGE time sink...<br />
<br />
Also, will doing AA at level 65 be much more time efficient than doing it at level 60, given that the amount of XP per kill will typically be greater at level 65?<br />
<br />
I'm not really looking forward to putting my EQ/AM3 pursuits on the back burner while I feel the pressure to level to 65 with everyone else...</div></div><hr />
