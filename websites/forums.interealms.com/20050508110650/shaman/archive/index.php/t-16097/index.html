<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it me or is the in-game 2hb animation jacked?  It looks like my Shammy (and Pally btw) is trying to stab the mob with his big two-handed hammer.  Retarded.  It has been this way forever and really takes away from the fun of having a big hammer to flatten the mobs with.  Instead of this silly 2hp animation I wish they would finally fix it and make it like the 2hs one.  Is this really so hard.  Heck, the character selection screen shows the correct 2-handed overhead motion.  Is it that difficult to but this animation in the game?  Just one of the little things that really should just be corrected.<br />
<br />
My 2 cents<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I remember reading right Sony tried to fix the animations and screwed some of them up so they repatched...  Don't remember what they did as I wasn't playing and didn't get to see them...  Someone on here can probably explain it better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">2hb has been jacked since day 1 of new models - lot's of bitches about it on Monkly-business. Many have suggested just switching to the 2hs animation - at least that would look like you are whomping something.</div></div><hr />
