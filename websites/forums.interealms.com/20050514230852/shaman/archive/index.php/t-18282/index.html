<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I have a question for the math wizzie's in here.  How exactly do you calculate DPS, and add other factor's into it?  Are you simply using the parsing programs out there, or is there an actual &quot;lamens&quot; equation that I can use, plugging in variables as needed.  I did a search, but couldn't really find anything that I could follow.  I am sure that I am not the only one out there who wants to know this, and I really think it could help my game play out.  I want to do anything I can to be able to get the best play out of my shaman as I can.  Thanks in advance!<br />

Use a parser though, it is really the only way to be accurate.</div></div><hr />

and, of course, don't forget to take into account that a CHA buffed shaman slows time itself! :D</div></div><hr />
