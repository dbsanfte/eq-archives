<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First, before I toss this out there, I fully understand the situation that face shaman who are maxed out so to speak..And Im not making light of it..But here goes anyways.<br />
<br />
     The Uber toons are all screaming about how there is no challenge except for GoD, but God is too hard..This doesnt work, and that doesnt work, and we want more....WEll, here is you solution.. Once youve got all your flags, all your Time raid gear, all your AA's, and youve become bored with your uber guild...You should be given the title of Demi God and given your own pocket universe in the game.. A mini plane so to speak..Where when you log on, us low toons have the option of getting our peeps togethor and raiding you... <br />
<br />
     Look I know its bad out there..But hey, there are other games and many more ways to amuse yourself..  Sooner or later everything ends...Nothing is worse then having to sit and listen to someone cry in they're beer over and over again about the &quot;good ole days.&quot;  When I stop having fun in EQ, I will move on to something else..And Ive spent a few years getting to where I am....No game will ever be worth getting my blood pressure spun up..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL I actually like this idea...roflmao<br />
<br />
There would have to be some reward there to make newbs come up to yer plane. You could act like protector of the treasure. Too funny. You could yell out zone wide oaths and summon people...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bingo, it would give you something to do..You could even have other Demi Gods band togethor to protect your loot or what ever..Id be a refreshing change to the doldrum of past Uber life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Demi God Shavedman, Sweet..<br />
<br />
Who would want to raid me though?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You know, this is such a fun idea. Perhaps for the added cost of 10 bucks a month ( cover server cost ) your plane would share a CPU with a few others. In your plane you powers are amplified greatly to make you strong enough for a raid and you get to control the fight, meaning they really raid you. You can pick to dismantle the clerics or beat down a melee other then the MA, or chase the chanters around the zone zapping them with ice nukes cause one of them mezzed a puppy.<br />
<br />
My god, this is about the most fun idea ever in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, I've thought about this before and think its a great idea hehe.<br />
<br />
In the same way that Daoc evolved to PvP at the high end, an alternate path to pve for everquest could be pvp at the raid level.<br />
<br />
There are tons of raid mobs that when people die, or at certain times, they spawn adds.  Well, just think of your group of god-like friends all being given charter to guard a certain area.  When that area is attacked, if you click &quot;fight for you home plane?&quot;  you get teleported to defend your realm.  Others in your god-circle can come too, so the encounter becomes multiple people versus multiple people.<br />
<br />
I had also thought about epic level quests that give you powers.  After you get enough of these powers (which are only activated when &quot;defending your home plane&quot;) you become a demi god. <br />
<br />
So, you can play normally, raid, level, whatever, but when you reach demi god status through quests, and you are called upon to defend your realm, your god abilities activate and you can AE dmg, or proc slow, any number of things that normal mobs have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, I went ld in the arena once and went berzek almost killing a Rogue and a ranger... does that count ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fun idea, but isn't this what GMs were supposed to be?  Anyway, you could never be beaten.  At least I would hope not; players would be smart enough to attack the heal-chain first, right?  I mean, as tempting as the warrior tank might be...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can only kill one of each class every 20 seconds. So 5 clerics would merit at least one minute of &quot;survivability&quot;. Also, you can't move out of a certain circleish area, but you can summon. So no long range plinker arrows from the rangers with 10000000 range, but you can't just run around avoiding everyone waiting on the 20 second timer to reset so you can go splat a cleric.<br />
<br />
Spells cast on you are 2/3 damage, and weapon damage is nearly 1/3 its norm from the front. They'd have to balance their force on all sides, and you would also have to circle some find that certain high DPS class behind you/on your side, so everyone stays active.<br />
<br />
Only 2 AEs, one being a bigtime debuff-only type of deal, and another being a somewhat annoying debuff, and either a medium DD or a rather nasty DoT, the longer the time the more the DoT damage scales up. Also, the DoT can be spread over both mana and health, but must keep a 2:1 health to mana drained ratio.<br />
<br />
You can have 1 single target &quot;DT&quot;, but it can't outright kill the target, and at most the single DD, if so chosen, should be capped at 65% of the targets health. Time it right + a high damage quad and suddenly they're looking for a new MT. Time it wrong and a CH remedies the situation np.<br />
<br />
Once you target someone, the longer you keep them targeted the more damage you do. So after 5 seconds you'd have 100 damage added to your max FOR THE REST OF THE FIGHT. After 25 seconds it would be 230, 45 would be 375 damage, etc. However, if you change your current target to, say, go off a cleric, you'd end up having to rerun through the 45 original seconds to resume where you left off at a 315 damage bonus.<br />
<br />
Just rambling, maybe I'll add more later. Bring flames plz++.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Now this sounds fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">sounds liek the dnd dieties supplements for first edition, VERY FUN, but after a while of sitting there nd having people talk smack to you, you kinda get bored of the whole &quot;give meh ubah lewtz bish !!one!!won11!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
but !<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i hear this is what CoH is like ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well i like the idea but, if i was a mob the first thing ill do is to kill the CH chain, not all just a few just enough to break the chain, then ill eat the Tank chain and fast, so it should be somthing like you are only able to summon the first 10 people on you hatelist.<br />
here is the spell set i would like to mem:<br />
AE debuff (neg 400 check)<br />
AE rain 3x675 (neg 400 check)<br />
AE FD (just for giggles)<br />
Summon<br />
single target -800 hate<br />
single target 3500 DD<br />
AA pets<br />
<br />
Best idea i have seen in EQ in a log time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Uber toons are all screaming about how there is no challenge except for GoD, but God is too hard.<br />
Actually &quot;the Uber toons&quot; are screaming about GoD is horribly onesided, blatantly favoring a select few classes, ignoring some and beating a few into the ground with Thor's own hammer.<br />
<br />
I like hard. I love a good challenge. I do not mind dying twenty times in a single evening while trying to find a strategy that works. What I hate about GoD is how the entire expansion is ten times harder for me then it is for say, a cleric.<br />
<br />
That being said I would love to see a Murtak NPC being raided by some other guild :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ancagalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If the demi god player was not targeting the MA, then there is no reason for a CHeal chain to exist. <br />
<br />
Think of the tactics other players would have to use to win, it would be incredible. <br />
<br />
Range and positioning would become the critical factor to beating a demi god player. Send in the melee, knowing that the demi god player will be targeting the healers first. Use snare/root/stuns to prevent the demi god player from getting within range of your healers. Or creating a player wall of tanks. Healers constantly trying to stay out of range of the demi god player, but having to move in range as needed to heal others. <br />
<br />
I could see having a healing group in the &quot;hot zone&quot;, in range to heal, and in range of the demi go player so the demi god player trying to kill that healing team. To prevent this, a back-up healing team out of range of the demi god player to keep the primary healing team standing. <br />
<br />
Damn, that would be fun!<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

OK.  I'll throw in some flasks of water, spiderling silk and HQ pelt.<br />

<br />
Sure sounds as if you're making light of it to me.  How do you fully understand a situation you have no experience with?  I figure becasue you know so much about the game - no, that's not right either, after all you're the guy who just asked if CHA helps something on a shaman :D<br />
<br />
I find this game to be a drag in many ways now, but I have 4 years of attachment to this char and many, many hours of time in this game and character.  Sorry if I find it difficult to leave and that I'd rather complain in the hopes that Sony listens to its customers.  OK, I'm not sorry about that, but I am sorry I have to take a bunch of guff from some young shaman (who has been on this forum less than 2 weeks and who has no idea what our problems are!) about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Any PC Shaman Demi-God better get some serious upgrades, otherwise you will be a solo-mob level 50 Bards...LOL.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Minsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">... I have to take a bunch of guff from some young shaman (who has been on this forum less than 2 weeks and who has no idea what our problems are!) about it.<br />
<br />
You need to chill.  The guy was just offering solution/idea for crying out loud.  And just because someone is registered later than you doesn't necessarily mean they have no idea what they are talking about.  Stop basing people's knowledge on the date they are registered on a board.<br />
<br />
I've  been playing a shaman for 5 yrs and been reading this board since it started, just didnt feel like registering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thanks Minsh, I appreciate the support.  As for experience Megara, I have a 62 Barbwarrior Ive been playing for two years, a 58 Rogue Ive run for the past year and a half and now my Shaman.. Just because someone doesnt know everything about a particular class doesnt mean that they are new to the game.. Everyone has questions.  Also, not having the same difficulties as you doesnt mean that I dont understand them.  You seem to be caught up in your own misery and thats sad... Really sad. And to base your opinion on how long a person has been the member of a board says a lot about your charactor.  I have a firm understanding on how the game works, and like many others hope that the game devs fix the problems that are associated with many of the classes.. Im all for people voicing theyre frustrations, but point blank criticisim like yours does absolutely nothing for anyone, except maybe yourself.  So, in closeing, I am not making fun or light of the End Game shaman issues, I DO understand the problems they are having, and I WILL continue to offer a lighthearted idea now and then to change things up and make people laugh...  To you I add this, Get over yourself, your not alone in your woes, your not the only one who has a firm grasp on whats wrong with the class..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">sorry about the side track but back to the Demi Gods status.. As lord of your own pocket plane, you should get a few henchmen..Something interesting and suited to your class.. What sort of henchmen would you want to have?  Personally I like the Snow Griffens or the those nasty little buggers from fear that shadow step you away from your party...Id have a bunch of them running amok and teleporting you right to my feet so I could smack you around a bit..Maybe do a Cazic Thule and start calling out the names of toons from accross the zone and DTing..Not every thirty seconds mind you but maybe like every 3 minutes I can pick a name and give em to boot... The possibilities would be awsome...Sony could give you some really cool loot to drop but loot that you couldnt take out from the zone and couldnt give away to your buddies..  Hell, Id make my zone be increddibly foggy where I could see clearly but incomming toons would be limited to degree on how far they could see..I think it would be an awsome addition and a lot of fun..You could talk smack to the toons trying to take you out, pick your own zone music and such..</div></div><hr />
