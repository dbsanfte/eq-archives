<br />
I have been hearing about these things called soul marks for awhile (mostly in conjunction with GM's)<br />
.. and now with PoP comming live I am hearing more about these....<br />
<br />
What are they, and what do they have to do with GM's.. or even the Planes of Power?<br />
<br />
I'm Tunare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arbok of Xegony</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aka Character Flags.   Instead of carrying around stupid little keys around, or items to prove that you've completed a quest.   You've got these soul marks, that are with you.   Certain NPC's will only respond to you when you have completed certain quests etc etc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jezekiell</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye but in connection with GMs they arent good. Soul marks is as far as I know, one you get if you have done something really bad, to the extent of getting a soul mark on your character permanently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwindor</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, a pally in my group got a soul mark from a gm the other day for cussing out a group who was messing with our camp. He didn't elaborate on what this meant (nor did I push him on the topic) but he didn't seem happy about it =(<br />
Shame is that the other group was really the deserving party for disciplinary action. It's a shame that using &quot;dirty language&quot; (whatever that means, I use whatever language I want and it never makes me feel dirty or wrong) is considered more harmful than not playing nice with others. A group can come in and train you, KS you, rape your corpses and the only thing the GM is gonna look at is the /report of you (finally exasperated) screaming obscenities in /say at your tormentors. Irony at it's finest.</div></div><hr />

I am not totally sure, but I seem to recall that it's the traditional &quot;3 strikes, you're out&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
The new thing in Planes of Power are usually referred to as &quot;character flags&quot;  and just act sort of like the new key ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep soulmark usually means you got a perm gm ****list on record for your character, tho you can also get good ones as stated above. Guildie got one for being nice in a RF dispute before she was with us.</div></div><hr />
