<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I have stated before I have made a post with the feedback of the community regarding our 67pet and his inability to DW inaitely . This was sent to the proper dev's last week ... No responce on this yet to me . <br />
<br />
As I have stated before I also compiled a list of feedback regarding the Ancestral Aid AA and some anoying stacking Issues with it . This list was also sent on to the Dev's last week ... No responce on this to me yet .<br />
<br />
As for &quot;New Items&quot; after reading through a few posts , I compiled a list of feedback regarding our Sprit/Talisman of Sence/Might and some rather anoying stacking issues with them . &quot;Not stacking with Champion and being overwrighten by various melee disc's&quot; .<br />
I submited this list to Kytheria and she has assured me that it has been passed along .<br />
<br />
This is the current status of my activity . Please rest asured that I will continue to raise these issues at anytime I can do so in the hopes of prompting a responce .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thx for the update Grimbear, much appreciated.  Will be a long and slow process, but I'm sure you'll get some results.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just pass the info back (and, when possible, forth) like this and don't invest so much into it that it frustrates you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the update Grimbear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kudos for the excellent job of focusing on the &quot;bug fix&quot; type issues and bringing them to bear. I'd rather focus on getting little things like this ironed out first.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It seems all other casters get upgrades to their critical core spells in OoW over the GoD ones, but we do not get a Nihil-comparable slow spell.  We should get one in the 66 to 68 level range the same as the other casters.  They could add another spell to the curent list or convert something like Ancestral Bulwark into the nihil-type slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks Grim. This is exactly one-half of what has been missing for these past 11 months--communication regarding what issues the developers have been made aware. The other half--an actual response, is out of your hands. Thanks for increasing communication from 0% to 50%.</div></div><hr />

LOL, took them 6 expansions and 13 levels to upgrade Turgurs, what makes you think they will EVER put out an upgrade to Nihil. I think Nihil is the end of the line for the 75% slow spells, honestly. I suppose they could make a new one with a 2.0 second cast, and a -80 MR check, and a 120 second duration or something, but I doubt it. No need.</div></div><hr />

I agree with everything but the &quot;no need&quot;. Nihil with -80 would be very handy.</div></div><hr />

They also screwed up level 3 of it: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5935&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
It has +30 to STR, when levels I and II have +30, +60 to STR respectively.  It probably doesn't make a difference anyway, unless they fixed how STR affects melee.  It's still a careless oversight which has become routine for them; like the OOW spell duration foci not affecting most DoTs and all HoTs.</div></div><hr />
