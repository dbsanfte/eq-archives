<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I didn't want to clutter the poll and general suggestion thread more, so i ask a question here.<br />
<br />
At the moment it seems, that a relative large chunk of shamans (the polls are still running of course) is in favor of heal updates - OK.<br />
<br />
What i see often tossed around is 'we want an update to Tnarg's Mending'?<br />
<br />
Why that?<br />
<br />
Yes, we maybe loosing distance to paladins regarding fast heals, but does it really is a big problem? With Q and Tnarg's i can cover most emergency situations quite well, that call for massive patch healing. But in my view the gap between druids and shaman in the 'big heal' department is much more of an issue.<br />
<br />
Who cares if paladins even get a few 100 HP more with their fast heal, when druids big heal power exceeds shamans for over 2.000 HP per 10 secs? (Renewal 4.680 HP versus Kragg's 1.950 HP + 300 - 600 HP for an active Q)<br />
<br />
So my question is do we ask for a 'fast heal or big heal'? An update for Tnarg's OR for Kragg's Mending?<br />
<br />
If we indeed ask for a look into fast heals, we can certainly forget about any main healer role comparable to druids in the future. There would be (for any content more challenging than LDoN normal adventures) TWO main healers left, clerics and druids.<br />
<br />
I am not necessarily opposed to ditching main healer role out of our class description, if we have enough other valid roles. We should just be aware, what consequences such developments could have (it's unlikely, that more expansions will come up with trivial LDoN mob types, that even a shaman can heal).<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">personally I would favor healing improvements in the heal over time and or mgb/group heals dept, followed by a tnargs (quick heal) update.<br />
<br />
Shaman is a dynamic class that has to do a lot of things at once (like regen mana!).  I think we are ill suited to long cast time heals like druids and clerics are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Torpor was such an important milestone spell for us, I would like to keep our strength in the Heal over time area. A bigger Q and a group Q would make me the happiest.<br />
<br />
10 second heals just aren't welcome in my spellbook.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">An upgrade to KM would be 100% worthless in the high-end raid situations where we need the most help.

<br />
These are the kind of things which should be tried out during betas ... unfortunately they seem to have sort of risk aversion to actually trying something new or different.<br />
<br />
Im sure Ciele is right about the during the beta thing but i always like to say to AL shaman, You are all Thott's bitches =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think shamans need one more heal.  The way I see it, for shamans, there are basically 3 &quot;lines&quot; of healing.<br />
<br />
Healing - 3 sec cast - first received at 19 (Healing), second received at 55 (Chloroblast).<br />
<br />
Greater Healing - 3.75 sec cast - first received at 29 (Greater Healing), second received at 62 (Tnarg's)<br />
<br />
Superior Healing - 4.5 sec cast - first received at 51 (Superior Healing), and we haven't gotten a second one yet.<br />
<br />
I think an upgrade to the Superior Healing line, something along the lines of 600 mana for 1750 healed (which matches the former best druid quick heal for amount healed, with 100 mana higher cost.  This would give a nice spot heal that keeps up with the times.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'd also like a slow upgrade, etc., etc. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Big heals take to long to cast, and I don't really want to be in the &quot;main healer&quot; role anymore. This keeps druids and clerics desireability high still.<br />
<br />
We just need better HoT's and fast heals. As a 2ndary healer we need to keep people and groups up until the real heals hit. <br />
<br />
Group healing be it AA or spell is something we should have. (no, regrow doesn't count) Druids, Clerics, Bst, necros, pali, all have some form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree<br />
<br />
Druids can sacrafice 10 seconds for a huge heal (I played a druid before my shaman...  snare, than all your MUST DO, duties are done.)  Shaman cannot.  The only benefit to being a large utility class is that you can adapt quickly.  10 seconds sucked out of a fight eliminates that benefit.<br />
<br />
I would like an upgrade to our quick heal, and would really like a group heal.  A significant addition to our heal over time would be lovely as well, but is third in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am in agreement with others that have posted here in the need for a new faster heal and a real upgrade to Q or possible a group HoT.<br />
<br />
The other idea I wanted to throw out was what about about a new group regen of 50-100 /tick or possible as an AA.  I just trying to figure in something that would make the shammy more distinct and have less conflicts with current spells.  If we were to get a HoT, upgraded Q, etc... I would image that the stacking issues would delay the release to shamans.<br />
<br />
I am not into the element planes and above so I am not sure wether this would just add to the current problem of our heals being the equvilant to pissing into vat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My 2c....I think an upgraded Q (maybe 400/tick) and have a group Q that can be mgb'd.<br />
<br />
With these 2 things I would be very happy.  Of course a better canny (along the lines of 50% better than canny 4) and an upgraded fast nuke would be nice also.  I'm shocked and amazed with the proposed disease dot - just when I thought Sony had their act together somewhat?? LOL.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>smaaltz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd prefer a fast heal.   Druids and Clerics reign supreme with their slow heals, let them.  Bumping Tnargs up to the 2k neighborhood to make it actually heal 1/3 of a tanks health would be nice, and doesn't strike me as particularly overpowering.  A fast heal goes along with our role of secondary healer in XP groups, and spot healer on raids. <br />
<br />
I'd also like to see either a group FA or group Q.  As there already exist a ton of MGBable heals..   I'd prefer it to be FA as it'd be more unique.  But if we actually get anything useful I'll be happy as a clam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't really understand the desire for an MGB'able Heal over Time. There's no need for it. Cleric's HoTs will be highly favorable as they last longer and are insta casting. Q and Cleric HoTs don't stack unlike Spirit of the Wood/Paragon.<br />
<br />
We are in dire need of an upgrade to Q. Q should have been what Supernal Elixier is, which makes me sad. There's no way in hell I'll accept a Q upgrade for less than 500(with the healing upgrades for other classes it should be 600+)! <br />
<br />
- Heals over Time don't stack, remember that. <br />
3 Shamans casting Q on one person will still heal 300 HP/tick.<br />
<br />
- Heals over Time require a buff slot <br />
<br />
- Heals over Time are dispellable<br />
<br />
- Heals over Time will not gain effectivness through focus effects(HP/second wise. Extending them doesn't raise the healing effectivness)<br />
<br />
With all the drawbacks, they need to frickin throw me a bone and give me a 600+ HoT to make it a support heal worth casting for my Tnarg's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CHs are affected by heal crits and improved healing, as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way that would be acceptable to me is if they made either the heal or the buffs innately MGB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Personally I'd like to see 3 things healing wise.<br />
<br />
1) an upgraded tnargs. I'd like to see something in the range of 2k healed base for 600ish hps with same cast time.  That would give a descent heal for patching and for healing some group situations. I don't want another CH limited wanna be heal. No crits, no focus, no Mana pres = the suck.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) AA group heal like Paragon/wood that stacks with CE/CR. It sucks not having any sort of group heal when every other healing class has group heals. Hell you could even argue that necros and sk's have group heals with thier group taps. It's about damm time we got one.<br />
<br />
3) I wouldn't mind a q upgrade as a single target spell. 500 hps a tick would seem obvious since that keeps us basically 1 step behind clerics for HoT's altho should keep the lower mana cost making them more efficient for us keeping that trend too. Say 500hps a tick for 275 mana.<br />
<br />
The first 2 I'd really like to see in that order and the 3rd would be nice but not as important to me since Q is already a very efficient heal for a HoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">CHs are affected by heal crits and improved healing, as far as I know.<br />
<br />
CH's for cleris are critable and are effected by healing aa's for clerics.<br />
<br />
Percent ch's for shaman druids are not critable but are effected by healing aa's.<br />
<br />
Neither is effected by imp healing focus, Mana pres focus or spell haste focus.<br />
<br />
So for shaman you've got a slow casting, capped only effected by 1 aa heal or a faster casting effected by all aa's/focus effects heal. I'll always go with the faster caster heal. Haven't even touched kraggs since I started getting healing aa's and focuses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd like to see a better spot heal, with a better mana to hp's cured ratio (I don't have MP4 yet). Cheals take to long, and I got better things to do than wait 10 seconds to heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">% heals blow. By the time you have an emelental mob malosed and slow, do you REALLY want to wait 10 seconds for the healing to start? A fairly efficient 2000 blast heal, 500ish HoT, and we are good. Some want a group queisence, some dont. I personally would like group q, but only if it doesnt come at the expense of much needed improvements in other areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think a fast heal I'd prefer... the 10 sec casting time heals stink unless they make it a 4k heal or the like (aka double our crappy ICH).<br />
<br />
AA ability to heal group would be nice too, or maybe more in shaman line, an AA group cannibalize &quot;Here, this is how you do it&quot; CHOMP.  Everyone loses 400 health and gains 250 mana (might be totally off on ratio).  5 min casting time.  It'd be a nice downtime thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would like to see a new Q that is useful ~450 or 500/tick lasting 4 ticks and costing 250 mana.  Id also like to see an upgraded tnargs thats something in the range of 2200 heal 550 mana 4 sec cast that removes 20 poison 20 disease and 6 curse counters.  No group heals or hots please, and no improved CH.  an upgraded Q with a quick heal that gives a little power would make us more than viable healers against the mobs which mitigate slow, which unfortunately everything does now :(.  Sometimes i only slow to negate haste effects on mobs, which is sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You can see a comparison of Kragg's and Tnarg's mending relative to the comparable spells of other priests here (http://www.afflictionguild.com/imagegallery.php?charactername=Gardeltron&amp;page=3).  Tnarg's actually stacks up very favorably compared to the other heals for fights of moderate duration (30-45 seconds).  Kragg's, on the other hand, is pretty useless unless mobs last a really long time.  I'd actually prefer an upgrade to both.  The idea behind Kraggs is nice, but to be helpful it needs to do at least another 1000hp of healing with the same duration and mana cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">No MGBable heals please.

<br />
The only way that would be acceptable to me is if they made either the heal or the buffs innately MGB.<br />
<br />
The idea behind mgb heals or something like an mgb avatar is to give the other 4 suckers with MGB and nothing to cast something useful to do during fights. <br />
<br />
Focus is our only spell worth mgb'n at all. Sta costs so little the only reason to mgb it would be because you want to be lazy or if your timing is bad and sta goes down midfight or something. Sta isn't even an issue for some guilds (still is for mine). <br />
<br />
Other then that you've got a lot of shaman sitting around with mgb up and nothing to do.<br />
<br />
Clerics have to spells that need to be mgb'd HoV and symbol. HoV with buff extensions will last an entire night. Symbol with buff extension will last more then mgb rate. So every cleric past 2 with MGB is free to cast MGB heals when/if needed. Same with druids except they only have one spell to MGB and then all the others can MGB wood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Gardeltron, <br />
<br />
/sigh i was really hopeing to finish reading this thread and not see thottbot graphs show up, i'm sorry but they have been shredded before,  iirc,  the graphs i saw you post are even more bias as they say for druid/cleric heals they assume the mob is unslowed,  the fact that its further biased by only the shaman lines being effected by mitigation, also the only time i've ever used our craptastic lvl 58 heal is between the levels of 58-60, post 60 i exped in pop, and i was lucky enough to have torpor at 60  that engine +chloro was better than the slow heal, and pop required second healer. (well at least until Q)  your pretty crayon drawings don't account for any caning, crit heals, aa's focus, altho non of the classes are counting those other factors.  Also, lets take tank hp's into account now i was never in highend luclin guild pre pop, but tanks had 8kish hps i'm guessing, or lets use it for numbers sake,  that means kraggs our biggest heal at the time may do 25% of a tanks hps,  now a days when you have 10k+ tanks it does less than 20% of a tanks hps, again of the high end guild varitey. how about mob dps,  pop mobs hit harder than any other exp mobs ever,  when you have mobs in ele plans that hit 700ish on hte low scale, at least doubling a 10 sec heal that heals 3 hits from a mob is a waste of time.<br />
<br />
as for mgbing heals we usually have 4+ shaman on a raid (ele level)  so one mgb's focus, the others just kinda waste 9 aa's,  however instead of a heal i'd like a cure overtime,  perhaps duration of 2 minish,  curing counters the whole time to help limit ae damage,  or maybe short duration high counter cure,  so it would be like casting blood of nadox over the entire raid.  while not being a heal would still be incredibly usefull</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;The mana costs for clerics and druids assume that the mob has not been slowed&quot; = &quot;This chart is a complete joke and mostly irrelevant to the game commonly called Everquest.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I guess that depends on how many shamans you have at most raids.  Sometimes we have a bunch, but often only 1 or 2.  I'd want more stackability via direct heals or direct damage before I'd be comfortable assuming that a raid will cart enough shamans along to have mgb heals be worthwhile and not a pain in the ass (and a once-per-mgb-refresh skill isn't a sufficient stackability enhancer).</div></div><hr />
