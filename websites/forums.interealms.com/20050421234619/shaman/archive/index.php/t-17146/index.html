<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rosedesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
We are looking for someplace to go to get good xp.  The kills in Dulak Harbor are pretty easy, but the xp is slowing down.  I am looking for suggestions on where to go hunt.  Money and good drops would be a plus.  Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks much,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Utah, sadly and can't wait to move??? I spent almost four years in Utah, loved every minute of it. Too much fun to be had there. <br />
<br />
You could try DSP at the hopper caves. Xp is good, the pelts are excellent cash as they are in high demand for tailors.<br />
<br />
Cobalt scar killing wyverns there is also good for a few more levels. Spells, gems, research items drop are pretty good. <br />
<br />
I haven't had a shot at COM since the revamp, the gazebo area might be fun for you.<br />
<br />
Might try the hole as well at the entrance. Drops are not that common, but you can get some nice stuff there, as well as more research components, random gems etc.<br />
<br />
Good luck to ya.<br />
<br />
Get out and enjoy Utah though, seriously, one of the best states for outdoor entertainment I have been to. Yes, I am well traveled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rosedesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the help.  We will go see what we can find.  I enjoy Utah, I just wanna go back down to Texas where my family is.  We have been here just over a year, have about 3 more years to go then we move somewhere else.  I love the mountians except for the winter time cause I don't ski or anything.  Oh well.  Thanks for the help again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Military Rose? Air Force here, was stationed at Hill myself. Thats how I got to know Utah.<br />
<br />
btw, I never ski either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rosedesu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hello again.<br />
Yup we are military.  My husband is active duty in the Air Force.  I really love the state itself, just suck not having my family here.  So of my hubby's family is here but we don't get along all that well.  Oh well.  We hope that we can start going out and about more next year.  Our son will be close to three then.  I can't wait to teach him how to fish. Hehe.  It's always nice to meet people who play this game and are in the military.  I've notice a lot of military that play.  I wish you luck and safe travels.</div></div><hr />
