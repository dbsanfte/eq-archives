<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi hi :)<br />
<br />
First off I wanted to say thanks so much to all who went along to hate and killed the corruptor of life.  I hope you enjoyed the raid and the slaying of Mr. Corruptor just happened to be an added fun bonus for everyone.  <br />
In order to finish the Nature's Defender quest, I need some help killing 3 monsters in the Wakening lands.  There are 3 monsters there -- Corrupted Faun, Corrupted Panther, and Corrupted Unicorn.  They're not supposed to be too difficult from what I've heard.  The toughest of the three is the unicorn, who is a level 59 shadowknight.  I've heard from more than one person that it can be done with 2 strong groups or 3 decent ones.  The monsters are usually up, and tend to hover around the coordinate (0,0).  <br />
Anyway, if you could please post if you can make it sometime Friday evening or during the weekend, that'd be great!<br />
<br />
I saw Moe's post about hunting in Velious this weekend - maybe we could have a joint hunt between his and my posts?<br />
<br />
Okay thanks!<br />
<br />
:) Lia :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aranuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This weekend is really bad for me hon.  I really would like to help, but I am not sure how I can.  Very sorry. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd love to help Lianna but I can't do things on weekends...especially this one since I leave friday evening and get back monday morning. If you happen to get the forces needed on a weeknight though (and I'm ingame) I'll tag along :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blumgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd love to help you this weekend. <br />
<br />
plus I know another person(sorry bad with names sigh) who also needs help with the phenocryst quest and I could use the help taking down the taskmaster in GD for a quest.  What I propose is this we take the same 2-3 groups and knock out all three at once then depending on if people would like to continue we head to Kael or Velks or Icewell for some good ole exp. :)</div></div><hr />

Edit: Found this (http://pub13.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathholyswordsandquests.showMessage?topicID=2997.topic) post on the Paladins of Norrath messageboard - seems like some good info on the mobs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You should have been with me and Gallandro last week: I think it was Friday or Saturday, when a certain barb warrior stumbled into the panther and unicorn and was promptly HTed for 1021 hp and sent packing ( this was after an abortive attempt  to whack some inkie merc in WL, who was re-enforced by a level 56 healing giant priest).  Gallandro was able to find the corpse by trakcing the unicorn :p</div></div><hr />
