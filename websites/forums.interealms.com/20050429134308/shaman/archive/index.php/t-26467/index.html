<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I leveled a priest to 60 on Stormreaver, which is notorious for its gankfests, no rules, no holds barred type of PVP play.  There is a high population of former Sullon Zek'ers on SR and although every PVP server is &quot;red is dead&quot;, I think in SR that's especially true.  It's fun, and it's what I got used to.  It makes you kind of calloused (or arrogant) though.<br />
<br />
Started an alt on a PVE server.  What a difference.  Whenever a single opposing member is in the zone, General Chat is spammed, you'd think the Japanese had invaded San Francisco.  I just have to chuckle.  PVP is such a rarity on PVE servers that it's taken seriously.  I don't know if that's silly or just cute.  I was waiting for a boat, and there were two mid-lvl 30ish guys waiting on the docks for the boat as well.  (I'm horder in PVP, ally in PVE)  The conversation was something like:<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard Auberdine got attacked!  I'm going there to fight back the horde!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, can I come?  I hate the horde&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, we always need more pallys.  They rock - great tanks - and the can heal&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya being a pally ownz.&quot;<br />
<br />
I couldn't help but just chuckle.  So different than PVP servers.  Loved the change of pace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh. I don't know whether to be offended by your &quot;how quaint&quot; attitude towards PVE, or just /hug ya and welcome you to the other side of the fence. :)<br />
<br />
PVE is fun. You're right though. PVP is semi-rare, which is why it IS so fun when it happens. Usually a group gets together and sets out to rain chaos on a mid level town or outpost somewhere, then the reinforcements arrive and all hell can break loose.<br />
<br />
PVP by choice has always been my preference.<br />
<br />
Both rulesets have their pro's and con's. Enjoy each for what they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sadly the one kind of PVP I like isnt really offered on the PVE servers, I dont much care for the gankfests or the raids into lowbie lands but I just love the knockdown dragout kinda fights that happen when you end up in the same grinding spot as the other faction. No planning, no griefing crap, just plain old pvp for the chance to exp.</div></div><hr />

No, really?  I hadn't noticed.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks Cappi!<br />

a) Weren't you the one who was swearing to never ever PvP no matter what?  (or am I confusing you with somebody else.. izmalis maybe?)<br />
<br />
b) Grats on 40 you old fart.  Just noticed it, so maybe it's been a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a) Nope, wasn't me. Just the opposite as a matter of fact. If there's PVP goin' on I usually get involved. I've never cared for unrestricted PVP rulesets though, so maybe that's what you're remembering?<br />
<br />
b) Thanks, I guess. :p Black Friday occurred back in Feburary. Welcome to this year. :D</div></div><hr />
