<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As far as I know, not a lot of people know about this spot and its great solo exp, I’ve been solo’n here pretty much since SOL came out. Figure’d I let you Shamans in on it.<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
<br />
It’s located in a tunnel in the northern part of Shadeweaver's Thicket (loc 0, 3000). At the end of the tunnel is some lava, and on a ledge is 4 mobs and a named in the middle (Jynhadar). The named is level 51, summons, and spawns every hour and a half or so (iirc) and drops a decent robe (+5% evoc, and has a cool purple look). The other 4 mobs range from light blue to blue at level 60, they have roughly the same amount of hps as Seb frogs and their spawn rate is extremely quick. <br />
<br />
Advantages<br />
<br />
This is a very safe and easy camp, aside from the named, the mobs die very quickly. You can go AFK at any time for any amount of time. You don’t have to worry about breaking the spawns. Of all the times I’ve been here I’ve never seen it camped. I’d say if you are 60 this place is solo only, to duo here is borderline overkill IMO. I’d say shamans have an advantage here because the named would be somewhat hard to solo for most other classes. <br />
<br />
Disadvantage<br />
<br />
The bastids dispel, and I swear they always go right for my KEI and AEGO. There is no cash loot, and the robe the named drops is very rare, and while it’s not bad, would probably only yield a K or two in bazaar. This place is pretty much out of the way, although not bad now that they added Luclin ports. <br />
<br />
Strategy<br />
<br />
Get you self all buffed up. Don’t summon a pet, he’ll likely mess things up for you. After you’ve done this camp a while you can experiment with using your pet though. <br />
<br />
The first thing you need to do is kill Jynhadar. For some reason you can’t target him because he is standing next to some gate that needs a key (which is I think is broken), so you basically have to walk right up next to him to target him or just agro him (don’t worry about the other 4 guys, they won’t agro). Pull him down just before the ledge. He is completely resistant to disease and poison so its just epic, JBB, and iCE strike. He has a good amount of hps and can be pretty tough without torpor.<br />
<br />
After he’s dead, the best place to set up camp is a few feet from the ledge. Through experience I’ve found this to be the best place because you keep the mob far enough so others can’t heal him, yet close enough to his spawn point that he doesn’t try to gate. The 4 mobs you kill are strangely enough non-kos, yet they have no faction, which is what makes this camp so easy. Just pick one and pull, use whatever strategy you like to kill them, they’re about as easy as Seb frogs. Many of them have pets, dispel, nuke, dot and heal. I actually usually pull by clicking my epic on their pet, rooting it, then slow and fight the mob. There are only 4 of them, but they respawn quick so you should have no down time. Keep in mind that Jynhadar will be spawning and he is KOS. <br />
<br />
That’s pretty much it, its kinda fun solo’n here at level 60 because it’s a total newbie zone, you’ll most likely get some tells from newbies asking for buffs and stuff :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How long is respawn, precisely?  <br />
<br />
How hard does Jynhadar hit, and how long is his respawn?  What does he hit for, and how many hits per round?<br />
<br />
Of course, all this is fairly irrelevant now, because these mobs give 1/2 or less exp post-patch.  Hurrah for VI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wolfmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since they have changed it back were you can now get exp again with low blues, I thought I would try it...<br />
<br />
It is 3000, 0. You can target Jynhadar from way back at the tunnel. I slowed him and a sentry immediately joined the fight.<br />
Gated out. Went back and tried just one sentry and could pull the sentry solo. But like I said, the first time I tried slowing Jyn, the sentry joined in. I will try again later and see with the new resists if Jyn can take a poison or disease dot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That is wierd, Wolf. I have not done this camp for a little while now, mainly because I hated how they always dispelled heh. But when I was there I could solo pull Jyn every time. They could have changed it though, I should prolly go back and give it a try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>coryn braun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">is this doable at 57?  would it be worth it with the exp changes?  I've had a hella time finding decent exp lately, I spent ages in the Grey last night for only a few % of all 57 exp, 0% into AA.. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I prob just suck but I got owed here.  At 55 all 5 of the mobs aggroed me after I pulled the named.  Maybe 1 sec went by before I saw that o so beautiful corpse.  But then again, solo'n isnt my bag baby, ya!</div></div><hr />
