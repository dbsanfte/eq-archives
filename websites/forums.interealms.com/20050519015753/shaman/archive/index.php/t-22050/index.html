<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">in looking at all of the comments about end game content and the focus on short fights, i was had a few thoughts:<br />
<br />
1. shammy are just fine soloing, should be obvious to everyone. we don't need anything that makes us directly uber so much as something that is going to be a major and positive offering to a group or raid party.<br />
<br />
2. whatever the contribution we were to make would *have* to be geared towards helping out in a quick-fight oriented zone or raid.<br />
<br />
3. slows wouldn't have squat to do with it. our slows are just fine, and don't need revision.<br />
<br />
<br />
that basically left me scratching my chin, until today while i was in BoT wishing Avatar was a group spell. then of course i thought &quot;well...if it WAS a group spell, i could MGB it...&quot; then it just spiralled out of control, and now i'm here saying this:<br />
<br />
<br />
RALLY THE TROOPS, YOU SKIRT WEARING, BUTT SCRATCHING, PRIMITIVE RACE DERIVED BEASTLORD AND/OR CLERIC WANNABES!!! BRING YOUR FRIENDS, BRING YOUR FAMILY, TELL EVERYONE, LETS GET GROUP AVATAR FOR LEVEL 65!!! GROUP FERINE AT LEVEL 70!!!<br />
<br />
all of the sudden, quick buff and SCRM go from &quot;wow, that's useful&quot; to &quot;ok, first i'm getting scrm and quick buff, then canni5...&quot;.<br />
<br />
i am not joking. bring everyone to this thread if you agree, and lets try to get this to become a reallity. it's not the be-all, end all, but with this and some very minor tweaks, we could become that much more desirable to raid organizers and groups in general in the end game.<br />
<br />
(note: because of the likely mana cost and the probably still short duration, i imagine most raid parties would want to have enough shammies on board to keep this going non-stop. probably 4 or so so that we could continue to perform our other duties as well)<br />
<br />
another possible suggestion: group quiesence? i could see how this would actually cause some possible quibbles from cleric or druid camps, but it would offer us something in the way of heals that helps a lot w/o taking over the number 2 big-heal role of druids, who IMO should retain that title.<br />
<br />
bear with me if you disagree, but i love these ideas. if you don't, great...be kind in responding at least, it's 1 AM here as i post this and daydream of this becoming a reallity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The idea of group avatar has been cited a lot, the only criticism is that clerics/druids might have to click it off every 6 mins, so it would have to be put in the Songs window.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aekhold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would rather have a Group Quiescence :)<br />
<br />
Edit : I'm not sure Druids/Cleric would click it off, except if it doesn't stack with one of their buff I don't know... With nowadays weapons and procs I often see them melee and ask me haste or other buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont much care about group FA, I just want a decent duration on the single version. 15 minutes base, sounds reasonable, then it wont become a Bazaar Bot Spell but it wont be such a PITA. That would put it around 22? mins (not a big numbers guy) with SCRM and an EE focus. <br />
<br />
Group Quies probably isnt happening either, so I am putting that out of my head as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't see anything overpowering in making FA a 30 minute duration.  Rangers can group buff 130 ATK that lasts an hour *and* adds 400 HP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">either way, proactive and positive seems to be the way to go. <br />
<br />
what i'm noticing a lot among those with complaints about their classes are that their suggestions often encroach upon the turf that other classes hold even more dear. an example of this being the current frustration of SK and pally players with not being able to tank certain mobs in end content. seems to me that being the only class able to tank some of those very high end mobs is just about all warriors have going for them. sure, their dps is better than sk or pally, but sk seem to be overlooking the fact that on those huge raid mobs, they are still desirable for their ability to HT it to help bring it down, and they can contribute some minor debuffs that stack with the ones shammy and enc will be throwing at those mobs. pally, of course, can heal, and offer Brell's to the buff pool, etc. all warriors have is dps and sheer meatwall ability. additionally, outside of the MT and a couple more warriors to round out the tank line, it's not like every tank you take has to be a warrior--having pally and sk along where the meleers are being bombared with aoe dmg helps a lot--especially when you take into consideration those other offerings.<br />
<br />
similarly, while we would ALL love more healing ability, healing and rezzing are all clerics have going for them, and being second to clerics in healing is all that really gets druids spots on a raid. their nukes and such are ok, but they're not so dazzling that they're going to get looked at over a mage if they aren't also the 2nd best healers. as far as i'm concerned, let them remain the 2nd best healers, and even kick them a little extra nuke ability. what i'd really love to see for us is more impact in short term fights through consequential melee buffs and maybe an extension on the Cripple line that makes them very desirable for those fights, as well. <br />
<br />
ultimately, the shaman should remain the best melee buffer/debuffer, and if slow is going to be taken out of the equation in end content, so be it--there are other ways to debuff that will help us make a big difference. how about a very big combination Malos/Cripple with a 2-3 sec cast time? make Tash and our Malos versions stack regardless of which one sticks first so that enchy and shammy both benefit, with Tash at end game level debuffing by 150 or something, and malos debuffing MR for about 100 with a built in 100 point ac debuff and 10% decrease to the mob's melee output. <br />
<br />
just some ideas, trying to think of things to do that won't cause a loss of role or identity for any other class, yet still making the shammy desirable for end game content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Making Avatar group castable would be, in the devs eyes, a big upgrade in its power.<br />
<br />
I'd rather have the new Avatar (Champion) have an added ability, such as some type of modification on more recent special melee abilities.  If they made it group, which they stated at summit they would not, it would be seen as very powerful, and would see no other modifications, most likely.</div></div><hr />

group avatar would be nice for 1 group encounters, but if it is casters group only we would still be up ****'s creak when on raids...I hate this spell with a passion...<br />
<br />
funny thing about avatar- avatar and quick heals are about the only 2 things that make shaman stackable over 2-3 on raids =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just curious why group Q would be such an upgrade that you would come back again?<br />
<br />
Wouldn't being able to get the new &quot;ancient&quot; canny and stopping the carpal of canny4, canny4, canny4 be more important?  Wouldn't faster casting DD's that would give Shaman more flexibility and a little more potential DPS make you more happy?  Wouldn't (pending Druid re-tuning, to be consistent with my post from today) increasing shaman single target healing to an acceptable level make you happier?  Wouldn't having everything work according to some sort of common sense like fixing puppy duel wielding, FA duration, out of group shrink, etc. make you more happy?<br />
<br />
Again just curious why, when most of the issues the upper tier Shaman have concerning healing is regarding quick, powerful spot heals that group Q would be such a big deal??<br />
<br />
For that matter why the big press for Group FA when the duration would still suck, and it is the annoyance factor above anything that is the problem.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">my reason for pushing for group Avatar, especially given the short duration (though i'd be elated to see the duration extended to 20 mins base) is because it would make us that much more attractive to have ALONG on raids, as opposed to the raid party relying on someone's two-boxed alt to buff pre-otm then camp out.<br />
<br />
i'm not saying it's the only way, i'm not saying it's 100% guaranteed to work--i'm just trying to offer up some suggestions that would give us added utility without pushing too heavily into areas other classes rely on to retain their own utility. druids &gt; shammy in end game right now because of healing and healing alone. if our healing is improved to where it's even a close gap, druids are basically done, and after about six months of pleading with the dev team, they will be given something else that will result in us or clerics being upset, which will result in even more posts talking about balance issues and blah blah on the shammy forums.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANY upgrade that allows us to remain what we signed on to be--the best melee buffers, 2nd best DoT casters, best debuffers, and capable support healers (yes, i know that at present we are barely capable support healers in end game content)--is a good one in my opinion. i would rather see us gain in the buffing/debuffing areas to keep us balanced in end game than have our heals upgraded. let druids be druids, and let us be shammies once again. <br />
<br />
that's it.<br />
<br />
the big hoorahh in the first thread was basically intended to do what this thread is doing--keeping everyone positive and proactive. offering suggestions that would help with balance without making druids pointless or even threatening clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Petition to make ShamBots even more lucrative?<br />
<br />
Why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Any buff that I have to recast every 6 minutes....won't be used by me ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would like to see FA given a group version or  much longer duration, No both. If it is groupable and long duration it could be done and maintained easily by a bot. Where as if I can cast it just once every 6 to 9 minutes and get a whole group at once I would be happy. While if lasting 20 or thirty minutes would be just as attractive to me in single target version. Six minutes is not to painful compared to what I do already, it's the casting it every time it pops to keep it on five people that annoys the crap outa me.<br />
<br />
Group Q is so attractive because often when you need to heal fast you also need to heal multiple people fast. I don't know that group Q is really all that needed but  Iwould love to have it. Group FA, or a longer duration, would be a godsend. It wouldn't necessarily save anyone's bacon in a tight spot but it would let us focus on something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't see anything overpowering in making FA a 30 minute duration.  Rangers can group buff 130 ATK that lasts an hour *and* adds 400 HP.<br />
<br />
What spell is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I just fear Sony will go &quot;Group avatar? What a great idea for a proc for OoW end game weapons!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What spell is that?<br />
<br />
I am guessing Strength of Tunare? never paid attention to how much atk, if any, that it adds. [SoT also does not stack with BSS so you have to choose between more hps or more atk]  If this wasn't the spell that was mentioned then it might be the combination of SoT and Predator.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I can see the Dev issue with not giving us Group Avatar.  It becomes real easy to mgb one off right before a raid boss encounter.  That sort of strategy would be an extensive increase in overall raid dps so maybe that is the problem.  <br />
<br />
I think I would be happier with the Avatar line if they would tweak the recast time or just attach the spell as a right-clicky to shaman-only armor down the line in OoW.  Avatar taking up a precious spell slot is more an issue for me than the spell length.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">SoT plus SotP = 130 ATK.<br />
<br />
I'm still hoping someone will do some parses that show how much DPS FA really adds.  I think that with todays melee being against the cap already in STR, the only real bonus you are getting is the ATK.<br />
<br />
There is a post here with some discussion of this, I think Purdypog started the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As if group avatar would do a thing for the main shamans out there. Yet another spell the dragged along boxed shammy can cast. No thank you.<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Group Q would be great but it won't happen till they prevent group heals being mgbable as said by SoE a while ago.<br />
<br />
Group FA would ge nice but they would probably make it cost 3k+ mana per cast and like group Q they probably think mgbing it would make a ground breaking effect on raid dps as thus brutally overpowering :D :D<br />
<br />
As satated by others longer duration single FA would be better imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">once again, the REAL point of this thread was to try to create a conversation where people made positive suggestions and stopped complaining.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
side note: been using FA a lot when i duo with 59 sk/rl friend. he's toting a windblade...hit % is obviously up, and his avg dmg is retarded (for level) with this. hits for 300 very often, and back to back frequently. avg attack round with this up and str maxed (fo7 more than does it alone) is probably around 480. big dps increase over how he does w/o it, due to the combination of hit % and avg dmg increase.<br />
<br />
<br />
good to be loved.<br />
<br />
ranger on Air tower raid (BoT) the other night said this put him up to 2315 atk with all the other mods he had as well...i'm not going to say what his dmg looked like, but Time gear and that atk rating make for a big blood smear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">30 minutes FA won't happen because if they do so, beasts will ask for a 20 minutes ( if not more ) Ferocity.<br />
And the resists granted by this spell are too huge to last 20+ minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">In my opinion, a good way (maybe not easy) to make us not bot-able is to make a kind of buffs that only affect while the shaman (or any other buffing class) is in the raid. Something like &quot;Avatar aura&quot; that affects all the people in an area of influence and in the same raid as the caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">in looking at all of the comments about end game content and the focus on short fights, i was had a few thoughts:<br />

<br />
Just to give a little update on fanfaire during the the discussion for spells and aa's.<br />
<br />
Was quite intresting.. group avatar is a definte no go. Stat buffs are being looked into, mainly raising cap. Shaman healing is pretty much where they want it to be.<br />

<br />
Why not?  To me this seems a natural progression to me in our spell line up. Not to mention our hybrid counter part has it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Still waiting to see a parse on the DPS increase of FA on a stat capped tank.  I'd do one myself but I'm heading out of town to a family reunion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, I agree that FA should be a group spell with a minimum base duration of 60 minutes, but that would do exactly 0 to help our issues as a class.  It would just make the game less annoying.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Fact: Right now, the shaman class buffs better than it ever has.  <br />
Fact: Right now, the shaman class is weaker than it ever has been.<br />
