<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Turned 34 and finally got my dogdog. This is the first time I've run a char with a pet, and it's becoming a great learning experience. Especially with all the hints, tips, and advice I've found on this board. Thanks to everyone that contributed. I do have a few questions:<br />
<br />
1) Does the pet have any effect on gaining melee skill points? I mean, other than tangent effects such as reduced melee time due to quicker kills, etc. I ask because my defense skill is suddenly lagging, and it has usually kept up with offense and the others. I try to max them for each level as I work my way up.<br />
<br />
2) Can you rename your pet, or is there an option somewhere so your pet always gets the same name?<br />
<br />
3) I read somewhere that your pet will &quot;point&quot; to the nearest mob when it's been parked or is guarding. Is this the case? <br />
<br />
A noob question about the bazaar. The trader's bag has only 10 slots, yet I've seen traders with far more than 10 items for sale. Now I understand the stackable items can &quot;spread out&quot; and occupy multiple slots, but I know I've seen traders with more than 10 unique items for sale. How is this done? Multiple trader bags? And how do you get an item to highlight when you announce auctions (i.e., what makes the item clickable in the chat window text)?<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like the mob is beating on the pet, and not you. <br />
Try using &quot;/pet notaunt&quot;. <br />

Nope.<br />

Yub. Not sure on the range though. <br />

Not a trader myself, I suspect multiple trader bags. <br />
<br />
Click on an item to open it, hold the mouse button down while you <br />
move to the item window. Start an auction, tell line or whatever, but<br />
don't hit return yet. Move your mouse of the picture of the item and<br />
either right click or left click. It will then put the link into your chat<br />
window. Hit return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">number 1  think of your pet like a Dot he will help kill things faster but i bet you will be fine on your defense skills just keep tanking em.<br />
<br />
Number 2   No the game just radomly picks names for each pet cast.<br />
<br />
Number 3  if you put your pet on Guard it will face the nearest mob as it is guarding. <br />
<br />
Number 4 it is the use of multiple trader satchels.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that helps some friend</div></div><hr />

The pet has no effect on gaining any kind of skills.  But ya, if the mobs are beating on your pet instead of you of course your defense will go up slower.  /pet taunt off or something similar would help but if you are standing in melee range the mob will usually hit you anyway.<br />

No way to name the pet.<br />

Ya, the pet will point to the nearest mob but the range is fairly small.<br />

Definitely multiple bags there.  You can have 8 10 slot bags so I would imagine you could sell 80 items.  I've only been up to maybe 50 or so at most so I don't know for sure what the max is.  To link an item right click on the item to bring up the description window then left click on the picture in the description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are rooting the mob, the mob will attack the closest thing.  From what i recall, the shaman pet attacks from fairly close range so it might be closer than you are and therefore taking the hits for you.  If you are rooting, make sure you are closest to the mob and your defense skill should start increasing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks everyone. Guess I'll buy some extra Trader Bags. I'm doing the tanking for my pet, and I'm pretty sure the mob isn't beating on it (no yelping sounds, anyway), so maybe I'm just not getting hit as often. I plan on tanking in teh face until my melee skills are maxxed as it is, so it just might take a little longer to get defense to max. No problem - I like to hit things.</div></div><hr />

As your slows get better it gets harder to get your defense up. Best thing to do is find a light hitting yellow or red mob and let it beat on you. Gate or zone out when you can't take the beating anymore. Rinse and repeat until your defense is maxxed for that level.</div></div><hr />
