<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
What is AA?<br />
<br />
At level 51 all classes gain access to the Alternate Advancement menus.  You can access them in game using the command ALT V.  You can toggle a portion of your Experience points into a seperate pool that is not counted towards achieving your next level.   When this pool is filled you gain 1 AA point, that can be saved or spent on a new Alternate Ability.<br />
<br />
There are several catagories of Alternate Abilities.<br />
<br />
General: These may be purchased starting at level 51.  They cost 1 AA point for each ability.<br />
<br />
Archetype:  These may be purchased starting at level 55 AND after you have spent 6 points in the General catagory.  They cost 2 points for the first level, 4 points for the second level and 6 points for the third level of each ability.<br />
<br />
Class: These may be purchased starting at level 59 AND after you have spent 12 points in the Archetype catagory.  Their point costs differ, but most cost 3 points for the first level, 6 points for the second level and 9 points for the third level.<br />
<br />
POP Advance:  Available at different point costs, to people level 61 and over, who have purchased the Planes of Power expansion.   <br />
<br />
POP Ability: Available at different point costs, to people level 61 and over, who have purchased the Planes of Power expansion.  Many skills have seperate level requirements and point costs for each level of the ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
What is an AA title and how do I get one?<br />
When 6 points are spent in General Abilities, all classes gain the title Baron/Baroness depending on gender.<br />
<br />
When 12 points are spent in the Archetype Abilities, each class gains a new title.  For shamans, druids, beastlords and clerics that title is Venerable.<br />
<br />
When 24 points are spent in the Class Abilities Catagory, each class gains yet another title.  For shamans, druids and beastlords that is Elder.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
Do racial exp penalties apply to AA points?<br />
<br />
No, racial exp penalities do not apply to the rate at which a player gains AA points.  The class-based exp penalty was removed from everquest years ago and that does not apply to AA points either.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
What are the shaman AA's and how do they work?<br />
<br />
See the Shaman Alternate Ability Chart. (http://interealms.com/shaman/guides/aa-chart.html)<br />
<br />
That chart lays out the requirements and costs, as well as a description of how each AA works.<br />
<br />
It includes information on how our Healing AA works (aka Adept works with tnargs, but not torpor/Q/kraggs - adept works with tnargs/kraggs but not torpor/Q) how spell casting mastery works, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
When should I start working on AA?<br />
<br />
This is a difficult question and one that is best left to the individual.  However, most shaman generally use one of a few strategies to plan how they will earn AA points.<br />
<br />
1.  Level to 65 before any AA.<br />
2.  Level to 60/61, stop and do AAs, then level to 65.<br />
3.  Work on AA steadily while levelling<br />
<br />
Explanation for Case 1:  <br />
Explanation for Case 2:  <br />
Explanation for Case 3:  <br />
<br />
<br />
See arguments for when to work on AA, below.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
What's the best order to do them in?<br />
General: Innate Runspeed 1, 2, 3<br />
General: Innate Regeneration 1, 2, 3  OR  General: Innate Metabolism 1, 2, 3<br />
Archetype: Mental Clarity 1, 2, 3<br />
Class: Cannibalize<br />
<br />
After that its up to you to decide which ones are the most important and relevant to your playstyle.<br />
<br />
See the Shaman AA Chart (http://interealms.com/shaman/guides/aa-chart.html) for descriptions of other AA that shamans have available to them.<br />
<br />
Personally, after Canni5, I recommend getting Radiant Cure 1, then working on either Spell Casting Mastery, Quickbuff, Mass Group Buff, Spell Casting Reinforcement/Mastery and Natural Durability.  In whatever order you feel like.  Others have posted their personal recommendations below.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
What are the /alt activate commands to put AA skills in a Macro?<br />
<br />
Cannibalize............/alt activate 47 <br />
Radiant Cure........../alt activate 153 <br />
Virulent Paralysis..../alt activate 171 <br />
Suspend Minion....../alt activate 176 <br />
Spirit Call................/alt activate 177<br />
Mass Group Buff ..../alt activate 35 <br />
Rabid Bear ............./alt activate 50<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
Do AA skills stack with focus effects?<br />
<br />
Yes. <br />
<br />
Quickbuff will stack with Buffing Haste and/or Spell Haste focuses to a maximum cast time reduction of 50%.<br />
Example:  Quickbuff 2, plus Haste of Mithaniel = 45% spell haste on spells such as Torpor/Quiescience. <br />
<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement will stack with Buff Extension focuses, with no cap.<br />
Example:  Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery and the effect on the 8th Shawl, Zephyr of Brell will stack for a +70% duration increase on your buffs. <br />
<br />
Healing Adept will stack with Enhanced Healing focuses, with no cap.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think there really is 1 right answer to when to aa. I can definitely see run3 being worth while as soon as you hit 55 if you spend your time indoor. Running faster than mobs = good things. Seems most people tho look for the easiest path tho and spend most of thier time out doors.<br />
<br />
Torpor and cann v are definitely a powerful combination and will make a noticable impact in most things you do. Then again you have to have torpor which isn't always easy.<br />
<br />
Depending on your friends/guild thats an important factor. If you can get access to some of the better zones you can get some great exp at higher level. In the elemental planes it takes me about 1:15-1:30 to get a full aa in a good group and you are pretty much going to be required to be 65 for that. If on the other hand you can't get into these zones and are stuck hunting pov/pos at best you would get better aa exp at 60.<br />
<br />
Spells throw another interesting an interesting consideration into the situation. On alot of servers it's easier and even cheaper to find the key shaman spells in the 65 versions rather than the 60 versions. Malos and q often times are more common and sell for less than malo/torpor. With out malo/torpor these spells offer huge benifit for the shaman to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The following posts are copied and pasted from a thread on my guild's private forums<br />
<br />
I currently have 176AA. Here is what I have, in more or less the order I got it. My favorites are in bold. <br />
<br />
Run3 <br />
Regen3 <br />
MC3 <br />
Canni5 <br />
MGB <br />
ND3 <br />
SC1 <br />
SCM3 <br />
SCR3 <br />
SCRM <br />
QB3 <br />
RC2 <br />
HG3 <br />
SCF1 &lt;--- for giggles <br />
AHG3 <br />
CA3 <br />
PP1 <br />
EE2 <br />
LR5 <br />
CS3. <br />
<br />
I think that's all of it. Here are the AA's I feel are most valuable and why: <br />
<br />
Canni5 (5aa +12aa prereq) - Canni5 is a no brainer. Every shaman in the guild has it already so no further discussion needed. <br />
<br />
Mass Group Buff (9aa) - Duh. You all have it already, nothing to see here. <br />
<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery (8aa + 12aa prereq) - 50% buff extension, and works with quiescence/torpor. With this AA, my Q always heals 2100 points of damage. Sometimes, with the right lag/timing, it will heal 2400. That's a 2100-2400 point heal for just 200 mana. That is excellent, both for raiding, exp, and dueling. On top of a better Q, you also get longer buffs, which is always nice. Combined with 8th shawl, my buffs have a 70% duration bonus. It is nice to have a 2.5 hour focus, and an 11 minute avatar. Both the buffer and the buffee benefit from longer buffs. This is probably my favorite AA outside of canni5. <br />
<br />
Quick Buff 3 (18aa) - Reduces the casting time on buffs (including torpor / Q) by 50%. Having a 3 second Q is a must-have. With 3 second cast time combined with SCRM, you can keep Q up on your entire group without it ever fading on anyone. That is awesome. On top of making Q cast faster, it also makes all those other buffs cast faster. What I usually do is MGB fo7, then cast tali of boar on each group individually. QB really cuts down on the time it takes to buff a raid, and its nice to be able to buff the stragglers quickly when you get those &quot;focus sta plz&quot; tells. One important thing to note about QB3 is that the maximum spell haste is 50%. You can hit 50% with QB2 + blessing of reverence + haste of mithaniel. However, I have nice ft3 items in my shoulder and range slots (the only places haste of mithaniel is available) and I was unwilling to give those up, so I just spent the 9aa. If you have cog encrusted epaults or a wicked bone altl, then QB2 should be enough for you. <br />
<br />
Advanced Healing Gift 3 (9aa + 12aa prereq) - Gives you a 16% chance to exceptional heal for double healage (2600pt tnargs, doesnt work with kraggs). I feel that our primary role on raids after a mob is debuffed, is to heal. For minor splash damage, I can heal with Q. If someone is getting beat, they need a blast heal. 1300 is a decent heal, but with mobs hitting as hard as they do nowadays, it isn't always enough. A 2600pt heal, though, is almost always enough to save someone's life for long enough for them to lose aggro or gain the attention of a cleric. I perform lots of exceptionals on raids, as most of you have probably seen, and I have saved many people's lives. I feel that healing adept is a good AA, but healing gift is much much better for our purposes. I plan on getting HA soon, though. <br />
<br />
Lightning Reflexes 5 (15aa + 12aa prereq) - This AA makes you get missed a lot more often. I feel that this serves us better than CS + ID. If you get quadded for 2500, and you have ID5, you'll only get quadded for 2000 instead. 10000vs8000 damage doesnt matter, you're still gonna die. If you had had LR5, though, half of the quad might have missed you, and you would only take 5000 damage, which would not kill you. LR5 really works. I often see long strings of misses, and I honestly believe that it has greatly increased my survivability. With this AA, I rampage tanked DXXT, and exp mobs have become laughable. I can now function as the main tank anywhere in a tier2/3 exp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Other Good AA: <br />
<br />
Spell Casting Mastery 3 (12aa) - Roughly 10% mana savings. This is just a great all-around AA, with noticeable effects. During my month long absence, Gylius used me to PL himself a few hundred AA. He got me 12aa while he was at it, and spent them on SCM3. I came back and got to see how big of a difference it is to go from SCM0 -&gt; SCM3, and it is a very large and noticeable difference. Between my mana savings on heals, my FT, and the mana I get back from canni5, I can cast Q on as many people as I want, forever. I will not go oom. I can also blast heal tnargs for a very long time before I run oom. Great AA for any class. <br />
<br />
Natural Durability 3 (12aa) - Free hitpoints, 'nuff said. <br />
<br />
Radient Cure 2 (6aa, 12aa to max it) - This AA removes negative effects. It is really great because it gets rid of crap that could otherwise only be dispelled (great for when you malo yourself). RC1 is unreliable, but RC2 is much much better. I am unsure if RC3 is worth the 6 points, and it is currently low on my list. Everyone should have at least RC1. <br />
<br />
AA's that I am not too fond of: <br />
<br />
Spirit Call (4 - 3 - 3) - This is the pet swarm AA. I disagree with Sajan here. He loves this AA, and I do not. I am glad that I have SC1, but I can't find justification to take it past that. I use this AA for 2 things, really: 1) Eating the harmtouch for me when I solo Daiku Death Knights. 2) Dueling. 3 pets in a caster's face will make them freak out and prevent them from getting off any long cast-time spells. SC3 would obviously be better for dueling, but I have more important things to spend them on right now. I feel that spending 4aa for 3 pets is a good buy, but 3aa for 1 addition pet (ranks 2 and 3) is not worth it. <br />
<br />
Virulent Paralysis (3 - 3 - 3) - http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16806 - When I originally wrote this guide, I did not yet have VP and I wasn't too enthusiastic about ever getting it.  Since then, though, I have trained it and it turns out that VP is actually a really great ability.  Follow the link for a more in-depth discussion.<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear (5aa) - This AA is ok for dueling, and that is it. A rabid bear shaman w/ a bone of bertox (54/40) does not outdamage blood of saryrn. I will not train this until I have well over 200aa. A bad AA that could have been really cool if they'd done it a little different. If you train this before you have at least 100aa I will slap you. <br />
<br />
Hastened Rabidity (who cares?) - Proof that SOE not only hates us, but also thinks we are stupid as well. <br />
<br />
Spell Casting Fury &amp; Fury of Magic - SCF makes you crit for 33%, 66%, 100% extra damage at each rank, respectively. FOM makes you crit more. With SCF3 and FOM3 you will crit, I believe, 13% of the time. This just isn't worth it for shamans until you have a lot of AA. We are not here to do damage. We are here to debuff, and then heal. If you are of the school of thought that shamans are here to debuff, and then do damage, then this AA might be good for you, but I think you're silly. It works with our rain spells, which are decent except for the resist rate. <br />
<br />
Channeling Focus 3 (12aa) - I know nothing about this AA, but I know Sajan has it trained so maybe he can tell us a little about its effectiveness. <br />
<br />
Suspended Minion (5aa - ?) - This AA lets you keep an extra pet in your pocket. You can suspsend your pet and then invis, and release him when you get to your destination. Or, you can suspend your pet and then summon another one, and release the old one when the second dies. This is a great AA for pet class, bad AA for us. I plan on training it somewhere around my 250th AA, for dueling purposes, but there is really no other reason to get this if you are a shaman. <br />
<br />
Pet Discipline (6aa) - Gives you a /pet hold command, which makes your pet sit there and not attack anything until given the order. This means your pet will not be aggroed by AE's, and will not go chasing off mobs that cast on you, etc... Good AA for pet classes, bad AA for us. I never use my pet on raids, and when I am exping, spamming /pet back off is good enough. If it was 2aa i would get it, but not for 6. <br />
<br />
Combat Stability and Innate Defense (12aa - 15aa) - This doesn't really belong in this section, but I didn't know where else to put it. It is not a bad AA, just not as good as LR5. This makes you take less damage per hit, kind of like having a higher AC. It reduces your damage consistantly, but not by enough to be likely to save your life if you aggro something you shouldn't have. You are better off with LR5, because a lucky streak of misses WILL save your life. I am currently training this AA because I am running out of things to train.  Update:  When I originally made this post, I had CS1.  I now have CS3 and I am very happy with my defensive capabilities so far.  However, I gained the LR and CS AA's very quickly so I never really had much time to analyze each step and decide which was most effective.  I know that at this point, I defend much better than I did before, but I cannot tell you if it is from CS3 or LR5 (I am guessing LR5, but I have no real data to back it up).<br />
<br />
Advance Healing Adept (12aa prereq and ???) - This is basically like ID5. It will make you a consistantly better healer, but the bonus isn't likely to save anyone's life, whereas a lucky exceptional can. This is getting trained when I am done with ID5. <br />
<br />
I think that is every AA we have. Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Awesome thread, and great posts Jinheim.<br />
<br />
This will get sticky I assume? or should I just bookmark it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In the section &quot;What is AA&quot; i would add a general remark about prerequisite (sp??) abilities like:<br />
<br />
Note, that for raising several Alternate Abilities of higher categories you also have to raise a  certain lower prerequisite AA before. Most popular shaman case being Cannibalize V (Class category), where you must get Mental Clarity 3 (Archetype category) at first.<br />
<br />
Feel free to translate that to English  :D Adding more when i see some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When To AA:<br />
<br />
I am a firm believer that attaining level 65 should be your #1 goal in improving your character.  There are many reasons for this.<br />
<br />
First of all, just being level 65 makes you more powerful.  Your spells will get resisted less, you will not die as quickly when attacked, and pretty much everything you do will be effected in a positive way.  People that are not 65 SERIOUSLY underestimate the effect that being 65 has.<br />
<br />
Second of all, if you care about raiding, you need to be 65.  Not only does being 65 mean you can slow mobs easier, it also means that your buffs and debuffs will always take hold.  On top of that, a sub-65 shaman just is not as useful.  If you're 64, and you aren the only shaman on the raid, then you will do ok I guess.  If there is a 65 shaman there, though, then any sub-65's are basically just extra lag as far as I am concerned.  I am in a large raiding guild and we have had a few shaman recruits that weren't 65 yet.  The ones that leveled quickly all turned out to be pretty good.  The ones that lingered around and never worked on leveling turned out to be pretty crappy.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, being 65 opens doorways for you.  A lot of people say &quot;I'm not going to level to 65 because I don't have to spells.&quot;  This is stupid.  Level to 65 and you will get the spells MUCH MUCH easier than you will if you are sub-65.  Seriously, all you need to do to get your 65 spells is this:  Level to 65 and hang out in BoT all day.  If you have tactics flag and know some people that are capable of downing gyklus or overseer, go there.  That's it.  The end.  If you aren't 65, you won't get as many groups in these places and you will spend most of your time in ****hole PoV, where a level 64 toon is a godsend for most groups.<br />
<br />
Finally, IT IS EASIER TO GET AA AT 65 THAN ANY OTHER LEVEL.  I do not give a flying rats ass if someone gets half a percent more AA per kill at 63 than I do at 65.  I will have more aa than them when the day is done.  Why?  Because level 65's are stronger.  A group full of 65's doesn't die.  A group full of 65's kills faster.  A group full of 65's has an easy time finding level 65 replacements, and the group does not break up.  On top of that, if I shout &quot;65 shaman (176aa) LFG&quot; and you shout &quot;64 shaman (22aa) LFG&quot;, who do you think is going to get a group faster?  Let me tell you the answer:  me. I very rarely have to spend more than 10 minutes LFG.  Even if I don't get a group, I can solo mobs 2 at a time in tactics or pov.  3 if I feel like concentrating and have raid buffs.  You can't do that without blood of saryrn, a level 65 spell.<br />
<br />
If you do not believe me that it is easier to get AA at level 65, look at this:  http://www.eqrankings.com/?rm=list&amp;class=Shaman&amp;server=&amp;order=AA&amp;page=6  That is a list of shamans, sorted decending by AA.  The top 660 shamans listed are all level 65.  The 661st shaman is level 62, and has 84aa.  If it isn't easier to get AA at 65, then how come the top 660 shamans are all 65?<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
There are exceptions however.  I feel that everyone should get run3, probably at either level 56, when you get bane of nife for increased soloing power, or at level 60, when you get torpor and the ability to get in to good groups.  Run3 is just 3aa, which should take one afternoon of dedicated grinding.  Cannibalize5, though, is going to take another 20aa to reach.  Canni5 is THE ONLY aa ability that MIGHT be worth stopping your grind to 65 for.  I feel that you're better off getting to 65 before even canni5, but, if you absolutely must do some aa, then just get canni5.  I recommend that you do it at level 62, if you must do it.  At level 62, you will have all of your easy to get PoP spells, and you will be a high enough level to be an asset to a pov group, rather than a liability.  You are also high enough level to zone in to BoT, on the off chance that there is a good group there that will take you.  Both these things will make the grind to canni5 a lot easier.<br />
<br />
That's my advice.  A lot of you are going to disagree or maybe even be angry with it, but that is how I see it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1. Level to 65 before any AA.<br />
2. Level to 60/61, stop and do AAs, then level to 65.<br />
3. Work on AA steadily while levelling<br />
<br />
You should have run3 asap after hitting level 51.  Run3 lets you run faster than most mobs in the entire game.  It works indoors.  It's very quick to get.  There's no reason to avoid getting this asap.<br />
<br />
General concensus is that the next 20 AA to get should be the ones you need to get Cannibalization (3 more general, 12 for MC3, and 5 for Can5).  When should they be acquired though?<br />
<br />
There is very little reason to work on AAs any time before level 59.  The benefits of getting AAs are minimal in comparison to what new spells will do and what levels will help you.  Can5 can only be acquired at level 59.  Most people don't enjoy banking AAs at lower level then levelling up.  They tend to enjoy levelling and getting new spells and then going for AAs instead.  Only get first 6 AAs if you really feel like getting your Baron title, otherwise just get run3 and start levelling to 59 at least.<br />
<br />
(FYI:  One of the main reasons that people suggested AAing at level 60 is because the old world mobs used to &quot;green out&quot; at level 61, but due to a recent patch, more old world mobs are blue and give xp, so arguements concerning this are invalid at this point.)<br />
<br />
You may wish to level up to level 59/60/61 and then start working on AAs (and thus working towards Cannibalization).  Level 59 is the minimum level to start using Can5.  The level 58 2k heal is efficient enough to use on yourself that you can use can5 and do the slow cheal type heal on yourself to get back mana quickly.  If you don't have very good HP gear, you may not be able to live through can5 very well, and the casting time on the cheal spell is 10 seconds, so casting it in combat may be very dangerous.  Level 60 is a good level to stop levelling and then start on AAs, because you have access to FoS, GFoS, Malo, and Avatar, which all have very noticable effects.  Only consider staying at 59 if you have no chance at acquiring any of these level 60 spells.  Level 61 is also a good spell to level up to, because you have access to even more new spells from the POP expansion.  The pet and new heal spell are all level 61, and add a great deal of power to the shaman.  If you have Torpor banked, there's no reason to stay at 59 and starting to AA.  Get to 60 asap and scribe that wonderful spell.<br />
<br />
Another reason to think about staying lower level is that many of the mobs in pop that you fight for xp are level 60+.  Fighting mobs equal or higher level than you are gives you an xp bonus.  The xp bonus is very visible.  You may wish to keep that in mind and take in that xp bonus while working on AAs.  If you wish to see how much the xp bonus is, level up to a level, say level 61, and kill a few even conning mobs to check the xp rate, then delevel to 60 and kill a few level 61 mobs (yellow cons) to see how the xp rate differs.<br />
<br />
<br />
The main choice of whether to work on AAs at the 60ish mark, or at the 65 mark is what spells you have banked.  Can5 requires an efficient heal.  The level 58 heal is storebought for cheap, so you have a good heal when you can finally actually buy the can5 skill.  But you want a more efficient heal if you can get one.  You want Torpor or Quiessence.  If you have Torpor banked but no Q, you will want to level to 60 at least before work on AAs.  If you have Q banked, regardless if you have Torpor or not, you probably want to level up to 65 before doing AAs.  Q is vastly more powerful than Torpor.  If you don't have Q or Torpor, nor have the funds to buy a copy or expect to win one any time soon, then you may wish to just go level 65 before going to AA.  Levelling to 65 will give you more time to possibly obtain a copy of Q or Torpor before you get can5.  It will also let you get access to other powerful spells.  And you really do want the most efficient heal spell for use with can5.<br />
<br />
<br />
What's the best order to do them in?<br />
General: Innate Runspeed 1, 2, 3<br />
General: Innate Regeneration 1, 2, 3<br />
...<br />
True, getting regen is definately one of the stronger choices for #4,5,6 in generals.  Another strong choice is going for Metabolism3.  Many people in my guild have gotten Metab3 since the creation of all the stat based foods.  When you have to farm items in order to get certain types of food created, and also factor in that your horse eats food as well, and compare how much 3hp regen really helps when you are getting hit by mobs for up to 700 a shot in POP, going for metab3 can be very useful.  If I was leveling up at this point, I'd go for metab3 over regen3 in all honesty.<br />
Also, I can't remember at this time.  Is Tanaan mastery in the general tab?  If you are one of those tradeskiller types, you may want to get a level of this for your 2nd 200+ tradeskill instead of getting some other skill like regen or metab3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">General: These may be purchased starting at level 51. They cost 1 AA point for each ability.<br />
<br />
Incorrect. New Tanaan Crafting Mastery in the General slot is 3 AA per point, with 6 possible points to obtain.<br />
<br />
Not something to recommend except to nutcases like myself who are dumb enough to grandmaster multiple tradeskills.</div></div><hr />

So now I am on the road to canni5 &amp; all the other kewls aa abilities we get &amp; can use all the advise I can get.<br />
<br />
Glad I posted a question earlier this week about my aa intentions &amp; someone reminded me that I needed to do MC3 before getting canni5. I am sure I woulda messed that up, so a resource like this will become invaluable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">First, when to get your AA's.  I advocate an almost even split of AA, starting at 55, till you get 65 or Can V.  Why?  The game is sometimes lacking in rewards for your time.  If you split your EXP, you're still going to progress, but you're also going to get rewarded on a more frequent basis.  Run3 WILL eventually save your life while soloing indoors, so don't put off getting it.<br />
<br />
Jin is usually right on, but here's where I disagree with him on this one:<br />
<br />
1.  Spirit Call.  Call them the Puppies O Powa, The Dogs of War or The Pack...   SC is just plain FUN!  Remember fun?  Does the game always have to be so bloody serious?   HAVE FUN!<br />
<br />
2.  Virulent Paralysis.  This is NOT a root.  This is a root with a knockback!  And it's a damn FAST root with a knockback.  I keep a root up, even  though I have this, but it's saved lives in exp group MANY times.  NOTE:  after tier 2, you'll probably start losing functionality in this one, due to DR.<br />
<br />
3.  Innate Metabolism.  If you don't use stat food, never mind this AA.  But if you do, and ESPECIALLY if you use a mount, this is vital.  Stat food is too good to eat, so you need to gorge yourself on regular food, while having the stat food in the &quot;next to be eaten&quot; slot.  Innate metabolism keeps you ahead of eating your stat food by accident.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There's only 1 reason one would enjoy playing a Shaman in EQ at this point of the game, imo. Shaman's are the master of nothing really, yet in a situation where you don't need the &quot;masters&quot; in a certain area(healing, crowd control, DPS etc.), the Shaman is somewhat able to replace more classes in a group than any other class. <br />
<br />
That said, Virulent Paralysis is something that gives you another tool to compensate for the lack of a specialty, actually not just that, as it will add an ability to your character that is unique in all of EQ. It's not a root/DoT tool, it's something that allows you to do things no other class can.<br />
<br />
Ever tried soloing the shroom king without it?<br />
Ever tried NToV(1 group killing the dragons or just clearing trash) without VP(Virulent Paralysis)<br />
Ever tried soloing in VT without VP<br />
<br />
These are just a few things where VP will enable you to do things, which used to be impossible. VP for me ranks on top of the Shaman PoP abilities(too bad it will never interrupt a cast in PvE, though).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think he was being a little sarcastic there, but let me explain.  VP gives us something we've never had, semi-automatic CC.  We can CC the manual was without it (I.E., gain aggro, move away and root), but VP is different.  A mob is beating on your cleric (who may or may not be stunned now) you target and shoot with your 2 second root, and the mob gets kicked back, out of melee range from the grateful groupie.  <br />
<br />
Because of VP, anytime I'm in PoV, I always tell the puller to come back with at least 2-4 mobs.....  the killing is faster that way (more, if we have a chanter in the group)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Another reason to stay 60/61 to work on AA is if most of your guild is mid 50s, and you still want to be able to group with them. Even though the exp range has been broadened, many things will still start to go light blue at 65 if you're hunting with lower level people from your guild, etc.<br />
<br />
A good reason to get to 62 before working on Canni V is to be able to zone into HoH, BoT, now they're open. Plus, 62 spells aren't hard to get.<br />
<br />
A good reason to not split AA/normal exp - it'll take you longer to get your next AA point or your next level. If you are always putting 100% exp into one or the other depending on your goals, you'll get the AA point or level sooner, and be more powerful when you work on the next step - it's more efficient. The only reason to not do this is psychological. That is not to say that it's not a good reason. :) For example,  you may want to earn AA &quot;in the background&quot; so put 10% in AA, most in normal, or conversely, you want to work mostly on AA, but put some in normal exp, so when you go back to levelling, the next level is that much nearer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do racial exp penalties apply to AA points?<br />
<br />
No, racial exp penalities do not apply to the rate at which a player gains AA points. The class-based exp penalty was removed from everquest years ago and that does not apply to AA points either.<br />
<br />
-------<br />
<br />
I'm hesistent to reply to this, but there has been talk that racial exp penalties apply to AAs when you do split XP. Now I have not done any experiments to confirm this unfortunately. But the talk I've heard seems to make some sense and depends on how Sony programmed this. Is the AA XP split off before or after racial XP penalty is applied for a kill?<br />
<br />
Because of this, as an Ogre, I never do an XP split. I wish someone would do the test to confirm this. I don't XP consistently in the same spot to do an appropriate test unfortunately.<br />
<br />
As a level 65, I'd like to be running a 90/10 split to slowly fill up my level 65 bar to counter deaths, but for now I just keep level 65 at 10% for now and switch back and forth on occasion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">1. Level to 65 before any AA.<br />
2. Level to 60/61, stop and do AAs, then level to 65.<br />
3. Work on AA steadily while levelling<br />
<br />
<br />
Explanation for Case 1: <br />
Already strongly stated.<br />
<br />
Explanation for Case 2: <br />
Levelling to 60/61 gives you a reasonable chance of getting a group in PoV/PoS, where the xp is noticeably better than tier 1. If you have Torpor and Malo, then you have the two most important shaman spells for grouping purposes already. The effects of Canni V should not be underestimated, and in combination with Torpor you will rarely have any mana problems ever again. What's more, you can save the time you used to spend pressing Canni IV, and add to the groups efficiency. RS3 is also well worthwhile stopping a moment for if you hunt or raid in indoor zones still - it takes little time to get and can make the difference between life and death.<br />
<br />
Once you have those AA I see no real argument (other than the points below) for not pressing on to 65. The benefits of 65 are too big too ignore (says the level 63 shaman! :p)<br />
Explanation for Case 3: <br />
Apart from the psycholigcal effect mentioned above, you may want to do this to keep pace with friends so you can still hunt the same mobs and share the xp evenly. Other than that, I see little point in &quot;dabbling&quot;. Either go all out for AA, or all out for 65. The (possible) exceptions to this are run speed 3 and canni V</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">First, when to get your AA's.

Run3 WILL eventually save your life while soloing indoors, so don't put off getting it.<br />
<br />
If gaining in power as rapidly as possible is your goal, then splitting experience is the worst thing you can do, because it postpones both leveling and getting AA points. It's best to put 100% towards one or the other. The only time I split mine is sometimes going 90% AA, 10% regular to maintain an exp buffer for a level.<br />
<br />
I agree that Spirit Call is a fun AA and worth purchasing.<br />
<br />
My opinion on some of the perhaps underrated AA skills:<br />
<br />
SCM3 - no question a great skill. The mana savings is very noticeable.<br />
<br />
VP - I got this recently and think it's fantastic. The knockback makes CC almost trivial. No longer do you have to initially get agro with slow to drag the mob away from the group to root it.<br />
<br />
Given the recent expansion of the blue con range, I see no reason to stop leveling at 60 to do AAs. Quiescence and Malos are a lot less rare than Torpor and Malo, the higher dots have no DD component making root dotting easier, it's easier to get in groups at higher levels, and the experience just comes in faster.</div></div><hr />

It ought to be noted that unless you are a raiding shaman, there is flat out no reason to get Mass Group Buff.  I say this because I got MGB and I regret doing so.  Our &quot;raids&quot; have three groups max, it just wasn't worth 9 AA points, I got it because we were briefly allied with a larger group of people and I had 8 AA pts banked for another skill.<br />
<br />
For a shaman who solos/xps a lot and has Torpor/Q, maxxing SCRM and QB after getting Can 5 ranks pretty high on the list.  I would rank SCRM over QB simply because most of the mobs you will be fighting will be slowed anyway, and channeling a torpor/Q isn't that hard.  Obviously without Torpor/Q these don't rate that high.<br />

<br />
Run3 <br />
Regen3 <br />
MC3 <br />

One thing I have not seen mentioned at all is Innate Enlightenment.  I max out at 280 wis with KEI/VoQ. Is it worth putting points into this and Planar Power to boost that upwards?<br />
<br />
Another AA I have never seen discussed is Alchemy Mastery. I sell tons of potions in the Bazaar. I havent spent the points on this yet, but I sure think about it every time I fail a combine.

&quot;When is the best time to start working on AA?&quot;<br />
3. Work on AA steadily while levelling<br />
<br />
I believe it is important for all to get thier run2or 3  at least for raids or exp in dungeons.  I had thought regen 3 was important as well. . but eheh. . i didn't see a diff when i got it, so wouldn't suggest takin' the time on that one. More likly from waht i've read here that metab3 is better way to go later on.<br />
<br />
2. Level to 60/61, stop and do AAs, then level to 65.<br />
 After acomplishin' that goal i would go with #2.  To get some key aa's MC3 <br />
Canni5<br />
metabolism 3   ( those are ones i saw listed repetedly and agreed with)<br />
<br />
I personally would go for more, as I wish to feel my shammy is a very functional one at every level.  Therefor If i feel for example that I need more hitpoints badly I would go and put pts into durability because i feel it would benifit me as an easy upgrade so to speak.  I am not knowledgable enough to give a listing of what would be worth stopping for or isn't, in general.  I can tell you that i stopped for run2 regen3 and wisdom3 (as i upgraded gear for higher hps/ac and felt a lil wisdom might make it an even trade (as i lost considerable wisdom to the upgrades)<br />
I am 55 now and i have 8 AA's and yes i am still doin' it. . . Yes, you can be just as efficent if you go all the way up to the top and than do it.  But some don't level as fast or play as much as others ( myself ), so will be at certain lvls alot longer and these little AA's can be a real help in an otherwise frustratin' point in your exp life.  Eheh also i tend to like to explore as many areas for my lvls as i can. . so you get the picture . . i guess i hold onto my &quot;Cubhood&quot;.<br />
<br />
So i'm thinkin in essence you could actually write the FAQ on this if you made it into a few topics.<br />
<br />
Say. . . like i've seen in here a few times <br />
Raiding Shamans<br />
Soloin' Shamans<br />
if you tackle it like that i feel you will hit both sides and thier belifs tend to be simular for each group.  There is an apparent grey area wich seems to me to be your EX: #2 But you would still cover the mass majority.  Maybe postin' as much in a disclaimor of sorts would be a good idea too. . . <br />
<br />
<br />
anyways i'm long winded eheh. . .<br />

3) The logistics of memorizing a spell, casting it, recovering the mana, and then switching back to the original memorized spell are tiresome.  Many shaman do not bother to actually continuously keep SoW memorized (Black Fur Boots &gt; All).</div></div><hr />

I see lots of VP with Spirit Call AA's in addition in the line up here.  I know I love to raid and have been following the raiding shaman line of AA's, but there seems to be a lot of eye candy AA's that are being proposed.  Especially, for the solo shaman here.  Hell I have specialized in EVO of all things good and bad.  I like Jin's train of thought there on available AA's.  <br />

Hail,<br />
<br />
I would also recommend bumping VP3 up higher on the list as well for soloers.  A virtually guaranteed root (when preceded by Malicious Decay) that will last longer than the refresh rate of the ability itself (though by only a few seconds) lets us permanently root any single mob without any mana cost.  This works really well when fighting mobs that will shred a shaman within melee range, and precludes the need for even casting Turgur's in a single mob root/rot situation.  <br />
<br />
The additional benefit that the social aggro on the recipient of VP is generated from where the mob LANDS (instead of where struck) makes this ability even more valuable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Hey Frek, I haven't gotten VP yet, but have a question on the comment you made about where the aggro is generated from.  Are you saying that if I VP'd a mob that was standing in a doorway into the next room, that the rest of the mobs in the room (if they aggro'd Line of Sight) would not aggro?  I ask this because I tend to pull in LDON hard missions a lot, and can think of numerous 3-4 pulls where I could knock the pulls down to 2-3 pulls if this was the case by rooting one of the mobs into another room or their chamber prior to pulling the rest (I really don't like pacify unless it's a suck group, then I wouldn't be in it anyways, or it's a 4+ pull or named +2).<br />
<br />
If this is the case I'm going to train up to VP3 asap (if I'm going for VP1 might as well hit up VP3 for the extended duration and stuff).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Hail,<br />
I do not recommend wasting AA points in this ability.<br />
The description on Castersrealm...I would recommend ignoring Chanzg from this quote alone.  Castersrealm is notorious for having blatantly incorrect information.<br />
Are you saying that if I VP'd a mob that was standing in a doorway into the next room, that the rest of the mobs in the room (if they aggro'd Line of Sight) would not aggro?  Short answer: It depends.  <br />
<br />
Longer answer:  It is not a guarantee.  The spell IS resisted quite often by mobs with inherently high (&amp; even w/ 'normal&quot;) disease resistance.  There are many factors that come into play.  Social aggro radius, the distance of the push (VP3 (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3276&amp;source=Live)  moves a mob '16' for distance) and the resistance of the mob all come into play.  You CAN use it to TRY to separate one mob from tightly packed nearby mobs w/ a pull by reversing the direction you are facing &amp; smacking your VP key. IF...<br />
1) The spell isn't resisted.<br />
2) You angled the knockback correctly to maximize distance from the nearby mobs.<br />
3) The knockback pushes the mobs sufficient distance to be greater than the normal social aggro radius of the nearby mobs  (which will need to be very small for this to work right).<br />
...then it can work the way you describe.  But don't bet the ranch on it working. :D   It is fun to try though, and when you pull it off it can amaze your friends.<br />
<br />
The fact that the root lasts LONGER than the refresh time gives you a mana-free root that should last forever if left unattended and you had pre-cast Malicious Decay.  Obviously, for attempting mob separation you don't have the option of prepping w/ Malicious though, so trying that is really a gambit unless you know your target is vulnerable to disease based spells.  I particularly enjoy camping outside the pig stables in Tactics using Malicious Decay + VP3 for soloing the Diakus (even the nasty 1k HT'ing SK's) and not ever getting hit by them.<br />
<br />
Additionally, having a DR-based root even with its inherent limitations can be very valuable to mobs that have insanely high MR.  Mobs that normally prevent you from root parking with our traditional root-line of spells CAN get parked with MD+VP.<br />
<br />
This is a very valuable &amp; underrated AA in my opinion.  It is a nice ability that I feel every shaman should have in their playbook.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Please look at THIS THREAD by Jinheim (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16806&amp;highlight=Virulent+Paralysis) for more VP information (with pictures! :D ).<br />
<br />
I hope that answers your question Bloxr.  Chanzg, I recommend you study Lucy &amp; experiment on your own (once you have VP3) instead of going by Castersrealm &amp; a few Tier1/2 experiences for basing your opinions about this AA.<br />

I have never gone into the bazaar and not been able to purchase stat food for a reasonable price. <br />

Personally I would rather spend an hour or so cash farming or just sell the junk you normally get while doing whatever to get my food than to go farm whatever it is makes your particular stat food of choice.<br />

If your money concerns are that truly, the go buy some junk food from a vender and force feed yourself. <br />

IMO:<br />
There are better things to do and more important things going on in the game to worry about open bag, take food out of bag, force feed, put food back, close inventory every few minutes.  <br />

The one thing i say tho, you dont need run3, its nice, my 56 cleric has run3 and it rocks, but I think it was stated if you hunt indoors lots if not, its not that useful. I am always sow'd (Billy) or on my mount. Regen3 and Metabolism3 are what i took so far, and have worked nicely. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">To share my path to-date:<br />
<br />
run3<br />
regen3<br />
mc3<br />
canni5<br />
mgb<br />
scr3<br />
scrm<br />
qb1<br />
<br />
And that's where I stand now.  That's 55 AA points, so should provide a fairly good base of info for up-and-coming shamans.<br />
<br />
I'm a do-it-all shaman... one who solos, groups, raids (although on a smaller scale), and partakes in a lot of guild arena bashes.  So I've had to fight the urge to get a few of the &quot;funner&quot; AAs in favor of getting the &quot;boring but necessary&quot; AAs.  Canni5 is incredible.  SCRM makes Torpor last 2 extra ticks, and greatly reduces the amount of time you spend buffing in groups/raids.  MC3, although a pre-requisite for canni5, is still a worthy AA just for increasing your mana regen.  MGB is such a life-saver on raids, and is very fun for the generous types who like to sit in PoK and buff the masses.<br />
<br />
My next AAs I believe will be spirit call 1 and virulent paralysis... 'cause I think these 2 abilities would give me a huge lift when partaking in the guild Arena bashes.  :)  Great for parking caster pets and interrupting casters.  And fun, to boot, even if not totally incredible in other situations.<br />
<br />
But after that I'll get back on pace with the non-glamorous AAs like SCM3, SCF3 and FoM3 (I nuke a lot in raids/groups).<br />
<br />
And then I'll go nuts on the defensive AAs...  ND3, CA3, LR5, CS3, ID5...<br />
<br />
Somewhere in there I'll throw in RC of some level... and then after the defense AAs, I'll go back and finish up VP, RC, and SC.<br />
<br />
After that... it's just icing on the cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">VP3 is horribly unpredictable in LDoN if you don't use MD or ID first.  I can't count the number of times I have parked a mob on inc and have VP wear off before it even finishes the knockback effect :(<br />
<br />
On the other hand, as soon as MD or ID is applied then even LDoN mobs are pretty much perma rooted.  They do resist some still but it's pretty uncommon.  I'm not sure if this has been mentioned, but keep in mind that VP has no recast delay and that MD and ID are extremely fast casting.  You can cast VP immediately after MD or ID.  This works great for multiple mob pulls since it eliminates a mob before it even gets into camp.<br />
<br />
If you decide to use VP (or heck even root) as a CC method make sure to let everyone know that you will be knockback parking mobs, especially if you have a beastlord in the group.  I think a beastlords favorite activity is to pet off-tank :)<br />
<br />
If you are a soloing Shaman then VP3 is up there with Canni5, seriously.  This is THE best solo tool you have access to.  I have my combat spam (mob hitting me, missing me, stuff dying, and nuke damage) sent to a seperate window.  In my combat window I will fill it up with death messages from mobs without having a single line of damage in it, VP3 is just that effective.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, I would say SCF and FoM are underrated as well and I wish I had gotten them earlier.  ND is highly overrated because I always have virtue on me, so another couple hundred hp's isn't that big of a deal for the AA's required.<br />
<br />
I tend to fully complete a line of AA before I move on to another and my choices have been:<br />
<br />
Run3, Regen3, MC3, Canni5, SCM3, SCR3, MGB (bleh, got this and then retired for months with no guild to come back to when I started playing again), LR5, VP3, SCRM, FoM1 (currently working to FoM3).  When FoM is finished I am going to max ID.<br />
<br />

<br />
I was skeptical when I first read that you should get to 65 asap and forgo heavy AAing early...because I thought it would be fun to get some AA earlier and I thought the game might be stale once I hit 65.  However, having recently hit 65 and having done little AAing on the way I would have to fully agree with Jinheim.<br />
<br />
I only got run3, regen3, and maybe a little MC before I hit 65 - because I wanted a title and because when I was 64 I went 50/50 for a while til I acquired Q (I couldn't face hitting 65 with no spells).<br />
<br />
Now that I'm 65 I've been gaining AAs very quickly, feel much more free in what I can do (since I don't have to worry about leveling), get groups easier than ever, don't worry about dying (I have a little xp padding but usually get rezzed if I do die), and I'm generally enjoying the game more than ever.<br />
<br />
I don't think you really need canniV from 60 to 65 unless you solo a lot or group with reckless folks - otherwise you should never have mana issues with CanniIV available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Just an observation:<br />
<br />
I think that it is important to keep in mind that there is no inherently &quot;right&quot; order in which to get ones AAs. It will really depend on ones playstyle and ones goals (and one's mood at the time).<br />
<br />
I would also emphasise that it is not even desirable to try to standardise the order in which shaman pursue their AA progression: In my opinion, the best thing about the introduction of AA abilities was that it stopped the amorphous sameness of shaman. IT provided a diversity of viable paths for progression without the cookie-cutter formula mentality that made everyone pursue the same path.<br />
<br />
You guys would probably laugh your little cotton socks off at my AA progression - not that I have many AA, but my progression is not &quot;wrong&quot;, it is right for me, and it makes my style different from yours...and that is a good thing!</div></div><hr />

yea SCM helps alot. It was my first investment cause I realized that I wanted to do more stuff with my time then cannibalize constantly. If you are doing ldon keeping SLTW, BoR, and FA (2-3melees) and main healing you will feel the need for mana savings big time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">SCM was one of my favorite AA.

<br />
Regen3 / STA5 (lol, I can be different too!) / MC3 / Canni 5 / MGB / ND3 / SCM / SCR / VP3 / SCRM / RC2 / QB2 / PP2 / HG3 / HA3 / AHA 3 / AHG 3 / Suspend Minion 1.<br />

EDIT: Suspend Minion is a godsend. I'm two AA away from the second level, arguably one of the better AA's I've currently got. The ability to keep puppy with me as we move through GOD sewers/Tipt/Vxed is WELL WORTH the AA's.<br />

&quot;Spell Casting Mastery (SCM) This ability reduces the amount of mana used when casting spells by 2.5% at rank 1, 5% at rank 2 and 10% at rank 3. Spell Casting Mastery stacks with mana reducing focus effects.&quot;<br />
<br />
But EQ Sham AA Area says this.<br />
&quot;Spell Casting Mastery - 5/10/30% chance of increasing 'specialisation activation'. What this effectively means is better mana efficiency on spells in your specialisation.&quot;<br />

All the people in my guild told me not to split the xp pool because you actually lose some xp to rounding when you do.  Say you get 23 point of experience for mob x, and you have your split at 70/30:  You should get 16.1 points for your regular pool, but ifrom what I'm told, it's going to get rounded to 16.

PP is a good AA to get but I wouldn't put it at the top of my list.  Mostly I liked the increase in HPs by being able to gain more stam.<br />
<br />
IE is a real waste of time.  At these levels 1 wis = 1 mana. So for each rank of IE you gain 10 wis and 10 mana.  =/  At least this is what Magelo shows happening when you increase mana when you are around 300 wis.  I looked at this a couple months ago so if you know differently please let me know.<br />
<br />
PS.  Does anyone know a site that gives the real info on what each AA does?  Like cast time, refresh, counters, etc.  Lucy is unreliable on these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>psionic11</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Having dinged 61, with no Torpor/Malo yet, and having only 3 AA's saved up, I started mulling over my AA path.<br />
<br />
I usually put together my LDON groups. I have gotten to the point now where I can log on to EQ and START a good, often hard, ADV within 20 min or so.  I do this by inviting from guild, friends list, and by hopping to each ADV camp and personally inviting.  I do not worry about not getting a cleric or enchanter, which saves tons of time.  I can Main heal, and often get the dr00ds to do that.  Sometimes, as long as we have great DPS, I would go with just one non-pulling subtank.<br />
<br />
But many wondered &quot;who will pull&quot; or &quot;we have no paci&quot; or &quot;there's no cleric?!&quot; or &quot;don't we need an enchanter?&quot;<br />
<br />
When they were surprised by the answers &quot;I will pull&quot; or &quot;I will be main healer&quot; or &quot;I got CC&quot;....they obviously didn't group with many aggressive shamen.  Sometimes I struggled to hold it together, but with planning, communication, and teamwork, it is more successful than not.<br />
<br />
Replacing the cleric was easy after 58 and Kragg's Mending (and a 58 dr00d).  Replacing the enchanter was tougher, but pet off-tanking and root-parking can get the job done.  Replacing/augmenting paci pulling using green doggie pet pulling was awesome when I learned how to do it after watching SKs do it.  And finally getting our AE slow Tigir's Insects and USING it makes CC even better.  Having 2 slows memmed adds real CC to the group (helps having 4.3k HP and 1k AC....)<br />
<br />
Best yet was getting VIRULENT PARALYSIS.  This AA simply rocks.  Yes it is occasionally resisted, but for 3 measly AA points (with NO pre-requisites!!!!) at level 61, I am totally satisfied that this is my FIRST AA purchase.  No having to wait 23 AA points later to get that first AA rush from Canni5.  <br />
<br />
Bargain basement AA shopping for 3 points!!  A new dimension added to the versatile shammy.  For the aggressive or solo shaman, I highly recommend this as a first if you are 61 with but a few points to spend.  You can then keep on trucking to 65 and the more 'conventional' AA's, but will have the instant gratification of a really useful, &quot;Advanced Ability&quot;... Overpulls are no longer a scary thing in LDONs for me 8)</div></div><hr />

Awsome, get even more value out of it, keep Insidious Decay mem'd!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Just want to say thank you for this VERY interesting thread. Plenty for us all to learn here.<br />
<br />
I am a 65 Vah Shir Shaman with 160 AAs and I think I got VP3 at around the 70 AA mark (can't remember for sure) and I am not exaggerating when I say it has made me more useful in all situations.<br />
<br />
It's a root, it's a knockback, it's crowd control!!<br />
<br />
I often have Malicious Decay memmed now exactly for this purpose in High Risk Ldon and GoD groups. Only the most resistant mobs will break this root early or resist it (hynids in vxed for example) after being debuffed with MD.<br />
<br />
imho VP3 (much better than VP &lt; 3 btw) should be high on any high end shaman's list.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">After Can V, VP3 is my favorite AA, bar none.  Only mobs I've ever had break early if I MD them are the golems in the GoD areena area (blanking, can't remember the zone name).  Everything else stays rooted just a tad longer than the refresh on VP.  What could be better than a mana free perma root/knockback?<br />
<br />
If you solo at all, VP is your best friend.  Just find a rootable,non-summoning, melee mob and root/rot to your heart's content.  I don't even mem Turgur's when I'm doing this, just keep your VP timer visible and you'll never need to slow 'em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I know the Arena you mean. name also escapes me...silly GoD zone names...<br />
<br />
The hynids in vxed/tipt are also very resistant -- it wont last on them either.<br />
<br />
Actually i solo very little for a shaman, althuogh when i do VP is alwasy used :)<br />
<br />
I tend to use VP a lot for CC on raids and groups.<br />

Have the Omens AA's been confirmed to be a static cost and not incremental?  Hard to believe that so many previously incremental cost AA's would be so few points now :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
- but it's not guaranteed to break, and I find that it usually does not - but it does when you're least prepared for it to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Vortecks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Can VP be broken by the DD portion of our &gt;lvl 65 DoT's?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes it can be.. but i have seen it hold too through several DD's...<br />
<br />
VP is a GREAT aa to get.  Don't even hesitate to get it.  If you are EP flagged... you can solo in fire.  I've killed there for hours and i have NEVER had VP break on a mob.  If you ldon, it works great there too.  In OoW it is hit and miss..  I would say it works 60% of the time, but most of the time it is becuase of the moband it's resist lvl.  I can say that i have not had VP hold for full duration in OoW yet, so it is only a quick fix to get you out of a jam. <br />
<br />
sum it up.. VP rocks.. get it<br />
