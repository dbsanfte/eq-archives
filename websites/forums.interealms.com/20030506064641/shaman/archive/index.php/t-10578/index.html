<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all. I'm looking to invest some plat into making the Earring of the Solstice. Just wondering what it would cost me to make this earring and is it worth it in the long run or should I just save the plat for something better now that we have the bazaar and PoP. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its a pretty nice earring, and worth the cost IMO.  A few months ago, I did the quest 4 times for my 2 characters and wifes 2 characters.  Ended up running me around 6-7k I think for each one.  <br />
<br />
I mostly purchased the things needed in the Bazaar but I got a few expensive pieces from guildies at cost.  Ive seen people auctioning the entire kit for 8-9k or thereabouts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it is worth it. I have been working on mine for a few days, not wanting to spent all that hard earned money. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just a little up date of faction for this. You CAN complete this quest for the earring with &quot;Apprehensively&quot; faction. I did this last night and got my earring. <br />
<br />
You can also go see Trade Commissioner Henry in SH, run a few reports around to vendors for him and raise your faction to all the merchants in SH. The Commissioner and Rebecca Cabbageleaf are on the same faction table (IT WOULD APPEAR), so if you want to know your faction just con the Commissioner.<br />
<br />
Making the earring, Put all nine items in the Forge (there are too in the bazaar) and click combine. It is fail safe, I have no smithing skills. You get the earring (DRU Only) and a spell, take the earring to Rebecca Cabbageleaf in FG, give to her, get your new kick butt earring.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On my server, if you search in the bazaar, you can get the pieces to make the earring for under 7kpp. It's well worth the price, imo. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Styks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On bristlebane it runs around 7 - 8 k a kit is about 9 or 10 depending on the PC that is auctioning.  Also, when you do the combine, it has to be a non cultural forge.  IE you can't use one in say Qeynos.  Bazaar has one, SH has one those are probibly your best bet.  A fine earring for the money involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did it on Mith Marr for under 5K, tho someone in guild gave me the robe.  Just keep an eye on the bazaar for the best prices.<br />
