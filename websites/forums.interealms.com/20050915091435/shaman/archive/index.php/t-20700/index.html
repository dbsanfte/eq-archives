I don't understand how you play to level 54 and don't know the name of your own race. You are a Vah Shir, not a &quot;shar val&quot;. It's almost as bad as people who play Iksars calling them &quot;iskars&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyway, now that I have that off my chest...<br />
<br />
Go do seafuries in OOT if you care more about money than xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure if you'd be able to at 54, but soloing nurga is always good plat. The mobs drop plat and occasionally gems, and there's a high number of named in the zone. I haven't seen it myself but others who've camped it say there's a spot to pull from from which you can easily get six named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I camp nurga at 53 only camp one named atm though traiter something dont remember his name but drops sleeves of the adept that sell for 4-5k on TZ. easy camp once you break it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Boilerterry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my 50s I did the boats in Dulak, could clear 1K/hr easy there, that was a while ago, so it may be nerfed, but worth a check, other good spots are Acrylia caverns, but can be rough there untill 60s</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd get to indiff to CoV so you can single pull Wyverns and sell to the Otters... I'd also Bind in a far corner of the zone and pick up a Spiritstone for your hometown...<br />
