<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So we basically have our best Emperor kill so far.  Only 5 people died and the MT tanked the whole fight.  Fantastic, yeah?  Right after loot/stats (ring, slippers, shawl) were called I go LD.  It turns out the server got locked.  Since the server went down so quickly, there was no proof of our victory in the logs.  We weren't even awarded rifts.  The GM's gave us rez's and were keeping the room clear but it still sucks.  It was so late that we opted not to try again.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any fun stories like that?<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way, here is what it looks like when you log into a full repop of Emperor room.<br />

Well his magelo profile at http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78663 puts him at 2700hps unbuffed so fully buffed he's probably right around 4700hp so I'd assume that ss was taken shortly before he got killed. Altho it was probablty actually multiple ss's pasted together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>korinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My guild was just about to Kill triplets in Ntov. We had killed everything else up to them. When the zone crashed and it crashed hard. Took about half hour to get back in. When we finally did we were faced with a total repop. <br />
<br />
It was a nice loot week, cause we were able to techniqly clear Ntov twice but popping in to Flurrys is not fun at all. I popped in with no less than 6 mobs I lasted all of 6 sec and I had 4k hps fully buffed haha..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We've had some lame issues with server/zone resets recently, but not nearly as bad as that. Just last night, we were about to kill the Idol and try the Avatar (we've never killed Avatar yet, we get him to about 5 to 15% every time, and then wipe). We had killed Tormax/Statue the night before but it was too late for Avatar. The next day we killed Vindi (while waiting on people and awarded a bard his BP), then about 5 minutes later Kael crashed. All spawns reset (no Idol up), and the bard no longer had her shiny new Vindi BP.<br />
<br />
Also, about a week ago we had wiped to Lord Vyemm (dear god fix his stupid broken AE) and as our people were logging back in to res we got that &quot;Servers going down in 15 minutes!!&quot; message. As it turned out, it was much closer to 5 minutes than 15 minutes. So about 80% of us had the servers go down with our corpses in Vyemm's lair. When server came back up, there was Vyemm with his 2 guards respawned killing everyone that logged in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Targar, by no means was this showing off.  I just wanted to talk.  The whole night wasn't wasted--we got 3 more people keyed and people got to practice strategy.<br />
<br />
Banthar, I think with yummy Halas pies I have 4725hps or close to that.  Since Canni5 I've gone HP crazy.<br />
<br />
Janin2, we have a pretty healthy crew for the Emperor fight.  I think usually we have 80 to 90 people.<br />
<br />
Murphy, there was no warning.  The server just went down out of the blue.  I actually logged in ok but a cleric trained me when he logged in.  :( <br />
<br />
Anyways, I know this happens to all of us once.  Our guild has been through a lot and we will keep on going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Our first Vulak kill (server first about a year ago) got wiped when the servers crashed about 5 mins after Vulak died and we were about to award loot.<br />
<br />
Yeah it sucks, but we have had more times where we got the loot and then the crash reset the mob right back up to kill him again for more loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Jaradis, what you said totally put everything in perspective.  Thanks for showing the glass is always half full.<br />
<br />
Now Part II.  We killed Emperor 45 minutes ago and server just crashed  LOL.  I hope the rollback doesn't screw us up.  I have seen other servers get locked several nights in a row.  I guess it is that time for Quellious.  :)</div></div><hr />
