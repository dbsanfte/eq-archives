<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">11:30 am EST and I get the logging into server message, then the screen goes black and never connects.  Anyone else having problems logging in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just tried it Thunderwolfjr and I got a message saying that the messaging software is a different version. It looks like they just ran a patch of some kind. I normally run the exe that bypasses the file check, so I ran the checker and there were new files to download. There weren't 2 hours ago so I assume its fairly recent.<br />
<br />
Make sure you re-run the file checker and try again. I just got in no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I saw the same message as Karshak, rebooted and logged in no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey guys, thanks for the input, but still no luck on my end.  Re-booted and did a complete file check with patcher.  Still get a time out after several minutes when trying to get to the server page.  Last message I see after putting in my password is &quot;logging into server&quot;, then nothing.  If I wait long enough it just tells me I timed out.  Any other thoughts or work-arounds?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OK, online knowledgebase is useless, and no tech support on Sat.  I can't get logged in.  Put in password and hit enter, &quot;connecting to log in server, please wait...&quot;  and nothing.  Also, I can't even get to the chat screen, same problem, says it's logging into server, then nothing.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Enormious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There seems to be a problem with customized log in screens. Try moving eqlsPlayerData.ini from your Everquest folder to your desktop and try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There seems to be a problem with customized log in screens. Try moving eqlsPlayerData.ini from your Everquest folder to your desktop and try again.<br />
<br />
OK, listen Crucible: &quot;Enormious is the Man!&quot;<br />
<br />
That was it, custom log in screen no longer working after stealth patch this morning.  Moved file as suggested and got right in.  Real pain, since there is no error message or hint as to what the problem is, just won't load screen and times out.<br />
<br />
Thanks a bunch E<br />
<br />
btw, your custom magelo kicks @ss</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">um.. just edit the SeenWebOrder=false line (don't remember exactly) to say true instead of false.<br />
You don't have to lose your custom login skin.</div></div><hr />
