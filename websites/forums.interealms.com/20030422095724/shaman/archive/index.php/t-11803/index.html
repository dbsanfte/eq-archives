<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks very good at 14 except you have far too much wis gear.  Wisdom doesn't help as much at 14 as HP and AC.  I would recommend losing the forest loop and the PBBs and the platinum Jasper Rings for HP gear. You should be able to sell that stuff for enough plat to replace them easily.<br />
<br />
Ear - Black Sapphire Electrum Earring<br />
Fingers - Velium Fire Wedding Rings (Platinum are good if you need to save a little)<br />
Wrists - Chipped Bone Bracer(the focus is amazing at 14 and gets better all the way up to 44) and ? (anyone know of a great item?  Too many mediocre items to name one, just look in the bazaar)<br />
<br />
You will most likely replace the chest and shoulder pieces before 50 as well.  And with no stats on the boots they will probably be a candidate for the recycle bin too.<br />
<br />
Don't be in too much of a rush.  The game is changing rapidly right now with lots of nice items showing up in good quantities.  The great low end items today may not be the same ones tomorrow.  Buy what you can afford and use now.  It will help you to level and make money faster to buy better upgrades. <br />
<br />
Always remember FT&gt;REGEN&gt;HP&gt;AC&gt;WIS.  The first two steps of that are likely to be out of your reach for a while yet though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What he said. Lose the WIS rings, get the HP/AC rings, much better at any level in fact.<br />
<br />
If you can, try to pick up a Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate - it has stackable regen, and that helps a LOT at low levels, and after 24 it makes cannibalizing a snap.<br />
<br />
Wrists. Hmm... Chipped bone bracer for one, and then... Arctic Wyvern? There's a new one from Gunthak which is nice, Rust Encrusted Bracer... <br />
<br />
Dont' worry about increasing your WIS over 150 until you are level 40. Before that, remember the last 3 steps of Catty's formula...<br />

HP&gt;AC&gt;WIS<br />
