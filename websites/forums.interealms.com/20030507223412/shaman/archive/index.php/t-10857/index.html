<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I leave my trader on at night when I am sleeping in hopes of becoming filthy rich.  Seems like every morning I find myself at the screen before server select - connect screen - sometimes I can connect and go into game - sometimes when I get to character select my mouse pointer freezes in upper left corner and I have to 3 finger salute to get out.  Rarely my dsl connection is gone.  I have no problems when I am playing for hours on end.  This happens to 2 machines - so my thinking is its not machine related.  Both running windows XP.<br />
<br />
Any ideas for trader connectivity issues?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Last nite I logged on my disconnected trader to see if he had sold anything, when someone approached me and started looking at my wares.  I was disconneted and sent to sign in screen.  When I came back I found I had a ton of pp and decided he must have made a purchase and possibly somehow that disconnected me?????<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am having the same problem and I 2 box.  1 computer has no problems but the one I usually leave up in the bazaar gets disconnected all the time.  I notice the left percent (I think it is outgoing pack loss) starts jumping up.  If it hits 100% you disconnect.<br />
<br />
I tried lowering my datarate not sure if this is helping yet.  I have had the same configuration for a couple of months and no problems till last patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tilanali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have this problem sometimes too.  I have found that if I turn off all chat channel filters, ie. ooc, auction, shout, ... turn them ALL off so only the minimum is displayed, then make sure /log is *OFF*, and finally double check to make sure distance clipping is set to minimum, I don't go LD while in bazaar.  If I forget one or more of these things, I invariably go LD at some point and I wake up to the character select screen, and I'm no richer  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimmlukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a problem with the BadWord filter in the bazaar: some /auc and /ooc's have an error that freaks out the badWord filter.<br />
<br />
You can use:<br />
/filter badword<br />
<br />
to toggle the badword filter and turn it OFF.<br />
<br />
This solved the problem of getting disconnected from the Bazaar for me - was happening on a regularly IRREGULAR basis since LoY came out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bazaar still has a habit of dumping large quantities of people at times.  I was moseying through Bazaar on my way to a vendor, when POOF, a bunch of folks just up and vanished.<br />
<br />
Another day, folks started randomly showing up at the succor point (right in front of the steps to Shadowhaven).  Dozens of AFK folks all in one spot -- looked like a kaleidoscope.<br />
<br />
And still another day, folks got TL'd back to their bind spot.  Wasn't an AE TL or so, it was randomly happening throughout the morning.  Nothing like a couple dozen people crammed onto the walkway by the soulbinder in Shadowhaven.  I think a few people got knocked into the water and drowned, too.</div></div><hr />
