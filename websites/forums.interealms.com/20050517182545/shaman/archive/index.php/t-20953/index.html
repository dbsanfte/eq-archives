<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thought this was humorous gang.  Its a post from a cleric to the SOE clerics boards about how their class is out of balance compared to shamen, druids and necros regarding the dots clerics get :D<br />
<br />
Too funny<br />

<br />
Our DoT are another example of useless spells for clerics. All the above you mention are true and can't see them changed unless there is a good hard look from the developers in cleric class. This is just 1 of the problems clerics have and need to be address.<br />
<br />
I'm sure he'd love to have 2/3 of his spellbook full of useless spells. (read stat buffs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hear hear. If even HALF the spells in my book were good all the time, I would be a happy Shaman.<br />
<br />
Poor clerics. They have a useless DoT spell. Well, maybe htey would like to trade it in for Spirit Quickening. Leet hammer pet DPS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's clear proof that clerics are unbalanced in EQ by all the retards and nimwits who are now clerics.  <br />
<br />
You can suck and be idiot and yet get so much more as a cleric than any other class.<br />
<br />
edit:  I'll add the proviso that clerics probably do have some beefs about certain things.  Everyone does.  Generally speaking, they way too much dominant healing, imho.  <br />
<br />
They can in fact do more than just heal, but who will let them do that when they are the only ones who can heal these days?</div></div><hr />
