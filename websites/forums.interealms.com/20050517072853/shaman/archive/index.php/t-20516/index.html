<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First, let me say that despite the title of this post this isn't meant to be a crybaby-post.  I realize that they are implementing a enw graphics engine and that little problems will be present in abundance for a while.<br />
<br />
So, if I'm not crying about the patch, what AM I posting for?<br />
<br />
Well, I wanted to get peoples opinions about the actual functionality of the new graphics engine.   For me, I saw this:<br />
<br />
1) increased frame rate<br />
2) slightly better looking movement/armour<br />
3) MUCH better performance running two EQ windows on the same machine<br />
4) targeting with f8 seems alot better<br />
5) geometry is kind of a problem.  small obstacles stop you dead, you no longer seem to slide off things like trees, and using your U key to activate things like zone-outs is alot more difficult<br />
6) also ran into some bugs with armour being drawn as very white<br />
7) if I went fullscreen on one of my EQ sessions, the other would not redraw (ever) when I left full-screen (unless I went full screen in that one, which would cause the original to freak out).<br />
<br />
Ohter than that, I didn't really notice any changes.<br />
<br />
So what else did you guys encounter that I didn't?  Like I said, I'm not really interested in complaining, I'm just trying to get a feel for whatI might run into in-game until they patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;1) increased frame rate&quot;<br />
     Not For me I got siginifigantly lower frame rate&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;2) slightly better looking movement/armour&quot;<br />
     I didnt really notice a difference<br />
   <br />
&quot;3) MUCH better performance running two EQ windows on the same machine&quot;<br />
     WEll I never used SoE's windowed mode I always used EQW and that ran 10x better than what I did last night running to EQ Windows<br />
<br />
&quot;4) targeting with f8 seems alot better &quot;<br />
     agree<br />
<br />
&quot;5) geometry is kind of a problem.  small obstacles stop you dead, you no longer seem to slide off things like trees, and using your U key to activate things like zone-outs is alot more difficult&quot;<br />
    this is also making boxing more difficult because my dorf gets stuck on everything<br />
<br />
&quot;6) also ran into some bugs with armour being drawn as very white&quot;<br />
     Now this i would like ... White plate armor is what I want to see on my paly LOL<br />
<br />
&quot;7) if I went fullscreen on one of my EQ sessions, the other would not redraw (ever) when I left full-screen (unless I went full screen in that one, which would cause the original to freak out).&quot;<br />
    I had several EQ crashes because of this<br />
   <br />
The gamma thing seems to be back for me ... remember when you had to change your gamma everytime you logged in??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mobs get plowed through walls now. Not all mobs/all walls but Reparm got pushed through a wall in Fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Improvements:  The sky is awesome, my horse seemed smoother when running (some folks are reporting the 100k mounts are slow however), video lag went way down, and the lighting effects seemed to be working a lot better.<br />
<br />
Problems:  Climbing stairs was very difficult last night, it seemed that a mob had to be nearly in spell casting range before I could click-target, my horse could not traverse an incline at all, mobs would *not* corner tank, arrows were freezing in mid-air and not disappearing, armor colors seemed to change to odd shades for no reason.<br />
<br />
We also discovered that the timers on a lot of detrimental spells are jacked up.  Bliss (54 sec. mez) was fading after 35-40 seconds, rez sickness was fading in about half the time it usually does, some AA abilities were resetting faster, etc.  Needless to say, the short duration mez made the Rathe Council all but impossible.  I'm sure this bug has nothing to do with the graphic engine change, but it caused a heck of a lot more problems for us last night than dorfs tripping over rocks did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had some major problems with movement and some with targeting.<br />
<br />
Been running directX9 for months now but did load the newest nvidia drivers while waiting for the patch to complete yesterday.<br />
<br />
I also got hung up on rocks, corners of buildings and other obstacles that were no issue in the past. Most the time I just backed up and took a wider corner.  Once I had to cast bear form to retrace my steps past a &quot;one way&quot; obstacle. <br />
<br />
The last couple of weeks I have been using bind vision to follow mobs thru the GoD Lair expedition in search of names that might drop my copy of the new slow.  I did this for 10 to 15 hours last weekend.  Invis up, get expediton, zone in, cast bind sight, check out zone, exit, rinse &amp; repeat. Never had any problems.  After the patch, my &quot;view&quot; fell under the world a couple times when mobs were going up stairs and seemed to get hung up.<br />
<br />
Also, targeting was significantly different. When targeting NPC's I often had trouble targeting past NPC's that were in the foregroud.  With the new patch, this seems significantly improved.<br />
<br />
However, we did Xegony last night and I was RGC'r and cleric healer. I had a horrible time trying to target players that were full screen right in front of me.  5 necros, 7 clerics, bard, mouse click after mouse click I could not target reliably.  I didn't seem to matter if they were on a horse or not,  if I needed to target someone, I had to type &quot;/tar so-an-so&quot;.  That was a real pain. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just got my bard speed horse from Emperor last night, and was really looking forward to zooming around on it.  It really sucked getting stuck on everything, even when no &quot;obstacles&quot; were in the way - I couldn't even run uphill in The Grey on it - guess horsie was getting his hooves stuck on a pebble.  Makes the horse darn near worthless ATM since I could just SOW and run and without having to stop every 5 seconds, I'd get there faster.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I didn't feel like the horse was all that much faster, in particular from a standing start, it took a long time to get to top speed.  I had a lizard (slowest) before.  Has anyone had experience with horse starting speed being very slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm running a Raedon 9600 with DX9 and latest drivers.<br />
<br />
I noticed numeroius problems with getting stuck while running, especially near edges of zones.  <br />
<br />
Lag was pretty wierd. Lag during the raids I was on was much lower than normal, noticeably so, but I noticed sometimes that the whole scene would &quot;freeze&quot; for a few moments.  This made mobs appear to &quot;warp&quot; along the path they were moving along.  Monks were saying that pathing was quite different in some instances.<br />
<br />
Shadowing was very wierd.  It seemed like the shadows were lagging behind the sun.  I was standing facing the setting sun in PoEB, and was fully in a shadow.  After the sun set, the raid was lighted up.  Most annoying was when the moon rose, it turned my beard white, so it was a different color than my hair (both should have been blonde).<br />
<br />
Another thing I noticed was outside the zone in to Takish in Oasis of Marr, when I cast group buffs, I did not get the usual messages that group members were buffed.  Same with the enchanter.  Apparently everyone got the buffs fine, just no message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MurojTruewolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Running Radeon 7000, with updated drivers and dx9. I can't say I noticed anything buggy graphics-wise, but as I posted in another message, the lag itself when I was in game was atrocious. I'm still hoping that it was simply my work firewall causing these probs, not EQ itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed that FA refreshed about twice as fast too, it kinda suprised me, but I won't complain.<br />
<br />
Now, if Trueshot on my ranger will refresh half the time, that would be awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Same for me on the colors issues. Armor colors have changed and they will visibly change on players as you get close to them or circle them.<br />
<br />
My hair color also changed, it use to be orange, and now no matter what, it looks very blonde in certain lights.<br />
<br />
Running along a wall is near impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Having problems myself.<br />
Can't get EQW to work properly, acts like there is 4 instances of everquest open, whenthere's only 2.  The windows also do not redraw and freak out like a poster above said (i run 2 accounts on one machine easily pre-patch).<br />
<br />
Zoning was -much- slower compared to my usual near insta zoning ability.  I also have a VERY odd occurance when I start eq.  I typically run mIRC, Trillian, Opera, and Winamp when I have EQ going.  IF i have any of those 4 not totally minimized to the taskbar after the patcher window completes and I get the the EULA splash screen, my mouse locks up totally and I cannot alt+tab out to a different program.  I have to ctrl/alt/del to task manager and cancel (eq closes/crashes on its own), and leaves me at a 640/480 desktop.  section of my upper left corner of my desktop.  so I get to go change all my desktop settings all over again.<br />
<br />
When it rains, my frog paladin goes from being red w/grey armor to having a white translucent glow from his neck to his feet.  Looks -really- strange, think this was mentioned earlier also.<br />
<br />
Running an Asylum GeForce FX5900, newest drivers and newest DX9.0b...and still problems.  Thinking the 3-5 hour extension on the patch was a hint there was gunna be problems..</div></div><hr />

<br />
The normal chain bridle is very slow now, compared to before the patch.  It's about sow speed instead of bardish. I'm guessing that came because they were screwing around with the speed on the Fabled Jboots and ended up breaking a bunch of other stuff  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fix for EQw is being worked on, so you have to go the &quot;Alt+Tab&quot; route, which there is a post for on this board I believe.<br />
<br />
Hopefully it will be fixed soon :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">2) slightly better looking movement/armour <br />
<br />
The armor looked the same to me, and I was told that the armor only got better for those who hadn't fixed the /dopropertinting issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The white translucent glow, I discovered, is a gamma glitch dealing with dyed armor.  I had that happen to me after I LD'd and crashed all the way back to login.  I didn't close EQ and came back (no 1018), and anyone with dyed armor had a white glow in the dyed slot.  The problem corrected itself a few minutes after I logged back in (I intentionally waited to see what would happen).<br />
<br />
My main beef with this patch so far is the getting stuck on things and the gamma correction.  Now the gamma correction seems to attach itself to your system even outside of EQ so long as you have EQ going.  If I want to window out, I have to turn my gamma down or I get a glaring white haze over everything.<br />
<br />
There's also a pretty messy issue with targetting people on horseback.  I simply seem unable to target anyone on a mount with my mouse, be it horse or lizard.  I have to type it out.<br />
<br />
I won't complain too much, because I know that SoE had a real ****storm over this patch already, and they're probably working like maniacs trying to fix these problems.<br />
<br />
/rant on<br />
<br />
But, the point of contention we should all have is...if this was on the test server, and they knew what issues it was having, then WHY IN THE BLOODY HE11 DID THEY PUSH THIS LIVE WHEN THEY KNEW IT HAD SERIOUS BUGS!!!!!!!  I mean, really, that's what the /rewind command was all about, if you think about it.  They KNEW people were going to get trapped in the geometry, but instead of fixing it they put in a hasty command to allow them to unstick themselves...which they promptly TOOK OUT just before the patch because they realized that people were going to exploit the command.<br />
<br />
Sheesh.<br />
<br />
So, everyone kindly /feedback SoE with this advice:<br />
<br />
/feedback from now on, PLEASE work all the bugs out on the Test server BEFORE going live with a patch!  That's what it's for, after all!  Thank you.<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">rewind does not work.  No such command.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kronas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My experience with the patch was awesome.  I was acutally able to put on particle effects and spell graphics on a large raid and it did not lag me at all.  <br />
<br />
Colors are deeper, brighter and in general richer.<br />
<br />
Over all lag is way down.<br />
<br />
Negatives --<br />
<br />
Noticed had keyboard / mouse problems at times.<br />
<br />
Fog -- even with bar at full, there still is a wall a fog at a distance, this does however help with reducing lag as there is no need to generate things that are far away.<br />
<br />
Dont like the way some of the armour stops short above the boots.  Looks like your wearing long shorts.<br />
<br />
Other than that i say kudos, its like looking at a new game expecaillly with the spells and particles fully turned on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This new run into an object and get stuck/duck is extremely annoying.<br />
<br />
Ssra last night was a mess.  It has those funky angled walls, if you even get near one of them, you duck and can't stand up.  When people run into me, it interrupts my spells.  I have a brand new computer (Athlon 64 3200, 1gb of ram, 10,000rpm SATA hard drive, radeon 9800 pro) and I had 120 FPS in The Grey.  I zoned into Ssra (only 40 other people in there, not like 200) and it dropped to ... 10.   I use a 3rd party utility to display this information (http://www.fraps.com).   <br />
<br />
Anyways, seriously 10FPS or less for my whole raid.  We could barely move.  We were sitting in the hall by Rhag1 for like 20 mins, while people restarted and turned off graphics.  We were trying to decide if we should even bother starting the cycle since so many people were so lagged.  Figured we would kill Rhag1 anyways for a chance at a GRC drop, we buffed and I started shrinking everyone.  When we were all shrank (all 12 of us), zoom FPS back up to 70 again and it went away for everyone else too.<br />
<br />
Nerf shamans, we now have the ability to stop lag....<br />
<br />
They slowed down the horse animation and it ( the chain model ) doesn't seem any faster than Spirit of the Wolf to me.  I also seem to just plain run slower than smaller people now.   Was running across mons to ssra and watched an iksar and high elf who started at the same time as me steadily out run me, they were about 10 seconds ahead of me to zone.   We all had Spirit of Bihli and Lev from me.  I was noticing it all night, kept checking that I had run on and that I wasn't encumbered (like that ever happens).<br />
<br />
Anyways, to cap off the fun that is everquest, we killed Rhag1 and Rhag2 never spawned, so the cycle was bugged...and then we went to Barindu to do Trial 1 for someone in the guild, fought down and only 8 of the 9 stonemites spawned, so that was bugged too.  <br />
<br />
Also, when you turn off the sky, it becomes night.  That's pretty sweet.   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
I guess the only positive thing I have to say about this patch is that I like the new rain.  I still wish I could TURN OFF THE DEAFENING FREAKING THUNDER that comes along with it, but I suppose that's just too much to ask.<br />
<br />
oh yeah and ALT-ENTER crashes EQ on all 3 of my machines.</div></div><hr />

Seen this happen before, one spawns on top of another, so it looks like 8 but you have 9. The pathing there allows you to split them by having a fd/lull/paci puller stand 45% off from the pull point to them, the mobs will run in a upside down V path giving you time to see which mob has twins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I don't like is running along and getting stuck on the least little thing.<br />
<br />
Oh and my hair, which was always a fairly ordinary brown now looks brown in some zones, but rather unnatural blond in other zones. When I used the face command to play about with it when it was blond, I couldn't find any brown settings, but there was a rather sickly shade of blue.<br />

Lots of peoples' armour looks a bit different too, and a few people asked me if I'd changed my BP. (It must have been prophetic, because Inny dropped a chain pattern for me. :))</div></div><hr />

For quite a few people the game doesn't run better. For me personally my load and zone times have increased and framerates have gone down. I hardly call that runs better. Also as mentioned previously the graphics colors are worse. <br />
Noticed today also that the clippning of objects at distance is much worse, stuff just &quot;pops&quot; in and has artifacting.</div></div><hr />

VZ in Time and Quarm were both pretty much unbeatable because of geometry problems.  They would become untouchable or warp because their &quot;center of gravity&quot; would go through a wall.  RZ in Time had similar problems, but you could work around them.</div></div><hr />
