However, if there is a 5% &quot;experience bonus&quot; for warriors and rogues, why is there a 6% difference between the warrior/rogue &quot;runs&quot;, than the others?<br />
<br />
Additionally, if 5% is apparently &quot;not a big deal&quot;, the difference between 3 of the slowing classes... is 5%, but yet, the highest of the 3, isn't even desired any longer, because that 5% &quot;addition&quot; gives them no other useful abilities in a short period of time.<br />
<br />
... Things that make you go &quot;Hmmm&quot;<br />
<br />
Notice how after that post, it got derailed and hasn't gone back on track yet? Double &quot;Hmmm&quot;</div></div><hr />

I think his point is that SOE seems to think that our 5% bigger slow is a MASSIVE advantage but an additional 5% XP for rogues and warriors is insignificant. <br />
<br />
Its apples and oranges, but it is interesting how SOE places differnt values on 5%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right. It's also interesting that only warriors and rogues (both highly desired classes now) get 5% experience bonuses (really unnecessary if you ask me), where every other class is &quot;base&quot;. Additionally, if it was really 5%, why was there a 6% difference? On top of that, since more people want warriors and rogues, why do they need a bonus anymore? Everyone should be flat. If warriors and rogues get it, why not, say, berserkers and monks (the other 2 pure melee classes)?<br />
<br />
The point I was bringing, is how 5% experience is insignificant, yet 5% slow causes a shaman to be at the bottom of the barrel in just about everything else.<br />
<br />
If the experience bonus for warriors/rogues is &quot;to get more people to play them&quot;, uh... there's enough people playing them. Maybe change the experience bonuses depending on what class there isn't much of (similar to how Planetside's experience worked). Granted, that's difficult because of the time invested in characters here, but there is really no reason for a 5% experience bonus, especially considering that a 5% bonus in some areas, results in a serious blow when it comes to nearly everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The whole 5% thing is really damning for SOE. They never should have said this. Why? because the question that immediately came to my mind after hearing this argument was this: &quot;If 5% is a very significant difference, then why is it that the priest classes are so far apart on the healing percentages?&quot; Clearly 5% (In all it's glory) can be the difference in some situations, but this line of argument is so easily turned around on them. Nevertheless, the dev team is picking up on interaction with the various classes, so maybe we will see a change in the &quot;5% Philosophy&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought that xp modifiers were applied to regular xp, but not aa xp, so it only affects people leveling up, not those at 65? Btw, the only penalties that were removed, if I remember correctly, were the hybrid penalties. The warrior bonus was left in place. Also left in place were the race penalties/bonus. Evil races still had their penalty and halflings their bonus. My warrior, for example, leveled up with 20% racial penalty and a 5% class bonus, or about 15% slower than most toons.<br />
<br />
The other thing they did at the time was change the way penalties/bonuses were calculated. Prior to the change these were averaged across the entire group, and after the change they were only applied to the individual who had them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Scary thing... Halfling warriors get a 15% exp bonus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Evil races still had their penalty<br />
<br />
Evil races dont have the penalty - large races have the penalty. It just so happens that 2 of the 3 large races happen to be evil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If they really think 5% is so much why don't we offer to sacrifice 5% of our slow in exchange for the ability to dire charm like an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a fair trade to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think they just should allow shamans to switch classes to enchanter when they hit GoD.  That would be more fair than the current situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I think so too - just around the time when a new serious competition for EQ launches.<br />
<br />
Its right that it seems like they are trying to improve on interaction with their customers but just look at the reply Henora got to a post about the Sludge Eating Fly (or whatever its called :)). That reply more than anything confirms that behind all the fluff and glimmer nothing has changed since the &quot;good old days&quot; with Abashi in charge of customer relations.</div></div><hr />
