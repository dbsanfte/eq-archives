<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LARRYHILL01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone confirm this is actually in game and where it drops.. Have yet to see this potion in AH...or the recipie for sale.<br />
<br />
Per Alakazams it drops off Scarlet Arch Mages, Clerics and Enchanters.... Ive spent the last 3 days camping it... the drop rate is from 1% to 3% according to them... not that standard 0.01% ... and Ive seen tons of things drop in 2 to 3 days of farming areas with 0.01% rate as opposed to a higher drop rate and the item not dropping......<br />
<br />
Weird.... so any info would be helpful... Id at least like to know im in the right area....Tyrs Hand. <br />
<br />
Tks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you are referring to the Elixir of the Sages, then it's definately at Tyr's Hand, me and a friend got 2 recipe drops in 20 minutes.  They were both from the clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sages ya tks for the correct... my bad... dam lucky bastage!!  :p <br />
<br />
ok ill just keep farming</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I didn't even know about Tyr's Hand until my friend said to come help him farm it.  We got one within 5 minutes and stayed for another so i could sell it.  Your best bet is to kill the clerics, they have the highest % chance to drop it I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You dont have to kill the ones up the hill at the chapel right? Named 60 elite came by and owned me when i was fighting a archmage... so ive been down the hill to the left... nice pull place up against a wall... clerics enchanters and the regular guards spawn in cycle.<br />
<br />
Toughest part is the splitting of the spawns but Ive got it down pretty well.....got a 100 mana recipie yesterday but still no potion recipie....=(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">After I read this thread I headed over to Tyr's to try and get this recipe. WHen you head through the gates I went left up the hill and killed the first 3 mobs plus the wanderer there. Then I crossed the road and went on top of the gate and killed the 2 mobs on the right hand side ignoring the ones on the left. By that time the other mobs respawned. About 30-40 kills of the casters and I got the recipe. Thanks for the tip!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is a lvl 60 elite near the chapel avoid him if possible..pretty easy to duo but not to solo.  Stay at the bottom and kill the lower level ones ranging from 53-55 (?), particularly the clerics and also stay off the path to chapel because you don't want to get steamrolled by the courier when it paths up to the chapel.</div></div><hr />
