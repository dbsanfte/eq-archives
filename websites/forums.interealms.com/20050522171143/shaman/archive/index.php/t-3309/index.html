Forgot...past Kurn's level!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Swamp of No Hope skel camps, till about 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks...will research that one right now!<br />
<br />
Didn't see a skelly camp on EQ Atlas and the bestiary didn't show very high levels for the skeletons. Looking for some a bit higher. Or is there a camp that isn't shown on EQ Atlas with skeletons about level 30?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The skeleton camp in Ill Omen is also known as the &quot;Haunted House&quot; - it's a 15 second run from the Windmill (#13 on the EQAtlas map, at -2542, -2941.)  It won't take you to level 30- but it will get you most of the way there.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Bigguss <br />
Any other no-runner camps out there?<br />
Looking for those mobs that are a decent amount above the level of the powerleveled player so that the DS does the work and the xp flows like ....like...fast or something ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I took my monk to keasora for solo work at the library area.  If you're unfamiliar with the dungeon just do it like this:  enter the zone, go up to the first little room.  If you look to your left, there is a small drop down.  Go down there and then straight thru a door to another drop down.  Or you can just take a walk to the left and around and down for a while.  The place has fast respawns of skellies who dont run.  There are cleric class skellies further in the actual library areas and those can be annoying with the heals they like to do all the time.  My monk at 45 was able to solo all those skellies and most of the library.  But he was pretty twinked, fungi, good haste, high AC, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rypt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Never having been there myself but what about ToFS? That should be a 30+ zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">com is great, mobs are lvl 35 to 45 tops i think (not counting reavers).<br />
<br />
dreadlands have some undead camps with lvl 40ish skellies.<br />
<br />
trakanon's teeth is filled with undead, although they are lvl 40-45. outside the ramp to emperor (for seb key) is good, or near sebilis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most of the mobs in ToFS do run when low on health.  Same with the plaguebone thieves in DL as well as the spectrals in TT.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd put in my 2 coppers before you tried those places out and ended up with problems because of a runner.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kongming</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used unrest for a good amount of it.  skel don't run.   almost nothin in that zone runs,  just use the druid to pull and not the one being Pled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Humm, I thought most lower level Undead didn't run?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Might be a little higher than what you're looking for, but somewhere in the Dreadlands between the tunnel and Firiona Vie (I can't remember which side of Burning Woods), there is an undead camp. I dinged either 45 or 46 there; I think that after the ding was when it started to green out, so I split. (That was before teal cons.)</div></div><hr />
