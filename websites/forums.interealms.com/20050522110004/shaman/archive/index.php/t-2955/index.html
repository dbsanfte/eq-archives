Take care )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah prices are being gouged by some people. Just today I saw someone trying to get 15k for an obulous death shroud and FIFTY FIVEk for a freaking white dragon scale cloak. These items used to go for 4k and 15k so some at least are definately tryin to jack the prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's called supply and demand. If a seller raises the price too high, no one will buy. That forces them to either lower the price or not sell the item. If someone pays 55k for a white dragon scale cloak, they obviously thought it was worth that price, otherwise they wouldn't pay it would they?<br />
<br />
I don't see how someone can &quot;gouge&quot; you when you can choose not to pay what they are asking and do without the item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I call it gouging because a near 400% price increase overnite when there are just as many in circulation and it is as easy or even easier to get than before is BS. Sure the item is a little nicer now but that is ridiculous to me.<br />
<br />
And no, noone seemed to be buying it at that price because the guy kept auctioning it for a long time. I know all about supply and demand, thanks. I'm still of the opinion that a number of people are way overpricing focus items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lovista Atreides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here's the secret!<br />
<br />
Don't buy it!<br />
<br />
OMG.  (and in the case of an ODS.. the item just went from something you put on twinks, to something a ton of lvl 60s are wearing now, so supply is way down, ex, I just swapped my IGS for a death shroud).<br />

If all Iksar Regen bps had their hp regen increased to 15, would it not be logical that they'd cost nearly as much as fungis? Would it be justified? or would be it &quot;gouging?&quot;<br />
<br />
Better items will always be worth more than lesser items, and this &quot;worth&quot; is determined by a variety of factors from availibility to personal preference. When an item gets a boost in usefulness overnight, it's only logical that its worth increase overnight as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SwamplayggRex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey thats great news Boinshar - when are they going to increase the regen on Ikky BP's to 15 ?</div></div><hr />
