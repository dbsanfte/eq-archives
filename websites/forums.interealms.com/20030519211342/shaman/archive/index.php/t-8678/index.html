<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just thought that I would post this since alot of people are questioning how things go on the turn ins with factions and such.<br />
<br />
I had done patience, popped the wolf in Mistmoore.  Did the Book from City of Mist.<br />
<br />
I was Warmly to Truespirit faction when starting this:<br />
<br />
Guild went in a popped Ghiosk and got ahold of the books.  We then went in a another shaman from another guild MQed the tear.  The shaman had her epic and was max faction, since she was epicced awhile ago.<br />
<br />
I looted scale.  <br />
<br />
I then went to turn in the books from Ghiosk to the spirt.  I then did 4 Woe/Envy runs.  Best way to do this was with PoP, and bound in the PoK.  I'd hit the grobb Portal, zone into Rathe Mountains and pop the Pally/SK.  Then hit PoK, go to Qeynos and run to the Karanas.  After getting the gem from the wandering spirit, take it and gate to PoK, then hit the Cabilis book, one zone to EJ and give the gem to the spirit there.  Rinse and Repeat.<br />
<br />
The longest parts were waiting for the Pally/SK to re-spawn or finding the wandering spirit.   Do yourself a favor and ooc for a ranger for PLing.  Offer some uberr buffage or coin to have some ranger in their teens to track for you.  Sometimes its easy to find the spirit, sometimes you can look for an hour or more and not find him.<br />
<br />
Once I had that ally message (got it on the 4th woe/envy turn in), go to EJ and give scale to the spirit.<br />
<br />
Boom.  One epic.<br />
<br />
BTW.  You can get unlimited shields from the wandering spirit by saying 'What shield' and yoru faction is high enough.<br />
<br />
I went through about 30 of them just for the fun of it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I am now indifferent to true spirit.<br />
<br />
Forgot to mention:  I completely bypassed kirn and the high scale.  Never could seem to get enough folks to the Hole to do this.  Lack of interest and all that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kinda went that path too.  Am max ally atm, but no tear.  Soon as I have that i'll do final fight and have my epic, w00t.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On the weekend I had a guildie who was a server transferee hand in a Tear to Rak and he ATE it :(<br />
He was Ally but maybe not Max Ally (he HAD his epic on his old server though).<br />
<br />
Luckily I had a spare Tear banked and I headed over to CoM, handed Rak a tear and Rak Aggro'd and we toasted him.<br />
<br />
Now either it worked for me because 1) I was Max Ally or 2) I was Max Ally AND had my Epic.<br />
<br />
Any idea if you shortcircuit the quest if you need to have the Tear handed in by an &quot;epic'd&quot; shaman?<br />
Or it was just bad luck he'd somehow lost a tiny bit of faction?<br />
<br />
Hmmm.... now I think about it.. MAYBE he was in bear-form (Naughty!). Need to check that.</div></div><hr />

Ugggg...someone delete this... <br />
Why even bother covering up the dead horse?<br />
<br />
Old news. Not like it would be hiding anything from anyone. Do you truly believe that SOE doesn't know about factioning epics? :)<br />
<br />
Oh yeh...grats to Unknown_Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well if you needed your epic in order to hand in a tear, that would be quite the catch-22. So, no.<br />
<br />
Max ally with Truespirit and a Child's Tear are all that's required. If it was the wrong item, Rak should have handed it back saying he doesn't need it. So it must have been a faction problem.</div></div><hr />
