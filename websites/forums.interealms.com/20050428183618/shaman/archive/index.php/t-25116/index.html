<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">someone who lost interesting War Craft 3 about half way through?  I don't know why I never finished it...I just never got into it I guess.  I am not sure which to go with EQ2 or WoW.  I am leaning toward EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like WoW a lot more but it depends.<br />
IF you like endless timesinks and forced grouping then EQ2 is the game for you.<br />
Else welcome to WoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmmm...how much does WoW cost per month again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1 month is $15. paying in advance gets you a discount (till $12.95)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Out of the 2 games I preferred WoW, eq2 I wasn't very keen on also apparently its based on Morrowind in design? never played that so don't know but that could help swing your vote one way or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, do you want to play with the people that come up with the ideas or the guys that steal them, tweak them and slap their logo on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like the dream makers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with Litgruv.  Go with WoW.  Just say no to any more SOE games ever again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">WC3 and WoW are completely different games, they just use the same mythology.  I can't stand single player WC3 either but I love WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, knowledge of WC lore certainly isn't a prerequisite.  It may  help you understand some storylines but not having it will not hinder you.  If you actually read the quest descriptions and attempt to follow along, you can pick up on the story a lot.  Most folks I know at this point just watch their mouse hovering over the &quot;accept quest&quot; button or scroll immediately down to see the reward :) (myself included a lot of times hehe).<br />
<br />
I played both betas and I've actually bought EQ2 as well (mainly to play between end of WoW beta and 11/23 hehe).  I like WoW hands down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for all your imput.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yes, best game I have played yet. If you play, pvp or not, try to research and pick a server that has a lower population the high stress servers are having issues.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tombfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I also lost interest in Warcraft 3 about 1/3 or 1/2 of the way through. RTS games just aren't something I've ever fell in love with. <br />
<br />
WoW is a great MMORPG, very engrossing, and the most fun I've had with a game in years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">EQ (both versions) is deeper. WoW is just frankly FAR more fun.<br />
<br />
GD (idled EQ1 6box, played for 30mins since WoW launched and only cause of server issues)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Do you think it will last through the years at EQ1 has?  I have heard that WoW is good for those looking for a quick fix (fast lvls/loot/money).  Everyone was ranting about CoH and it seems pretty non-existant now.  I guess I will have to dole out the cash and see for myself.  I can only sit on the fence for so long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">CoH is still going strong. Apples and oranges comparing the genre's and the types of people each attract.<br />
<br />
Hop over to CoH's official forums, you'll see. Update 3 is coming soon which appears to have lots of neat features/content. I cancelled my CoH account when WoW OB started, but may resub every now and then just because I like some of the gameplay.<br />
<br />
And I absolutely believe WoW will have the same (if not better) staying power than EQ. Look how many of their previous titles are still going strong. Many are considered some of the greatest games of all times...almost cult classic status. WoW won't be any different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wasn't really trying to compare the games in a what you like to play sense.  It was more along the lines of do you think WoW is too easy of a game to hold your interest?  I think the reason EQ was so successful was because it took forever to lvl, get around to anywhere (boats or running, no PoK or spires).  EQ started loosing peeps when they made it easier to lvl and get around.  The abolished hell lvls, made exp easier to get in groups and in PoP.  I hear of peeps in wow getting lvl 10 in like an hour.  That seems really fast to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally think eq woulda eroded a lot faster if they hadn't done these things. I know I wouldn't have played it for as long as I did if it still took me as long to get to a group as it did to walk to someplace like CoM back in the day. Maybe its just me, but eliminating timesinks made me a happier player. <br />
<br />
Things that made me hate eq:<br />
VT Key<br />
VP Ket<br />
Long corpse runs<br />
Flagging raids<br />
etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">unatainable (for the most part) spells is what annoyed me the most.  They should have waited to charge you for an expansion until you were fully flagged and had all your spells for that expansion.</div></div><hr />
