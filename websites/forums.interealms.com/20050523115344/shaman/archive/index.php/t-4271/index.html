<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, I'm still 29 after a week *sigh*. I'm pretty broke right now because I made a stupid move of twinking my druid and my beastlord. I went from 500+ plat to 0. I was wondering if there is any place for me to farm to get a few items that can sell to merchants? I'm thinking about camping an entire bandit camp in Pauldal Caverns so I can just sell all the loot to the merchants. I remmeber making about 100pp each level when I use to hunt there. Is there any place you guys can recommend that a mid level can camp and farm? Any input would be appreciated, and again, thanks in advance. - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did a nice amount of plat in KB with my lvl 30 necro by farming Upper Guk. I killed Froglok Squire for Woven Grass Bracelets (150pp each on Kb), Ancient Crock for arms (400pp on Kb) and Leggings (450pp on Kb), and if I had time before repops I went to the froggie in the ramp room that drops Collar of Undead Protection and Runed Bone Fork (400-600pp on Kb).<br />
 The Ancient Crocodile room gives great exp to up to lvl 34 so you'd get some exp too. All of the camps I mentioned are very easy to handle at 30'ish. You can single pull froggies at your level, and the crocodiles wont assist each others unless you fight too close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the reply. I'm going to have to try this out tonight and see if I'm high enough to take these mobs. Once again, thanks, and I'll give another reply after I try it. - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vinas Solamnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What you might want to do is pop your head into Lowe Guk and grab some buffs, im Soloing with my 25 monk down there and if i had root id be OWNING most of the creatures, i get lots of adds when they run tho, but if i can pay a peridot and grab heroism and symbol or aegolism (sometimes youll find a PLing 60 cleric down there) your SET.</div></div><hr />
