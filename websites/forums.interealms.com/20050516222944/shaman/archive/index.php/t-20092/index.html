<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MMshammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all.  Havent posted that much, but i have a few questions and I hope you guys can help me.<br />
<br />
My shammy is now lvl 38 and has for all intents and purposes become my main.  On the back of my mains reputation my shammy has been invited to join a guild that although not quite elemental, by the time I get to a high enough lvl probably will be.<br />
<br />
I have accepted their offer to join the guild, but not until i hit lvl 50, as I dont want the guild to feel as tho I am using them to get lvls and loot.  They are happy with this, and have offered to help me out with groups etc in the mean time.<br />
<br />
So here is my question... in 12 lvls I need to know how to be useful in a group/raid enviroment with my shammy.  You see, I am soloed completely, shammy has never grouped once other than 2 experimental PU groups over the last few days which... well... lets say they didnt go well  :confused: <br />
<br />
I desperately want to offer this guild something, and contribute as wholly as possible, but feel that I may be a bit high to start cold on the ropes of learning with pick up groups.  I would perhaps have trouble finding a PU group that would tolerate me for long as well.<br />
<br />
Obviously my roles can vary in a group, shaman are extremely versatile critters, but in the few situations i have been in a group my spell line up has been totally wrong, i fall out of sync with my buffing, my mana bar is perpetually empty, even with my lil canni dance going on, i can only offer intermittent dps as i need to med at some point, and whilst trying to be selective with the buffs i dish out i seem to get complaint rather than complement.<br />
<br />
I know this is a lame request for a half seasoned shammy of 38 however, i dont think what I am doing is wrong, so much as lacking some fluid cohesion.<br />
<br />
Please help  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Oh, flamers please show restraint on this one, I can be much harder on myself than you could ever be  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I pretty much don't ever worry about trying to add dps to a group unless I hit FM and can afford to use the mana and be back at FM by the time the next pull is incoming. I always try to keep HP, str, sta, dex, and agi buffs on everyone that needs em as well as haste and FA. Basically my job in a group is to slow every pull as fast as possible and keep the melee's doing as much damage as possible while backup healing for the clerics sake. I think this kind of basic shaman role is fairly easy to get the hang of and it's all your group will really expect from you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my opinion, the only way to get to be an adequate, at least, shaman in a group situation is to group.  There is no tried and true method, everyone has their own style.  Some shaman make great pullers, some can be the glue that holds a group together on a terrible pull, and some just do everything.  <br />
<br />
Main things you need to know to always keep up are your malo(x) spell and slow, root is nice to have.  Have a rotation on buffs like haste, where you cast on yourself, then cast on others.  When it starts to wear off you can rebuff yourself, and get everyone else before theirs drops.  Keep everyone buffed as much as possible, even the casters, with whatever is your highest buff, they'll appreciate it.  <br />
<br />
Let your cleric know when to heal you, if you prefer to not be healed until a certain hp percentage, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you had experience with previous characters already, and know what good playstyle and etiquette is, then this should be easy for you.<br />
<br />
I solo'd my shaman for almost his entire life up until maybe the 60's.  I always avoided groups because I feared that I would not know how to play correctly.  But I tried grouping and it turned out just fine.<br />
<br />
I would say try to play your shaman with that twinge of fear that people are watching what you are doing.  This will make you want to prove yourself and perform your roles with utmost diligence.  Shamans complain about buffing-- learn to enjoy your buffs.  Shamans complain about healing-- heal as well as you can without complaint.  Learn standard shaman roles-- buffing, healing, slowing (how soon, standing where, etc)-- and then go that extra step-- canni-ing, damaging, debuffing, etc.  Never be idle.<br />
<br />
Then when you hit 65 you can start getting lazy again ;-P (when stuff gets more natural for you)<br />
<br />
A common &quot;newb&quot; identifier for shamans is when they just sit there without canni-ing even though they're full health-- and they're always wanting a KEI.  Also, some shamans slow way too slowly.  Some shamans slow way too fast or cause the mob to chase them by not slowing next to the mob/main tank.  Some shamans just don't know how to play well-- crowd control is very doable by a shamans... root/dog are powerful cc tools.  More advanced shamans can tell when a shaman is &quot;newbish&quot; in more subtle ways-- if all they do is slow and nothing else for instance.<br />
<br />
Anyway, do your best to prove your worth to people, and ask for feedback on improvement.  Eventually it will all come naturally to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well friend, the majority of your problem lies, not in your faults, but in the faults of the class at that level.  Our buffs don't last long at all, and since no one at that level is near capping anything, they want them all.  They are really expensive compared to the typical mana pool of that level, and yet you can't seem to talk anyone out of even the more useless ones.<br />
<br />
The problem is, the only way to offset some of these problems and keep ourselves from wasting all our mana on things we shouldn't is to take charge and simply tell everyone what you are doing and why you are doing it...  However, never grouping before probably makes you kind of timid in that regard so your more inclined to let other people take charge...  This will only lead to you getting more and more frustrated.  At that level I usually gave them an option.  I said I will only pass out talisman of tnarg, health, and shifting shield (only if no cleric buffs) to the MT.  If he's not holding agro and everyone wants hp/ac/sta buffs, then your all going to have to sit and let me med back to full when I'm done casting them.<br />
<br />
Strength buffs will be easy to keep up next level when you get tumultuous strength (group str buff).  And ask off the bat who is wielding a proccing weapon.  Tell them you don't have infinate mana, so your only going to dex buff those that are.  At that level, you shouldn't have too many people to dex buff.  Make sure to keep telling everyone why you are doing what you are doing, and it will all be fine.  Say if your being asked to do something outside the realm of your typical routine, then you will need a little more med time in order to compensate.<br />
<br />
Regen actually makes a pretty big difference at these levels, but it costs ALOT of mana, so tell the group it's simply not cost effecient to keep up on everyone.  Only keep it up on the person who seems to be taking the most damage.  This should be the MT, but at these levels, noone seems to hold agro worth a squat, so be flexible.  Also, always keep yourself regened.  It'll pay off in the long run by how much more canni-ing it allows you to do.<br />
<br />
That handles buffing.  As far as slowing goes, I never really started needing my slows untill sometime in my 40's.  The mobs just don't hit hard enough before that... But more importanly, until you get torgors at 39, you're not slowing for all too noticeable of a %, yet your still dumping 125 mana.  At 39 you get torgors which is 175 mana but will be slowing by another 11% than by what targars was doing at lvl 38.  This is when the mana wasted on slow pays off, cause your not having to heal nearly as much.<br />
<br />
As for damage, don't worry about it.  Just send in dogdog, keep the mobs slowed, and let the melees deal with killing the mobs.  If you do what I have said above, you'll really only be down on mana right after buffing, and slowly be able to work up your mana pool in-between slows.  Eventually it will get high enough to dump a little mana on dps for a few mobs, but usually after about 3 or 4 your right back buffing... It's just how the game goes at these levels.<br />
<br />
The problem is we have too much utility at lower levels, and not enough mana to handle it all.  Canni II will help a little, and if you can get your guild to help you get it, that'll solve some of your problems.  Stoicism at 44 kinda changes the game in your favor, and then it slowly starts going down-hill from there.  You start having the mana pool to keep up with all your allotted jobs, and by your early to mid 50's you have enough to do all your duties and drop some dps on every incomming mob.<br />
<br />
Don't fret about being a bad shaman.  We all look bad early on unless we are rediculously twinked.  Only way to avoid this is to let everyone else know the score, so when mana is low, they understand it is because tnarg, health, and shifting shield aren't cheap, haste falls every time the wind blows, and idiots who ask for agility buffs are basically eating your mana pool for the sake of a pair of pretty boots to look at.  When the group realizes your mana limitations, they will start trying hard to streamline the process so you can do what helps them most.<br />
<br />
Only other piece of advice I can give you, is if your still having alot of mana trouble try grouping with enchanters, or clerics, or both.  Not having to haste is a HUGE mana save, and it'll give you the chance to do alot more.  And leaving healing to the clerics really helps till you get the spell arsenal to be able to handle it yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depending on the size of the group, I do different things.<br />
<br />
When I group with my normal duo partner (A beastlord), basically I slow on incoming, then toss my best poison DoT and melee.<br />
<br />
Lets face it, he can't take damage much better then I can, and letting his warder tank is boring. :)<br />
<br />
When i'm in a full group, it is usually with a tank who can hold agro very well (Paladin, shadowknight, and there is one warrior in my guild who is AMAZING and can keep agro VERY easily.  I dont know what equipment he has, but it must be good stuff.) ....<br />
<br />
Anyway, when in a full group with a good agro-keeping tank, I slow early on (Stand next to MT or mob so it doesn't run if it does twitch to you),  wait 10 seconds or so, then poison DoT (if it still has a decent amount of hp), or poison nuke.<br />
<br />
If said group has an enchanter/cleric, I'll toss Cripple into it as well.   I keep Malosi (my current version) up, but unless i'm in a place where I get a LOT of resists, I dont bother with it (when I get the un-resistable versions, this will change)<br />
<br />
If i'm in a group without a tank who can hold agro well, i'll wait 'til about 80% of the target's health to slow, and maybe toss a nuke later on.  If this group DOES have a cleric/enchanter, i might nuke more (usually a high-DPS group, even a crappy nuke helps, and a DoT wont last long enough)<br />
<br />
If i'm in a group without a healer or enchanter, or a tank that can hold agro, i slow right away becuse i probably AM the tank. :D  I would try not to let them pull me into places with powerful foes in them unless you are sure you can take their hits.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>slimb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lets see what I can add being that I just hit 35th today.<br />
<br />
I generally duo with my fiance's pally (or 2box if she's not around).  But I frequently toss together LDoN's or just XP groups due to boredom.<br />
<br />
I generally keep 2 spell lineups memorized - one for hunting and a buff list<br />
<br />
I'll start out the group by buffing those who need it.  As mentioned earlier, no one is near max stats, however I look at it differently.  I buff the tank out to the max - no dex if they dont have proccing weaps.  Casters get +HP/AC - nothing else and anyone that won't be getting hit will get STR mainly but not a lot else unless they need dex.<br />
<br />
I'll haste anyone doing dmg too.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I keep up slow (the level 14 one - cheaper and at this level the % diff isn't a huge deal), cripple, DoTs, haste if there's no chanter, DD, and heal (canni of course too).<br />
<br />
I then find out what my role is, no other healer around?  ok i'm slowing/healing.  I'm always tossing dogdog into the fray.<br />
<br />
If there's a healer, I'll slow, and DD - DoT if the mob's living long enough (oftentimes mobs dont last but 20 - 30 seconds).  <br />
<br />
You'll get good and bad pickup groups, just find a good one and let them know you're still learning.  Once you figure out your role in a particular group, it's easy to get into a routine and get comfortable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">good question and some fine comprehensive answers. Did anyone cover adds? I might have missed it. <br />
<br />
You can be a good group member if you take charge of your role specific areas... &quot;who will slow? I'm a shammy, I should be doing that&quot;. With adds, other classes can do a better job IF they are in the group... rangers and druids can snare and root, chanters can mez... a beastlord will send in pet to hold an added mob for a bit. However, it may be that your group does not have good crowd control, or all hell breaks loose. What do you do? <br />
1) Try and root ONE add, in such a place that it is NOT hitting on your tank and mellee types. If this is not possible, root ONE mob and tell group to pull back out of harms way. <br />
2) slow the original mob and sic dog onto that<br />
3) slow the add (and tell your group it is slowed).<br />
4) keep watching the mob... our root is short, and you may need to root again.<br />
<br />
I strongly suggest you look out for comprehensive focus effects on your armour.. buff extenders and spell haste especially, and buff efficiency. <br />
<br />
Build your wis through judicious armour selection. At lower levels, this provides bigger manna pool.<br />
<br />
Learn when to heal. Our heals are poor in lower levels, but if there is no cleric in the group, you can be an assist healer. Watch the health bars, let the main healer tell you when and who to help.<br />
<br />
Lastly learn to use hot buttons... &quot;such and such a mob is slowed&quot;, &quot;such and such a mob resisted my spell&quot; would be two good ones to start with.<br />
<br />
mem different spell sets of course... buff, self buff, slow/heal, normal fight would be four good sets. <br />
<br />
Check out the various on-line lists for accronyms and in game terms... ninja loot, ffa, cawu, ML, MT. I was a dodo even at level 40 and ninja looted an aug 'cause I just didnt understand what a ML (main looter) was and did. <br />
<br />
Lastly, shammys make GREAT duo parterns. We compliment many other races nicely. Solo nice reds with a parter (pick a partner who can snare and dot... druid, nec or ranger, for instance).  this way you &quot;blend&quot; experience from solo and learn a bit of group etiquette.<br />
<br />
REALLY lastly group with alts with much higher level characters. Honestly tell em you are learning, and ask to get clues about what to do better. EVen better, group with equal level alts who have a SHAMAN main, and get somm GREAT class specific help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And please.  Never, ever agility in a group situation.  The more shaman cast agi buffs in groups, the more time I have to spend with my group proving my capability with my class when I refuse to cast it.  Usually a simple, firm &quot;Agi buffs or slows.  Take your pick,&quot; does the job.  If I'm sitting in POK just in channel chat, and somebody wandering by is asking for buffs, then he or she can get whatever, but in a group, pfft. Know what's the best way to spend your mana and canni time, and stick to your guns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Contrary to common belief, everquest is a twitch game, and to become a truely excellent shaman you must learn to twitch like a pro.<br />
<br />
1) master assist healing and super fast targetting. You should be able to assist heal and patch any character under attack in .5 seconds. If you can't, practice.<br />
<br />
2) slow as soon as possible. Always. Your mission as a shaman is to turn mobs into docile and harmless creatures with slow. Until you do that, they are a threat to the raid. Target mobs on inc, begin casting Malos while they are incoming, and once a tank has picked them up, run next to his shoulder and attempt a slow.<br />
<br />
that's all you realy need to know besides the obvious, buffing is a duty that doesn't really require any skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kenneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just a few more tips...<br />
<br />
Slow, Malosinia line, Cripple... these don't break mez.  Use them on mezzed mobs.<br />
<br />
Your pet can also be a good buff timer (if you don't want to use yourself).  Just cast on the pet first (or yourself).<br />
<br />
Once you get going, start refreshing buffs in cycles.  Example -- Health and Furious Strength both last 54 minutes.  Don't cast them both in the same cycle or they'll wear off at the same time.  Cast one on everyone (dog or you first), then wait a few minutes and cast the other.  That way, you won't blow all your mana when all the buffs start wearing off at the same time, and you everybody won't be complaining that they don't have their buffs.<br />
<br />
At higher levels, IoS, Stamina and Tuna (Hp only buff) all stack.<br />
<br />
HoS, FoS line does not stack with int caster personal shields.  Some will want HoS, some won't (I only have a couple casters that always ask me for FoS -- a few necros and one wizzy that has great gear).  When in doubt, when buffing an int caster, ask first because you may be overwriting something they preferred to keep.<br />
<br />
And, constantly do something... canni or whatever, there is always something you can be doing as a shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Use the F keys to target group members. If a group member has a pet, hitting the F key twice will target the pet.<br />
<br />
Very handy.<br />
<br />
I've actually found it's easier just to buff agi then to argue about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I pretty much discovered till you get canni5 or a good set of ft gear most groups will keep you busy in terms of mana just slowing and keeping useful buffs up.  I doubt seriously you will have time to throw much dps till much later in your career.  If you aren't the solo type I'd almost consider not even buying your damage spells save for maybe a nuke in case you need to quick burn something.<br />
<br />
As far as agility .. I didn't buy the spells.  I found that I didn't have to cast them then. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've actually found it's easier just to buff agi then to argue about it <br />
<br />
<br />
That's pretty much my opinion on that as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As far as Dex and Agility go, you can pick up a pair of Jaundiced Boots and Gauntlets really cheap from the bazaar (well cheap is a relative term) 350pp each I think.  They give manna free buffs, and the AC is nice.  The fact that they give no other stat makes them unused often, and therefore cheap to buy.  Just keep them in your bag, and switch to them for buffing purposes.  Later on, you can get a pair of Thurg Quest boots that do the same thing, and are decent enough to wear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My shammy is now lvl 38 and has for all intents and purposes become my main. On the back of my mains reputation my shammy has been invited to join a guild that although not quite elemental, by the time I get to a high enough lvl probably will be.<br />
<br />
This comment clicked with me. What class is your main? What level? Guessing here, but if your main's rep has resulted in a higher level guild asking you to join with your shaman then that toon's reputation in a group/raid environment must be pretty solid.<br />
<br />
Whatever the class of the main, if you have experience grouping there are many attributes that make a good group member that are more about the player than the class. Examples: 1) good wizards can CC adds, pull aggro off chanter/cleric, save groups with evac. 2) enchanters can heal (rune - damage buff) in a pinch to give that warrior a few more seconds to pull mob off cleric (rune the cleric.) The list goes on. It boils down to doing what is possible and necessary to win. As far as flexibility goes in &quot;doing what is possible&quot; the shaman has soooooo many tools available.<br />
<br />
At 38 your greater healing is the same as a lvl 38 cleric. They don't get complete heal until 39. From 29-39 you are as effective a healer as a cleric. Reality side of this is the mana cost. With all the other buffs you are dropping constantly and the slows/debuffs in combat it can be very hard to keep mana up with demand. Guess what - it is equally hard for the cleric. Groups have always been notoriously patient with letting clerics buff groups and then sit around waiting for the cleric to med back to FM (or close) before pulling mobs. Shamans (and druids) on the other hand are expected to buff then switch to battle mode as soon as finished and a mob is incoming.<br />
<br />
If you are LOM (low on mana) the simple fact is this: you do not have mana to do your battle jobs. That is going to happen if the group wants all the buffs. Tell them at the beginning. Work it out from there. If the group expects/wants full buffs on all members they are going to have to wait. Look for those groups that understand that focused buffs (useful buffs on key group members most likely to need) is the best approach as it minimizes your downtime/maximizes pulling rate.<br />
<br />
GET CANNI 2. Beg, borrow, steal, sell first born ... but get CANNI 2. You want to mem that as soon as you can. Same applies to ALL canni series spells. Make a canni hotkey and use it constantly. Always strive to be FM then strive to be FHealth then strive to be FM ... do the canni dance. Love the canni dance. It is the one tool you need to master first to solve the demand/ability problem with doing all you need to do in a group. Though you will never-ever get away from canni it gets better and better as you level. At 65 I can go from rezzed to group fully buffed (FO7, sta, str-diaku, group regen, bih li, agi, hastes and FA) and pet up/buffed and ready for pulls in 6-8 minutes (without KEI) while the cleric is at ~50% and still finishing single Virtue casts. This is thanks to Canni-5 and Canni-4. I mention this not to brag (though personally I think our mana recovery is way cool) but rather to give you some insight into what is ahead of you.<br />
<br />
Know your group members. Those mid-30/lo-40 folks you are grouping with are likely twinked. At least some of them. If you have a tank super twinked your heals are just denting his hitpoints. Know what those are and (if main healer) adjust accordingly. If tank has a haste item already it is pointless to toss your haste on top of that. He can swing faster, sure ... but balanced with the mobs you are killing with ease it is more of a waste of time/mana to keep shaman haste up. If tank has a regen item use your regen to complement that. Flip side is if the tank is poorly equipped for their level your job got harder exponentially. If tank is not mitigating damage/inflicting damage well you need a new MA ... you could likely do better tanking if your skills are maxxed and gear is decent.<br />
<br />
Others have pointed out a key to being a shaman in a group. That key is knowing your role. In pick up groups my initial focus is to play a traditional shaman: buff, slow, debuff. I do this a few rounds of kills to see how the group is working. Only takes a few mobs and a couple of multiple incoming mobs to know if other folks are playing their toons well in that group. If the cleric has a habit of starting CH when the tank is at 40% regardless of 1 or 2 or 3 mobs beating on him I know I have to toss quick heals on the tank until CH lands. This while also doing my best to get the mobs slowed and aggro pulled away to root or pet tank (if no chanter or unmezzable mobs.)<br />
<br />
There are tons of variable in a group situation. First is being a primary shaman = slow/debuffs. Next is what is needed to keep group productive. Quick heals, root parking, off tanking.<br />
<br />
As you gain experience in reading your groups and working well with any mix of folks and styles of play there will be often times when a multiple pull looks bad and because of you things settle down, mobs die and everyone takes a deep breath followed by comments of &quot;good work everyone.&quot; Take that comment personally. It usually really means, &quot;WOW! Awesome shaman!&quot; To be fair to other classes, the same can be said of well played enchanters and necromancers and bards. These 4 classes have those versatile tools that can turn defeat into victory. Shaman has the best of those tools .. then again I may be prejudicial in that view  :) <br />

Good luck on your shaman. Come back and let us know what you think once you get to 49 and beyond. Its a whole new world then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zugarbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'll tell you what works for me.<br />
<br />
Number one get to know your spell book intimately. Use your Spell Sets! They are fast, reliable and save the downtime from opening-searching-memming-closing-standing-casting. Lately, I've become very dextrous at on-the-fly spell swaps:  Right click a spell to drop it. Right click the empty slot. move cursor down the list to the set you need and then over to the specific spell and click it. auto sit-mem-stand and boom you're casting without having to o-s-c-s. Learn how those spells are sorted and use it over and over to get it down.<br />
<br />
Spell line stays like this:<br />
1. Biggest heal<br />
2. next biggest heal/regen<br />
3. haste<br />
4. Canny<br />
5. malo<br />
6. cripple<br />
7. slow<br />
8. root<br />
<br />
2, 3, and 6 are the ones I'll swap-on-the-fly or set up spell sets for. hit spell set &quot;buffs&quot; and 2,3, 6 go and 3 buffs come in. buff up and hit spell set &quot;Attack Line&quot; and I'm back to the start. <br />
<br />
Set up hotkeys! I got one that allows me to canny 5 times. one casts malo and slow and sics dogdog. <br />
<br />
As the Shammy, u are primarily slower, and rooter on the running mobs. Malo when needed. Cripple when u can (lowers mob dmg and saves groupies HPs). and secondary healer to the cleric or druid. But always keep your regen on peeps. <br />
<br />
And keep dogdog up when possible. He''s a great DOT and radar if nothing else. He's not a hinderance to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My only advice is like several others said to get Cann 2 and Stoicism as soon as you can use them. Cann 2 will help you get more mana and Stoicism will make you able to heal slightly better and it will also help you learn how and when to use the eventual upgrades Torpor and Quiescence.<br />
<br />
PS. It's really great to see all the people that normally dont post most much come forward when someone requests info like this. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Here is the best piece of advice I can give.  <br />
<br />
When you join this guild, they will obviously have level 65 shaman if they are about to hit ele.  Ask them questions, and lots of them.  Let them teach you how they do things, and learn WHY you do them that way.<br />
<br />
Grouping now will greatly help your intuition by the time you reach your 60s.  Learning when to start casting that slow so its slowed as early as possible without you dying will come with practice, and is your most important job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mgbaron2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">One point to mention when learning to slow in a group:  Try to stand next to the main tank on the pull.  That way you can slow as soon as you want and even if you steal aggro for a second or two you won't ping pong the mob all over the place.  Most groups I've been in weren't happy with mobs running laps around the camp  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>MMshammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Once again you guys have impressed me with your responses, this is all really great stuff, and I will be putting it all into active evaluation mode tonight to pick out the bits that work for me.  Thanks to you all.<br />
<br />
There were a few questions throughout the post which i will try and clarify...<br />
<br />
This comment clicked with me. What class is your main? What level? Guessing here, but if your main's rep has resulted in a higher level guild asking you to join with your shaman then that toon's reputation in a group/raid environment must be pretty solid. <br />
<br />
My main is a 65 Ranger.  I played him without ever soloing too level 59, at which point my work took me afk for about 9 months.  My brother, who has 2 60+ characters used my account to 2 box with his cleric and his chanter over that period.  Whilst away i found that i got intermittent chances to play, so i bought a second account and started, amongst others my shammy.  At about the same time i notcied that the game had deteriorated to a perverted form of child care facility and wanted a character that i could work from begining to end as a solid soloist.  Necro's arent my style, druids whinge too much (no offence to any closet druids out there).  I think that shammys are the Hummer H1 models of the EQ soloist world, they get the job done, but they burn a heck of a lot of gas doing it.<br />
<br />
Since i have been back i have dabbled in several characters on several server types and I have come to one conclusion... My shammy is the most versatile and definitely the most enjoyable to play...hence he is rapidly gaining status of &quot;main&quot;.<br />
<br />
So how does this guild come into the picture?  Well, my ranger grouped with a bunch of friends through most of his life.  Some of these guys have left the game, however 4 of them are now officers in said guild.  they know me well, they knew how i played my ranger, and they trust me.  Hence my question to you guys... I want to ensure that i am on the right track to deliver shammy service the same as i delivered ranger service.<br />
<br />
So i know how groups work/dont work, I was really after some clarity as to what my roles are, and how best i can manage them.  You all have done a great job of delivering some light on my path  :D.<br />
<br />
I have been back for about 4 months and I just got Ldon about a month ago.  The game has advanced a lot, even in the 9 months I was away (PoP had been around for a while, but i never got it), but the biggest change i have noticed is in the people playing.  Maybe with the mates i had i was sheltered from this before, but sometimes i feel like I am sitting in the middle of a daycare centre  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Anyways, thanks for your help again guys.  I will most certainly post again with a status of my progress, I appreciate the interest  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>MMshammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">At the risk of being flamed for bumping an old thread, I was asked to let you guys know how things were going when i dinged lvl 49.  I thought the same thread would be better than a new one...<br />
<br />
Well i dinged lvl 49 last night, right before i logged.  In 10 lvls I have gone from being a 100% soloing shammy to really feeling valuable in a group.  I have found a bunch of new friends that send me tells within moments of logging on, wanting to group with me in Ldons, epic groups, PoP groups etc.<br />
<br />
It is like a different game now, i wish i had started grouping earlier  :D .  I have set up some standard spell lists (based on Samanna's lists - TY Samanna  :D ) and have become very familiar with the spell change menus.  I try to deliver a requested buff straight away and never moan about having no mana as i have found a neat balance between canni-ing and stoicism... chain canni  :eek:  gotta love it.<br />
<br />
I put a group of new friends together to get my Stoic quest done, took 1.5 hours and i dinged 44 20 min before the flask dropped.  Stoic-ed everyone in the group on the beach in Gunthak I was so rapt  :D .<br />
<br />
I have had 3 complements.  In 65 lvls on my ranger i never had a complement (no flames either mind), i just did my thing and did it to the best of my abilities.  My shammy has had a pat on the back twice for taking care of emergency CC in 2 different Ldons, the third complement was for never letting buffs drop on anyone during a group doing three Ldons back to back.<br />
<br />
Will be picking up my 49 spells tonight, and gonna keep grouping on, doing the shammy thing... gotta love it  :cool: <br />
<br />
Thanks to all that offered their advice before, I wouldnt have met the new friends i have, or begun on the path to ubahshammydom without you all.  :D , I liked my shammy very much before, now i love it.  <br />
<br />
I still think that Shammies are a great soloing class, but EQ is a much better game when you group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I've actually found it's easier just to buff agi then to argue about it.<br />
Yep, I just toss it out there with my other buffs, with a warning about clicking it off if you dont want it....my usual groupies know I use it and use it as a junk buff slot, which is about all its useful for.As another hint, if you or a friend has GoD, Cann II is a vendor spell there, so the quest is really just for those that want to do it or dont have GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My suggestion for a Shaman who wants to learn to work in a group situation is to start doing all the LDoN's you can.  You will learn to play your class well or you will die a lot.<br />
<br />
Start by only taking on the &quot;classic&quot; Shaman role of Buffer/Slower/De-Buffer.  If a Shaman is unable to take care of this role in a group situation he's useless.  Once you become comfortable in this role you will be ready to start handling Crowd Control.<br />
<br />
Slow is an AWESOME way to grab aggro.  You can easily turn a resisted pacy or bad pull into gravy.  Enchanters?  Who needs em.  Back off from the fray.  Slow one of the adds . . . you can bet your @$$ he's coming for you.  He whacks you once, you root him.  Sick Scooby on him to keep him parked.  Repeat for all adds, minus Scooby who will be busy with that first mob for quite some time.  Once the MT starts on the mob Scooby has parked, back Scooby off and send him to a different mob.  I've juggled up to 4 mobs this way while our MT was polishing off the initial pull.<br />
<br />
As you get higher in levels, you'll probably want to learn to pull.  Depending on the mobs, you can either pull with Slow or with Mal(x).  You'll learn over the course of leveling when to use which.  Basically, if my Slow will land 3 out of 4 times without Mal then I pull with Slow.  If my Slow is 50% or less, I pull with Mal so I am SURE that my Slow will land next.<br />
<br />
As you become better you will find that your presence can turn almost any group into a seemingly well oiled machine.  I get a LOT of comments from people I group with often that Adventures go SO much smoother with me there that they can't believe it.  Its a good thing.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />
