<br />
Well here's a story about a man named Hootie, <br />
Country Club President, people say he's sorta snootie, <br />
then one day while Hootie's talking on the tube, <br />
up jumps a viewer and she screams, &quot;HE'S A BOOB!&quot; <br />
... <br />
President of N.C.W.O. <br />
Martha Burk... <br />
Woman with an agenda... <br />
dangerous thing... <br />
<br />
Next thing you know ol Hooties in hot water, <br />
seems his private club will take your son, but not your daughter, <br />
Martha screams: &quot;let the women play in there!&quot; <br />
But Hootie one ups her and pulls the sponsors from the air... <br />
<br />
IBM, Coca-Cola, Citigroup... <br />
Blue chippers, big money... <br />
<br />
Well Martha ain't done, she's got herself a plan, <br />
if Hootie won't give in, she'll go to see the man! <br />
She packs up her agenda and her priorities, <br />
and off she goes to see CBS - TV... <br />
<br />
Corporation... <br />
Media Conglomerate... <br />
Stockholders... <br />
You're in over your head Martha... <br />
<br />
Well CBS listens as Martha bends their ear, <br />
she talks about what's right and she talks about what's fair, <br />
CBS nods and says &quot;We thank you for your time,&quot; <br />
but when it comes to the Masters it's about the bottom line... <br />
<br />
Ratings... <br />
Shares... <br />
Money... <br />
<br />
So now we thank you for listening to our tale, <br />
if you think it's over, then it must be cold in Hell, <br />
Cuz Martha has set her priorities, <br />
and she won't be dissuaded by hy-po-cri-sy... <br />
<br />
Women's colleges... <br />
Girl Scouts... <br />
Womens only health clubs..</div></div><hr />
