<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How about this aa?<br />
<br />
Enchanted Weapon Mastery<br />
<br />
When you activate this AA, you force the weapon you're wielding in your primary slot to proc sooner, but skip the next random proc.<br />
<br />
Level 1:  5 minute reuse, proc within 30 seconds, 3 aa<br />
Level 2:  3 minute reuse, proc within 15 seconds, 6 aa<br />
Level 3:  2 minute reuse, proc within 5 seconds, 9 aa<br />
<br />
The exact cost/recast could be determined by playtesting on test, but this gives the basic idea.  <br />
<br />
For one thing, it would give even non-melee classes an amusing new dimension of gear to mess around with.  Jumping into melee every few minutes to proc your weapon, then jumping back out and going back to whatever you were doing.<br />
<br />
And of course, forcing a &quot;massive hate weapon&quot; to proc at the beginning of a combat would lock in the tank's agro nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is a good idea, but one of the main gripes of the warrior community is that they should not be forced to rely on procs for aggro.  I think this would be a good solution, though, since nowadays anyone can buy a decent aggro proccing weapon for under 10k, or aug one after a few days spent in ldon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How about instead of chance to proc, directly adding a certain amount of aggro?  WOuldnt that be more fair for warriors that dont have lots of money sitting around, and it would still help high end warriors with everything.<br />
<br />
win-win for all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes. let's break the game by giving Warriors snap aggro and trivializing every encounter, ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was looking for a solution which all classes might be able to use, which also happened to solve the warrior &quot;snap agro&quot; issue.  An aa to add hate to weapon swings seems (1) boring and (2) extremely warrior-specific.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the AA I'm proposing is probably something I'd actually buy, but doesn't on the face of it look absurdly powerful.  And it lets warriors get snap agro when it's truly critical without making them in all ways superior to knights.<br />
<br />
And if worried about this trivializing raid encounters, restrict it to only work when attacking mobs below level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, I think there should be an AA for warriors starting at level 60 or 61 that has 5 levels like planar power.  It's function would be passive, not activated.  It would increase the amount of aggro that the taunt ability causes and it would enable warriors to taunt more effectively against 60+ mobs.  Each level of the AA should increase the effectiveness of taunt by at least 10-15%, and allow warriors to taunt monsters of increasingly higher level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And if worried about this trivializing raid encounters, restrict it to only work when attacking mobs below level 65.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few raid MoBs under 65. Not everyone is in the planes. You may not break the game past Tier2 PoP, but you'll trivialize almost all content before then.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I wish I were as completely blind as some people, so that I too could believe Warriors have it as bad as they pretend they do, and jump on their bandwagon.<br />
<br />
Warrior &quot;Cry to Arms&quot;? I don't know about the To Arms part, but Cry is sure dead on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">While it MIGHT be fun, your suggestion looks to be a coding nightmare.  It doesnt help warriors any more than waiting for their weapon to proc either IMO.  Every two minutes I have a guaranteed chance to proc..yippy.  The ONLY benefit to this aa would be you could be guaranteed to open with a proc (assuming you had no more than ONE mob every 2 minutes)<br />
<br />
Look at how much trouble they have making doors open the right way.  Do you really want them to make code that forces a proc in X-seconds and skips the next proc?<br />
<br />
Its not an AA i would even think of getting.  One proc guaranteed every 2 minutes? for 18aa? No thanks.  Don't try to disguise it as a great AA for everyone, its not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If the coding is too difficult, fair enough, but I think your other objections are incorrect.<br />
<br />
We could change the exact recast times and aa prices, as I mentioned in the original note.  If 18aa is too pricy, make it cost 12 or 6.  whatever.  If 2 minute recast on the highest level is insufficient, make it 1 minute recast.<br />
<br />
For the sake of arguement, let's say we leave it alone and you happen to burn the aa and get the highest level.  It's basically free damage every 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Let's say a ranger or beastlord has a steel hilted flint daggar.  He could swap it in every 2 minutes for a 622 point nuke.  That's an extra 5dps.<br />
<br />
Any primal equipped melee can swap their primal in for a known and minimal amount of time, proc avatar, then swap it back out instead of wielding the thing when they'd rather be using their regular weapon.<br />
<br />
When you REALLY want to interrupt that chealing mob, you can swap in your copper hammer of striking and know that you're going to proc that stun.<br />
<br />
A shaman can swap in spear of constriction, proc the ensnare, then stop screwing around meleeing.<br />
<br />
It seems like EVERY class could come up with some creative uses of an ability like this.  It's not just a stealth way to up warrior agro.  Hell, I don't even have a warrior alt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There are quite a few raid MoBs under 65. Not everyone is in the planes. You may not break the game past Tier2 PoP, but you'll trivialize almost all content before then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior aggro on raid-class mobs is already trivial.  Ranger uses weaponshield, builds mass aggro, warrior AE taunts.  You're unlikely to kill more than one big mob per 15 minutes, so even a single warrior is enough for this.<br />
<br />
If you're honestly worried about pre-PoP raid content becoming &quot;trivialized&quot;, future tense, then you're already too late.  Adding AA abilities, adding five levels and all around mudflation have already done that.<br />
<br />
That said, I'm not very fond of the initial suggestion.  It wouldn't be too bad if weaponry was limited to simple DD / stun / hate procs, but I don't think warriors should be able to, say, slow or snare at will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you make a good point on procing a utility type proc.<br />
<br />
For those who dont have a bag of weapons with assorted procs its not helpful though...<br />
<br />
For damage/aggro procs its not really beneficial; you are using the weapon FOR the proc, and one proc guaranteed every 2 minutes isnt worth it, 1 minute isnt really either. I dunno how much less than 1 minute is acceptable without being overpowered though.</div></div><hr />

I maintain that Warriors have nowhere the issues they claim to. All they need is a little more utility. Aggro is not a problem for a good Warrior. If your Warriors have aggro issues, then maybe you should find out who the &quot;weakest link&quot; in the party is, instead of believing eveyrone is innocent and Sony is to blame for people being too lazy to play their classes well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you completely that people are generally too lazy to learn to play their classes well.  I don't blame Sony for that in the least.<br />
<br />
I'll point out, however, that holding the moral high ground and saying &quot;Well, if they're too stupid to know how to control their aggro, I don't want to group with them anyway&quot; doesn't lend itself well to advancement.  I see no difference between the AA points I've earned with idiots and the AA points I'd earned with geniuses.<br />
<br />
People follow the path of least resistance.  When I levelled a shaman, pre-kunark, I spent most of my time in Unrest, Cazic-Thule, and Lower Guk.<br />
<br />
When I started a warrior, shortly before Velious launch, those same places were virtual ghost towns.  People moved to the easy XP of Lake of Ill Omen / Frontier Mountains / Overthere / Dreadlands.<br />
<br />
Sitting in Unrest and fuming about all the idiots in Lake of Ill Omen wouldn't have done me any more good THEN than me sitting in PoT fuming about all the idiots who've grown up without learning to control their aggro because they're used to knights as tanks<br />

I think you hit it right on the head here.  Perception matters a great deal, and warrior messageboards have done their very best to make warriors appear gimps.  Go read em, post after post of how knights are superior.  After reading all that, how many people want warriors?<br />
How many 'ranja down' jokes do we still hear/tell?  The FACT of rangers being pathetic was taken care long ago, but the PERCEPTION lingers to this day.  Warriors, welcome to ranja land, some of you certainly earned it.<br />
Just as aside, I'll still take warriors any time.  The other side of the coin is that the poorly played warriors are fading out.  Some of the good ones(and I'm not talking about their gear) remain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I figured if you make it an AA that's open to all classes, it would keep class balance relatively reasonable, while still being something that the warriors who feel they need help can get.  I see A LOT of people, including many warriors thinking that they aren't broken.  Those folks could get this AA for an amusing toy, while the others who feel that warriors are broken can have an easy fix to the problem without throwing class balance totally out of whack.<br />
<br />
At least that was the thought.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any opinions on the AA suggestion itself, rather than how it addresses warrior concerns?  I did intend for this particular AA to be available to all classes, not just warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The problem with warriors is not just agro generation, not just poort itemization, and not just poor utility. The problem is the combination of them all.<br />
<br />
Right now, if you gave warriors equal agro generate as hybrids, all encounters will essentially be trivialized by quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Any itemization change at this point in the game will simply be seen as a nerf to knights, and the same goes with giving Warriors extra utility. After all, warriors are fighters, not hybrids.<br />
<br />
So what exactly can we give warriors to once again widen the gap between then and the hybrids? The answer is nothing. There is absolutely nothing anybody can do in the current expansions to widen the gap without pissing off the Knights in some way or another. Let's face it, with current itemization guilds would be using non-warriors to tank current content just because they can, and nothing short of something drastic, such as increasing all mob damage by 75% or some such, would change that.<br />
<br />
However, there could very well be changes in new expansions. For example, SoE could give warriors innate Mirror and innate Shielding abilities through AAs (perhaps 5, 10, 15%). To continue with this line of thought, hypothetically new raid mobs could have insanely annoying unresistable (but mirrorable) procs such as 20-30 sec stuns, charmes, mezzes etc.<br />
<br />
Again, hypothetically speaking, SoE could introduce raid level mobs with insanely high and also highly varient DI, which would make warriors ideal tanks. <br />
<br />
These are just idle thoughts though, because SoE is stuck, and no matter which way they swing on this issue, there are going to be pissed AND dissatisfied people out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Or just fix the taunt skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you realize that low level people use those spells? Do you realize that &quot;fixing&quot; agro on certain spells, such as DoTs and stuns, would completely change caster agro from lvl 1 through 65?<br />
<br />
&quot;Fixing&quot; taunt, depending on what your idea of &quot;fixing&quot; is, can be anywhere from completely ineffective as far as balancing warriors to completely trivializing encounters, ie, create a bigger problem than it solves.<br />
<br />
If balancing melees was that easy, it'd have been done already.</div></div><hr />

I challenge you to go to a new server, start up a warrior (any race, it doesn't matter), level yourself up, and come back and see how loudly you talk after that. No cheating now, you start with 0pp, no equipment and no high level friends to help you out. You must level enough to be asked to tank in PoP. I suggest 55 as thats the level most warriors realize they are fighting a losing battle. Now, I realize from you posts that you are smarter than most of us, and it will probably occur to you that you are on the losing end of thing faster than the rest of us would but I ask that you get to at least 55 before you quit just for the sake of thoroughness. Furthermore, I suggest that you come to my server (FV) where you can't just roll up more easily leveled alts to help smooth things out for your aspiring warrior.<br />
Anyone who speaks as loudly and offensively as you do should be willing to put his money where his mouth is. Otherwise you simply look like a child who's mother never taught him any manners.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Anyone who doesn't think warriors need a severe buff is a blind moron.<br />
<br />
Before Luclin and Planes of Power, Knights made decent tanks in that they could get aggro better. However for raid mobs, warriors were needed because of defensive disc. Warriors knew they weren't great at picking up aggro, but they also knew that thanks to defensive they had their niche, and were irreplacable.<br />
<br />
Then Luclin and PoP come along. Gone are the days of unslowable mobs with straightforward &quot;melee damage up the butthole&quot; tactics. Its an era of DD procs, AE's, and mobs that are so slowable, crippleable, and clerics are so abundant and filled with boundless mana that melee damage in all formes becomes trivial. And thus defensive becomes useless. A paladin takes a 3000dd lifetap proc just as well as a warrior does, but holds aggro 5 times better. A shadownight takes a 4000dd directional AE just as well as a warrior, but holds aggro 5 times better.<br />
<br />
Warrior disciplines are close to useless in Planes of Power. So close to useless, that the aggro taking and holding abilities of the paladin and shadowknight make them being main tanks safer. Quarm has been tanked by shadows and pallies (Main time guild on my server uses a paladin as main tank always for quarm farming). Fennin ro tanked by Monks. Rangers even are becoming superior to warriors in tanking ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Original Poster, your solution is by far not good enough. Warriors need a 2nd taunt ability unshared by knights which recycles every 5 seconds and increases hate by a minimum of 10 and maximum of 300, depending on the warrior's skill level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I once sent a suggestion to SOE, saying that why not add some of the current WAR only procs/effects as the skills for warriors. Say, Furious Bash - make it a skill, with 3 different levels, warriors can train one level of it at, say, lvl 20 and it is automatic, added to Bash/Slam skill. At, say, level 40, they get to train FB 2 and at 60, FB3. No need to figure out something new, but use the damn things ALREADY in the game. Not to mention that these abilities/effects/procs are already WAR only, so no one will really lose here, neither will WAR's gain immediate huge gain. WAR would STILL have to land that Bash/Slam, and the aggro amount generated by it is getting gradually bigger with the levels, leaving plenty of room for knights to offtank or get fast aggro, when needed. In this situation, 2 mobs are inc, knight will aggro one fast to offtank it, WAR will get another and thanks to the skill, keeps the aggro just as well as knight. Once main mob is dead, WAR can switch over to another mob, and thanks to this skill, gain the aggro back from the knight if needed (provided that the knight isn't some brainless bufoon, who will try, no matter what, keep aggro on him). Or not, whichever way they have agreed upon.<br />
<br />
Enraging Blow - heck, make also 3 levels of it, add it to WAR kick. Make it perhaps weaker then the proc from weapons, but higher then from FB one above. Let WAR's learn it at, say, lvl 25/45/65, and add it to Kick. No need to re-invent the bicycle again, everything is already in the game.<br />
<br />
Those who here said that &quot;warrior has no aggro problems when others in the group watch their aggro&quot; - bah. The bloody thing IS unbalanced, when everyone in the group can go nuts and ballistic with their skills/effects/spells when there's the knight tanking, without worries that the mob will aggro on them, and with warrior they have to watch not to breathe too loud to piss the mob off. Nothing here relates to &quot;skill&quot; and &quot;experiece&quot; and &quot;aggro management&quot;, it relates to &quot;broken stuff and BS&quot;. If knight is the tank and I can slow the mob as soon as it is incoming without getting any aggro whatsoever; and with warrior I have to wait and wait and wait, while cleric burns mana on couple CH's, possibly gains aggro, I slow the mob to save cleric and get it off of cleric and gain aggro, cleric burns mana on me because of insane DPS the mob uses and because it just maybe resisted my slow, cleric burns mana on himself to heal the damage from the heal aggro, I slow and mob is again on me and I use Quiescence to heal myself - and during all this time the warrior frantically tries to gain the aggro and manages to finally get it when mob is at 15% HP - this is broken. The MAIN tank class can't get hell worth of aggro with all of his skills and whatever (because most of the warriors on all of the servers do NOT have those crazy aggro WAR weapons or had the time to get all of the AA's there are (which suck when it comes to aggro anyway)) and then some secondary tank classes just flip the finger, cast the spell, and mob is locked on them - nothing here relates to skills, in any way. And those who even have the gear, still have to rely on the mercy of the &quot;proc to go off at some point&quot;, while secondary tanks, again, just flip the finger, press the button to cast the spell and tadaa! Insta aggro, locked.<br />
<br />
Knights add enough utility to groups with their buffs and special spells and so on. Not to mention that as it is now, they also add the tanking ability and insta-aggro and perma-aggro, so to say. Warriors add nothing. Granted, the lack of spells and group skills/AA's will not let the warrior have any utility in the group anyway (for the whole group as such), but hell, at least let them then do the one thing they are meant for, the thing they are made for - tank, get aggro, KEEP aggro.</div></div><hr />

Do you realize that low level people use those spells? Do you realize that &quot;fixing&quot; agro on certain spells, such as DoTs and stuns, would completely change caster agro from lvl 1 through 65?<br />
<br />
&quot;Fixing&quot; taunt, depending on what your idea of &quot;fixing&quot; is, can be anywhere from completely ineffective as far as balancing warriors to completely trivializing encounters, ie, create a bigger problem than it solves.<br />
<br />
If balancing melees was that easy, it'd have been done already.<br />
I realize that they can take in account the spell lvl difference to calculate agro generated by them, but this is a double-blade knife, 'cause then, non hybrids could cast non-stop with lower level spells (at 65, tugurs is a 'low' level spell, so calculations would make it generate less agro...).<br />
<br />
The main problem is people using MIN/MAX to make groups. Only the optimal combination is used, so when different classes perform same rol, only the 'best' is chosen. <br />
<br />
A warrior group is a bit more challenging (more fun) because you have to control agro, but people want fast xp because the only objective now seems to be getting to 65 max AAs and best equipment. Fun seems to be a future objective, something to do when your equipment is the best and you have max AAs. Then, when you get there, fun is not there and you start an alter to grind again...  <br />
<br />
Thinking of leaving EQ for a while... bit tired of grinding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Most of you don't really see the real problem. <br />
<br />
It isn't warriors and it isn't Knights. The Warrior still tanks better than any hybrid with and without defensive or evasive. <br />
The point is that the healing available is good enough to keep both type of tanks alive through the highest DPS encounters. <br />
So you either up the mob DPS to the point that any non warrior *can* die no matter how tight the healing rotation is or you tone down the healing ability of all priests.<br />
<br />
Excluding certain spells in a particular zone would go a long way in making fights more interesting and non trivial again. You can disable CotH and Gate, you can disable CH or Vie as well.<br />
<br />
All this really only matters, if you are of the opinion that Warriors should be the only ones able to tank the toughest mobs. I never read Warriors should have the &quot;tanking monopoly&quot;. If they aren't tanking they can dish out decent damage.<br />
If you think about it, the Shaman is in the same boat if not worse. We used to be better slowers, and some people say we still are, but if you had Enchanters(who have a better aggro control) or even Beastlords(can handle aggro better) slowing Time gods, they would die just the same. If Warriors need help, Shamans need too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Stop saying &quot;fix Taunt&quot;, because Taunt isn't broken, It actually never worked better than it currently is, it was never intended to be anything else than what it is today.</div></div><hr />

Right, because it's not like guilds can use Paladins (with snap aggro) to trivialize every encounter, ever.<br />
<br />
I maintain that Warriors have nowhere the issues they claim to.<br />
<br />
Right, other than the fact there is no reason, ever, to invite them to tank for an exp group over a knight. Oh, yeah, and the fact that knights can raid tank instead of a warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
All they need is a little more utility. Aggro is not a problem for a good Warrior. If your Warriors have aggro issues, then maybe you should find out who the &quot;weakest link&quot; in the party is, instead of believing eveyrone is innocent and Sony is to blame for people being too lazy to play their classes well.<br />
<br />
Sure, a warrior can hold aggro, if a party manages its aggro well. On the other hand, with a knight tanking, casters can burn much sooner, there's less ping ponging, and less chance of a healer ever meeting a mob face to face. So, ummm, why on earth would your average group ever want to get exp more slowly with a warrior and actually have to pay attention to the game when they can just grab a knight to &quot;dumb down&quot; the game. <br />
<br />
If your best argument against buffing warriors is that it makes the game too &quot;stupideasy&quot;, then the solution is clear: nerf knight aggro. <br />

There's no problem with Warriors in regards to holding aggro, nor is there in regards to their relative tanking ability. <br />
The healing makes tanking trivial for everyone who can't be one rounded by X mob, period. That's the root of the problem.<br />

Some of you might remember how hard Lord Vyemm was before they totally gimped him and before people exploited the AE by simply turning NPC spells off. It was a challenege for every guild back then due to the nature of the fight and the inability to use a CH-chain. <br />
<br />
EQ has to go back to blast healing. <br />
Blast heals will drain the healer's mana a lot faster and it will create random holes in the healing &quot;pattern&quot;, which actually allow the mob to kill the tank on a good melee round. This will give the Warrior an edge in regards to tankability again since the margin of error with a Warrior tank is bigger in general.</div></div><hr />

I think getting an AA to fix warrior aggro is...not such a good idea.  Why should they need AAs to fix a broken skill like taunt?  Taunt needs to work more then 25% of the time...simple as that.  Gives Sony a place to start.  Melee is soo far broken fixing ONE thing is no where near the answer but starting with just that would help.

<br />
I would certainly prefer to spend 25k for something I can resell than for a level 60 spell that I will outgrow (torpor), and for which there is no cash recovery when I do.<br />

On the other hand, their complaints about the limited variety of decent aggro proccing weapons has merit.  If there are really only 4 or 5 weaps that work for their class, then they are being shortchanged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And Vab didn't even have to use VoT or Vie, so i fail to see what's the difference.<br />
<br />
Unsurprising. <br />
<br />
If he could hold the aggro, any Warrior with a bazaar sold BoC and VoT can too. <br />
<br />
And a bard could hold aggro with Chords of Dissonance. Their guildmembers would just have to watch their aggro. The problem isn't that no mob on the face of Norrath will ever attack a warrior. The problem is that a warrior cannot generate aggro on demand, and thus imposes stricter limits on what their allies can do. <br />
<br />
Want to nuke hard? Grab a knight.<br />
Want to go all out DPS? Grab a knight.<br />
Want to sit on your ass and wait for procs? Grab a warrior, baby! <br />
<br />
On a side note, given equivalent procs, monk aggro generation is somewhat better than a warrior's over an extended fight. Warriors don't have Instill Doubt. A warrior has to rely on superior DPS (while tanking) and procs to generate aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's no problem with Warriors in regards to holding aggro, nor is there in regards to their relative tanking ability. <br />
<br />
Other than the fact that Knights tank almost exactly as well as a non-defensive warrior, and generate much more aggro than a warrior whenever they feel like it.<br />
<br />
Defensive is the only reason to ever have a warrior around. If you don't need defensive, you don't need warriors. They have monk-level DPS, zero utility, and can't generate aggro on demand.<br />
<br />
But yeah, other than that, they're golden. <br />

<br />
This would only be true if a Warrior actually had an inherent tanking advantage over a knight. Since they don't this is moot. In fact, given a reliance on blast heals, I'd much prefer a Knight tank since they have vastly superior aggro generation tools, equivalent avoidance and mitigation, and the extra 600 or so hit points that a warrior has no longer matter in terms of efficiency, as we're not using Complete Heal. Not that 600 hit points is much of an advantage even with Complete Heal, but it would be just one more erosion of the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Thanks for ignoring the post above. <br />
Show me a damn valid parse that straight out tells you Warriors and Knights mitigate identically. What about the higher total HPs of the Warrior, isn't that an &quot;inherent tanking advantage&quot; ?<br />
<br />
You are not seriously going to tell me that Instill Doubt generates aggro on demand, are you?<br />
The monk wasn't using any aggro enhancing buffs, every Warrior will be able to hold aggro like the Monk easily.<br />
<br />
Hell, how many times do you see your guild warriors lose aggro anyways?<br />
<br />
I know, i have to really try hard to outaggro my warrior and if i tried hard enough i could outaggro any knight as well probably. <br />
Let's not forget that the Warrior has the ability to AE taunt off a WS tank to get high on top of the hatelist before any heals land on him, which no other class can as reliably as him either.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the discussion is moot. You are using a Warrior to tank your mobs, aren't you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">the extra 600 or so hit points that a warrior has no longer matter in terms of efficiency, as we're not using Complete Heal.

<br />
I forgot this gem.<br />
<br />
When you don't use CH the extra HPs matter so much more, since CH is capped at 7500(+AA's) and current hybrids have up to 11 k. The amount the Warrior gets healed for is the same as the amount the Knight gets healed for most of the time.<br />
When you are using blast heals on the other hand, every bit of more HPs counts, since that allows for a larger gap between heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Giac: Only using warriors to tank some raid encounters. Usually they are only necessary as tanks until the current level of encounters has been farmed some.<br />
<br />
Or if the cleric count is low.<br />
<br />
The rest of the time we would be slightly better off using a knight even for raid tanking, as we could start dishing out dps fractionally earlier. <br />
<br />
But we let the warriors tank, always. Why? Because otherwise they would quit. It's a favor to the warriors more than a real requirement.<br />
<br />
And in exp groups... Warriors tank only if we can't shake up a knight to do it. Especially in LDoN. Snap aggro is better than the 5-10% less damage a warrior takes. DPS classes can go all out from the get go with a knight. With a warrior we have to wait for procs or X seconds into the fight. No such limitation with knights.<br />
<br />
Rogues to deal damage? What a laughable concept. 4-5 classes surpass them in damage, all from range so AE rampage and/or sick damage shields isn't an issue. (All these classes also have wicked utility, and all but one is top tier soloers.) You need to unlock some doors in Ssra and disarm some traps there, after that they are just sub-par dps.<br />
<br />
What role monks fill isn't clear to anyone any more. FD pulling is useful for some raid encounters, but in most (not all) of those a sk can do it as well. And the sk fills the off-tank slot as well.<br />
<br />
Rangers do more damage than rogues. From a distance. With a droppable weapon they can buy in the bazaar. They provide valuable buffs to a raid. They can tank, and maintain aggro, even in elemental planes once properly equipped. (Well, a rogue could tank as well, but not maintain the aggro.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Giac, excuse my impertinence, but you use the example of * A * Monk with 5 pieces of Quarm gear (At last count) as THE example for ALL Monks?<br />

Umm yeah, and Bracey is THE example for all Shaman. Or the fellow who claimed Shaman were overpowered because he had a Fungal from levels 1-45 and could tanke IN TEH FACE.<br />
<br />
Banadan's post was spot on for the regular (semi) casual player. Knights can get and hold aggro much faster and much easier. And as you (Giac) yourself mentioned, with Warriors holding a whopping 600-800 points of health advantage and that representing their ONLY advantage over a Knight - then yes, they have some problems.<br />
<br />
The Monk thing was funny. I thought for sure you were being facetious. Was even funnier when I realized you were serious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">This is getting better and better...<br />
<br />
Ok, once the content is farmed some, you don't need necessarily Warriors to tank the mobs. That's called progression.<br />
However, as small as it is, the Warrior's mitigation/avoidance and HPs are superior to any Knights with the same quality of gear. The healing abilities we are given allow us to make other classes than Warriors tank.<br />
<br />
Depending on what your view on the Warrior class and EQ in general is this is either fine or &quot;broken&quot;(Is the Warrior really the only class supposed to tank the toughest mobs?)<br />
<br />
For the Rogue DPS being surpassed by 4 to 5 classes...Sorry, but what are you smoking?<br />
The Rogue is the highest DPS class in game. In very short fights, a Wizard with similar gear can rival him, but that's it. Given certain circumstances the Mage can rarely be on par with them, but generally the Rogue will outdamage everyone at Raid.</div></div><hr />

As far as warrior aggro goes a good portion of the aggro problem IMO was itemization related especially in PoP. You have all sorts of nice weapons dropping and a grand total of 2 weapons with aggro procs (Cord hilted driver and BoW) before plane of time. There where a couple other stun proccing weapons which weren't bad for aggro either. The fact that you had to go back to SoL (cursed and creator) or SoV (AoW) for a good aggro procing weapon was truely messed up. LDoN has helped alot with this. The ability to take a good dps weapon, maybe with some sort of not eb/stun proc, and add a stun (yak) or EB (anger 3) proc to the weapon has allowed warriors to make most weapons in t viable aggro holding weapons and take any good weapon and make if great. Take it to the extreme like furror has with the 2 best time weapons both augmented with anger 3 with a clicky stun proc item and warrior bp (perma aggro mod) and you've got a warrior that generates huge amounts of aggro. Might take a little longer to get the aggro lock but definitely got solid aggro with that.<br />
<br />
Personally my normal tank in any sort of adventure is a warrior but thats just because he's my room mate and I know he's decked out, has very good aggro and has a clue. If I where doing a random pick up group I'd definitely prefer a pally or sk since thier aggro abilities aren't dependant on thier gear. They don't have to have a boc or done dozens of ldon raids already to buy aggro proc augments.<br />
<br />
Giac does make a good point. Anyone that can't be killed in a single round can tank any mob given an effective heal chain. I know personally my guild has done silly things like having a wizard main tank sol ro mini mobs etc. Bulwark of Vie definitely helps out here because it makes that worst case situation that much easier to handle in addition to just over all lowering the mobs dps. <br />
<br />
As far as hps or any other tanking advantage goes for warriors it really depends on the situation. If your compairing elemental geared warriors to pallys/sks warriors do have an advantage altho not a huge one. The advantage comes from the collective effect of the small differences in hps on thier respective elmental armor. Fast forward to time and warriors, sks and pallys are all going to be going after almost all the same gear now. In time the hps difference all but disappears.<br />
<br />
As far as the idea that warriors can't get any better aggro with out trivializing the game I've got news for ya it's already there. Any mob that can't kill your pally/sk in one round can already be trivial if you choose and it's pretty clear from what arch overseer's has been doing that as long as your pally or sk is sufficiently geared thats pretty much every mob in the game right now.</div></div><hr />

In a group using a druid or shaman to heal you can also subtract an additional 700(marzin) and 425(HB..shammy healer) for a Paladin hp advantage of 580 or 1005.<br />

I'm not sure what the other warrior posters here have said (sorry, just skimmed a bunch of the posts), but for me, the exp group situation is the whole issue.  Yes, I'm in a guild and I do some raiding - usually 2 nights a week so not much by some standards.  On a raid with the proper support, as someone else already pointed out, pretty much anyone can tank.  For me the problem is how less efficient an exp group is with a warrior versus an equivallently (is that a word??) equiped knight.<br />
<br />
As to monks and rogues...never played em so I don't know enough to comment much.  (although when I had 2 rogues in my ldon group once it was amazing how fast the mobs dropped once I got solid agro - after a proc or two on my GSoT.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Why are you trying to sell me that exp group ****?<br />
<br />
<br />
Because thats where they have a lot of trouble. No one with any sense prefers (or even wants) a warrior to tank in an exp group. Riposte leads to more damage taken, and they suck for aggro. Not being able to offload like you can w a knight means slower kills. Every 15 mins, they can ae taunt. Whoopy crap. <br />
<br />
Warrior control their aggro? umm HOW? They hit auto attack and pray for procs. They save taunt, which is largely useless. The group controls warrior aggro more, by holding back. You know what? Id rather not have to handicap myself and 4 others so my roommate can not suck. He has a BoC and Storm blade from Agnarr, granted, they dont have anger 3 procs yet, but should warriors really need ALL this to function as a mediocre exp tank? I dont see anyone saying knights need uber gear to suffice as an exp tank. More is required of warriors to be weaker at a task than a knight... I dont really see that as fair.<br />
<br />
I can deal with warriors not being the preferred exp tank, but the gulf between them and knights need to shrink.<br />

HP advantage? LOL... 800 more omg, such a huge diff. It sucks that by and large, tanks use the same gear. If they actually had melee only gear that was worth a damn, it might be diff. And I dont mean warr/monk/rogue stuff with 3 ac on it, for fear that monks may once again not be paper sacks. Any hp advantage is lost in a huge way the moment the warrior dual wields.<br />
<br />
Up melee dps, add useful aa's that provide group benefit (similar to warcry, but not lame), fill in gear spots, lower disc reuse timers to add benefit outside of raids (trash is trivial, everyone saves disc for the target... it would only increase exp benefit), etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
About that 800 hp advantage...I was in PoS (tier 2) a couple days ago for the first time and we were fighting spiders and golems.  I have 6500 hp and 1250 ac.  I would regularly get knocked down to 20 to 30% in the first few seconds of the fight (single mobs.)  Part of the reason is because the enchie could not slow immediately for fear of getting agro - although half the time I lost agro on the slow immediately.  The net of the story is, the cleric had to use more mana then would have been necessary with a knight tanking and doing slow on inc.  Sorry, but the 800 points isn't squat in PoP.  (and I haven't even been to tier 3+ yet and I already see the hp advantage more than mitigated already)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Thanks for ignoring the post above. <br />
Show me a damn valid parse that straight out tells you Warriors and Knights mitigate identically. What about the higher total HPs of the Warrior, isn't that an &quot;inherent tanking advantage&quot; ?<br />
<br />
400 to 600 hit points is a 3-5% advantage in Hit Points. Go warriors! It's your birthday! I don't have a parse handy, but I've seen several floating around. If I get a chance I'll dig one up. It's not exactly one of the Seven Secrets Which Cannot Be Spoken kept in an ancient temple to Shub-Niggurath buried deep within the Himalayas. Pretty much any melee class can tell you that.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are not seriously going to tell me that Instill Doubt generates aggro on demand, are you?<br />
<br />
Sure, push a button, get aggro. Aggro on demand. It's not all that reliable, of course, but when it works it's a huge chunk of hate. If you need hate added to your aggro, it can be significantly better than taunt.<br />
<br />
<br />
The monk wasn't using any aggro enhancing buffs, every Warrior will be able to hold aggro like the Monk easily.<br />
<br />
No, the warrior doesn't hold aggro (neither does the monk). The guild gives aggro to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell, how many times do you see your guild warriors lose aggro anyways?<br />
<br />
<br />
Rarely... because everyone else in the guild works to control aggro. We lower our DPS to refrain from stealing aggro from warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know, i have to really try hard to outaggro my warrior and if i tried hard enough i could outaggro any knight as well probably. <br />
Let's not forget that the Warrior has the ability to AE taunt off a WS tank to get high on top of the hatelist before any heals land on him, which no other class can as reliably as him either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Depends on the class I'm playing. I can easily pull aggro off a warrior with a Necro, Shaman, or Enchanter. I can do it with a monk, but have to work at it. Any hybrid in the game can pull aggro off a warrior. Don't play a wizard or a mage, but we all know they can do it at will.<br />
<br />
Right, 'cause AE taunt is better than spells for aggro. Really! That's why nobody in their right mind uses a warrior to tank LDoN raids if they have well-geared knights available.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, the discussion is moot. You are using a Warrior to tank your mobs, aren't you?<br />
<br />
Rarely ever in LDoN raids, and well, we've all seen how badly you need a warrior in time, right? So, ummm, where exactly does a high end warrior shine? Why should a top-notch guild care about having a warrior in it? <br />
<br />
For the Rogue DPS being surpassed by 4 to 5 classes...Sorry, but what are you smoking?<br />
The Rogue is the highest DPS class in game. In very short fights, a Wizard with similar gear can rival him, but that's it. Given certain circumstances the Mage can rarely be on par with them, but generally the Rogue will outdamage everyone at Raid.<br />
<br />
On trash mobs the rogue may outdamage everyone. On boss mobs Necros, Mages, and Wizards are all likely to outdamage a rogue. I'd say that '4 to 5' classes is an exaggeration, but rogues are certaintly not the DPS kings. <br />
<br />
When you don't use CH the extra HPs matter so much more, since CH is capped at 7500(+AA's) and current hybrids have up to 11 k. The amount the Warrior gets healed for is the same as the amount the Knight gets healed for most of the time.<br />
.<br />
<br />
Right, because we all time our CHeal rotations to land at 25%! <br />
<br />
Warriors still use a CHR very, very slightly more effectively than a knight.<br />
<br />
The funny part is that you're yelling about how warriors mitigate damage better.. but for a warrior and a knight to recieve the same healing from a CH chain with a given interval, they will have had to have taken the same amount of damage during that interval. So, do hybrids just have superior avoidance? <br />
<br />
When you are using blast heals on the other hand, every bit of more HPs counts, since that allows for a larger gap between heals<br />
<br />
I can't even imagine how this made it past your internal censor. There has to be some part of you that realizes in retrospect how absurd this statement is, so I won't harp on it too much. Suffice it to say that the goal of healing is to heal as much damage as a mob puts out within a given time frame. Total hit number of hit points has no bearing on this whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

You're precisely the kind of retard who jumps on bandwagons because someone says such-and-such is true. It's people like you who are the real problem. <br />
<br />
Yeah, Knights have snap aggro ... and? Warriors have Defensive. You give them Defensive and Snap Aggro and you remove the challenge from the game. Their one ability gimps them just as much Turgur's gimps us. We won't get any significant rise in power because we are hands down the best slowrs in the game. Just like Warriors are the best raid tanks in the game.<br />
<br />
If you can't see this, then you're the biggest twit I've ever had the displeasure of having to read's trite and disappointingly lacking opinion.<br />
<br />
Quarm hits like a little girl. You can have ANY class tank him with enough healing power there. You can have a level 55 Warrior tank him, or a 55 Druid, FFS. Unless you were there, and know the specifics, you're pulling assumptions out of your rear. Like I said, enjoy the ride on the bandwagon. The mindless need to be lead after all. I bet you it's more efficient having a guild's top Warrior tank Quarm than their top Knights.<br />
<br />
Every single expansion endgame MoBs gets tanked by Knights eventually. That means that certain guilds have moved beyond the expansion.<br />
<br />
A Monk tanked Sol Ro. Does that mean that Monks aren't in need of a serious upgrade?<br />
<br />
Jesus Christ. If you people want to crusade, help a class that needs it. <br />
<br />
If you think there are problems with Warriors ... when's the last time you let a good one tank for your group? Or do you just hear that Warriors suck and avoid them? The same way you once heard Knights sucked and avoided them? Because Knight Aggro has always been there. And that's the primary reason you want them there. <br />
<br />
Maybe if you started seeing with your own eyes instead of believing blindly what people tell you, you'd understand more. But most people are followers and need someone to think for them. Congratulations.<br />
<br />
All Warriors need is utility. Their problem is so deeply rooted that SOE can't think of any effective way to fix them. Hell, if you remove Defensive from the game, I'm all for giving Warriors snap aggro. Until then, no. But if that's what it takes, I'd love to see it done. Give Warriors innate 10% mitigation, or make them give their group an XP bonus for having to wait five seconds longer to slow or nuke.</div></div><hr />

You can slow on incoming and not get hit with a warrior pulling??  Sorry, gotta call out the *S flag on that one.  If so, you should be in Vegas with that kinda luck.   :D   Slow pulls agro from me half the time after I've been beating on the mob for a few seconds...I couldn't imagine what would happen if someone cast on inc.  (can't say for certain because I've never grouped with someone that was that trigger happy with slow with a warrior pulling)<br />
<br />
Also, although I've posted a number of times on this board about warriors, I don't feel they are completely broken...just not as effective relative to knights in exp groups and therefore slightly out of balance.  <br />
I still get groups (and almost always get invited back once I've grouped with someone) and I have a lot of fun playing the game.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I don't like misinformation - either pro or con - which is why I've posted a few times on this board on the whole &quot;meleee (read, not just warrior) balance&quot; issue.

Which is it?  It seems you want to get pity points for your personal hardships as a paladin, but you actually started playing the game after they'd been resolved.<br />
<br />
Dear Kryss,<br />
<br />
So, when are you going to respond to this?  It appears to me that you've been caught.  Are you hoping no one will take the time to read both of your posts and realize that you contradicted yourself?  Most people remember when they started playing - it seems to me you've been making up certain facts to support whatever argument you're putting forth.  With that in mind, why should anything you say be given any credibility at all?<br />
<br />
For the record, I have a warrior that I rarely play.  I also have a monk that I no longer play at all - he's my first character going back to the day EQ went live.  Neither class offers enough any more, especially without insanely good gear, to be of significant value.  <br />
<br />
Several people in this post have already addressed the fundamental issue - EQ is no longer friendly to melee-only classes.  They simply don't bring enough to the table to be preferrable in more than a handful of situations that most players will never experience.  I don't think there's anything that can be done about it without serious side-effects that will upset even more people.  Since most people I know have already moved on from melee-only classes, SOE would be foolish to wreck the game now in favor on three of the least-played classes in the game.<br />
<br />
Shadrak<br />
59 (woot, finally) Shaman<br />
Ayonae Ro<br />
<br />
p.s. I have to agree with the poster right above me (sorry, didn't catch your name).  If I slow on inc with a warrior, I get agro.  Every time.  If I slow as soon as the warrior engages, I get agro 95% of the time (a lucky proc being the only exception).  My tank usually wields a GSoT, which procs a stun that's very good agro - when it procs.  It just doesn't proc nearly often enough to be reliable - I absolutely have to wait for at least 2 taunts before throwing slow on a typical LDoN or PoP mob, or I'll get agro.  Since I two-box, I know exactly when that second taunt goes off, and cast slow immediately thereafter.  With my SK, I can slow right away - no problems.  Do I think SKs or Paladins should be nerfed?  No.  I never think any class should be nerfed.  There aren't enough full-time warriors left to bother at this point.  It's like fixing monks.  They're so broken that most monks I know have retired in favor of a caster/hybrid.  That's just the way it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I think the shaman class itself has enough issues to not bother with warriors and the way they THINK they need to be improved.<br />
<br />
YES think as what they demand is nothing more then a monopoly on raid tanking.<br />
<br />
Having knights being able to tank is not only logical, it is also very good.<br />
Just as it should be possible to use druids and shamans on raids as healers.<br />
Just as it should be possible to use Mages as nukers on raids.<br />
<br />

You obviously have an agenda posting these arguments.  You play a palladin and don't want any other class to infringe on the good times you have going now.<br />
<br />
You argue that giving warriors snap agro would trivialize the game (when it is already there for you).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">On trash mobs the rogue may outdamage everyone. On boss mobs Necros, Mages, and Wizards are all likely to outdamage a rogue. I'd say that '4 to 5' classes is an exaggeration, but rogues are certaintly not the DPS kings.<br />
<br />
From the time you first kill Emperor till Fennin Ro is your farm bitch rangers outdamage rogues. The droppable elemental bows are a huge problem, and there is just nothing the non-hardcore raiding rogue can do. With high spawn contention and bad luck there is nothing even the hardcore raiding rogue can do. (I wish rogues could buy Ifir+GRMK for 75k. Which is about what the stonewood compound bow equals.) The ranger Time bow has 1 more damage and 1 less delay than the stonewood compound bow. It also has 20 more raw atk, but atleast in theory it's possible to max out atk even before the EPs.<br />
<br />
And even after that rogue and ranger are a nose length from each other for dps. The rogue has to be dual wielding, has to be in contact with the mob. In almost all exp situations, and most raid situations the ranger can put out similar dps from a distance. (This is mostly a raid concern, pretty few exp targets have significant damage shields, and none that I can think of have ae rampage.) Once the rogue has his time piercer he's in a clear lead.<br />
<br />
The wizard is way ahead from when you start farming VT until you start farming MM/Fennin. The necro is also real high for the same time. Mage is situational, and is also highly dependent on if you have a pet hater as raid leader or not. The wizard definitely stays ahead on his ability to do dps to a raid target. And if he puts out slightly less dps than a rogue in a top end exp group does it matter? The thirty minutes the rogue spent lfg, even inside the guild, let the wizard get (close to) an aa.<br />
<br />
If shamans could lower their aggro they could outdamage rogues too during the VT-&gt;farming EP period. Someone who actually raids with their shammy might clue us in on if they can stay over 180dps on a raid target in this interval that isn't already trivialized by their guild? (Or over 200dps if we assume the rogue got his full share of 250 raw atk from ornate+VT and earlier items.)</div></div><hr />

I think it's more due to enthusiastic ignorance than anything else.  It feels good to dismiss a whole class in EQ as &quot;whiners&quot; but it's also an inherently stupid thing to do.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, the clerics have done extensive testing on mitigation and concluded there is no difference in mitigation based on class.  Giac, go to their boards to get that part of your many illogical positions refuted.  <br />
<br />
Warriors are getting pounded in exp groups because Knight aggro permits everyone to let their business fly while the warrior brings worse aggro and ZERO utility to the table - and recently that was in part justified by their perceived roles on raids.  Now the proof is in the pudding that their perceived roles in raids isn't so critical.  So, they get whittled down more and more.  Jharrassik and Devnull have it right it seems to me.  <br />

<br />
Warriors are not nearly as broken as they are made out to be.<br />
<br />
Tanking Ability - Knight vs Warrior<br />
<br />
There is a 300 hp difference between the best geared paladins and the alpha warriors out there.  AC is comparable.  Mitigation posts are comparable.<br />
<br />
This should equate to identical tanking abilities on raids right?<br />
<br />
WRONG.<br />
<br />
Warriors have defensive and evasive.  You *cannot* discount these discs in their ability to tank if you're talking about the overall package.  It's added mitigation that knights don't have.<br />
<br />
But wait, who needs defensive if knights and monks can tank Quarm?<br />
<br />
The funny part is that you're yelling about how warriors mitigate damage better.. but for a warrior and a knight to recieve the same healing from a CH chain with a given interval, they will have had to have taken the same amount of damage during that interval. So, do hybrids just have superior avoidance? <br />
<br />
Just because another class *can* tank a mob like Quarm doesn't make it optimal to use them.  Single-round deaths aside, a level 30 wizard could tank Quarm with a tight enough rotation on him (once he got past the whole can't-zone-into-time thing).<br />
<br />
Using a warrior allows you the flexibility to do more with less.  Because of the extra mitigation that a disc provides, you require less healing to counterbalance the incoming damage.  Less healing required = less healers required.<br />
<br />
Their tanking abilities don't even compare.  Some guilds tank Time Vallon Zek using multiple knights, but I'm going to venture that some raidleaders don't know what the hell they are doing in the first place and just do what everyone else does.  What works for the first guild to tackle an encounter may not be ideal for the 50 guilds that then copy their initial strat.  We single tank time VZ with a warrior and we do it flawlessly.  The only time we even consider using a knight is when Fear is involved.  Hey guess what it takes less clerics too.<br />
<br />
*** does defensive bring to the table when Clerics can cast it on any damned class that is standing in front of them.<br />
<br />
The &quot;every other class has defensive because of Vie&quot; argument doesn't hold any water either since they stack.  Vie on a knight = less resources required.  Vie AND defensive on a warrior = even less.<br />
<br />
Now in LDON this has changed somewhat because of deathcounts.  But that isn't an issue with warriors per se, I see it as more an issue with LDON raid design.<br />
<br />
Aggro Generation<br />
<br />
It's a tradeoff.  Warriors are superior tanks, knights are superior at aggro.  Why should warriors get an up to their aggro generation abilities?  A couple points to consider:<br />
<br />
Warriors just did receive a significant increase to their aggro in the form of anger augs.  Yes, it's a proc in the form of an item.  My ability to malos mobs also comes from an item drop.  A wizard's ability to nuke comes from an item drop.  Why exactly should aggro generation be innate?  It should also be noted that anger 3 augs are by no means limited to time-level warriors.  A level 50 warrior could get an anger 3 aug alot easier than a level 50 shaman could get malos without buying it.<br />
<br />
Warriors also have an ability to instantly aggro mobs.  It's called AE taunt.<br />
<br />
There are also additional items that can be used, live and in game.  Warriors in my guild farm snare glands using an earthshaker, they kill 4 keg quests solo instantly, and get 7 glands at a time.  It takes them however long it takes the mobs to build up.<br />
<br />
But what am I saying, I mean this takes effort.  You have to run all the way to FG, *then* you have to buy 4 kegs, *then* you have to disc fortitude and hit the ae rampage button.  <br />

Over time, warriors can build significant aggro through procs.  Mobs can and do lock.  But warriors want additional aggro abilities on top of the tools that are out there already.  Currently aggro management is a balance between non-tanks comparing their potential aggro on mobs with the mt's &quot;supposed&quot; aggro and acting accordingly.  Its challenging walking the tightrope of maximum dps without overaggroing.<br />
<br />
You give them Defensive and Snap Aggro and you remove the challenge from the game. <br />
<br />
I couldn't have said it better.<br />
<br />
How boring would boss mob encounters be if there was no possibility to overaggro?  Our main warriors use anger auged bows, vanizirs, dbotw and they generate HUGE amounts of aggro over time.  But warriors need more aggro?<br />
<br />
XP Groups<br />
<br />
I always use warriors in my LDON groups when they're available.  We don't pull though, we charge rooms and the warrior ae taunts.<br />
<br />
No the warrior can't instantly peel mobs off.  But on the other hand, he's also not doing Knight DPS.<br />
<br />
Warrior DPS is far far far far far far far far far far far far better than knight DPS.<br />
<br />
The reasoning that you have 4 other slots in the group for DPS doesn't make sense either.  Just because you can put in 4 DPS classes into an xp group (1 tank 1 healer) doesn't mean the tank shouldn't be contributing in that department also.<br />
<br />
Knights provide greater versatility in xp groups, there is no question.  A paladin can contribute to healing.  A shadowknight can snare.  Etc.  But to say that warriors should never be picked over knights in xp groups is ludicruous.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok so.  Should knight instant aggro be nerfed?  Maybe.  But I'd suggest that you don't compensate for one class having a certain ability by immediately giving the same type of ability to another class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">my warrior opinion <br />
<br />
honestly  i dont see alot wrong with  the warrior.  maybe there taunt should accualy add some hate  insted of just moveing em up the hate list. the  add of hate with taunt would help keep em there.  it shouldnt be too big  they still need to  have to work for it.   with that  allow them a singe target taunt that has a much larger boost to hate then a normal taunt  set it with a dely of  10 minutes or so, or have it leave a buff on the mob that wont stack so they could only use it once per mob  call it battel cry or something  its use for inital argo  that would put them along with a hate added to there taunt  on the same lvl as a knight  for houlding argo..<br />
<br />
truly  the problem  lies in the argo ability of other classes  have gotten better wile the warrior's ability  is still where it was 2  years ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
i like it the way it is now. i admit im spoiled  i fight behind some great tanks. but there is no other class i would rather stand behind on a big kill.  they have the staying  power to take the hits and  as long as  i allow em  a few swings  i will never get hit. we call the knights in when we face  a kill that tosses  argo reducers  a knight will  be more mana intensive on the healers but at least they will be alive to heal.  in the  end  a tank is only as good as the peeps he  kills with. its not his job to keep argo its our job not to get it. he is just there to take the beating.<br />
<br />
i feel for the derv crowd they have there work cut out for em. hope the dont screw it up to bad  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I absolutely have to wait for at least 2 taunts before throwing slow on a typical LDoN or PoP mob, or I'll get agro. Since I two-box, I know exactly when that second taunt goes off, and cast slow immediately thereafter. <br />
<br />
Taunt doesnt increase hate the more times that you push it.  It puts you ONE point ahead of the next person on top of the aggro list IF it works regardless of whatever anyone else does to the mob.  Unfortunately warrior taunt only works 25% of the time.  Now you may actually be hurting yourself here by pushing taunt again.  If taunt succeeds the first time and you builld aggro and press taunt again...BAM right back down the list to next highest aggroed person.  Here is a great article regarding taunt for those that dont know how it works and need to understand the warriors gripe.  Please read it...I now understand and thouroughly believe that they absolutely need some help here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Wow Kylt , that is a great job of sounding knowledgable, and still being wrong.<br />
<br />
Warriors have defensive and evasive. You *cannot* discount these discs in their ability to tank if you're talking about the overall package. It's added mitigation that knights don't have. <br />
<br />
Many warriors actually hope that SoE does away with /disc defensive, as that 3 minutes while the disc is an excuse to keep warriors from having any upgrade to agro.  I disagree some, as most ideas to upgrade  taunt suggest upping taunt rate only for blue and even con mobs(and therefore would not affect current high end raid targets), or to make special abilities, and flag raid mobs immune to those abilities.  While you are right that you cannot discount defensive/evasive, they are not a reason to not give warriors better agro...there are ways around that problem.<br />
<br />
It's a tradeoff. Warriors are superior tanks, knights are superior at aggro. Why should warriors get an up to their aggro generation abilities? <br />
<br />
Warriors are margenally better at taking damage, but knights arevastly  better at generating agro, at range and at will.  This gives knights a clear advantage.  Upping warrior agro to slightly below knight levels, or reducing knight agro to slightly above warrior levels would go a long way to balancing the two classes.<br />
<br />
Warriors just did receive a significant increase to their aggro in the form of anger augs <br />
<br />
So, after 1150 points in LDoN, a warrior will still have random agro generation, and any palladin will still be able to outagro them(at will) with 3 vender bought level 9 and 15 spells that they can cast pretty much as soon as the spell gem pops without ever going 00m.  This is not a solution to warrior balance issues.<br />
<br />
A level 50 warrior could get an anger 3 aug alot easier than a level 50 shaman could get malos <br />
<br />
1150 adventure points in EF vs walking into the bazaar after farming some cash is alot easier?  Especially if we consider how many points a level 50 gets per adventure, this statement is simply laughable.<br />
<br />
Warriors also have an ability to instantly aggro mobs. It's called AE taunt. <br />
<br />
AE taunt gives a warrior sure agro for about .00000000000000001 seconds.  As soon as someone does something more to the mob, they can pull agro away.<br />
<br />
Warriors in my guild farm snare glands using an earthshaker, they kill 4 keg quests solo instantly, and get 7 glands at a time. It takes them however long it takes the mobs to build up <br />
<br />
So, a warrior needs to a) have a weapon that no longer drops, b) spend aa points in a generally worthless aa, and c) spend a bunch of time doing a boring farm...just to have an expendable one shot item that will help them build hate .  Woohoo, lucky warriors.<br />
<br />
But warriors want additional aggro abilities on top of the tools that are out there already. Currently aggro management is a balance between non-tanks comparing their potential aggro on mobs with the mt's &quot;supposed&quot; aggro and acting accordingly. Its challenging walking the tightrope of maximum dps without overaggroing. <br />
<br />
But a group can grab a knight and not have to walk that tightrope(as much, if a caster really wants to, they can pull agro off anyone).  So a group has a choice...challenging slow exp with a warrior, or fast easy exp with a knight.  Who do you think they choose?<br />
<br />
I always use warriors in my LDON groups when they're available. We don't pull though, we charge rooms and the warrior ae taunts. <br />
<br />
AE taunt, with the highest level of Hastened Instigation aa(lowers ae taunt reuse time by 10 % per rank, 3 ranks) allows use of AE taunt once every ~10 minutes.  Are you saying that you onle do one room every 10 minutes?<br />
<br />
Warrior DPS is far far far far far far far far far far far far better than knight DPS. <br />
<br />
A warrior with the same weapon as a knight will do 20 % more melee damage.  This is not 'far far far far far far far far far far far far better', this is slightly better.  Note that most warriors have to dual weild(for agro), while most knights use 2 handers, and 2 hander damage is greater than dual weild damage, thereby allowing the knight to do equal to or more damage than a warrior.  Also note that SU3 adds about 20 % to paladin melee DPS against undead(and Mir, MM and Guk adventures all have significant undead populations), bringing them to about warrior levels of damage against undead.  Sorry, but your statement is above is simply false.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">You guys are mixing raiding up with xp grouping etc..<br />
<br />
Defensive is not an advantage in your typical xp group.  Saying knights have snap agro and warriors have defensive so it's balanced. means that it is not balanced for xp groups (and this is were warriors seem to be getting the shaft.  The average xp group wants a knight).<br />
<br />
<br />
As for raiding, lately it's been proven that warriors may or may not be needed to tank boss mobs.  They certainly aren't required for old content, and may not be required for new content (depending on if you say Quarm is old or new content).  So at best you can say warriors are needed for cutting edge content until you've killed it a few times and can go with another tank type.<br />
<br />
So given that knights and wars have almost the same HP/AC (maybe what 10 percent).<br />
<br />
I ask, where is that warrior advantage again?  Why did they give up that spell book and utility to be the best at..... tanking the current boss mob for a bit before others can do it?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but you guy who are saying warriors aren't broken?  Have you been in some kind of no-POP bubble?  With a knight I can malos on incoming and drop slow as soon as mob is in camp, and never get agro.  You just can't do that with warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Holy It should also be noted that anger 3 augs are by no means limited to time-level warriors.

He'd have to have an incredible number of unrezzed deaths to buy a single anger 3 aug without having leveled way past 50.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you realize that low level people use those spells? Do you realize that &quot;fixing&quot; agro on certain spells, such as DoTs and stuns, would completely change caster agro from lvl 1 through 65?<br />
<br />
&quot;Fixing&quot; taunt, depending on what your idea of &quot;fixing&quot; is, can be anywhere from completely ineffective as far as balancing warriors to completely trivializing encounters, ie, create a bigger problem than it solves.<br />
<br />
If balancing melees was that easy, it'd have been done already.<br />
<br />
They can limit spells like cease &amp; desist to only stick on mobs under lvl55, but over 55 the aggro still sticks. It might be a seperate part of the code I suppose, but I can't see it being that difficult to change. There would be an overlap in tier 1, but mostly the balance problem is with 55+ PoP mobs, due to how hard they hit.</div></div><hr />

I choose warrior shrug :P  I really don't give a **** about my personal aggro in an xp group.  Oh my god I have to tank a mob until taunt pulls it off.  The same AC and HP blurring that is &quot;contributing to the knight/warrior problem&quot; is also increasing hps and ac for alot of classes.<br />
<br />
They can limit spells like cease &amp; desist to only stick on mobs 55 the aggro still sticks. It might be a seperate part of the code I suppose, but I can't see it being that difficult to change. There would be an overlap in tier 1, but mostly the balance problem is with &gt;55 PoP mobs, due to how hard they hit. (woden)<br />
<br />
Ok I agree with this.<br />
<br />
Here's the main problem with knight aggro atm in a raid environment I'll use an example:<br />
<br />
Let's assume you have boss mob X that puts out 7,500 DPS vs a set AC (and other item/skill mitigators).  This mob doesn't proc, doesn't AE, isn't slowable, is fully debuffed, etc etc etc - it does 7500 DPS.  To counter that damage you would require 1 cheal a second.  Cheal is a 10 second refresh so you require, at minimum, 10 clerics.<br />
<br />
Now let's assume for the example that disc defensive is 30 percent mitigation vs this particular mob.  With disc the mob is now putting out 5250 DPS.  Now you've cut down the healing required to counterbalance it - you now need 7 clerics on a 1.43 second rotation.<br />
<br />
So a warrior tanking this mob needs 7 clerics, a knight tanking this mob needs 10.  The *non-dps* resources you require to maintain the tank is lowered by defensive.<br />
<br />
But.<br />
<br />
Aggro management with a warrior tanking is a tightrope.  The other 30-50 people on your raid can't go 100% DPS or they will steal aggro and die.  So maybe they do only 60-80% of their &quot;DPS potential&quot;.<br />
<br />
But with a knight tanking, aggro management is less of an issue.  Maybe your 30-50 people actually killing the mob can now do 80-90% of their DPS potential.  The mob dies faster and you actually *save* resources in the end because when people can individually put out higher DPS and not die, you need less people to put out the same DPS.<br />
<br />
The analogy isn't perfect.  To start with, the knight has a greater chance of getting one-rounded without defensive.  Secondly, it's highly dependent on the roster of your individual guild which route you go with.  If your guild can't field the clerics required to maintain a knight tank then obviously it's not an option.<br />
<br />
The solution?  Nerf Knights.  Make their stun aggro not apply to high level mobs.  End of story.  Aggro management should be part of the challenge of encounters, but that's my personal opinion.  The solution isn't to give warriors more aggro abilities, that would allow people to do more DPS on raids without fear of overaggro and trivialize the encounters.  No wait, SOE would just increase HPs on boss mobs to compensate for higher DPS levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>DakkaMalawicob</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">Hmm.  From most of the post's it seems more of an issue that paladin's can out aggro a warrior, yes?  And?  <br />
<br />
I have a 60 warrior and a 58 paladin.  Ok you like 5 guys who want to argue bout Time mobs, lets come back to reality a second. 95% of us dont fight there, least not yet.  <br />
<br />
Yes its an absolute, undeniable fact that my 58 pal can aggro from the war anywhere, anytime.  But merely to out-aggro the warrior serves ~~~{ ZERO }~~~ purpose.  The wizzie gets aggro from an ill timed nuke, a CH gets the attn of a mob to a clr, the 489 hits per millisecond a monk makes becomes too much of a distraction for the mob to ignore anymore...whatever, My pally will get the aggro back after a disarm, taunt, bash, beg aggro hot key, and stuns of course (and a helpful FD form the monk =), point is, in less than 3 secs, often much less.  I can get hit well. But my job is thus done, The warrior is doing all he can and does get aggro back....continue.<br />
<br />
My point is WHY does the warrior have to be the BEST aggro?  Its been argued again and again, given the same basic gear, same lvl, same everything, the warrior is the choice TANK.  So let the paladin provide the emergency, yes folks, emergency snap-aggro.  Keep the warrior's tanking.  Its their jobs.  Pally's job is to do what needs to be done.<br />
<br />
Why all the mathematical equations? the debates?  If your a good warrior (it may seem easy but people sure do f**k it up) then there you have it.<br />

As much as I hate to say this, I am beginning to lean this way myself. Maybe its not Warriors that are broken, its Knights. The fact that I can malos, slow, DOT, DOT a mob WHILE ITS INC and still not get hit because the Paladin used his lvl 9 spells just isnt right. <br />
<br />
It SHOULD be the groups responsibility to manage aggro, not one single member of the group. I am spoiled though, I like my Knight tanks. I get to use my spells then. I can DOT, and melee, and Nuke, and Cripple, and all the things my class is supposed to to. But with a Warrior, I get to pick 2 of those, and I am still gonna take at least one hit.</div></div><hr />

The issue is not laziness.  Why should one class have to go tosuch extreme measures to obtain expendeable, one shot items just to do their basic job?  No other class has to do something like this, why should warriors have to, and how can you suggest that this somehow makes things all right?<br />
<br />
I choose warrior shrug :P I really don't give a **** about my personal aggro in an xp group. Oh my god I have to tank a mob until taunt pulls it off <br />
<br />
This would make you an exceptio, tho I admit when I play my shaman, I have basically the same attitude.  When I play my mage tho, especially in LDoN, I haveto admit that a knight makes me far more able to do things, and therefore are preferable.  I can actually nuke more than once a mob and I can sit down to med during a fight, helping my mana regen so I can nuke more.<br />
<br />
I know enough(as a warrior is my main, it certainly helps me understand some of this) to stand next to the tank whenever I do something high agro, and to pay attention to my agro and work with each tanks limitations.  This is extra work tho, and does lead to many people finding knights simply preferable to warriors, in far greater numbers than the other way around.<br />
<br />
Aggro management should be part of the challenge of encounters, but that's my personal opinion. The solution isn't to give warriors more aggro abilities, that would allow people to do more DPS on raids without fear of overaggro and trivialize the encounters. No wait, SOE would just increase HPs on boss mobs to compensate for higher DPS levels. <br />
<br />
I do agree with this to an extent.  The old idea was that, since warriors where the class that could most take a beating, they had the lowest agro generation...any class could outagro a warrior.  This was fine and worked well.  Then, when PoP came out, snap agro became important due to neading to slow mobs early.  Combined with itemization that lowered the hp/AC difference between warriors and knights, they moved into a spot of being preferred exp tanks.  Now 2 of the 3 classes that can best take a beating can generate agro almost at will...this seems wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">How about this idea?  Since hybrids think that warriors with snap agro will make hybrids useless, don't change agro at all--- change people's reasons for *wanting* the warrior to have agro.<br />
<br />
Give the warrior an excessive amount of riposte and parrying skills to the point where the warrior is a higher dps, lower damage taking character *only if* the mob is attacking him.<br />
<br />
Maybe make some warrior only furious bash shields that have a very very large innate damage shield built in (i.e., around 50).<br />
<br />
People will *want* to let the warrior gain agro for the higher dps, won't mind as much that they're delaying their own dps since the warrior is generating more, and the warrior will take less damage and deal more damage while he's generating agro so it'll be okay to wait to slow a little bit.<br />
<br />
This will make a warrior a complement dps class to the rogue and will at least slightly deal with the problems without trivializing the whole gaining agro issue for warriors in raid encounters.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, would it be fair for Knights to have to farm stuff with items that no longer drop to be an acceptable tank?  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
AE taunt isnt an exp tool either. Exp groups is where the warriors need the MOST help. I realize some paladin in a guild thats been farming time for X length tanked quarm; that shouldnt be the major focus of the discussion. Odds are, they had warriors tank encounters along the way to gear the knight up. Not everyone is end game, and not everyone in a raiding guild... and even if they are, theres only one MA at a time. Focusing on this aspect is like putting a bandaid on a scratch while the patient has a severed arm.
