<br />
I am currently 62 and I want to all solo spots that you guys have been to that gives more than 5% AAXP a kill.<br />
<br />
I know Razorfiends in PoV gives 8%. Takes about 10 - 15 min. for me to kill with a mana pool of approx. 3500 (magelo info).<br />
<br />
Also I know High Guardians in PoJ gives 6%. Takes approx. 6 - 7 min. to kill for me.<br />
<br />
Haven't tried anything in PoD yet or PoI. Anyone know any GOOD solo spots. Please share. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know about 5% per kill, but I get 1.5% per kill in PoN just doing GY trash, and kills only take around 2 minutes with 30 seconds or so cann/torpor afterwards.  So in the 10-15 min you spend killing one Razorfiend for 8% I've probably killed 4-6 gnarled treants for 6-9% AA, and probably at less risk.<br />
<br />
I like to go just north of the graveyard, past the tree that looks like a treant and directly across from the mob that triggers the Daffiyd event.  There are two trees to the left, one tree diagonally left, and a random spawn tree-bird-bat to the right just out of sight.<br />
<br />
I want to go to the other side of the trench and try hobs/banshees but I'm worried that their summon will give me trouble if they resist slow.  Anybody have tips for handling summoning mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Getting 1-2% per kill doing prisoners in plane of Justice.  Pretty cool camp and not all that hard, alot of casters and watch where you position yourself (usually in the back corner of the room) in case of adds from the hall.<br />
<br />
Can easily take two at the same time NP down there.</div></div><hr />

Root, and they'll most often turn to dogdog, as his idea of max melee is to crawl right up their chest.<br />
<br />
Trees, bears, snakes and plants in PoS forest are all a fairly good challenge (and 4% aa each) for 62 shaman and 61 mage with no outside buffs - with some virtue and c3, might be a doable solo spot.<br />
<br />
Could probably get similar or better exp from trash in tier 1, however these drop parchments, which the mage still needs.  ;)</div></div><hr />
