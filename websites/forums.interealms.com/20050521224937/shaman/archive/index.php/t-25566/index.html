<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There was a thread i saw here someplace about harbingers spires named and soloing them. Unfortunately I can't find it now, but did find Grobbles post on locs of all the named....<br />
<br />
Could someone point me to the soloing post please? Also is my gear good enough to solo them? (i have the new dots and wunshi, but still missing most 69/70 spells) and only just dinged 70<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The named dragorn on the first floor should provide you little problem.  In particular the Revolter, Inventor, Guardsman, Toiler, Loyal Servant, Trainer, Overseer, Retind and Peon.  A lot will be light blue to you down there so XP won't fly.<br />
<br />
At all costs avoid the discordling named.  These guys cast Chaotica which is a nasty DoT to have to worry about.  Drops HP and Mana every tick.  Requires 3 casts of RC or 1 cast of RGC to remove.  At 67 my duo team would sometimes have problems with Karg the Fiend if we pulled him unprepared.<br />
<br />
The Girplan named may also be too tough for you.  They hit for around 600 and some cast DDs with a stun component.<br />
<br />
Since all named summon you will need to contend with that.  Strats used for NC named would probably also work well here; Basically:  root, debuff, Quie self, lay in the dots, back up when summoned, use dog summoning aa when you need to redot.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

This DOT also cancels out KEI, VoQ, Clairvoy or whatever mana-regen buff you have up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only way I've beaten the Discordling rares (Karg, Varin, sneak, stalker) is to pull with slow, root, then cast SC to keep them busy while I land as many dots as I can before they start summoning (Yoppa, Bane Saryrn, Wunshi). One of the keys is not to get close to them if you can help it, as they have a secondary proc (spin-stun...forget what it was called) if you stay within melee range for long. With good timing and a little luck as you re-apply dots, they will run out life just before the dot drains all of your mana. Not optimal by any means I know, but it works. Varin is the easiest of them I think, becasue you can pull him into one of the hallways to the rooms on his level in the spire (works even better if you've cleared the room too) and have lots of room to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grobbles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hat tip , SC and disease dots first .. and as a last resort keep a pet in the bag (susp minion ) use him as and when needed. Yes Varin is the easiest .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ashkani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">great help guys, thanks very much indeed...Looking forward to farming the augments and maybe the rare drop belt or quest belt ;p<br />
<br />
one last thing though - any pulling tips? Which pet do you use, and will it need virtue etc?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've got the quest belt.  Did on 2 toons.  Was about 20 hours each of camping the girplans (40 total).  Went from 68 - 70+ doing that camp.  Solo you can expect spending significant time finishing that quest.  Good luck, though, the belt is nice.<br />
<br />
Use your highest level green pet to pull.  Howling Spirit sound right?  Buff it up with sow outside, and any HP buffs you have.  Target mob you want to pull, quie your pet, use retarget key to target mob again, then send pet in.  When you see any damage or attack message spam back off (or hold if you have that AA).  Mob should come single.<br />
<br />
Only issue I've seen is with casters.  You do not want to call your pet back when a caster has started a spell. If your pet gets back to you and the spell hits it you also get aggro and may get more mobs than you wanted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">just set your pet to guard about 1/3 the way to the mobs. that way when you back him off the mob will be out of assist range and your pet will be far enough away to not get you agro on caster mobs.</div></div><hr />
