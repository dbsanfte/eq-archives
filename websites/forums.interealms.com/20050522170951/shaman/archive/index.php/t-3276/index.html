I have about 10k in the bank but am saving for some JBBs so I'd rather not spend it all, any suggestions would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Replace:<br />
<br />
Ears - electrum black sapphire<br />

belt - spider belt<br />
shield - SBS is selling for only 3K right now, or go to Chardok and camp one, they aren't terribly rare<br />
boots - sell these, get JB <br />

Just a few comments... <br />
<br />
For Armor... join a few PoG (Plane of Growth) raids, if you can... the armor you are looking for is Spirit Weavers Armor, and is almost Identical to Thurgadin Rune Crafters Armor...<br />
<br />
As for other upgrades... <br />
<br />
With 10k in bank you are well off, and could get the following:<br />
<br />
Crystal Chitin Shield (ac 20 wis 9 mana 40)<br />
(drops of Crystal Fang, uncommon, in Frenzy Camp in VL)<br />
<br />
Sarnak Battleshield (ac 25 str 5 sta 5 agi 5 hp 40 sv f c m +10)<br />
(drops of Sarnak Myrmidon in Chardok, also uncommon)<br />
<br />
Oakleaf Girdle (ac 4 hp 40 mana 40)<br />
(rare drop of Dracolich on Plane of Fear)<br />
<br />
Flayed Turmoil Skin Belt (ac 9 wis 6)<br />
(drops quite commonly on Plane of Fear)<br />
<br />
Coldain Skin Boots (ac 3 wis 8 int 8 mana 35)<br />
<br />
Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings (ac 2 hp 35 mana 25)<br />
<br />
or do the quest of Earring of the Solstice...<br />
<br />
Shadel Bandit ring (ac 5 hp 55 mana 55 sv d +10)<br />
<br />
Coldain Skin Gloves or Crystal Chitin Gloves...<br />
<br />
I really don't suggest you spend pp on a Jaundiced Bone Bracer (I'm saying that even though I have one myself, but I didn't want to waste pp on it and I got mine in seb... had to fight over it though, but got it hehe), I know alot are going to disagree, but IMHO with the gear you are currently having, your pp are spent much better getting overall upgrades than just one bracer... besides you can try to get into a 4d/emp group in Sebilis and with time and luck you'll get it from there (mob you are looking for is Arch Duke Iatol, and its his rare drop though)<br />
<br />
I am very well aware of the fact that many shamans say go WIS go WIS!!! I strongly disagree... check my profile and you'll see what my gear is... I'm still very GHETTO when it comes to gear hehe, but I'm slowly improving :) hehe<br />
<br />
But all in all, get the things you are comfortable with, if you want to shoot all pp on JBB, by all means go for it, but IMHO considering your current gear... I say you are better off with getting your gear upgraded than just getting that bracer...<br />
<br />
But its up to you :)<br />
<br />
Best wishes and GL!<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oakleaf Girdle (ac 4 hp 40 mana 40) <br />
(rare drop of Dracolich on Plane of Fear)<br />
<br />
Oakleaf girdle drops in POG and is droppable, I think you're thinking of the Grotesque Girdle which has much better stats and is no drop off Dracoliche.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the suggestions, Gloriana and Velarius.  Looking at these suggestions it looks like I'm going to drop about 40-50 wisdom though.  That'll put me at about 130-140 wisdom, will I survive with only that much wisdom?  It seems like sow is going to cost me about 20 percent of my mana again :)  But I like the suggestions and I'm looking into getting most of them.  Does anyone else have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, you don't have to make all the changes all at once.  When I was in my 50s, I set 170 or so as my wisdom limit and then constantly worked to maintain that equilibrium.  <br />
<br />
There are tons of great gear that are available to you with high AC and high wisdom which were not available to those of us that leveled up a couple of years ago.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Death Mask of the Elysians - awesome AC/wis item, drops in ME.<br />
Divine Inspiration - great high AC/high wis range item, drops in ME.<br />
Ethereal earring - 10 AC, wis, drops in ME<br />
<br />
Plus, some of the choices that we listed add wisdom, like the coldain skin gloves.  You could also do the quest for the Shield of Bane Warding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wish the death mask of the elysians dropped in ME.  It's from umbral.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Doh, sorry...I honestly get those two zones confused sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you gonna raid do the Velious armor quests.  Great gear all around.<br />
<br />
UP isn't so bad.<br />
<br />
We can usually do it with one group in one of the safe areas. Course if druid pulls more than 2 we dead but man it's a rush.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, after 2 hours in KC today I decided I really need a horse as well so I can med without sitting down.  I get tired of getting agro every time I slow and try to med.  I figure I lose out on a lot of mana because while the mobs are beating on me I'm not medding and I also have less hps to canni afterwards.  My only thought is that will leave me with only about 2k.  But as you guys suggested I should sell my gebs and wear my jaundiced bone boots which I already have.  So that would get me back to 5-6k.  Would you guys recommend getting a horse at this point or just spend my 10k on upgrades?  I'd really like a horse but if you guys think its a bad idea I'll wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Miyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think a horse is a good idea.  In fact if you group more then you solo, then I think a horse would be more bennificial then the JBB.  However, you really need to do some gear upgrades so my suggestion would be to spend at least some of your pp on some upgrades and then just keep saving for the horse.  If you get desperate you could always go into &quot;making plat mode&quot;.  If I need a quick couple hundred plat, I'll usually go farm the Geos in CC for a couple hours late at night. (I do it late so nobody is there, hate the idea of farming a spot that someone could be getting xp at)  So here's my upgrade advice:<br />
<br />
Earring:  Imbued Golden Ivory Earring (cheap)<br />
<br />
Neck:  Ivory Collar (around 900 on my server)<br />
<br />
Face: any suggested or get an Arctic Wyvern mask.  People do these to skill up so they often sell them for around 200pp on my server.  If you sell your old mask, you'll be upgrading and making a profit at the same time.<br />
<br />
Head: Good :)<br />
<br />
Fingers:  Definetly sell those and get yourself some 6/65.  130 HP's to cann down into mana along with 12 more ac would be huge for you right now imo.  If you sell your old rings, and use the pp from them then getting a pair of these should be pretty cheap.<br />
<br />
Wrist:  I'd probably just use two Jarsath's for now.  Then a JBB when money permits.<br />
<br />
Arms:  Good :)<br />
<br />
Gloves: Coldain, or Crystal Chitin.  I'd do the other upgrades first though as this one is really pretty good for now.<br />
<br />
Shoulders:  Good :)<br />
<br />
Chest:  Tough one to upgrade.  Can try doing a raid to get a no drop, or maybe buy Iksar Regen.  The iksar bp is pretty spendy, and that's why I say it's a tough upgrade.  I'd probably upgrade all my other spots first and then if you have enough left over, then get the iksar regen.<br />
<br />
Back:  Acrylia Studded Cloak I think costs about the same as what you have and is  7AC 3STR 3DEX 10WIS.  Might be able to sell your cloak and get this one or you could look up the ingredients and farm them for a friendly tailorer.  I got mine by farming enough for 5 attempts and then just asking if I could get one of the cloaks if they were successful with.  They thought it was a VERY good deal, so not only did I get my cloak, but made a new friend that now is willing to help me with their tailoring skill anytime I need something made.<br />
<br />
Waist:  Pretty much what everyone else said.  Flayed Turmoilskin is about 900pp on my server but not sure on the prices of the others.<br />
<br />
Feet:  Wear your JB Boots<br />
<br />
Secondary Melee:  Dump the Charred and get yourself a Sarnak Battle Shield.  They are running about 1.5k on my server now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well that should pretty much set you up for a while untill you can start getting the quested Velious Armors and other drops.  Definetly check out ME for some nice shaman drops.  If you have any left put it in the bank for your horse fund.  Oh and who knows, if you sit in the tunnel trying to get all these items you may just find that you can actually make some plat while upgrading yourself.  I learned how to do that when I needed to get a bunch of upgrades all at once.  Sat in the tunnel for about 2 days and learned all the prices.  By the time I got all my items I was shopping for I was able to play the buy low sell high game well enough that I had made enough to almost cover all the cost of my upgrades I had been sitting there for in the first place.<br />
<br />
I don't think your wis will suffer too much with the upgrades I suggested and your hp's and ac should go up nicely.  Your wis should still be hovering around 150 or 160.  Not a problem for us though because we can regen and cann :)  Honestly I never really worry about my wisdom that much.  I try to get tons of AC and HP gear.  As you start getting the nodrop stuff you'll find that your wisdom will slowly start to raise and your ac and hp's will be going up nicely too.  Just remember, a FM Dead Shaman is definetly not better then a OOM Shaman that still has health to cann down. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you're level 54 already, the heyday for the JBB is over. It really only helps significantly from lvl 45 - 55, so I wouldn't bother saving up for one at this point unless you're happy with your current equipment setup, which you aren't. <br />
<br />
As for dropping items with WIS on them, remember that HP / AC &gt; WIS. I've been level 60 for months now and just this month hit 200 WIS unbuffed. <br />
<br />
Suggestions from me that are pretty cheap and affordable, just off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
Velium Fire Wedding Rings (ac 6 +65 HP rings) 1k per pair<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield (ac 25 + some stats) 2-3k <br />
Ivory Imbued Collar (ac 8 + stats) 500-1k<br />
Forest Loops (can't remember but decent) 100-300pp<br />
Tattered Mantle (ac 12 +20 hp and some resists) 200pp<br />
Enshrouded Veil (ac 7 + 30 hp +30 mana +stats) 1k<br />
or Mushroom Veil (ac 8 12 dex 55 mana +10 poison) 1k<br />
<br />
I wouldn't bother with Plane of Growth raids as someone above mentioned unless you want to go for the learning experience. It's nice to get some raids under your belt, but I found that in my low - mid 50's the Plane of Growth was a great way to waste 10 hours by spending 5 of those hours doing corpse recovery. Even at level 60 it still gets a little rough sometimes clearing it to kill Tunare =) Not to mention that shaman armor seems extremely rare in PoG, I've been on about 15 raids there over the last year or so and have *never* seen any shaman armor drop.<br />
<br />
What I would suggest instead of doing planar raids is to pick a Velious faction (I would start off with Thurgadin) and go raid. Thurgadin armor is the easiest to acquire, with only 2 groups of mid 50's required to kill in the arena of Kael. I would wait until your high 50's or even 60 before switching over to Skyshrine / Kael faction since Temple of Veeshan is much more difficult. Mobs in Kael drop quest armor pieces pretty regularly, and the armor from the quest is very good. You can also find people willing to multiquest armor pieces for 1-3k usually as well, but expect to pay around 10-15k for BP or legs MQ. Also by choosing dwarf faction, you can do the Kromrif Military Leggings quest, which results in a nice pair of pants that did me well until level 56 or 57. <br />
<br />
Hunting in Velk's Lab is also good at your level, and some of the dropped items there would be a good upgrade for you - Crystal Chitin Gauntlets and Armplates, Spider Fur Cloak and belt; and you can also pick up some gems needed for Velious armor quests and some other items which sell for a couple k plat while you're there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eamonn1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personally at 60 I still use the jbb a lot (to gain aa points) so would dissuade you from giving up on one.This does not mean you cant camp it though.Elysians in Umbral drop a nice face and shoulder slot.They also drop nice Druid armour so perhaps you could drag a guild group there.It's SE corner.The Goranga Chief in ME drops a good range item (15ac 15 wis 35 mana) and is doable by a group of your level.<br />
<br />
                                      The rings obviously need changing and re the shield slot have a look at the Shield of Bane Warding (25ac 20wis 12 svm).It's a relatively easy quest (if time consuming) provided you have some pals.Your pals will get some good xp as you gather the quest items and on completion.<br />
<br />
            When I can stand the boredom I solo shrooms in FG for aa.The only mana used is slow to solo dark blue mobs.It's mind numbingly boring but it's the fastest aa xp Ive encountered and the jbb is an integral part of it.<br />
<br />
        Umbral shoulders are 15ac 7 wis and some others face 13 ac 2 or 3 wis and some stats btw.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aye Eamonn I didn't mean to tell him not to pursue the JBB, but rather put it on the backburner until he's got some decent upgrades to some other slots first. 20K or so for a JBB is a fair chunk of change, and it is a great tool, but I just meant that he shouldn't let the rest of his equipment suffer just to obtain it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah Gloriana I got them mixed up hehe, I play a wizzie too lol... and he used Oak Leaf before He got Grotesque... my bad hehe<br />

<br />
                No problem at all.I found that 4 items really made a difference to my EQ life as a shaman.Two of them (Fungi and JBB) directly impact on my ability to gain xp,whether aa or level.The second pair are malo and torpor and they make a huge difference when it comes to raiding.Obviously they are also advantageous in terms of xp groups but as shaman abilities  they come into their own in raid situations.<br />
<br />
                                           Thus I would advise gearing oneself towards these four goals (and later canni 5).The JBB is one of the four pillars (if the most potentially redundant one at 60) of a shaman's EQ life and thus,in my ranking,would take precedence as an objective.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Horses only work in outdoor zones, so keep that in mind if you do a lot of dungeon hunting.  :)<br />
<br />
I'd hit Maiden's Eye and grab some of the nice no drop stuff that drops pretty frequently.  Last time I was there I got a Shrouded Medallion (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=32318) and a Stone Idol (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=32323), both very nice pieces (in the 4-arms camp.)  One of these days I need to go back there and pray for some Divine Inspiration.  ;)<br />
<br />
The real game changing items aren't cheap.  I'll make some gear change recommendations, but slant them toward upgrading as cheaply as possible, with the idea of saving toward a JBB, Horse, Fungi Staff, or Iksar BP- remember, Mana free healing/damage &gt; All.<br />
<br />
Ears:  Imbued Golden Ivory Earring (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=20595) (this is an easy one- increases your WIS and AC- and super-cheap, 100 pp each max.)<br />
<br />
Face:  Arctic Wyvern (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=24813) is the cheapest way to go.  Lose 3 wis, get 6 AC/CHA, and a minor save.  Good trade, and you'll make some money on it.<br />
<br />
Neck:  Ry'gorr (100 pp, a great deal for ac 9, +10 mana, +4 sta, +4 magic)  /  Ivory imbued if cheap enough / or the Shrouded Medallion from Maidens<br />
<br />
Fingers:  6/65- yeah, you'll lose WIS, but it's worth it.  If you can find a cheap one, grab a Shadel Bandit Ring (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=28708) (the +55 mana is equivalent to 5 wisdom.)<br />
<br />
Wrists:  Leave 'em alone- shaman wrist upgrades aren't cheap.  Save for your JBB.<br />
<br />
Shoulders:  If you're serious about raising money, you could sell these and replace them with a tattered mantle (100 pp, or go whack Gullerback in Burning Woods) - you'd lose WIS but gain AC- and you might be able to use the cash to fund something more important.<br />
<br />
Chest:  Not worth upgrading cheaply.  An Iksar BP would be a nice upgrade- maybe something to save for or camp.  If you're looking to upgrade, I think the progression (cheapest first) is TreeWeave / Froglok BP / Barbed Ringmail / Iksar BP / Phase Spider Carapace / Fungi Tunic.<br />
<br />
Back:  Fine- no cheap upgrades here.  If you're looking to upgrade, those Arcylia reinforced (+10 wis) cloaks are coming down in price (2k?) and the Seahorse cloaks (ac 20, +25 hp) make a great ac/hp cloak for the money.<br />
<br />
Waist:  Fine- no cheap upgrades here (spider fur is a nice alternative, substituting WIS for AC/HP.)<br />
<br />
Legs:  Tough spot to upgrade- I wouldn't worry about it yet.<br />
<br />
Boots:  Sell the GEBs for cash and get some JBs.  More cash!<br />
<br />
Shield:  Definitely ditch the CGS- replace it with a Clay Guardian shield (ac 25, +50 HP, few hundred pp.)  Your next upgrades would be the Crystal Chitin (if WIS/Mana is your primary concern) or the Sarnak Battle Shield (resists, HP).  Thing is, these are each going to set you back a couple k.  I'd stick with the Clay guardian for now- you should be able to break even or make a little on that swap.<br />
<br />
Sell the Howling Harpoon and replace it with a goranga idol, stone idol, etc.  You might make a few plat on this deal as well.<br />
<br />
Hopefully at the end of this all you'll have a couple thousand more plat than you started with, to be applied toward one or two really good gear upgrades.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">sell your chodikai shoulders, replace with tattered mantle.  this should net you about 1k or so, depending.  <br />
add that, and all other monies you happen to come by, to your jbb fund.  once you get that you can start dropping your wisdom gear for ac/hp stuff.  <br />
Dont be too alarmed about really low wisdom.  I think my wisdom was around 150 when i dinged 60, and i never really went oom in an exp situation.  <br />
Basically start liquidating wisdom for ac/hp, until you find a comfortable level for your mana pool.  and get your free dmg items asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ok not to sound dumb here but why AC?  I understand hps to get more canni use.  I see AC being a small factor because we do gain agro with slow at times but I rarely do any actuall tanking.  Should I be tanking more when I solo?  When I solo my pet usually does fine without me tanking and I figure with my weapon I can do more damage medding/canni than if I melee.</div></div><hr />
