<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've had JB arms for too long and need some advice on where to get something better. Post stats on them and how to get please. Buying from the bazaar is not an option been looking for a long time and nothing good for sale. Want something with Hps decent ac at least 15ac, 40hps and some wis or mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS. Also would love to know where the Dragonhide mantle that has 12 ac 55hps and 55 mana drops and from who.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only thing that I would suggest for arms and such is either grabbing the Hardened Grey Flesh arms that drop in the Grey, or camping either the SS or Thurg arms.  I have the SS arms right now, and the Grey Flesh on my beastlord, but I'm seriously thinking about saying screw the couple more wisdom and AC and getting more hps and sta out of the Grey Flesh....then again, my sta is sitting at 275 with a max of 280 right now for me, so it might not be a good option baring a quick upgrade from elsewhere</div></div><hr />
