<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well this will go down as one of the most monumental evenings that I've had in the four years I've played EQ. Just shy of 3 months after having gotten back from retirement I dinged level 65 and became elemental flagged all an the same night!! ^_^ No powerleveling either. ^_^ Weeeeeeeeeeeeeee. ^_^ What's best is I was 7% to level after my first SolRo Tower raid and then preceded to ding 65 in Plane of Earth! ^_^ Sorry, I am so excited I had to share ^_^ Not to mention I think I am the first Froglok Shaman to enter the elemental planes on the Povar server! ^_^</div></div><hr />

So, how do you survive ae's with resists like that lol :p<br />
<br />
i'm also finding myself amused that your charm is probably your best piece of gear.</div></div><hr />

Why is it that every frog has to be a twink? =p All my gear was gotten by me in the form of buying and selling in the bazaar or in groups (well except for the shield that was given to me recently as a gift) =p I resist AEs fine BTW. Up until hitting 63 I wasn't in a guild so I didn't really have use for resists. Now... well now that's one of the next steps isn't it ^_^ hehe Actually I find it quite funny that my charm is one of my best pieces of gear, but you know I've never had a mana problem on a raid yet =p And yeah, not that you asked, but this character is my main, my one and only character, I am just back from retirement. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm..  Zyphun you must be in Triton. ^_^<br />
What toon did you play before you made this Frog?<br />
I was in the Old RA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How are you leveling so fast? Last time I looked at your profile you were only like 53 and you said you were hunting in CoM. Give some tips bro on how you did it. I'm 55 atm and I play like 3 hours a night and it seems like it takes me forever to level now even in groups. What's the secret on leveling so fast and how much are you playing if I may ask.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sign of the times I suppose. I dunno, its just strange to see stuff like this. <br />
<br />
&quot; Hi,I started a character from scratch 4 months ago, did nothing but level from 1-65 and buy all my gear, joined an uberguild that flagged me for the elemental planes lalala~ &quot;<br />
<br />
Just kinda boggles the mind how much its changed. Not doggin on ya or anything, honestly, but the difference is astounding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep Krakster, its insane how fast people can level these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My secret to leveling is that I do nothing but level. I kind of split up my time, figure out what I want to accomplish and work at that till it is done. I didn't take time to do quests except the epic that took all of a night, I am still without it because I haven't taken the time to go pick up a tear from Fear, and more importantly I didn't join a guild. Well that’s not true I did waste some time I mean, I do like to spend some time just chatting and I spent most of a week doing that and playing with a new friend I'd made and didn't worry about XP. <br />
<br />
As to exactly how I leveled so fast, well I spent a lot of time in my early 50's in City of Mist at the gazebos and in Dulak on the boats. I moved to PoDisease and into mostly left courtyard groups when I out grew Dulak at about 55. At 58 I got flagged for PoValor, which by the way, was the weekend before it opened up. LOL I spent 14 straight hours in a group that Saturday afternoon/night in caves just off of zone-in in PoValor (it's called the Inner Camp on the Povar server). Spending time like that is not something I usually do, but I used to have fun pulling all nighters so I decided I've do it again for old times sake. During those 14 hours I made 59, 60, and 61. I spent a lot of time after hunting in PoValor (random camps) and in BoThunder. I joined a guild at 63 because they were doing PoPower back flagging the week after I joined and I didn't want to miss it. I had planned on waiting to join a guild until I was 65, but my hand was forced. ^_^ That slowed my leveling down a lot and it took me two weeks to get from 62 to 64, but I think it was well worth it. When I was 90% into 64 I got my last flag (the Village People trial in HoHonor no less) for the first three elementals and dinged 65 in the PoEarth. Oh another thing is I didn't take any time to work on AAs at all. All 7 of my current AAs are from the flagging and talking to the dwarf in PoK. I didn't actually move my AAXP slider bar over to getting AAXP until I got 20% into 65 last night.<br />
<br />
LOL And no I am not in Triton. ^_^ The whole reason for me playing again is because my roommate wanted someone to play with again and he's in Forces Unknown. I actually picked being a shaman as a class to play because that was what it looked like FU needed at the time. I made him a frog because I wanted to be unique.<br />
<br />
As to who I played before, At the time I left just after PoPower, I had a level 61 cleric, 54 bard, 52 paladin and a 51 druid, my druid being my character with the most days played at 200+. I left EQ the first time because at the time was frustrated with the direction EverQuest was taking and I knew I'd go postal if I had to do the PoJustice trial again to get people through into PoStorms/PoValor.  Things have changed, I’ve changed and EQ is fun again.<br />
<br />
Krakster is right about it being easy. Anyone that really wanted to could do what I did I think. Though honestly I did just about the same thing with my Paladin back about two years ago. A little over a month and I think like 6 days played to get them to 52. Now though with all the gear that's so easily available and XP being handed to you on a silver tray the game is almost unpleasantly easy. Luckily I find other things in the game to enjoy. ^_^<br />
<br />
BTW I am by no means the fastest leveling person I know. Personally I think I to long. I have a friend who took a warrior from 1 to 65 in about 14 days played during the same time I was leveling. He's now got 25 AAs and is decently equipped as well as being elemental flagged (it's his main and one and only character). Of course he was PL'd and botted a lot so I guess I can rub that in when he brings it up. ;-)</div></div><hr />
