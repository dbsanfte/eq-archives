<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Um... to tell you the truth, he is a moron. But, so is Al Gore. Neither of them are intellectually high enough to be capable of resolving this issue fully. George Bush thinks we can do it on our own, and, of course, he never has an opinion either. He has his father's brain in his body. He asks his father on every issue it would seem. Note: Seem. As far as Gore, I am still waiting for the &quot;Made in Taiwan&quot; sticker to fall off of that Robotic freak.<br />
<br />
You don't insult your allies in the press or on television, however, especially not if their military protects your country. That is like asking for someone to invade you so the US can sit by and laugh.Wouldn't happen, but, they need to think of that.<br />
<br />
Oherwise, I don't think either Bush nor Gore should have won. We should have scrapped it and put someone intelligent in the White House, and in all of Congress. However, we don't elect smart people. we elect idiots who can out lie smart people that are Honest. That's the Democracy for you.</div></div><hr />

Edit - It's fairly amusing when people are willing to call someone they don't know a moron, just because a hostile press says he is stupid.  The fact of the matter is, none of you know or have met the guy, and are really in no position to judge him intellectually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sionach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;Regional dialect?&quot;  LMAO!<br />
<br />
The only time I've ever heard someone pronounce the word as &quot;nucular&quot; has been due to their ignorance . . . you know, kind of like Homer Simpson.  :p<br />
<br />
No matter how you look at it, the fact of the matter is, when the President can't pronounce &quot;nuclear&quot; properly, it's rather pathetic and somewhat laughable.  I expect the President to be well-spoken; a drawl is a normal part of living in specific regions, but blatant, consistent mispronunciation is just a display of ignorance.  One would think his advisors would advise him on the proper pronunciation, especially before he starts talking to North Korea about halting their &quot;nucular&quot; weapons development!  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
So...by your definition, nearly everyone in Boston and New York City are ignorant because they mispronounce words blatantly and consistently?  Or we could extend it even further, to include all english speaking people who don't sound like Britons...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sionach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My apologies then; perhaps there really is a regional pronunciation issue at work here . . . but I maintain my stance that, considering his position in the world, Bush should be able to pronounce the word correctly.  Nuke-lee-ur isn't so hard to pronounce that he couldn't be instructed in the proper pronuncation before he speaks on television/radio.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sionach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Timmit, there's a difference between &quot;pahking the cah&quot; (parking the car) and completely rearranging the letters in a word.  &quot;Nucular&quot; is not an accent, it is a mispronunciation; it reverses two of the sounds in the word, just like when kids call spaghetti &quot;psketti.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see any difference, they're both gross mispronunciations, and &quot;pahking the cah&quot; is just as bad really, since they're cutting/pasting sounds into the words that dont belong.<br />
<br />
I just don't make the mistake of assuming that someone is ignorant simply because they grew up in an area where very  nearly everyone says &quot;nucular&quot; instead of nuclear.<br />
<br />
I guess he's must be stupid, though.  If he wasn't he would have invented the internet :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of you may like to think that you are smarter than him and could do a better job. Get real. The duty of president is the most demanding and difficult job in the country. <br />
<br />
Throw him a fricking bone here.<br />
<br />
Nobody has to love the president and think he is the best human being in the entire world but at least show an ounce of respect. I'm not some huge patriot and I don't love my country all that much but I respect bush for what he is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kuluvien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gore actually never said that he invented the internet.  He was discussing that his promotion of certain industries which advanced the internet project to a global scale had a direct effect on its success.  Some opponent of his took it WAY out of context and said that Gore claimed he had invented the internet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The Nucular weapons?  They're at in the yahd, not to fah from the cah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually, being the president isnt as hard as everyone assumes. It is not like the President goes in and signs or vetos every bill that Congress puts in front of him while deciding international policy and all of that. Being a good president entitles that you assign a good staff to handle most of those decisions for you,. Bush has a good staff, I agree, but, he is not a good president.<br />
<br />
The reason I say he is not a good president is because, look at these facts. Number 1, His father put the Taliban in the Afghanistan government, as the people we &quot;wanted&quot; and trained Osama Bin Laden in Terrorist tactics to use against the government we just reinstituted as the one we now &quot;want&quot;. We created that mess, or, Georgen Bush Senior created that mess. George Bush Junior is doing nothing more than covering his father's ass right now. That's all there is to it. The only thng I have to give him compliments on is, he is doing it to make most people like him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I will give Bush credit for one thing.  He surrounded himself with some VERY intelligent people.  And I also tend to feel that much of his perceived &quot;stupidity&quot; comes from the fact that he simply isn't a very good public speaker.  If you listen to people who have talked to him in person *and I don't mean just interviewers* they say he is actually a rather charming and charismatic person.<br />
<br />
I'm not a Bush fan in the least, but you can't say he hasn't done anything right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Phantom042</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If you listen to people who have talked to him in person *and I don't mean just interviewers* they say he is actually a rather charming and charismatic person.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gore is also supposedly a very engaging person, and even a good speaker (when not so goddamn tense that he goes roboto...).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Daegan Quistfeather</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">In a March 1999 interview with Wolf Blitzer, Gore said, &quot;During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet.&quot;<br />
<br />
No matter what he meant by it he is still taking credit for something that he had nothing to do with...<br />
<br />
We created that mess, or, Georgen Bush Senior created that mess. George Bush Junior is doing nothing more than covering his father's ass right now. <br />
<br />
That would be incorrect.  Reagan was the one that supported the Afghan freedom fighters.  The Regime that was supported by the U.S. Was Overthrown in 1992 by the Taliban.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The regime we supported under Reagan wasn't the Taliban, aye, but, we finded the Taliban secretly, and trained them in their militaristic tactics. Do you realize that we put in the government we overthrew in 1992? That we now &quot;Want&quot; them in power? It's nothing more than George Bush Junior trying to stop the fact his father funded the Talibvan from coming out. Also, he is covering Rebublican ass by basically shifting everything toward the new Terroris goal.<br />
<br />
While Admirable, we cannot do it alone like he thinks, and the reason he is making it admirable are less than attractive on a personality point of view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Eoghan Blaidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Why would anyone ever get upset when someone calls a politician a moron? I thought all politicians were morons. Did something change when I wasnt paying attention again?</div></div><hr />

everything is going wrong : politics, religions, medecine,...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Malevant Faeshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I like the &quot;hostile&quot; press comment.  Shrub has not been called on near all of his hijinks as Clinton was, he's gotten a free ride so far.  I particularly like how senior staff members can repeatedly assert that questioning the president is unpatriotic and not be called on it, in very large and prominent print.  Disagreement is at the heart of Democracy, or at least, it is if you are not GWB.  The guy IS a moron, and what a politician has to do to earn that sort of distinction from me is pretty freaking steep.</div></div><hr />
