<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I spent a good part of Thurs (4hrs), Fri (6hrs), and Sat (5hrs) in Droga, and it seems as if they may have nerfed the named spawns, and also added some roamers in the named areas.  I actually had a couple close calls due to roamer adds that I've never had before in the Runri area.  I did the named cycle to Runri, and didn't come up with anywhere near the # of named spawns as usual.<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice this, or was my timing just bad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you actually get a roamer in Runri's room?<br />
<br />
There are two roamers outside one from each end of the &quot;hall&quot;. As for the drops I got the savage spider twice within a few hours of camping. I got the Ring and Bracer from it. The bracer is a nice upgrader for my Chanter mate. <br />
<br />
A necro on my server did however complain that runri wasn't popping as much as normal. I've not had chance to camp him though so I have no first hand knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dugok Grumblehawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I camped runri yesterday and I had 5 placeholders and 2 Runri pops.  So overall, not too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Osrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My 65 war friend and I duo'd Bone Knight Saturday then added the Dirt Criminal into the rotation on Sunday. Spent a little over 3 KEI's worth of time there total.<br />
<br />
Bone Knight: 5 daggers, no sashes.<br />
<br />
Dirt Criminal: 2 crowns, no earrings.<br />
<br />
Daggers sell for less than 1k on my server but are worth 3.6k trib.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My bad.  I meant Dirt Criminal for the roamer problems.  I try to do both when I get the camp, and had Runri on the brain.  However, there seems to be a few more roamers in this area now.<br />
<br />
Looks like it was just bad timing on my part.  I'll just keep at it.  Thanks to those that replied.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there's always been a roamer that paths across the bridge behind the dirt criminal. I cant remember how close he comes to the dirt criminal but i think its pretty close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It usually takes me 3/4 PHs to get to the Bone Knight to spawn, and so far, all he dropped for me to date are the daggers.  I do not camp him for long periods of time because of raids and such.  I usually here for my rogue - PLing him up in my free time.<br />
<br />
As for the Criminal, I always thought I would get three adds if I tried to pull the PH.  Never tried it, but one day when I feel adventurous, I will monkey around with that PH.<br />
<br />
I usually kill the Bone Knight, 2 roamers, the 3 static spawns to the gate, the 2 static spawns on the first floor, 1 static spawn at the top of the ramp in the criminal house, and the static spawn near the door in the building next to Bone Knight before repops happen.  I usually just take my time, tank the mob with dots to hold aggro as my rogue BS'es them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
At 63, I've never had the one behind and to the left of the Dirt Criminal (as you face him from the top of the ramp) add, but the one to his right comes once the DC/PHer starts to move--but not until then.  So, if root sticks to the Dirt Criminal, then you have time to slow/debuff/whatever before worrying about the one that will add.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info.  I appreciate it, and I will test drive this puppy next time I am in the neighborhood.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Went back tonite out of boredom, and realized I was mis-remembering the DC's spot.<br />
<br />
As you face the back of the room from the top of the ramp, there's 4 spawns visible.  1 in the far right corner on the wood platform, one in the middle back of the wood platform (the DC or ph'er), one just to the left and around the corner from the DC, and one back in the far left corner in the tunnel.  <br />
<br />
The ones on the far right and far left won't come.  The DC and the one just around the corner to the left of him will, but it's still the situation I described; I just had the mobs mixed up in my head--i.e., DC won't come until the one around the corner moves forward enough to trigger him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Spent 5 hours and not one Runri spawn. Went back the next day and got 4 spawns in about 2-3 hours. Just good old RNG happiness!<br />
<br />
Also got one dirt criminal spawn but wasn't always clearing him, much of the time I just kill the Runri PH and go do other stuff for 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Result - lots of rotting daggers and one nice crown for my bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">zone's not nerfed; last night my group got 3 kings in a row. they might have nerfed other named but i think they'd nerf em all to be safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think it was just a string of bad luck/spawns.  Hell, I've been in Inner Acrylia the last 3 weeks.  Needed a change of pace.  But, it seems like it may be time to go back to Droga, or Seb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There has been a subtle nerf to Droga.  I'm not referring to the drop rates or spawn rates.  I'm referring to the addition of wanderers in certain areas.  <br />
<br />
Once specific example is as follows:<br />
I routinely solo the Piklo spawn.  There are 2 mobs outside the &quot;room&quot; and 3 mobs (including the ph) in the room.  I usually invis down to the hallway past Piklo's area (towards the Runri part of the zone) and pick a spot to cast my pet and buff up.  I was always able to do this in peace and quiet and pick off the two mobs outside and then the three inside the room.  These 5 mobs are comfortable for me to kill them all before the 20 minute spawn rate.<br />
<br />
So, a couple weeks ago I head back down there to get a ring for my wife's alt, when lo and behold, in the middle of killing my first mob outside the room, here comes a wandering adept down the hallway.  Since I had just buffed and was low on mana and not prepared, I was barely able to gate out of there with my life.  This wanderer was never ever there in the past.  I am positive of this.  I went back again a couple of days ago, and sure enough, a wanderer.<br />
<br />
Someone else had alluded to a wanderer somewhere else and I think that it is possible.<br />
<br />
Be safe,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I had the same thing happen to me at Piklo, and like you Macheras I'm 100% sure this guy is new. I got bored one day and mapped all the spawn points and most of the roamer paths with my Rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Was there today at piklo and that damn wanderer came while killing another mob and gated on me, I was douing with my necro and ended up having that mob gate 2 times, Couldn't quite handle 4 mobs at once so i tryed to gate but couldn't get it off, necro was able to fd and drag/rezz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have Killed Runri/PH about 30 times &amp; i have only got one sash...Guess it is better to be lucky than good. Flame Master has popped quite frequently for me. Almost seems like 2 PH`s &amp; one Flame master..As for the other spawns I feel that the names are not popping as often probably cause i have spent a lot of time there &amp; am getting quite bored &amp; impatient.</div></div><hr />
