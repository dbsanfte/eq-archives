Also, regarding the slow descriptions:  you can have slow maintained on multiple targets at once.  The descriptions haven't been updated in-game yet.  <br />

<br />
No offense, but what level are you?  The complains in beta about the spell lines have been pretty minimal till the recent flood of people.  Most of the ones I see complaining about spell diversity aren't even high enough to have picked their sub-class yet.  Considering some spell lines don't even begin till 24 or 29, it does take a little while to get fully fleshed out.  Between my battle spells, utility spells/buffs, and my mastery spells (skeleton, gnoll, zombie, centaur) - I have almost 3 full hotkey banks.  Only 2 are macros.  I use all those spells quite regularly, except for the cure trauma/cure noxious/cure arcane line.<br />
<br />
Again, no offense intended.  Just curious what you're basing your opinion on.  No game is going to be for everyone, this one included; but I'm personally having a great time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've gone over the spell list for Mystics and I don't see anything about Skeletons, Gnolls, Zombies or Centaurs. What's that about?<br />
<br />
I have one other question for you Beta2 Shammys.<br />
<br />
I played a Shaman in Everquest, before Kunark and loved it. Played up to level 42 (When 50 was the highest and took a year to get to) but sold my account when some real life issues came up.<br />
<br />
I bought EQ again when Velious was released, but didn't want to wait until level 34 again before I got my pet this time, so I made a Necromancer.<br />
<br />
I'm really looking forward to playing a Shaman Main (Mystic) in EQ2 from what I've read, but I was wondering what you Beta shammys would suggest as a second account character? (I run a Necro/Cleric 2Box combo now in EQ1)<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of going Mystic/Conjurer or maybe Mystic/Rogue (The good version of Assassin) or something like that.<br />
<br />
I plan on focusing the majority of my attention on the Shaman, so I don't want a second class that's going to take a huge amount of attention. (Like Bard heheh)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

There are mastery quests,  mastery &quot;monster_type&quot; spells require you collect about 10 different rare drop &quot;body parts&quot; from that type of mob, and can take hundreds of kills to get them all.  Once this quest is completed you get a new spell, its Master 1 level and doesnt replace your previous spell..   Im my case as a Defiler I have a smite spell at Adept 3 level that works on everything, and a master 1 level Zombie Master's Smite, thats a completly different hotkey on a diferent timer ( same timer, 1min, with all other mastery spells I have)<br />

The way combat is -- very fast, lots of button pressing -- i think 2-boxing will be very tough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Combat is very fast, but with that said, I do have a friend that twoboxes a mystic and a swashbuckler right now in EQ2.  He does pretty well with it and it seems like a good pairing.  I've done a lot of duoing with some monk friends, and it's been a pretty formidable combo.  The monk can dodge/shrug off a lot of hits; while it's not a replacement for a plate class, they can tank and take a considerable amount of hits.<br />
<br />
As far as the mastery stuff goes, yeah, those are separate from the sub-class spells.  Anyone can obtain skeleton master's smite, zombie master's smite, etc.  For melee classes, it actually gives the player a kick; ie, &quot;skeleton master's kick&quot; that you can use against any skeleton-type mob with a 1 min refresh.  Currently, mastery spells are in for quite a few mobs... bixies, centaurs, giants, treants, elementals, skeletons, zombies, shadowed men.. etc.   Some of the drops are quite rare, but these mastery skills are meant to be completed over the life of your character.  You're not gonna run off and buy the mastery tome and farm skeletons until you're done.  You could, but it would take a while.  The mastery spells scale infinitely over level (increase in power as you gain levels) - so no matter what level you get it at, it will do damage based on where yer at.<br />
<br />
It's a cool, fun little extra bonus attack.  <br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okay I haven't been following EQ2 as well as I should have been, so this may sound like a stupid question:<br />
<br />
Where is the Pet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I’ve been 2Boxing in online games since around 1991 on the local multi line BBS systems. While it might prove a challenge, I’m hearing some things about EQ2 that will make multi boxing even easier.. (Like Melee’s auto-following mobs they are fighting) Which would make running a Shaman/Scout team more feasible.<br />
<br />
I play with two keyboards side by side like a big piano, and have become quite ambidextrous at it heh. I’m really looking forward to a new challenge!<br />
<br />
After the recent pet patches in EQ2 has there been any change to Shaman pets? I know it’s not a lot, but I loved my Wolf companion, and would be heartbroken if he didn’t follow me to the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Looks like the spell lists will be overhauled, so you might want to add that somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, what's the status with the new/revamped spells? Where's the pet?!?!? ;)</div></div><hr />
