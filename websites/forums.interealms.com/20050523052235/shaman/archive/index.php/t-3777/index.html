<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok how many of you shamans cast Malo?<br />
How many cast slows?  <br />
Dots?  <br />
Root?<br />
<br />
Affliction haste affects all of these with a hefty savings in time.  For example, with the Affliction Haste III bracer I got tonight from Eashen (bless his scaley heart) my cast time on Malo has dropped from 5 seconds to 3.4 seconds.  Turgurs has dropped from 3.0 seconds to 2.0 seconds.  This represents about a 33% savings in time.  <br />
<br />
Faster slows = less interrupts on slows.  A 2 second slow is pretty darn quick.  A 3.4 second Malo certainly has a better shot of channeling thru while that MR as hell mob beats on you.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I am a bit ignorant of the items out there with effects like this.  Is there a lower end item with AF 3?  I think this might be one of the most useful effects for shamans out there.  <br />
<br />
Braclet of the Sky<br />
22 AC  5 STR  50 HP  +7 all resists<br />
Affiction Haste III<br />
ALL ALL<br />
<br />
I wasn't gonna roll on it before I saw the effect.  That made me change my mind pretty fast.  I guess the hps and resists are pretty nice too tho.  <br />
<br />
Btw, Naki's Ring effect doesn't stack with this other effect.  The greater effect (AF3) is the one that takes hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When focus items came out, affliction items affected our debuffs and dots.  Then they changed it to only our dots.  Now its back.  Who knows if it'll stay or not?  Not me, i just know i love it.  Coldain military wristguard now has a permanent place on my left wrist, right across from the bracelet of the sky.  Can't see myself rolling on another bracer ever, unless they nerf this (again).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nice! Is affliction haste the only affliction effect that affects our debuffs? or will affliction efficiency or duration affect them too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have an extended affliction item and it works on debuffs, roots and dots. ubah. Now for haste and efficiencey items...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am lvl 40 so all my items are second lvl<br />
<br />
i have a chipped bone bracer, iksar hide boots, and serpentine bracer, so i have all the affliction item effects for focus lvl 2.<br />
I have seen a difference, and when i cast debuffs/slows/roots i have seen these all flicker/glow/whatever to show they all are used on those spells as well as damage over time instead of just haste.<br />
hope this helps</div></div><hr />
