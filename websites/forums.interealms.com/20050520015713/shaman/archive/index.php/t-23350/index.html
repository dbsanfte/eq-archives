<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else think that people on all servers should keep a constant raid going on Gukta? Just keep all the mobs dead constantly till they give it back to Grobb...show that we really would have won the war?<br />
<br />
It's nice and all that we got Frogloks...but they could have made thier own city...everyone else did.<br />
<br />
That or just /feedback everyday GIVE TROLLS GROBB BACK!.....Sooner or later they will get tired of it and restrict /feedback or give us Grobb.<br />
<br />
Sorry to any Frogloks who read this and disapprove.<br />
<br />
P.S. Yes I was very bored today...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lmao.. yeah give trolls a place so the others dont have to smell them.. maybe waay away from the other places</div></div><hr />

It'd even be appropriate to have a &quot;hidden&quot; zone (underwater passage, etc) from Innothule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was funny while it lasted, but the joke is over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SOE really dropped the ball on this one.  It took them over a month and a half to get the special forge over to Nerriak for thier cultural smithing, not that many out there actually create or use Troll cultural.  There were a couple other issues that were overlooked in the joke of having the frogs invade and take over Grobb.  If you have spent any time there as a frog, the vendors behind counters are difficult to see and look generally out of place.<br />
<br />
I agree with you Howler, the joke is long over.  Long live Grobb you will be ours once again.<br />
<br />
Nerriak is a nice place to visit, but not a great place to stay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">HAHAHAHAHA  i thought you ment the board trolls  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>FreyrSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Trolls owned.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The booting of Trolls from their home was (yet) another example of lazy programming from the Sony corp.<br />
<br />
Programmer_01: &quot;Huh? Actually give Trolls their own home?&quot;<br />
<br />
Programmer_02: &quot;Naaahhhh, we're working on G.O.D.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pause.<br />
<br />
Collectively: &quot;BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why spend the man hours and time to do the right thing? Take the path of least resistance and just move the Trolls out and the Frogs in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Every troll petitioning daily would be like 20 petitions on my server.<br />
<br />
At least the Spiritstone point for trolls is pretty convenient for getting to PoK.  I think I use that thing more than ever since GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wouldn't mind letting the trolls take back Grobb, my fellow guktans and I have given up on ever getting their smell out. /holds nose<br />
<br />
I feel sorry for the darkys if they ever DO get the trolls out, that stench will last beyond the end of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Timbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree that everything in Gukta looks out of place. Taking Troll sized objects and putting Dwarf sized people behind them just doesn't look right.<br />
<br />
Not to mention a lot of the &quot;general NPCs&quot; were taken from the Trolls. There's simply no room in Neriak....In fact so much was taken away to make them fit into Neriak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Neriak's Exotic Dancer must be seeing a serious drop in revenue since the troll stench. Poor Trolls take back your town!</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
I myself am a barbarian(I started with a barb warrior, and tried out shaman from there), but I would love to join a raid on gukta. First I don't like frog people that much(even more then Var Shir) call me old fasion, and second giving them that city was an extremly lazy thing on there part. At the very least let the trolls burrow there own city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Timbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ooh...good idea. Let the dumb frogs have Gukta...we can make a new even better Grobb....possibly having something to do with the Broken Skull Trolls....<br />
<br />
Just got to thinking. Freeport is evil in EQ II no? I think it's time it fell to the dark side...muahahaha. It does kinda make sense. Especially when you think about the fact that the Broken Skull Trolls are pirates...and Freeport is the largest port city. No one uses the boats (translocators because they are too lazy to fix them) from Freeport to BB anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">OT a little, but doesn't the ruler of Freeport in EQ2 remind people of Seru?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i tried to protect grobb.. and then the bashers started chasing me.. i say let the dark elves and trolls suffer, that should teach them from biting the hand that feeds them</div></div><hr />
