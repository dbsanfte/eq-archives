<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Janin2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone of you guys ever obtained any of the ancient spells and what about that ancient shaman dot or is it just all some bs from VI again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bugged drop when introduced, they were dropping in Seb and some lucky folk actually got them.<br />
<br />
Since then none have dropped, anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rumoured to drop off Vulak, but RoV has never been done on any servers except test due to it being bugged on live servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kuthu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well... and those people that got them from seb arent really lucky because when they patched it out of seb they either a) took away the scroll you had or b) if you had it scribed it got changed to something else. <br />
<br />
a druid in my guild got legacy of thorns. After patch, much to his displeasure, it had changed to something like skin like wood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So does that druid now have 2 copies of skin like wood in his spellbook?</div></div><hr />
