<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off. When I talk about experience unless it is a large amount like 10 or 20 percent I use ticks instead of percent since 1 tick doesn't equal 1 percent. On the experience bar there are 125 ticks to 100 percent.<br />
<br />
These aren't all the spots in LoY of course. Just the ones I've tried. I would like to see some solo info on the Luggalds in Nadox if anyone has any.<br />
<br />
All hunting was done with KEI and either Temp or Virtue. All mobs hit for about the same. Around 110 to 130 max.<br />
<br />
1. Nadox - Pulling to the safe point on the EQatlas map. http://www.eqatlas.com/ykesha/cryptofnadoxmap.html<br />
You can pull mobs from any tunnel to the safe spot. They have a good amount of hit points and the area is very safe. 15 minute or so respawn. Plenty of mobs to choose from. 1 exp. tick = 3.5 kills.<br />
<br />
2. Dulak - Boat 4 (Oceancrasher) - Pulling to side of ship opposite ramp, towards front of ship just past the anchor lying on the deck. Pull the mob closest to you from the front of the ship first. Average amount of hit points. Pretty easy kills. Usually kill 8 before respawn starts. 1 exp. tick = 3.5 kills.<br />
<br />
3. Torgiran's Mines - http://www.eqatlas.com/ykesha/torgiransminesmap.html<br />
Set up between mobs against a wall just on the north side of the lava bridge. Not stronger than other mobs but they have a huge amount of hit points. About 12,000. Long fights. There are 7 mobs in that area. 1 exp. tick = 3 kills.<br />
<br />
4. Dulak - Luggald Caves - http://www.eqatlas.com/ykesha/dulakcavesmap.html<br />
Killing in the furthest back NE room. When you open the door to the room take a sharp right or left to a front corner of the room. Explore the room first with invis on to find all the mobs. Sometimes the Luggalds blend into the walls. Start killing by just running up to your first victim otherwise pathing may get you. They almost seemed to respawn in a bit different order than killed but I can't verify this at this time. Average hit points. 9 or 10 mobs in room with the occasional wanderer walking in from the doors and then leaving. Should be ok exp until lvl 60 or 61. 1 exp. tick = 2.5 kills.<br />
<br />
Summary - The best experience is in the Luggald Caves in Dulak. However, running through the caves and into the back room hoping invis doesn't drop is pretty exciting. You also will not make it out running if something goes wrong in the room. The first time there I was able to gate out after I goofed up and doggy was holding two mobs.<br />
<br />
My advice out of these four would be Boat 4 in Dulak. Easy kills that after a while remind you of being in Katta forever. Not bad loot. In two hours I usually end up with between 500pp and 1,500pp. Also, in those two hours I usually get about 10 percent exp.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps someone and if your on Kane Bayle these spots are closed for about 1 week yet. lol</div></div><hr />

I quit going around 57 because of planar exp but when it was slow i always came back. Infact i dinged 60 in Naddox Near the Zone-in from Gunthak that is not at the lava...<br />
<br />
I only killed the wanderers because they have far less hp then the rest do. Was good exp. about 1 exp% was 4-5 kills in 59. have fun =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just wanted to add that LoY is also great for power lvling. The Elementals in Naddox are great for the high 30's. Anything in Gunthak in the low 30's. Boats 2 and 3 in Dulak after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I prefered to spend my time at position 1 and 2 on the attached nadox map, mainly to bang out the blood of nadox quest and the signet of grisk quest. Everything execpt for the first pull at position 1 is a single pull. Purple on the map = safe spot.<br />
<br />
The two spots (1 and 2) have no mobs pathing through or near them, so you could even kite them in those spots if you were a inny troll or a kite weilding class.<br />
<br />
Pulling from position 2 requires careful aggro pulling. Its a good place to practice. (read: aggro pulling using sit aggro).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Having been off EQ for the past four months I was wondering if anything has changed in LoY to effect this info. Or maybe just something to add from someone to help others.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
