I'm probably going to get digitally bitch slapped for this, but if I were coming back to the game now, I'd make a Beastlord.  They seem to be the most well rounded, able class available at the moment.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure somebody can explain better than I, but my impression of a high level beastlord is ranger class melee damage (between the beastlord and the pet) combined with the spell casting abilities of a mid 50s shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">beastlords get pet heals as good as our regular heals, geta  65% slow at 65, can buff as well as us (better if ya like mana regen, which i don't know why ya wouldn't) and as long as root isn't needed can handle most situations as well as a shaman. Beastlords are an awesome class once they hit the 60's. Shaman still are, but a beastlord cleric dou is as good probably as shaman and any melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jablek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">BST's sound cool, but whats your opinions on WAR and SK's? in the long run which would be better? with the WAR upgrades would they be better than a SK in your opinion?</div></div><hr />

Go SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Forget SK, they're fun and I have a 65 elemental flagged one and love him.  But GoD nerfed SK/pally severely too.  They can't tank past the first phases of GoD even in time gear unless their groups are stacked with healers.<br />
<br />
Warrior is an uber class now.  You'll find plenty to do as a warrior.  They have very good disciplines now, and have quite significant advantages in mitigation and hitpoints over SK/pally.  That said, they seem to me and a lot of people a little more dull to play.  But they are unassailably vital in the game these days.  You'll very rarely hear anyone saying, we could have raided this or killed this named, but we didn't have a SK or pally.  With warriors, like clerics, you'll hear that all the time.<br />
<br />
BL's slow lands very early and is similar enough to ours that it's worth looking at what else they can do -- and that's much more DPS than we can, and add better buffs and do a MGB heal, plus even melee if they feel like it.  They are a very capable toon, and if you like the shaman slow shtick, BL have it.<br />
<br />
Of the poster's three original toons he mentioned, I'd say rogue is the class with the most viability these days.  You can get your epic exceptionally easily and most get it very very early on, your class instantly springs to mind when people think about DPS, and nobody will ever ask you to buff them!  Which means a fairly low pressure toon to play  Plus, the SoS AA skill lets you run around and not be detected through a huge percentage of the game's content, which is fun and makes you quite useful.  The only negative I would say is that chain drops seem to be far rarer than leather and plate and silk drops, in my experience, from velious to PoP to the small bit I've done in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jablek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">thanks all for the replies...atm im thinking about starting up my naked gnome rogue (13 atm) or starting over as a halfing or gnome warrior. not sure which ones yet. though rogue does sound fun, but the thing is my rogue is naked and my SK is fully equipped so it would be alot easier to gear up the warrior, lol. :)</div></div><hr />
