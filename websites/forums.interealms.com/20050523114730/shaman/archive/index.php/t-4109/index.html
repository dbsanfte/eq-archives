<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just about to hit 25 and I was wondering what I should spend my money (the few pp I have) on.<br />
<br />
Is there a rule of thumb for how much AC, DPS, HP etc I should have at this lvl. We are talking an untwinked toon.<br />
<br />
Basically I need to know where my money is best spent. <br />
<br />
I think I have an AC of ~400 and the HP is in the same range (slightly higher than AC). Wis 105, and a few items that raise AGI, DEX and STR but not by much.<br />
<br />
I have no references since everyone I ever meet is twinked.<br />
<br />
If it matters at this lvl, my goal right now is to solo.<br />
<br />
/Merry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No need to use gear to specifically raise agi/dex/str.  Well, maybe str if you are an encumbered iksar.<br />
<br />
It would help if you posted your race and what gear you were currently wearing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will post more info after I have looked at my char. Don't remember what he is wearing. The stat raising items are not because I have looked for them. They just came with the package so to speak. Like the Rings from the bandits in the Paludal caves (+1 AC, +2 AGI). The only stat raising items I have ever bought are my earings +2 WIS.<br />
<br />
I will look at my char and update info.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am untwinked as well, I made all 42 of my levels primarily soloing....so I might be able to help with some gear suggestions. Please post what race you are, and what gear you are currently wearing. A magelo profile would help immensely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Stormrazor,<br />
<br />
what the heck is with your sig?  On my screen it is about 4 inches high and has three lines of text.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have no clue what deal with it is, it's suppose to have a pic in the middle, but it's not showing up. That and the damn thing is huge !!<br />
I'm no HTML wizard so I really don't have a clue how to fix it, I thought I did it right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So how to I get my toon into magelo?<br />
<br />
/Merry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's not hard...go to Magelo (http://www.magelo.com) <br />
and register. Create an ID and password for yourself and select Create my Account.<br />
Scroll to the bottom-left hand side of the Magelo homepage and click on Characters.<br />
It will then take you to a screen and select Add a Character. This is where you'll manage your toons profile. <br />
There are several links at the bottom of the page<br />
Update this character- manages stats, Surname, Server, Race, Class, Level, Deity, Money.<br />
<br />
Manage his profile - This is where you use the Magelo database to put in what gear you're wearing, Magelo will add up everything for you as long as your starting stats/naked stats are correct. Once you have all your gear in name that profile and save it. The bottom of the page will show your stored profiles and below that will show you your default profiles web link. Click on that and it will display your characters stats, gear, etc, etc, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here is the link to my equipment.<br />
<br />
My equipment (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=330948) <br />
<br />
I would like to know what direction I should take since I have to updsate piece by piece and keep it at low cost. I currently have 100pp to buy my next upgrade with.<br />
<br />
I'm not so much interested in what piece to buy as in what type of things I should try to get. All on AC, HP over anything else etc.<br />
<br />
/Merry<br />
<br />
PS The numbers in Magelo doesn't exactly match what EQ tells me. EQ says ATK 411 and WIS 105</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What server do you play on, Merry?<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
I'd like to add that you can easily double your cash with the following method. Go to EC and kill all the spiders you can and loot their silk. Once you have 3 or 4 stacks, go to the bazaar, set the price per silk, and go to bed. You should wake up 100pp richer. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Goodberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What price do you set for the silks and why are they so sought after?<br />
<br />
Any other things I could farm and sell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The reason why silks are so sought after is because they are used in tailoring. Lots of high level people are lazy about farming tradeskill components, so you can just farm them and sell them.<br />
<br />
I think you can safely put 1.5pp per spider silk. If they don't sell, then lower it a bit.<br />
<br />
Go post on the EQTraders.com site and ask how much they are willing to spend on silks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm on the Rodcet Nife server.<br />
<br />
I have been selling silk and HQ pelts in the Bazaar. Not knowing the value I have only charged 5g/silk though.<br />
<br />
The problem with farming these is that I feel like I'm steeling the kills for the people actually getting xp (I'm hunting in Shadeweawers Thicket)<br />
