I am 65 with about 35 aa's... Not very uber I know. But if I had to do it over again, I would level to 61 and get my new pet BEFORE I worked on any aa's. If you stop now and do 6 aa points, it will be like dinging 52 6 more times. That feels like an eternity. If you wait until 61 and get your new pet, you can ding an AA every couple hours...<br />
<br />
 Of course if you aren't going to get to 61 anytime in the near future, get Run3... But dont waste the time doing Regen3 until you get to 61... The level and pet makes it so much easier...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm in a guild that does Kael and other similar zones kinda frequently.  I think I may set AA filter to 20 or 30% until I get run3.  Then power to 60 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Run3 is worth every penny imo. However, don't split xp, either do aaxp, or do xp 100%, otherwise you take twice as long to acheive anything ;)</div></div><hr />

If you exp with a regular group, you should be able to get those 3 AA's in week, even at 51.  Run 3 is that valuable.  Everything else can really wait until 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Run1 was enough to outrun just about everything in the dungeons I fought in while grinding to 60.  At level 51, get run1 and then leave AA alone until you're at least 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ohaern Halveric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well Foramorm , since you asked for personal expirience's w/pre 60AA, heres  mine. Currently I am 62 with 147 trained AA's, 1 banked,working on 2 more for LR2. <br />
   <br />
   Here's how I got that way , might not appeal to you-I play a different EQ then  those of you  in the raid/guild game. As far as I am concerned I beat the game the day  I made 50, since that was  the level cap when  I first discovered EQ. For me the fun in this game is hanging out with my  freinds , dungeon crawling  ( cant wait for LdoN!! ). Or just soloing and mucking around, even playing &quot; Santa Shammy &quot; if I can find a low level  in  need on an item rotting in my bank, 16 slots + 2 shared ones-and still I can't find room!  /boggle   /disclaimer off<br />
<br />
<br />
   Once a suitable cushion into 51 was reached ( 2 orange for me usually ). Never know if you're going to have to eat a few deaths sans rez- prepare for it, nothing worse than losing access to those nifty new spells!! I went 100% into  AA, got my run 3, my regen 3, and my title.<br />
<br />
   Went back to regular XP  bumrushed 55 and cushion, got used to my new spells, worked on my AA until  I  had most my archtypes done, went back to leveling, made 56  ( also ran into a shamaness Fenora Primaljustice  round this time, she pointed me to these boards   /wave Fenora ) - and sat my  happy ass there until MC3/ND3/CS3/CA3- basically all my archetypes + the points needed to  own can5  the  second I hit 59.<br />
<br />
59 was a breeeze as a result, made it to  60 in 5 real life days - 5, 5 hour shifts soloing  in LoY areas. Sat at 60 working AA  ( I really  can't remeber whitch I was working at this point ) and learning  how to use torpor to my best advantage  ( so  I'm a little anal, sue me )  I was having a  blast - and thats why we all game , right? Once  I was comfortable with the new tools at my disposal, yep you guessed it- 61 and the dog, erm THE DOG. Nuff said. Went back to  AA until a few more things were done. One thing  I do remeber  distinctly was  not getting my 3rd title until  I had trained 123 points -  I was skipping around  from arch to  class. As of last night, I came  to the decision to  pound it out to 65 once I finish  LR2 that is.<br />
<br />
   All in all  it has taken me some months to reach  60 and beyond , from when  I first made  51 and went  AA. But I have had a hell of a time, done some fairly nifty things in my  book. Sorry for the ramble, started off a  quick note, but  I tend to ramble once  I warm to the subject. Hope   this point of view helps in some  way -  have a pleasant evening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In one month pack shrew will probably hit live servers with the release of LDoN and as such the requirement for run3 will diminish very very quickly.  Just focus on xp and if you can't get shrew when LDoN is released stop, get run2, and keep moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye, I think Shrew could do a lot to undermine the usefulness of getting Run3 early.  It still outshines the other general AAs, but I'd be inclined just to get levels rather than AAs at present.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The usefulness of Run3 depends on whether you spend a lot of time indoors. Also, if you don't have jboots/black fur boots, it could save your life outdoors.<br />
<br />
Other than that, it all depends on what you find fun, what your goals are in game etc.<br />
<br />
If your guild is mostly mid 50s, doing smaller raids, levelling might help them accomplish the raids, but it might also put some distance between you and the guild. I found that level 61+ puts a big gap between you and the people at 50-55. Not that you can't group with them, but it's better to group with people about the same level.<br />
<br />
If you want to join a raiding guild, or to group in tier 2/3 planes, then levelling is the most important thing. On the whole, levels make you more effective than AA. That's not to say that a level 60 with 200 AA isn't as effective as a 65 with none, but it's not too hard to get from 60-65, and 65 with 180AA is more effective than either. :)<br />
<br />
Personally, I put 10-20% into AA until I got run1, then levelled to 61. I got Canni V at 61/62, then levelled to 65. Getting 65 first, then working towards Canni V would also work. I did find the extra mana useful on the way, but it wouldn't have made a lot of difference either way.<br />
<br />
But, if you enjoy getting AA skills more than getting new levels and spells, and if you're not in guild which raids regularly, then by all means stick around and get AAs on the way. Levels make you more effective, but if you're happy waiting and doing lower level stuff rather than being level 65, that's fine. Not everyone wants to be 65 and exping in tier 3, nor should they.<br />
<br />
On splitting AA/normal exp - it's true that if you split experience to anything other than 100% you're waiting longer to get something useful. Each AA or level will make you a little more effective.<br />
<br />
However, I found that bleeding off a little exp either way 80-20 or 90-10 means you're mostly working towards one thing, but putting a little aside can help - it's psycological more than anything else. I still do this at level 65 when I want to rebuild my cushion in the level - I put 10% into normal experience until it's where I want it, but I'm still working mostly on AA. It doesn't make a lot of difference in the long run.<br />
<br />
In the end, it's all down to what you want from the game. Even that is likely to change as you level, also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I had a different motivation for getting AA points at 51-52.  At the time I had yet to be on a successful Vox and Naggy raid so I switched over to AA while I waited to reach my goals of seeing both Vox and Naggy dead.  Surprisingly it took awhile as it was hard to get enough folks to take these dragons out back then.<br />
<br />
So in effect I killed two birds with one stone, marked 2 items off my EQ want to do list and got Run3 and Regen2 on the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That really was never the point of discussion tho.  Players stop at 51 and get RS3 because it was useful despite the fact staying on the xp course is a much greater benefit in the short term.  With the advent of Shrew/Mongoose the requirement to stop at 51 to pound out RS3 is very much diminished, and while almost every player will eventually get it those players will do it at 65 what was previously 51.  I for one would be more than happy to be moderately annoyed at having to cast shrew so I could keep hammering 100% regular xp full time to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As others have stated, whether or not you should work on AA points at 51 is really dependent upon your play style and your circumstances.  When I hit 51 I really wanted to get run three.  The thought of not having to worry about when SoW dropped, outdoors or indoors, was very appealing.  My old guild had disbanded so I was either soloing or grouping with friends, so I didn’t really care how quickly I leveled.  I was having fun and that was all that mattered.  <br />
<br />
Once I got run three I went back to 100% regular experience.  I plan to keep it that way until I hit 61 and get my new puppy.  I’m not as interested enough in any of the other AA skills to tempt me to gain them before 61.  Its not that I don’t care about the other skills, but at 51 the AA points really are slow to accumulate.  I’m very happy I took the time out to gain run three, but once I hit level 61 the other skills will come much quicker.  So I’m willing to wait.<br />
<br />
If you want some of your AA skills badly enough to take the time gain them at 51 then go for it.  It will be worth it to you.  But if you can wait until 61 you can get your super puppy and your AA skills will come much more quickly.  Its up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">In my opinion, a lot of people here are missing out on a few things...<br />
<br />
I agree with everyone here, Level is &gt; AA...however, there are some disclaimers.<br />
<br />
Getting a new level, ie dinging 60, really does not increase your power much if you don't have access to your level 60 spells.<br />
<br />
If your in a guild or have access to the spells, sure, go ahead and level...AA's come easier and faster in tuffer zones so go at least to 62<br />
<br />
However, leveling up to 62 and not having any of your good spells would really be fairly pointless.<br />
<br />
The other thing most people seem to forget, is that as you level up, more and more areas go green.  Never been able to figure them out, maybe they like going to places where everything is green?  If your the type that likes to adventure, not necessarily raid, then I would recommend leveling a bit slower, and seeing some of the dungeons and zones most people seem to ignore nowadays...<br />
<br />
The idiot that said he saw no use to Run 3 is exactly that...if you solo, Run 3 makes pulling easier/safer...makes surviving some situations possible. Not all of us have access to pocket/guild clerics for that free Rezz.  <br />
<br />
If I happen to train a group on the way out, well, its their problem..I make it a point to never, ever, camp zone ins/outs unless the dungeon is deserted.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, I make it a point to never, ever ding a level unless I have at least one of the class defining spells for the  level.  Getting 56 without having Bane of Nife is pretty useless, 55 without the 55 pet is the same...60 without Malo and Torpor...sheesh how could you know how good the shammy class is, if you zoom right by the level and dont experiment.<br />
<br />
Depends on your temperament, situation, and goals, but if you do take the time to do AA along the way, they wont be wasted, you just won't have to do them later<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Who says run3 is useless?  I know I didn't.  My arguement is that with the advent of indoor castable sow the neccessity to get RS3 as soon as humanly possible is dimished greatly.<br />
<br />

<br />
I disagree .. don't level to 56 without bane?  55 without pet?  Sorry, neither are what I see as class defining spells.  Our class defining spell came at 51 for every single one of us.  And considering how much torpor/malo costs comparative to how long it takes to ding 65 from 60 (a week if you can get consistent xp groups) I don't see a reason to stop at 59/60 till you get the spells.  Just power through and get Malos/Quies.  I don't think you'll regret it in the long run.  <br />
<br />
Now true, any AA you get now is AA you don't need to get later but .. You can get an AA at 65 in 1 hour worth of xp in PoP.  Or you can stop at 51 and take 5-10 hours for an aa point .. in that same 5-10 hours you could also have leveled.  The AA xp payout just gets better and better the more levels you have under you so from a pure efficiency standpoint get 65 THEN AA .. especially if there are going to be live server indoor sow spells in 1 month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Honestly, who runs indoors anyways?  Usually that results in a train and someone elses group to possibly wipe.  Just die and get a rez.  Running is overrated.<br />
<br />
Lots of time you invis and run, you don't really want to be oos of the group cause of run3 or in raids you clear and area and then run, specially if there are a low number of shammys then do you really want to be still running as the raid is fighting a mob waiting for you to slow it? even the smallest advantage like when it's very important for there to be no delays between rezzes and your body being at the spot, run3 helps you run to the zone.. and if you ever have to pull or like to pull, run 3 is nice.. BUT if you don't do many dungeons, I would wait until the next expansion.. <br />
<br />
My take on when to AA, if you can get tier 2 groups at your current level (lets say you get consistent pov at level 59) then stay that level and grind AA because you AA rate will be MUCH 3x? higher than the level 65 people there.. simply cause they are reds/yellows..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Personally speaking, for my situation, I LOVE Ohaern's path. But that's because Amorae is primarily an alt and generally partners with some very capable classes (rogue, druid, enchanter, cleric, all 60+). For someone playing a Shaman as their main character, I'd recommend just pushing to 65. While it's true that the level without the spells to go with it is pretty pointless, I believe that along the way, most folks will have more opportunity to acquire the spells themselves. In my experience, the Shaman who is of level to cast a spell will get that spell if it drops over the Shaman who has levels to get before they can cast it (all things being equal).<br />
<br />
Lot of great points made in this thread, from playstyles that may vary widely. The key thing here is playstyle. What works best for a hardcore player (i.e. grinding out the levels to 65 asap) may not work very well for their more casual counterparts. Also, game goals come into play as well. If your goal is to experience the high end (however you choose to define 'high end'. The definition isn't an absolute one but purely subjective), then your path will probably be far different than someone who isn't the least bit interested in that.<br />
<br />
Just a few things. IMO Run3 is invaluable even with Shrew coming down the pipe. Why? Because innate effects are ALWAYS better than casted effects (again, all things being equal) in terms of usefulness. Having a worn Truesight or Plainsight or Faerune effect on an item is far better than constantly having to cast the spell. At the very least, you save a buff slot (which, at the low 50s is pretty important since you don't have group versions of all your buffs yet). In the case of Faerune, that's THREE slots (max) you save (See invis, UV, Enduring Breath).<br />
<br />
And I have to agree with Discordja, Bane of Nife and Spirit of the Howler are not class defining spells. Useful? Hell yes! But I haven't yet been in an xp group where we invited a shaman for Bane or Pox. It's always been for Turgurs. But, overall I agree with Vazzkorr that it's probably a good idea to try to secure the spells in advance of getting the level. However, if his assertion was true (that you shouldn't get a level until you get the important spells for that level), I'm fairly sure there would've been tons of 59 Shaman when PoP came out cuz no one would want to level to 60 without Malo and Torpor. Now, Malos and Q seem to be for sale in Bazaar FAR more often than their level 60 counterparts so folks just figure they can blow through to 65 and then get the &quot;better&quot; versions of these spells.<br />
<br />
Foramorm, I think this boils down to your playstyle and how easy xp is to get for you. For me, I'm going to get Amorae 2 yellow into 51 then grind out the 6 AA for Baroness then plow through to 56 (already have Bane and Howler in bank) and grind out Venerable (+ Cann 5's points banked). Then, assuming I have Malo and Torpor by that time, grind it out to 60 (picking up Cann 5 at 59).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I want to thank everyone for their imput in helping me decide on this issue :)<br />
<br />
I think I am going to go run3 and maybe regen 3 early, then &quot;bumrush&quot; to 60 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I strongly disagree that levelling without your spells is pointless.<br />
<br />
When I first got to 65 I had none of my 65 spells, and very few of my 63/64 spells. Of course it's nice having the spells but even if I had the exact same spell lineup as a 62 shaman, I would still be more effective than them. Also, if you level first, then when you do get that elusive spell, you can scribe it and use it straight away.<br />
<br />
Plus, at 65, I get more group offers than I did at 62, and none of them have asked if I have any of my spells. I've also seen more spectrals and runes drop as a result.<br />
<br />
I never liked levelling without having my spells, but I wouldn't suggest it as a reason to stick around instead of levelling.<br />
<br />
Now, if there's other reasons, such as being able to group with friends, or being able to level in particular places, that's fine. But don't let the lack of spells hold you back if you really do want to level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well here is my take on things, and since you want personal experance this will not be tipical.<br />
<br />
I would say that as you level there will be time that you might just want to slow down a bit and run a exp split ( the most i have ran was 10real/90AA ). I am of the mind set of the get a couple spells of the lvl before or very soon after you get the level. but the spells you get depends on the playing style you have. as for getting the 65 malos/Q , I have a hard time comeing up with the cash to buy little more then food and water .... I have no clue how you all are getting the cash in the time that you report going from 55 or so to 65 exspecaly IF your going balls to the wall exp since in my exp the best experaince spots have the worst loot. <br />
<br />
now I got something like 55 or 56 before AA was put in and had pretty much stoped becouse I could nto even start to genarate the funds to Buy malo/torpor even if thay where there so getting lvl 60 would do very little for me sept decress the exp from the stuff i could kill. the only resone i made a run to 60 ( it touch 5 days to level from 56 to 60 solo for me when i put my nose in to it ) was becouse the guild I am in had no 60 shamans at the time and a copy of malo droped from a kunark dragon we just killed and was put at the first shaman to 60 would get it from the guild. I lost the race to the shaman that was lvl 59 at the start of my run by half a yellow exp. once I did get 60 I did go back to grinding AA and well I was getting about the same exp a kill at 60 as 56 but I was haveing to fight tougher mobs with a ton more HP and so I got less exp over time couse thay touch longer to kill with the exacet same spells available to me ( did not have pox ether couse i could not buy it or it would not drop for the guild ). I ended up getting a drop of malo on the next dragon kill i attended and I bought torpor with all of my savings and a small loan from a friend. and that was just becouse the person was selling it way below price. <br />
<br />
If i had to say one thing its take a look at the rate at which you have funds comeing in, IF you would ding 65 and would have made enough to buy Q or malos or both in that time if you just did a balls-to-the-wall run at 65 then yes it would be oks to run at it. IF not then reconsider how fast your going. A 65 with out any post 60 spells IS little more then a 60 with ~250 more HP and fewer places to hunt that give a decent exp rate. Just take what the people that are saying run at 65 from 51, thay ether started playing many expasions back and have taken a very long road to the place thay are and had the cash to buy about what all thay wanted, are alts of other caricters and had the cash to transfer that way, or did more in thouse lvles then just grind out exp so thay had the cash to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would find it hard to believe anyone could get to 62 without at least some of the 61 and 62 spells. They're so common and cheap in the bazaar now, even the more expensive ones are around 200pp.<br />
<br />
One thing I would say about getting to 65, if your gear is poor, you will die much quicker there than if you have good gear. I wouldn't recommend shooting up the levels without equipping yourself accordingly. Around 2000 hp, 900 ac unbuffed at level 60 should be the minimum.<br />
<br />
But, whatever anyone says, it's possible to get spells, to get gear without being in a big guild, without farming cash.<br />
<br />
I am not a very fast leveller (though not slow when I put my mind to it). I only play one char now, and I don't farm cash. I got to 65 mostly in pickup groups, and most of my gear has been looted in exp groups or bought by myself in the bazaar, mostly the latter. The exceptions are 2 bits of Wolf Caller's (where I lead the raids and was the only chain class present) and my epic (which I lead all of the raids for with my smallish guild), and my Hierophant cloak which was given to me by a dear friend who quit the game.<br />
<br />
I paid 40k for Torpor at 60 (or 61, not sure). I got Malo and Avatar researched by checking the bazaar frequently and being a little lucky with the rarer components. I got most of my 61/62 spells through ethereals I won in pickup groups.<br />
<br />
I got together the cash for torpor with some help from friends, selling stuff, exping in cash areas when I could rather than in PoP (Ykesha is great for this - slower exp, but much more cash). I sold some potions, particularly illusion potions when they were still new, and armour dyes. I traded a little bit, but not much - I'm not very good at that. I kept an eye on particular items that I wanted, and waited until the price was good.<br />
<br />
Looking back, I've spent a ton of cash on my character, and I can't really say exactly where all that cash came from, but it came.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you exactly how long it took me to do all this, but I made my shaman my main shortly after Ykesha came out (6 months ago?), when he was level 54, vastly upgraded his gear at that time (and since) and I got to 65 about a month ago.<br />
<br />
In short, it *is* possible to get to 65, be reasonably well equipped and have at least some of your key spells, and do so untwinked, on your own merit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I would find it hard to believe anyone could get to 62 without at least some of the 61 and 62 spells<br />
<br />
I think you could probably get all the way to 65 with just level 51 spells :)</div></div><hr />

I went to 62 before i put any exp to aa's. I don't regret it. It's nice to work aa's in zones that give you 1/2-3/4 of a blue aa xp per kill in a full group. As for spells...I never bothered with avatar(cudgel!), and decided to buy torpor finally at 63 over malo(frankly, I've yet to see a real need for malo yet as I don't raid..and malosinia is rarely resisted up to and through tier 3). The biggest spell to me was khuras at 60(which i picked up at level 58 i think it was, for 400 plat).<br />
<br />
And as far as basics..I would say innate metab is more useful to a shaman than 3 hp/tick regen. You'll thank yourself when you get a mount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Let's see.  I paused at level 56 to do Run3 and Regen3 (Baron title).  At around that time, I picked up a copy of torpor which abolished any thought I might have had about doing any more AA pre-60.  I levelled up to 60, scribed our class defining spells, then did another 24 AA (MC3, Canni5, VP1, RC1, SCR1) while I was farming some cash, doing some trade skills, etc.  Eventually, I had all my 61+62 spells and some of my 63-65 spells, so despite really wanting to finish SCRM, I switched back to 100% xp.  Currently about half way to 64.  In retrospect, if I were soloing more, I'd have seriously considered getting 61 prior to my big AA burst.  The pet is a much better tank.  As it was, I had a melee to do the tanking, so the 55 pet was ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">To all those who say burn thru to 65...your missing the point.

<br />
Damn I just hate all the newb/uber punks that have only ever powered up thru the levels.  At least half of  them don't even know how to properly play there characters, let alone undersrtand what a well played character can do.<br />
<br />
Sure if all you want is the Phat lewt and the title...go to 65 and join the punks.<br />
<br />
But myself, I like to try the class out, and challenge myself. <br />
<br />
If you power thru to 65 how will you ever know if you could solo a guardian wurm at 58...or solo some other mob at some other level.<br />
<br />
But I a have to say I am dissappointed in a lot of the responses.  Based on what I am seeing, I think some people here think there are only about 14 zones in the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I did my aa the best way I could. <br />
<br />
I was already 53ish when Luclin came out. And I bounced around picking up an AA here and there. I would aa some. And get a point then they new spells would call to me when I said well that didnt do too much. Then After a level ding It would be a long empty bar. So I would get an AA or two. Then again call of new spells...<br />
<br />
When I was leveling up I didnt have a chance at my level 60 spells. Except for guardian wyms. Over the 9 months to level 60 and like 40 AA's into level 60 I chased the unicorn of Torpor. 186 Guardian wryms (Or so) Died. Along with several trips to Jumpy and the protector at the end. (Once we had gotten more powerful.) With not a single  Useful shaman spell drop. <br />
<br />
I finally got the unicorn of Torpor by a friend completing the quest in the bazzar. You knwo the one where they accumalate enough plat to drown a dragon and toss it on some seedy looking gnome who sells watches used armour parts hubcaps and of course the Unicorn... (Sigh) <br />
<br />
So my path was Many many AA. I think it went like this.<br />
<br />
Level 53.<br />
Run speed 1 <br />
Regen 1<br />
<br />
Level 54<br />
Regen 2 and 3<br />
<br />
Level 55<br />
Run speed 2 and 3<br />
<br />
Level 56<br />
Critical nukes 1 (Grins) It worked witht he JBB. Nerfed the next day (Sigh)<br />
<br />
Natural Durability 1<br />
<br />
Level 57<br />
<br />
Natural Duability 2<br />
Mental clarity 2<br />
<br />
Level 58<br />
Mental clarity 3. (I think)<br />
<br />
Level 59<br />
Spell casting reinforcement 1<br />
<br />
Level 60 <br />
A metric buttload. Of aa<br />
<br />
PoP<br />
(First kill) Ding 61. Wow. Damn Everything is green Old world. This sucks.<br />
<br />
Two truckloads of AA While trying to get spells. And to get guild leveled. Spent Months in Bugs beetles in Justice.<br />
<br />
Level 62. Okay stopping here. I cant get any spectrals so Why bother. And Any higher and stuff starts to Light blue out in all the places I hunted. And I refuse to pass trials without a guild group. (Sounds of cracking whip and many many failed trials attempts.)<br />
<br />
I think I got to around 200 AA at level 62. Then they put in the xp changes. So I shot to level 65. (and we passed trials and got 97% of the guild xp flagged for tactics a month before trials requirements went away)<br />
<br />
Now at like 287 AA. Level 65. With most of my spells. Guild is progressing decently and LDoN will be a huge boost to my little guild of crazed malcontents. And I cant play due to Crash bugs that have destroyed my sanity Made me work on my PC for a week and worst of all I installed windows xp... (Noooo!)<br />

<br />
Oh I agree with you here. But, if you want to raid and do the big things, 65 certainly helps.<br />
<br />
I've played EQ since May 2000, I've levelled 2 chars beyond 60, and a few more alts to varying degrees. However, I know people who've played only a few months and are already level 60 or higher (how DO you level that fast without PLing or twinking, lol), and I agree they've missed out on large chunks of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Or you can stop at 51 and take 5-10 hours for an aa point .. in that same 5-10 hours you could also have leveled <br />
Dunno where you were leveling at 51, but it's pretty trivial to kick out an AA point ever 45minutes to 1hr at level 51. Same at 65. It doesn't make a lick of difference when you get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">With very few exceptions it's a better idea to level than to get aa unless you LIKE being level 61 forever (or lesser level).  I imagine most who advocate it are not 65 so do not really know what it's like.<br />
<br />
   Still, there are some arguments for brief asides into aa.<br />
<br />
   Run3.  This is obvious.  Some make an argument for just Run1, being faster than most mobs.<br />
<br />
   Regen3.  In the end 3 points of regen matter very little, I find it more convenient to get advanced metabolism 3.  In the long run it's better.<br />
<br />
   MC3 -&gt; Can V.  This is obvious.<br />
<br />
   SCM3.  It has been estimated that this saves you 10% mana on every spell you cast.<br />
<br />
   ---  When to save?<br />
<br />
   Run1 or 3 at level 51 if you really want it.<br />
   SCM3 at 55 if you really want it.<br />
   MC3-&gt; Can V 59-61 if you really want it (Can V is really good).<br />
<br />
   As was pointed about level 61 gets you the new pet which IS really nice.<br />
<br />
   --- ND1-3?<br />
<br />
   Don't get these early.  You gain hp, mana and spells via leveling vs just hp from this.<br />
<br />
   --- Why level 65 fast?  The level 65 spells are seriously good.  Once you hit 62+ you can get into tactics and roll for runes, or you can save up pp and buy spells in the bazaar.  A level 65 shaman can farm pp/loot (if desired) more effectively than a lower level shaman.<br />
<br />
   --- There are plenty of good xp spots for the level 65 shaman, albeit most in PoP.<br />
<br />
   --- Experience is better than theory.  If you are not a 65 shaman, I strongly suggest not debating these issues too much.  That's like a virgin giving advice about sex.<br />
<br />
<br />
   --- I could ramble on and on and on about hows and whys and options but I wanna go play EQ.  My advice, get 65, MAYBE get run1 or 3, MAYBE get can V first.  Then get level 65, then get hundreds of aa and good gear/pp for yourself and those you like to group with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Okay, i'm close to hitting 51 and wondering:<br />
<br />
Do I get run3, regen3 at 51....or do I wait until 60?<br />
<br />
Anyone have some imput or personal experince here?  Thanks.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it is situational.<br />
<br />
When I hit 51, I was in a comfortable zone (Dulak) where mobs were still DB and I could solo with ease while making a few plat (albeit the xp was slow, but I'm a casual player).  I am in a small guild, and most of my friends were lower level than me.  In my situation, I stopped, went full AA and picked up Run3 and Regen3, and even picked up MC1.  When my friends and guildmates started catching up, I went full XP again.  I'm 57 and will power through to 61 where I'll think about stopping for AA again to finish up MC3 and SCM3, then back to grinding for 65.<br />
<br />
If I was in a raiding guild, I think my approach would be different, but again, it's all situational.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like almost everything in this game, how easy or difficult it is to gain experience is very situational.  I play EQ just about every single day and usually for several hours at a time.  When I was in my low 50s it took me well over a week to get my three AAs for run three.  I was grouping with a ranger and a cleric in places like Seb and Chardok.  I wish I could have gotten three AAs in three hours, but it took me at least eight to ten times that long.  I REALLY hope it&#8217;s not the same when I get to level 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have gotten 3 aa's in a HoH or BoT group on a saturday afternoon-evening before, so I think you will be happy with the rate of aa exp at 65 if you feel like grinding it out.</div></div><hr />
