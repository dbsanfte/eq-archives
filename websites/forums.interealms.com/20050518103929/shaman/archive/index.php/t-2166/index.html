<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I played a free month of Dark age of Camelot and chose shaman, of course.  A shaman in DAOC was very similar to those in EQ.  But as a bonus I had......RES!!!! The problem was that  you get 4x as many request for res in DAOC as in EQ, but noone pays.  You are expected to go 20 min out of your way to go give someone a res who is 5 min away from his spawn.  And if you even ask for a payment they insult you.  And everyone solos in DAOC! People are loners in that game and dont like to talk to other people.  So if any of you ppl reading this have considered playing DAOC then don't.  I made mistake of counvincing 3 friends that DAOC was a super great game before i even played a week of it and they bought it too.  Oh and, noone plays healer in DAOC.  20 nonhealers for a single, semi-healer class.  Just a warning and had to get these complaints off my back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hehe, i remember a month before DAOC came out how everyone was raving about how it would kill EQ, how it was flawless, perfect, etc.  now theyre all back :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">When you copy a game to be nearly identical to your future main competitor, change a few things here and there, remove 90% of the content. You get: Dark Age of no Content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">High lvl shaman in DAoC have some serious problems.  They are one of the least played classes in Midgard and Mythic won't fix em.<br />
<br />
Yeah I played.  Started out in beta for a bit, then continued for about 3 months.  You see I'm now back playing EQ.<br />
<br />
One word sums up DAoC.<br />
<br />
Horrible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I only played for the free month but it was fun for only a while.  I couldn't handle the fact that so few ppl wanted to be social.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What server did you play on?<br />
<br />
I was on Galahad...all the people I met were pretty social.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I played for the free month.  Some neat things to it, but some things I hated.<br />
<br />
I really liked the way each class could specialize in one of 3 skill tree's (well, casters anyway).<br />
<br />
I really liked the way they worked tradeskills - just had to have the proper items &amp; kits, stand near a (forge, loom, whatever), and make items.  No combining in a kit, simply proximity to the forge - allowing use by a crowd.<br />
<br />
I didn't like that you could make so much money on NPC errands from trades - I had ...hmm.  about 20 gold, I think, in a couple of days.<br />
<br />
I really, really didn't like the bit about no global channels - I really think that has helped EQ so much, making it seem like a truly multiplayer game - even when you have to listen to jerks.  When I was out of the city, I felt like I was on a not so great single player game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My friends showed me DAoC after they had switched and cancelled their EQ accounts.  Honestly, I wasn't impressed.  The graphics were sup par to EQ i my opinion, the spell animations and particle effects are far from impressive, not to mention I hate PvP.<br />
<br />
I want to enjoy my gaming without worrying about the dumbass kew3 d00d with no life that like to hack and run around PKing everything in sight.  <br />
<br />
I would rather make friends and enjoy my online gaming, so I choose EQ.  (Not to mention the insane amount of time invested in my character!  Quit EQ and start all over again?  HAH!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I played for 2 months on Gawaine server - Hibernia Realm. (Elves).<br />
<br />
Suffice to say Hibernia is also known as ' Gimpbernia. '  Albion (King Arthur types) is very strong. A lot of RvR (The most exciting part of the game imo) boils down to numbers.<br />
<br />
Trade skills are better to a point. When trying for some of the higher and more difficult items you can take up to 2 MINUTES for a single combine. The fact that you get your stuff back is a big plus but darn you have to be watching a movie or reading a book (I did) while doing tradeskills)<br />
<br />
Mythic is still working the bugs out of the game.  Rangers (A class that can stealth (go invisible)), have been nerfed to high heaven.<br />
<br />
Tweety (yes THAT Tweety) had a big hand in development from what I have heard. Problem is she was more of a guide and was not a hard core player.<br />
<br />
WoW hired Tigole. I think that's a good move, as long as all content isn't aimed at 24/7 players.<br />
<br />
What it boiled down to for me was this: All of these games are whack-a-mole.  If I am going to play whack-a-mole I am gonna do it with already developed toons.<br />
<br />
Suffice to say - 40 to 50 in DAoC makes 51-60 look like a walk in the park.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&lt;49 shm on err some server, i seem to have some selective amnesia from daoc :) <br />
****ty game, zero class balance, zero content :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What I couldn't stand in DAoC:<br />
<br />
- Leveling in EQ is less tedious, wich should give an idea about DAoC. You gain mana/hp back much faster than EQ but then again, you got to kill more mobs than in EQ. Something that already was tedious, has become even more tedious. A really bad leveling treadmill. Oh and 40-50 take the cake. Mythic even gives you skill points halfway through a hell level.<br />
- Your gear suddenly becomes utter crap because you just leveled. Instead of using a system with recommended levels to curve twinking, no, let's make more parts of the game tedious!<br />
- The Gizmo Sword of Uberness you looted last week, just broke.<br />
- Original non EQ gameplay like: you got this class that has dots, snare dot, summons pet, can haste/buff pet, has life taps, has some debuffs too and it's a robed caster. Where have I seen that before?<br />
- Learning curve for EQ players: 0. Even the interface is the same goddamn thing.<br />
- PvP is like Gankos Zek: levels and numbers all that count, 0 strategy. In the early days the rangers were broken in PvP, then AE stun/mez casters, now the rogues.<br />
- What to do at level 50? Not much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hail All,<br />
<br />
DAoC just didn't have the scale like EQ does.  I felt confined and restricted. Trade Skills weren't nearly as enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My friend who still plays daoc made a really funny but true comment about what he hates about daoc trade skills.<br />
<br />
The worst thing about these trade skills is I wish I could fail faster.<br />
<br />
That is a very odd statment to make but he like eq tradeskills better because even though it was really tedious if you had all the parts you could fire through combines quickly. He said there is nothing worse than trying to skillup when it takes 2 minutes or more per combine.<br />
<br />
Kaid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Couldn't agree with Blacklace more.  Balancing/content/etc was horrible.<br />
<br />
As a rogue type(lvl 37 shadowblade) I could sneak up to someone, backstab them and not even do near the damage that an archer did from range.  And archers got stealth like I did.<br />
<br />
Tell me how balanced that was.<br />
<br />
Ok..off my soap box now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Something else not mentioned in here is Concentration points.  I don't know about you, but sometimes I just run around buffing people.  In DAoC that is not possible because for each buff you cast, you use a Concentration point.  Till it wears off or you cancel it.  And most of the buffs are group only.<br />
<br />
I played a Dwarven Runemaster in DAoC for almost 4 months.  Got him to level 21.  Had over 400 in Tailoring and the supporting tradeskills were over 125 or so.  Tradeskills in DAoC take a lot of freaking time.  You figure at 400 I was spending close to 2 minutes on 1 item, and then you realize that the skill level goes to 1000 or more now.  Geesh.<br />
<br />
And I disliked the fact that the whole game was geared towards PvP.  People seemed to forget that danger does not always come from without.  Sometimes you need to deal with the dangers within the boarders as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Played a month then cancelled my account.  It sucked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I played DAoC for a bit. I think my little Shaman got to 20 before I went on Christmas vacation and eventually back to EQ.<br />
<br />
I didn't mind the PvE part of the game but I almost always played as a duo with my boyfriend so the lack of channels etc. didn't really affect me. If I did find myself solo'ing there were always tradeskills, even got up to around 400 in armorcrafting. <br />
<br />
The PvP part...ick. We once went out into the &quot;frontier&quot;, just once. Two level 20 Trolls within view of the gate got slaughtered by a level 40+ Albion stealthy something or other with large poisoned daggers. That I didn't like too much. Not that I died, I expected that, but more that so many players thought that hiding and attacking the weakest person they could find was &quot;honorable&quot; (as was claimed on numerous message boards).<br />
<br />
I didn't mind the game too much. Had its good and bad points but with my gaming time limited and friends beckoning in EQ I had to make a choice...so here I am :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I remember the game store guy telling me that everyone stopped playing EQ and are playing DAOC. <br />
<br />
Gee that's funny there are currently 430,000 people playing EQ. <br />
<br />
How many are playing DAOC still?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah, I played a thane for 42 levels in daoc... It was somewhat of an ok game, until you got high level and then the only content is to play musical keeps with the other realms... *yawn*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">oh I thought the PvP aspect was awesome, but there really wasn't a point to it.<br />
<br />
And speaking of dangers in the borders.  An albion archer by the name of Wink got inside the Midgard realm once.  Was sniping all the lowbies near Audilten.  One of our higher lvl shadowblades took him out, but not before he had sniped around 15 or 20 people.  Think I have the screenshots somewhere.<br />
<br />
Anyway, long story short...I liked the pvp part of the game(before they neutered rogues), but the PvE sucked..bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">/sigh<br />
<br />
I left for DAoC, and I am back.  I really enjoyed many parts of the game, PVP was AWESOME before &quot;the Zerg&quot; (TM).   No daubt DAoC had great potential and promise.  There were many, many things I really liked about it (no CR, many more rezzing classes, better, usfull tradeskills, etc), but, alas, there were many things that just ruined the game for me in the long run ( i guess this is where Zorlac can trump a bit &quot;TOLD YA SO&quot;, and it would be deserved).  One of the most anoying parts for me was that PvE lacked all taktic.  There was pretty much one way to skinn the cat and that was it.  For a shaman (and I played one to lev 41) this meant: bolt, root, bolt, dot, melee.  No room for deviation, and if only one of the components failed, you were toast.  In EQ, I have many, many more ways of dealing with mobs, Root - Rot, Pet kite, bracer-melee etc, and if something does not work, I always have a chance to root the mob and high tail out of the mess.  Oh, did I metion that you pretty much have no way of casting once a mob is in melee with you?  Pretty much, if a blue mob jumps you = you are DEAD.<br />
<br />
PvP was fun and heartpounding (I also leveld a skald to 49) but with population imbalance (this is where the feared Albion Zerg comes in), it too was loosing my interest fast.  Well, I am back in<br />
EQ, on a new server (RN) and I am having a blast =)<br />
