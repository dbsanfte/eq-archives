<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried it this morning to get my last flesh.  1% exp per kill, mediocre loot, mobs nearly as tough as the elementals in Nadox.<br />
<br />
2 slows, 2 vos, plus constant melee with pet and me tanking.  had aego and kei, and each mob would drop me down to 60 hp/m roughly.  each mob runs at 19 life, and since the spawns are so close together, you either had to agro right away and draw way back, or root.  they're more resistant than most other mobs this lvl, so sometimes landing root is a problem.  about 2 of 3 mobs pulled ended up agro'ing something else, leaving me with two mobs to fight for a short period of time.  considering i had well over 3000 hp, wielding soulstripper, and 1000 ac, doesn't seem like the xp and loot is worth the reward.<br />
<br />
but when all was said and done, i came out with my 6 flesh drops.  just thought i'd give my take on it, so you all didn't have to waste time being &quot;curious&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a general rule I normally dont let many mobs in LoY, unless they are very low dark blue/light blue get through a fight without a malo on them of some sort, especially with runners. If i'm in tight quarters i'll sometimes chain root them to be safe. <br />
<br />
Also seen that torn cloth eyepatch thing drop off mobs in there as well. (int caster face item).</div></div><hr />
