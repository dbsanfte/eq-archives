<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've got myself camped out in the Blood of Chottal room in Seb.<br />
I want to try killing the Emperor a few times, to see if I can get any level 59/60 spells drop.<br />
I know he's a 60 necro, and his pet is blue to me.<br />
I think his max damage hit is about 170, but I can't remember.<br />
I also know he will gate only if you fight him too far away from his spawn point, so I'll be fighting him just outside the door to his room.<br />
I'm pretty sure I'll be using a pet, but is there any good reason why I shouldn't?<br />
Does anyone know if Emp runs?<br />
<br />
Now, what I'm not sure of is what the best tactic would be to pull him.  Regardless of which method I pull, I plan to be Torporing myself before the pull, so I have a pseudo-rune up.<br />
<br />
I've got the fear undead necklace, which I'm sure won't affect him due to his level, but should be able to fear his pet so I don't need to worry about it on the pull.  I'd just have Emp to deal with, by casting turgur, then malo, and chaining turgur until it sticks.  When pet returns, slow it, and kill it before concentrating on Emp.<br />
<br />
Another option I'm thinking of is similar to the above, is trying to pull the pet with Paralying Earth in hopes it sticks with a long lasting root.  At that point deal with Emp same way as above, and then the pet when/before root breaks.<br />
<br />
Another option I'm thinking is  pulling Emp with Turgur, and hoping it sticks on the first pull.  If it does, I'll be laughing, and I just have to slow the pet.  If it doesn't stick, that's where things get tougher, as I'll have him and his pet both on me unslowed.<br />
<br />
Another option I'm thinking is Torporing myself then pulling Emp with Malo, and then trying to slow.  I have to deal with him and his pet unslowed at first, but I've got a much better chance to land Turgur on my first slow attempt, or any attempts at rooting him to CC.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated from people that have done this already, or thinking about doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drydon - Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am pretty sure the Emperor runs when low hp (I am certain that Blood does).  Fearing pet may get you adds that you dont want to deal with.  <br />
<br />
Doing the initial break with Emp up will be tough.  If he isn't up, pull him before he makes his pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya.  Getting him before he gets a pet will make it loads easier.<br />
<br />
I won't have a problem with adds though from fearing his pet, because a level 60 character can solo pull the entire area.  The biggest thing to worry about would be the pet pathing all the way to the crypt, and aggroing the ICGs.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pull him with either turgurs or malo, I can land turgurs on him at lvl 59 about half the time when pulling him for a group with it, so ya have a good chance at landing it...malo and then turgurs would prolly be safer though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Have I misread this or are you talking about your own pet pathing here? If so why dont you use /pet guard somewhere safe then use Summon Companion to bring him to you then hit /pet guard again before he buggers off back to his old guard point.<br />
<br />
Or is there some reason this would not work? Or are you talking about some other pet? Never fought there so just checking</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think he means the emperor's pet (emp is a necro) fear pathing strangely. Using a pet here yourself would be ill advised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>noodleghost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you plan on fearing his pet I wouldnbt recomend the pet at all, they wont chain agro on you cause of your level but they WILL chain agro on the pet cause the pet is agroed also. If you dont fear then a pet might be nice for some extra damage but could be a handicap as well depending on respawn in the immediate area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>katranna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I play in Emp room alot. I dont think you can solo him..<br />
He spawns maybe ones out of 8 phes... If you dont have kodiaks on you will run out of mana. He runs off aswell since you cant<br />
root him if you dot our dots take of root.. You can root his pet <br />
mabye. I would love to see it dont but i really dont think so..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Pull with a low aggro spell. If you get summoned into that room you are dead.<br />
<br />
He  sometimes  tries to run. I'm not sold on the &quot;Fight him in the door&quot; theory. It works, but I have seen him turn to run only to get caught by snare or root.  Plus if you fight him with dogdog in the door - man that is awful close to the first skellies.<br />
<br />
Can you solo him? Yes. It's been done before by a 60 Shaman.  Heck with dogdog up and Emperor slowed (you're right he hits for about 170) you have to worry about 2 things: putting out 32k ( I ' think ') of damage; and what happens when he starts to run. <br />
<br />
Good luck. Don't think you'll need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First of all, mobs don't start to summon until you've done a bit of damage to them, so as long you don't use a nuke/dot to pull, it doesn't matter how much agro you get, you won't be summoned.<br />
<br />
His pet has around ~2000 hps, so basically just park him somewhere near the door away from the Emp's room, and it'll die after 2 epics. He doesn't really represent a problem.<br />
<br />
The Emp himself, unless recently buffed, doesn't have too much hps, around 20k if I remember correctly. It's a necro, so prepare to have Ignite Blood casted on you, which is quite annoying since it's 99.999% unresistable and does ~1200 damage in 90ish secs. His hits are rather low, 178 I think, and doesn't quad as far as I can remember. His pure melee damage output is lower than Yeldema.<br />
<br />
He *may* run while low on health, personally I had him rooted for the last 10% of the fight. Yes, I took more damage that could have been avoided, but having him flee through the door, then gate, is something that should be prevented at any cost.<br />
<br />
A pet is a must, it increases your damage potential by quite a bit, and that shortens the fight considerably. <br />
<br />
A few things you may want to look into:<br />
<br />
- Banshee Aura, you may wanto dispell it. It'll kill the pet *eventually*.<br />
- Pet pathing. The pathing in the room's pretty bad, make sure your pet doesn't get close to the doors leading towards the crypt, he may agro the mobs out there.<br />
- Pet positioning. Watch where your pet is pushing him, you'll have to adjust from time to time to make sure he remains between the coffin and *his* door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sleesak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hello all,<br />
     I spent the last week in the 4 room/Emperor camp in Seb.  I dinged 60 and we were trying to get some 60th lvl spells to drop.  We camped 4r/emp with me, 60 cleric and a 60 rogue.  It was a good camp, but we invised to each room to avoid fighting the Crypt Guardians.<br />
     Like everyone mentioned, the Emp does in fact run.  We had no real problems killing him, except when he gated a couple of times on us (bad CR down there).  He tried to gate a lot, so the cleric was chain stunning him.  I had not heard about fighting him near the door to his lair, so I will have to try that.  He gated on us when he was near the Blood of Chottle spawn point, and when he tried to run outside of the Blood of Chottle room into the hallway.<br />
     I buffed MR, PR and DR before fights, which seemed to help.  Our 60lvl cleric could single pull him, as mentioned.   I could land Turgurs fairly well, but need to disease debuff if I wanted to land Pox of Bertox.  Bane of Nife seemed to land nicely.  I would slow, try malosini, annul magic (he has a DS), epic dot and bane of nife, then JBB him.<br />
     This past weekend we had him spawn 5 times in a row (making up for the past week when he was not up too much).  First time he dropped Mala, but second time he dropped Mala and Malo).<br />
     In that time I've only seen the Arch Duke spawn twice, the first time he dropped the JBB for me tho!<br />
     Good luck with soloing the Emp.  I'm not sure I'd try that hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As I type this, I'm sitting in Blood of Chottal room waiting for the 4 th spawn.  I've gotten 3 blood PH, 1 emp ph, and 2 Emporers.  Pulling the Emporer before he summons a pet, using malo, works wonderfully.  I have had a pet up.  He does run on low health.  He runs when his health is at &quot;em&quot; roughly.  So far I got 2 copies of Aegis of Ro, 1 nathsar crapsword, and a rod of lamentation.  Not bad so far...  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Woot Juujuu! I know where I'm going next lvl (had torpor since lvl 54 but still need malo).  Only...6...more...blues...</div></div><hr />

How do you keep the Emp from gating?  Is it true he will not gate when you fight him near the door to his lair?<br />
<br />
Also, which dots are you stacking on him?  Bane and epic?  Just wondering if you tried Pox of Bertoxx, and JBBing him.<br />
<br />
Very impressive.  <br />

<br />
heh, I was thinking /pet hold would be a nice skill for here.<br />
<br />
I have problems with dogdog running off ahead when things cast on me... desite spamming pet back off.<br />
<br />
I think I might have to go down and try it sometime for myself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I solo'd him for 8 hours straight and got my malo. I thought I was real lucky. Anyway he will not gate if you fight him at the door to his room. I found that my slow sticks pretty easily on Emporer at lev 60. Emporer tend to cast often so even if you get resist on initial pull, you can cast again pretty easily. If anything, the pet is more annoying, always interrupting you. My AC was around 1100, had torpor, can5, and around 2700hp self buff.<br />
<br />
I only used pet for the fights where Emporer had his pet up. My buffed pet (including avatar) could solo the emporer's slowed pet, while I concentrated on the emporer himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I timed the fights so I'd pull the Emporer right as he popped before he summoned his pet.<br />
<br />
If you fight him at the door, he won't gate.<br />
<br />
I have one of those right click instant snare items from the caller quests in FG.  VERY USEFUL for when root doesn't hold on Emp.<br />
<br />
I would pull with malo, and I had 1 resist on any remaining slows.<br />
<br />
I debuffed is DR and poxxed and epicced him until he's at about 1/3 health.  At that point I'd use Bane as well.  He only started running when his health was at &quot;Em&quot;.  I had my pet summoned the whole time.  I had to epic him about 6 times, bane about 3, reslow once, and bane once, with a few JBB bursts.  Most of my combat was wincing and torporing, and just letting dots and pet work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Nice work juujuu! GL on gettin ya spells :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Raytes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The Emperor is a pretty basic fight. I was surprised how easy it was actually and I have killed the Emperor solo 5 times now. Best tactic I have found is to pull the pet with slow, then malo and slow the emp. He will cast on you during this time so no fear of being interrupted. Get your magic resistance up so he can't stun you with that Invoke Fear2 spell he throws around. One Bane and one Jbb blast on the pet and it is dead. Then just take the emp to town like you would Yeldema. Conserve mana and torpor yourself constantly. <br />
<br />
He will gate if you fight him outside of the two torches next to his door. Also of note, he WILL run so keep him rooted.<br />
<br />
I have solo'd all of 6r (minus the 2 ICGs which aren't worth the energy expended in killing them) and it is a very nice place to hunt. Hire a rogue to run down from guard and pick the lock every few minutes and you're set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am thinking of trying this when I ding 60.  I am not in a guild, and have only Focus of my 60 spells.<br />
<br />
I have a good friend (60 monk) we both have our epics.  I figure we would destroy this camp, single pulling the room, and fight this joker at his spawn point.<br />
<br />
The question is can we kill all these mobs, and the emperor with a 60 shaman and a 60 monk?  Keep in mind I have my epic, we both have fungi, and I have a jbb. <br />
<br />
Also, where exactly is the locked door?  Can you do the 4 rooms without a rogue, or do you need a rogue everytime you try emperor...<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Raytes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">60 shaman and 60 monk would do well down there. I have duo'd it with a 60 monk before and its fairly easy.<br />
<br />
As for fighting the emp on his spawn point, I would strongly recommend that you not do that. The guards in his room cannot be single pulled and they are tough. Best strat is to single pull the emp and fight him just outside his room so he doesn't gate.<br />
<br />
Locked doors: there is one at the guard camp that obviously gives you access to the crypt with the 4 rooms and the two ICGs. The other locked door is right before Blood and Emp room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So once you are inside the Blood room, you are good to go?<br />
<br />
Is there a place a 60 could actually camp in there and come back safely?<br />
<br />
Is the emperor soloable without torpor or malo?  Sounds like most are saying slow isnt a problem.  I would probably not use a pet, go with something like...<br />
<br />
Slow, Root, Epic, Env Breath, Plague, JBB<br />
<br />
Bring some clarity potions, and some stinging wort potions, I would like it to be somewhat safe.<br />
<br />
Also, any merit to pulling emp by rooting his pet?<br />
<br />
Just wondering if I can set up camp in these two rooms, killing the two spawns.  Also is the door openable from the inside?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Raytes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The chances of doing Emp without Torpor is slim to slimmer. I would be very surprised if someone could do this and not resort to using potions. <br />
<br />
Yes once you are in the Blood room you can camp out safely since the blood spawn will not aggro you unless you step inside its coffin.<br />
<br />
The Emp is a spell-caster and thus will cast on you non-stop for the first few seconds of the fight. Why bother pulling him with slow when you can slow the pet first THEN worry about the emp while he is wasting his mana on you?<br />
<br />
One more thing to note is that the Emp is no pushover although he does get easier once you figure your strat out. He hits in the high 200s to low 300s and hits really fast, and also has a badass pet that can wreak havoc on you if you don't take care of him.</div></div><hr />
