<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=8114<br />
<br />
or Mask of War<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=25024<br />
<br />
What would you choose?  Also are there any better droppable masks out there that gives better HP,MANA,WIS,AC?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would pick the Death Mask of the Elysians over the other 2 (mask of war, artificer mask).  I'm always fighting to get my PR and DR as high as my other resists.</div></div><hr />

And on dr/pr, the funny thing is, my dr is my best resist, pr's not really that far behind =(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have the deathmask myself, pretty easy to get with a group in umbral. Druids hunting Elysian remains leave the corrupted alone because it summons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ah, corrupted drops that.  Btw he also drops a nice mantle that would be worth wearing, 15 ac good stats, hps, mana, resists, etc.</div></div><hr />

I wore crystal spider eyes over the mask of war as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Death Mask IMHO, one of the best droppable masks around; I currently use Crystal Spider Eyes (another good choice); I currently worship at the altar of Ac/hit points, and every little bit helps. Plus as others have said, pluses to poison/disease are hard to come by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">so compared to other tradeable masks, how much would you be willing to pay for a death mask?  saw one in the bazaar for 7.5k on Drinal, wasn't sure if it was worth it or not.. (only have 3k to spend anyhow)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Check out the crystal spider eyes, not quite as nice as a Dmote, but very close and a LOT cheaper.</div></div><hr />

Seen them for 9k to 12k on Brell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I got my death mask for 6k on Drinal.  I was lucky to get a shroud too, but I looted that one.<br />

Corrupted is a meanie.  He rooted and dotted our puller.  Which was hilarious.  Have a nice high MR when you go after him.</div></div><hr />

I bought it mainly for the Invis, but I drop under 1100ac if I wear it instead of my DMotE.  I don't think the extra stats are worth losing the ac.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I currently wear an Enshrouded Veil (pretty much equal to spider eyes in my...uh...eyes), and want to upgrade to a DMotE.  Monk friend of mine got one in part of an ODS trade, and it annoyed me.  :p<br />
<br />
It's funny how the monk and I are shooting for the same gear.  I want the mask he's wearing, we both want hardened grey flesh sleeves, we both wear clattering bone necklaces, and I want to get some barbed dragonscale boots (which he has already).  So much for leather/chain classes, eh?  ;)</div></div><hr />
