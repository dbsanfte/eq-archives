<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, it's a lost cause... about to give up here.<br />
<br />
Pisses me off that the wording was &quot;a limited number&quot; of open beta accounts.<br />
<br />
Losing faith in Blizzard already :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im almost through, just gotta be persistent and keep spamming the submit button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">YES!! Got my CD key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Fileplanet now says all open beta keys are gone.<br />
<br />
What a royal crock of flamin ****.  Blizzard well may have lost my money on this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Is fileplanet the only way to get an Open Beta key?  I know that they were heavily involved in the Stress tests, etc.<br />
<br />
Any chance of getting a key from Blizzards website or somewhere else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i wait all day sitting and trying to refresh hoping that they have keys up, now i get screwed because i couldnt refresh the sites quick enough or i kept getting errors. g o d damnit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Blizzard is supposed to release more on their website when the FP ones are used up.  Too bad their site is down right now, at least for me.  I need to make an account with my newly acquired CD-key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you can't play for free (for 2 weeks) you wont pay them to play (for xxx months)?<br />
<br />
hmmm...<br />
<br />
Besides, you'll get a key directy from Blizzard.  visit their website when it is back up and running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">W.T.F ?<br />
<br />
Limited? LIMITED ? WHY?<br />
<br />
This is supposed to be the ultimate stress test where they bring up all the servers online to see just how well they can handle the heat. Why limit ppl from playing in the open beta? <br />
Man this angers me :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Serious question: CAn i still get into the ST and pay 7 bucks to play? I hate FP like hell but i wanna play this so bad now :(<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Direct signups through Blizzard are working now. I just signed my brother up and logged in using the account I JUST now created.<br />
<br />
The first round through Fileplanet was to slowly open the floodgates. There are plenty of open beta keys left it would seem.<br />
<br />
1) Start HERE.<br />
2) Scroll to the bottom and click &quot;I Agree&quot;<br />
3) Enter the key &quot;BLIZRD-BETA-ONLINE-OPEN-PUBLIC&quot; (it's at the top of the page, but in your morning bleary eyed haste, you may miss it :)).<br />
4) Enter the dynamic security code<br />
5) Complete the signup with your info<br />
6) Enjoy!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">BTW, they stopped giving out keys sometime yesterday from what I could tell.  So yes, this was still a closed &quot;open&quot; beta.  If you waited until after the download was done to create an account, you were in bad shape.</div></div><hr />

Thought you had to create an account to start the DL? At least I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nope, I made my account about a third of the way through the download (about 10 hours in, sheesh).</div></div><hr />
