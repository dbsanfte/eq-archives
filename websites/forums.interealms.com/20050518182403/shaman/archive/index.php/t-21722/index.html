<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of the things that all casters and mellee have had a problem with is how should spells be distributed.  Little recap of how things have been done so far.<br />
<br />
Original EQ<br />
Priest could buy their spells, all of them.<br />
Pure casters could buy all of their spells up to lvl 16 or so, then could only buy certian ones and had to make their others from drops.<br />
<br />
Kunark<br />
Some spells were sold, some were drops, and some you got in return for turning in others.  Some spells were rare....ok thats not quite right, they were RARE!  And spell quests for 4 or so classes.<br />
<br />
Velious<br />
Some spells were sold, most were drops, all were very common in comparison to Kunark spells Except for the Ancients which were beefed up versions of other spells for the more uber out there and were no drop.  And a spell quest or two for wizards.<br />
<br />
Luclin<br />
Some spells were sold, most were drops.  Some had rare drop rates, and some were in questionable places.<br />
<br />
PoP<br />
Some spells were sold, when pop came out the ones that were sold were no drop if I remember.  Three tiers of quests for spells in which you hand in an item and got a random spell out of that tier, unsure if some were weighted more than others but for all we know was totally random.<br />
<br />
LoY<br />
Each class gets 2 spells, both spells require a quest to get.  <br />
<br />
LDoN<br />
Purchase the spells with the gratitude you get from the wayfarers brotherhood.  Included was a spell from luclin that it was felt more people needed.<br />
<br />
Gates<br />
Spells randomly drop off of named mobs and afaik rare.  Spells are no drop.<br />
<br />
I think we need to help SoE figure out a good way to distribute spells in the next expansion, there have been problems with all of the above ways.  In some cases true hardcore legitimate problems, and in others well people just liked to complain.<br />
<br />
A couple points I think that spells distribution should follow.<br />
<br />
Spells that Make a class should be easy to obtian, if its a spell where if you don't have it you can't do your job and therefore your not going to get groups in that expansion well there should be a way for you to get it very simply.<br />
<br />
If its a spell that is rather nice for you to have and is not 70% necassary then you should earn it, but also being able to buy it from other players is perfectly acceptable.<br />
<br />
If its a slightly beefed up version of a spell thats out there and it really doesn't add all that much to you, but its really cool to have just to have it haveing it no drop and off of a tough mob sounds fine since 90% of the players aren't really going to care.  The ancient spells from Velious is a good model for that.  The ancient spells from gates IS NOT.<br />
<br />
The above 3 points are just my opionion, whats yours?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I agree totally. In our case the heals and any future slows should be on the easier scale to get, but buffs and dots harder to get (but not impossible for most players) and the Uber spells  Ancient stuff should be limited to the top end.<br />
<br />
It never fails to amaze me that sony dont look after the &quot;casual&quot; user base better. These are the people that use the least physical resouces, and probably give them the least amount of community grief. Doing the spell drops like this would cater to both ends the casual players (myself included) would get the spells that they need to get into groups, and yet the oposite spectrum the hardcore raiders would get the chance to get the top end ones.<br />
<br />
Having said that I also like the ldon points system. yes the dungeons get repetative, but the idea is very good. People can work at their own pace with a set goal, knowing that if they complete enough adventures they will get the object of their desires.<br />
<br />
Maybe there would be some way of combining the two so that you can use one of two methods for getting the spells kill mobs for drops, or from general exping in the new expansion gain credits for buying the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spells that define a class should be more difficult to obtain.  More power = harder to get, simply put.  There is absolutely no reason to make cookie cutter shaman or any class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If more difficult means more points, then I agree.  But putting them in a zone that 90% of the players can not access or survive in is stupid.  <br />
<br />
LDoN is a good idea, if they would tweak it, it could be a great way to make most players happy.  You earn your gear and spells and pay more for the &quot;better&quot; stuff.  As has been said in other threads, they need more themes, more dungeons, and more dynamic content.  Would not hurt to let you spend all your points anywhere, zone restrictions seem to be more of a nuisance than a good way to spread the load.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, again, SoE just needs to keep the casual players in mind for all aspects of the game, spells included, and in their next expansion should get away from the formula that makes 95% of the expansion content intended for 5% of the player base.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spent another 20+ hours farming Vxed this weekend only to see upteen Druid/SK/BST spells drop and not one useful spell for those in the group. This is a problem.<br />
<br />
Clawmarks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I love quested spells when I can do them solo, but that means getting them 10 levels after the level of the spell and that won't be possible in Omens of War.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm....how about this:<br />
<br />
Solo/group style spells, basically the spells we currently have, are bought/dropped/quested in a reasonable manner.<br />
<br />
Ancient/uber stuff that the casual player will NEVER see should be spells that are geared towards us high end raiders. Make them raid mgb buffs maybe? I don't know exactly, but something like that...something thats useful in time/god+ for large groups of people.<br />
<br />
In this way, the shaman class is defined at a basic level. Solo/group/small guild players get everything they need, and everything that defines a shaman. So stuff like dots, slows, heals, buffs, pet, thats all the basics, and everyone should get them with some effort. The high end shaman would need to get stuff that actually helps: slows &amp; debuffs maybe that scale based on size of the raid. ie, more people = less cast time/refresh time, work as innate MGB, etc.<br />
<br />
The problem is, we're all given the same list of spells, so everyone expects to have and use them all at some point....but the dynamic of the game shows thats just not how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spells that define a class should be more difficult to obtain. More power = harder to get, simply put. There is absolutely no reason to make cookie cutter shaman or any class.<br />
How do you make this apply to melee too, though?  Warriors need to get a rare drop to be able to use 1hs, another to be able to dual-wield, yet another for defensive?  You'd have to make everyone earn their core abilities under this model.  Would be kind of neat, but I think EQ is way too far down the cookie-cutter path now to turn back.  That being the case, I do think the core abilities of a class should be more readily available than the more fun or showy ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Make then all vendor bought (very expensive) but make it random as to whether or not the vendor will actually give you the spell after you click &quot;buy&quot;.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Proposed Changes<br />
Hey folks,<br />
<br />
I wanted to give you all an update on what we are planning for the coming weeks as we work on some persistent in-game issues.  We know that many of you are concerned with the current state of the game and we feel confident that the changes we have planned will help to alleviate many of your concerns.  <br />
<br />
First on our plate, and number one on your list of concerns, is collision in EverQuest.  We are working hard to fix the current problems with collision and have many fixes currently on Test.  We will most likely be pushing these collision fixes to the Live servers tomorrow, June 3rd at 3AM PDT.  Many of the current issues appear to be resolved with this latest push and our programmers are still working hard to track down and fix any remaining issues.  For those of you on Test, thanks very much for your help in getting these issues to Grumbak.<br />
<br />
We are also scheduling out many other fixes, with the first round going to the Test server this week, and subsequent rounds as the changes are made.  Currently planned to hit Test this week are the following proposed changes;<br />
 <br />
- Add a quest to allow the exchange of Gates of Discord spells.<br />
- Correct an issue with the berserker epic quest that left some berserkers unable to complete the quest.<br />
- Improve the Eagle Eye spell series.<br />
- Increase the spawn rate of the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.<br />
- Change berserker snare to have a set duration.<br />
- Correct the pathing in Txevu.<br />
 <br />
Please remember that this is only the first round of planned changes and there are many more to come.  As more changes are rolled out to the Test server, I will post them.  Please feel free to discuss these changes on the EQ forums at eqforums.station.sony.com.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all of your feedback this past week.  You have shown, once again, what a strong community EQ has, thank you for being an active part of it!<br />

<br />
Hopefully this will mean a return to some more acceptable spell system than &quot;Totally Rare Totally Luck&quot;. Personally, I like the Etheral-Spectral-Rune method, as long as the spells are tradable. <br />
<br />
Great post, great thread.</div></div><hr />

Why not augments or special skills?<br />
<br />
AA's as a drop or quest. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sounds like we are about to get raped for our spells again.... Adding a quest to make spells tradeable?  What is that,  if you do happen to get a no-drop spell you can go do a quest and then be able to trade it?  I have a bad feeling about this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;Add a quest to allow the exchange of Gates of Discord spells.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damned if you do, Damned if you don't?<br />
<br />
And really, why does it have to be a quest?  Afaik there's already a timesink involved in the spells dropping in the first place, is there now going to be a timesink in getting them to market?  I imagine that the purpose of that may be to keep the spells within guilds doing the content rather than haveing them hit the bazaar, but eventually they will hit the bazaar at a markup like we have not yet seen before.<br />
<br />
Anyway though, I put in the thread to discuss ways it has been done and I'm hopeing to hear the points that the most people can agree on and perhaps a way to implement it.  I know I'm saying &quot;Hey lets do the devs job for them.&quot; but hey, we're the ones who will be buying the game why not see if we can get Our Vision put in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmm, when I read 'exchange' of GoD spells, I thought that meant you visit an npc with a no-drop pally spell, and exchange it for a no-drop shaman spell or whatever - Not that the spells could be made droppble to sell to other players.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Thats how I read it. Just like kunark hand ins were.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">IMO Kunark spells were PERFECTLY organized as per the description above IF they had simply managed to make the spells drop equally for each class.  I'm not sure how many remember, but they ADMITTED that the shaman (and wizard, I believe) spells were so ridiculously rare compared to the other class spell drops because of an error in their programming.   While other classes (clerics, enchanters, specifically) saw every one of their 60 spells dropping like candy.<br />
<br />
Some sold, most dropped and quested.  That's the way to do it, as long as you don't end up screwing a few classes because of shoddy programming.</div></div><hr />

One is for Nihil and one is for Daluda.<br />
<br />
They could put the spells on a merchant in abysmal now and it wouldn't make any difference at all. <br />
Next step is probably to put the spells automatically in your spellbook once you hit 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i have my ancient canni but not the new heal yet. its *almost* funny</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Doesn't seem to me that actually making it so you can get your spell versus the 75th copy of a beastlord spell for your efforts is exactly filling your spellbook upon dinging, but maybe that's just me.  I think it's a decent change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If i could decide i would make class defining spells AA spells like Can5. That means that everyone CAN get them, but they have to strive for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The basic set of spells should be available for everyone very easily, purchaseable, common drops in all zones or purchaseable within in the first flagging tier of a new expansion.<br />
<br />
Anything that gives a class an new ability (like the mage elemental charm) should be available to everyone, though quests are fine for these spells.<br />
<br />
Slightly improved versions of the basic spells can be available further into the expansion, both in raid and single group zones. The further you get into the expansion the better the spells get, up to the ancients in the last couple of zones. These spells should be progressively rarer then the basic spell set.<br />
<br />
Lastly for any nodrop spells there should be a turnin quest to receive a spell your class can use.<br />
<br />
This way noone misses out on class defining abilities. Everyone gets a small upgrade according to how far they progressed into the expansion (and to a lesser degree how lucky they were with drops). And no spells rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">One thing I like about DAoC... you ding a new level that has new spells and .. bam! .. you got them memmed.  Nice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">PoP had it pretty close to right IMO.  In PoP, if you are doing events related to storyline progression, you are guaranteed to end up with some spells AND the scribable spell is tradable.  Other random spell drops still occur, but they are more rare than if you stick to killing gods/storyline material etc.<br />
<br />
GoD is about the most messed up system to date and an obvious shot at just eating up time and RL $$.  Spell drops there don't come from doing progression related material, they don't drop randomly, and they sure as hell don't show up in the bazaar.  Anything unlike this system would be an improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">[QUOTE='Kamidari']Hmm, when I read 'exchange' of GoD spells, I thought that meant you visit an npc with a no-drop pally spell, and exchange it for a no-drop shaman spell or whatever QUOTE]<br />
<br />
<br />
you are correct in that assumption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Spells that define a class should be more difficult to obtain.  More power = harder to get, simply put.  There is absolutely no reason to make cookie cutter shaman or any class.<br />
<br />
If you are talking about improved versions of spells that are define a class, I might understand... but if you are suggesting that the majority of class defining spells are difficult to get then... well... we'll see a lot more healing shaman than clerics in that world, because a cleric's complete heal would drop off some Time mob, while every single one of his DD's would be sold in his hometown... and Shaman would have every heal for sale in hometown, with Turgur's requiring the head of every god in Time turned into a random BobMan npc that wanders from plane to plane at Selo's speed...<br />
<br />
Well, maybe that's taking it to the extreme, but I am trying to make a point.  I believe that a class should get enough of their core ability spells to function well in a group IF THEY ARE GOOD AT IT... repeat, if they are good at it.  Perhaps, once they have become skilled, and of course taken notice of by guilds, then raid, they can have access to slightly more powerful versions of the same spells (Heals, Slows, etc.) that would have made an unskilled player's job too easy (thereby removing the challenge of mastering their class), had they been available to someone of that skill level... can anyone understand what I'm trying to say?  I'm bad with words sometimes.<br />
<br />
Also, once a player has MASTERED his class, he should then finally be able to access a few cooler but not core spells.  This will give him something extra to do now that he's got his role down to a habit, and will be fitting, as it would go to waste if given to an unskilled player who would not know how to utilize it... let's say, as a totally arbitrary example, that the Cleric's only Mark of Karn type spell was a really rare one of respectable strength and usefulness that dropped rarely in GoD trials... something of that nature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just make everything runes again. Atleast they entered the market at a controled pace and everyone could get what they needed. Im talking when runes were fairly common drop in BoR btw. This bullshiz where they let all the uber people have everything and just when people start making it to their level, pull our the ornate and runes and put them in higher level zones really pissed me off.<br />
<br />
I worked my ass off to get to where these spells and itmes dropped and each f'n time i was just about to get there it would dry up and move to BoT, then it dried up and moved to Sol Ro, then it dried up and so on and so on.<br />
<br />
Grrr, it still burns me up &gt;:(</div></div><hr />
