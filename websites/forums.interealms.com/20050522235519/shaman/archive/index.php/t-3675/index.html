<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Cazic Thule is so damn good. In my hunting there, I have managed to pick up two different amazing shaman hats. <br />
<br />
I got this one hunting the old Gator Pools area a few weeks ago:<br />
<br />
Slime Covered Rubicite Coif   <br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
AC: +16 Agi: +6 Fire Resist: +4 Cold Resist: +4 HP: +65  <br />
Weight: 2.0 <br />
Classes: Rogue Shaman Ranger  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
Inventory Slot: Head <br />
<br />
and picked up this one last night in Archon:<br />
<br />
Tae Ew Spiritcaller's Coif   <br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
AC: +15 Str: +4 Dex: +4 Wis: +7 Poison Resist: +5 HP: +45 Mana: +40  <br />
Weight: 2.0 <br />
Classes: Shaman  <br />
Races: All Races  <br />
Inventory Slot: Head <br />
 <br />
I am torn - which to keep, which to sell? They both have the same funky spiked red chain cap graphic, so looks is not an issue between them. <br />
<br />
I think I prefer the 65 hp hat over the new 7 wisdom one - based upon my formula for Shaman gear evaluation (I convert every stat to some number of HP to rank items):<br />
<br />
Current Formula:<br />
<br />
1 Sta = 3 HP<br />
1 Agi = 1 Hp<br />
1 Wis = 3 Hp<br />
1 AC = 4 Hp<br />
1 Mana = 0.05 Hp<br />
1 Sv Magic = 0.5 Hp<br />
1 Sv Fire = 0.5 Hp<br />
1 Sv Cold = 0.5 Hp<br />
1 Sv Poison = 0.25 Hp<br />
1 Sv Disease = 0.25 Hp<br />
<br />
So - <br />
<br />
Slime Covered Rubicite Coif: (16 AC x 4) + (6 Agi) +(4 SvF x 0.5) + (4 SvC x 0.5) + (65 Hp)  = worth 139 Hp<br />
<br />
Tae Ew Spiritcaller's Coif: (15 AC x 4) +(7 Wis x 3) +(5 SvP x 0.25) + (45 Hp) +(40 Mana x 0.05) = worth 129 Hp<br />
<br />
Accordingly, I should keep the Slime Covered, right? (at least until I change my formula again! )<br />
<br />
Interested in comments on how you all evaluate gear. Any other math nerds do something similar to my formula?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh? My slime-covered rubi coif has a leather-looking graphic. Grrrrr!! Post a screenshot please?<br />
<br />
And assuming you're 60 with nearly maxxed wisdom, I'd give way more weight to mana than I would give to Wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd go with the Slime Covered Rubicite Coif.  Hps &gt; * and even if you're currently lacking wisdom you'll find wisdom more easy to obtain in other slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tyrace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if i were you, i would change the value of mana.  i would set it at 1 mana = .5 hp, not .05.<br />
<br />
from your scale 1 wis = 3hp, and 1 mana = 0.05 hp.  but for wis over 200, 1 wis = 6 mana (by most calculations).  <br />
<br />
so to compare mana to wis, it would take 60 mana to equal 3 hp which is equal to 1 wis. but 1 wis does not give 60 mana.<br />
<br />
if you use 1 mana = .5 hp, so that all of your equations balance out (ie 1 wis = 6 mana = 3 hp), then you get the following values:<br />
<br />
slime covered: 139 (stays the same since there is no mana on it)<br />
spiritcaller: 147.25 (15x4 + 7x3 + 5x0.25 + 45 + 40x0.5)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Somehow, I don't really like +Mana very much as a stat. I guess I believe that +Wisdom lowers my chance to fizzle in addition to increasing my mana pool, while +Mana is just mana pool.<br />
<br />
I am much more interested in not fizzling than I am in having a big mana pool. +Mana just seems like it is more for wizards and druids to me.<br />
<br />
FYI - I don't keep my wisdom at max. I would rather go for more Hp and AC while keeping Wisdom around 200 ish. If I really want more Wisdom, I can be a bear and get KEI.<br />
<br />
Regarding the look of the hat - on a Troll with Luclin graphics it looks like a red hat with spikes on top, which I took to be chain. Pretty cool look in my opinion. Does not really look like leather to me on a Troll. I will see what I can do about a screenshot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had the same options, I kept the slime covered and gave the other to a guild Shaman. However if you are trying to sell one of them, you would obviously find the slime covered easier to sell. I don't know if that's a factor in your decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Keep the Tae Ew and sell the Slime covered.  Stats are too close to call and the Slime covered is usable by 3 classes and is therefore more valuable on the trade market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mana and HP on Tae Ew, and Str and same AC. Id easily choose it over the other one. 25hp is one regen tick, not gonna make that much of a difference. And resists are useless, would trade it out for Crown of Froggy Kings for resists.<br />
<br />
There you go</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hiya Ximix! Havent seen you in ages but it looks like you are doing great. Havent seen the other oldtimers in a long time either - I hope they are still playing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hi Buma!<br />
<br />
Everyone is still playing, I guess time zones keep us from running into you more often!<br />
<br />
Keep in touch!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you plan on using the Canni IV aaxp ability, I would collect HP gear so you can cast it unbuffed.<br />
<br />
-Barm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd go with the higher hp one, but if you notice from my magelo, I'm a HP freak.  Check out my wishlist \ upgrades thing.  End up with near 2300 hps but barely over 1k ac hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have the slime covered hat. With old models it looks like a noob hat on an iksar. (brown bowl looking thing)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Katyana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have both Hats in my inventory and prefer the Tae Ew if those are the two I am choosing between. Once I attained Cann V and Torpor I found myself in very unfamiliar territory --&gt; having FM. I no longer discount + Wis and + mana statistics as severely as I once did and therefore choose to take a second look when rating armor. The look of the CT Hats has driven me to continue using my old Wolf Caller's Helm though on days when I cannot tolerate the clash between my blue warpaint and the Red Leather look.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd keep em both until they finish putting focus on in-game items.</div></div><hr />
