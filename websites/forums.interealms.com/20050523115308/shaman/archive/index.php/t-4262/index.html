<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious about the resists in Sleeper's Tomb. Is malo required there?<br />
<br />
My guild is about to go into sleeper's tomb and they have 2 shamans (not including me, I will be unable to play in the next couple of months). One of them has malo and one does not. I suggested letting the one with malo go because it just seems more reasonable since he will be responsible for slowing.<br />
<br />
There are only going to be about 2 groups to begin with. I was curious to know if the resists are similar to HoT (whether the shaman will have a hell of a time slowing without malo or OOS), or whether it is possible (and feasible) with only tash. <br />
<br />
I would like to know about the named as well as the regular stuff in there.<br />
<br />
Thanks )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my experience without two of:<br />
<br />
Malo<br />
Tash<br />
Oos<br />
<br />
You are in a world of hurt trying to land slow.<br />
<br />
If you had Oos and Tash you could likely jump to Malosini without Malo.<br />
<br />
The named golems (at least post-sleeper waking) are not substantially more MR than the regular golems.<br />
<br />
Even with Malo + Tash I'll frequently not stick Malosini (or Turgur) for 5 or 6 casts ... you'll want as much MR debuffing as you can get.  Especially if you are there with a dozen (or fewer) people this resists will (literally) kill you.<br />
<br />
One thing to remember:  They first two named are within an easy jog of the zone.  Keep SoW up.  The golems are slow -- I don't think anything in sleeper summons.<br />
<br />
I'm not suggesting you zone, but kiting until the tank regains aggro is definately an option.<br />
<br />
$0.02.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Current non Legend$ ST:<br />
Regular golems need at least Tash and/or OOS plus Malo to be slowed.<br />
Gargoyles can be slowed ok with Malo only.<br />
Master of the Guard needs standard golem debuffs.<br />
The Progenitor needs Tash, OOS and Malosini to be slowed. Very resistant.<br />
Final Arbiter is a PITA to slow. Extremely resistant, even with all debuffs on it can take 4-5 tries to slow it.<br />
<br />
Every named golem requires also Insidious Decay for SK taps to land.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The small golems can be slowed without any debuffs, not worth it though, they die too fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/Boggle  Can't imagine getting to ST level without Malo.  The dragons that you get the tooth from all need Malo to slow, as do the mobs to get SS or Kael armor, which is normally considered the base level of AC for this zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a level 60 ST keyed guildmate without Malo.  We've been trying to get it for him...in the past week we've killed Jumpy/Prot, Gorenaire and Sont (twice), no malo.<br />
<br />
It's a rare spell, even for those actively seeking it.</div></div><hr />
