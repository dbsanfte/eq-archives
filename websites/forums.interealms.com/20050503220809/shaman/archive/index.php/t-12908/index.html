<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Bout to be coming back to EQ after a self imposed break and looking for really FUN things to do, wondering if any lvl 61's without torpor have solo'd gaurdian wurms, and what my chances might be. Or what other difficult things I might want to try.............damn the lvl restriction on Naggy =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say it would be nearly impossible to solo guardian wurms without torpor at 61. I don't think I could handle guardian wurms right now at 65 if I didn't have torpor / quiessence - even slowed guardian wurms put out a lot of damage, and kragg's mending, while nice, isn't nearly mana efficient enough to keep up with heals. Kragg's mending is also a fairly long cast time spell, whereas torpor w/ quickbuff or mage items / cleric spell (Blessing of Reverence?) can be shortened to 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
Duo'ing would be easy enough if you added another class, necro / mage would make a good addition and kragg's would easily be enough healing then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can't solo a guardian wurm with torpor or quessience, with either its doable but more risky at lvl 61. Imo group them if you want torpor, although tbh might be better getting 65 on my server quessience is like 20-25k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You want to solo a guardian wurm at 61 without torpor.  Have a lot of Wis and mana.<br />
<br />
Get an item that snares.  I don't even care if it has charges.  I don't know bah something like this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Swollen Fungusbeast Gland&quot; <br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7603<br />
<br />
Use your Slow on the Guardian wurm drag it to the corner of the zone by one of those black dragon statues.  Have blinding luminance mem'd as well as your fastest dots you have for that level...hm that would be I think... BoN and EB.   Unless you have the Ancient dot /shrug.<br />
<br />
Snare wurm with item.  Blind wurm.  Cast two 42 sec. dots stacked on Guardian Wurm.  Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
Dead Guardian wurm without Torpor or Quessience.  Not everything needs to be tanked in this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey 35 druid boy, there's such a thing as summoning mobs.  Might be possible to kite between summons, but we can slow thier attacks down to almost the same interval as summon interval, so all the extra trouble to get out of melee range only to be summoned again would simply be detrimental... Necros on the other hand, who can't slow Gwurms, get an advantage by staying out of melee range so they DO agro kite, and mujaki/force shield between summons.  Gwurms have an insane melee radius so you need to be like 50 feet away before it can't hit you anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think what he is saying is more like fear kiting so no summoning. I suppose it might work, depends how well blind sticks/lasts.</div></div><hr />

Hey 35 druid boy, there's such a thing as summoning mobs.<br />
<br />
Getting out of melee range of a blinded mob is not that hard.  And no Guardian wurms don't have a melee range of 50 feet.<br />
<br />
Blinding the mob gets rid of the problem of getting summoned non-stop and Blinding Luminance is a good enough duration to get off dots and such.  Just have some wis and mana. <br />
<br />
Excuse me, Grizlor, while I now include you in my sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How do I recharge the Swollen Fungusbeast Gland?<br />

I have a collapsed toolkit, do I just combine the gland with a mana battery? If so, which one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Iirc gwurms are flagged unfearable, not sure if that translates to blind *shrug*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Apocrathy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Best bet is to tank the mob slowed. <br />
The Dps on a G-wurm is not that high really.<br />
Use potions to there best effect. <br />
<br />
Stinging wort (couple of stacks), Greater rejuvination potion or two and use Kilva's Skin of Flame. a humming orb would be handy to if you have the smithing skill.<br />
<br />
Have a horse, have your pet out(with two weapons ). And do the stocism quest.<br />
<br />
Damage is going to be your problem, pull to zone wall near VP zone and you shouldnt get any adds dont worry about snare the pull is slow enough without painfully slow in fact :(. Watch the mobs for a couple of minutes youll see the spot.<br />
<br />
a profile of your equipment hp/ac etc would make it easier to tell if you have a chance self buffed or if youll need outside assistance/buffs.<br />
<br />
If you want to kill G-wurms non-solo any other healer (big heal sham 58+ druid 58+ or 39+ cleric ) you can tank fine or just grab a 50+ tank and heal them. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You make it sound deceptively easy. Its not :P The wurms can double for 512. If they go large on you 3 rounds in a  row, its hard to keep a tank alive duo, muchless yourself. Before I got torpor (Had to buy the damn thing, it never droped) I duoed these with a gimpish 59 Pally. It was alot harder than it seemed. His ac wasnt that high and he got smacked ALOT. I struggled keeping him alive with CH and keeping stoic on me/caniing for mana. This is with us self buffed btw. The problem really is doing enough damage to the GW. Pally would do damage, pet does damage, and i would keep a disease dot on him. It took a LONG time to kill lthem this way. I did/do not have epic.<br />
<br />
Did it with a high aa'd 61 warrior and the fight time was literally halved. Warrior didnt take nearly as much damage, which gave me time to do damage.<br />
<br />
With Torpor I'm not sure i could solo one. I dont have an epic to do mana free damage. Dog Dog doesnt really do all that much damage. I'm afraid I'd spend nearly all my time torporing and blasting myself with cholror to keep myself alive.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure you could do it without Torpor unless you had REALLY good gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes, Guardian Wurms are blindable as mcroc stated.  Mcroc you probably got summon after blinding because you were using your pet.  You don't want to use dogdog for this.<br />
<br />
And if you don't want to get summoned then just get out of the wurm's melee radius.  The code for Blind works the same way as fear as long as there is not a PC or pet in melee radius of the blinded mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'd think you could do it just using Kragg's/stoicism and 61 alpha pet. <br />
Sure you don't have the mana efficiency of torpor healing, but these things are easily debuffed and locked down till your ready. <br />
<br />
You can have it completely 100% debuffed and yourself at 100% full mana before you ever engage. People did them at level 60 with a far inferior pet.<br />
<br />
Root is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Apocrathy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Your right maybe i made it sound too easy.They can hit for 500 ish but most of the time they hit for much less 200's and lower. <br />
<br />
How quick can you click that stinging wort potion pretty fast i bet. Enough to get you out of trouble if you get unlucky and the beasty does a few 500's to you in a row. <br />
<br />
The problem is always going to be damage hence the ds potions, pet. It will be tough to do and risk is not equal to reward 99% of the time...loot wurm meat :(<br />
<br />
With stocism and enough instant heal potions a understanding you may die a few times and a few lucky channels you can do it.  <br />
<br />
With outside buffs cleric and enchanter it will be much easier. With more aa and levels it would be easier too. <br />
<br />
Gear will come into it but he hasnt got a profile posted. Dont underestimate potions an instant heal potion does two things 1) heals you 2) saves you the mana you would have used to heal for damage.<br />
<br />
Downside being they are very expensive or require farming but they can change a fight from not possable to mearly risky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My advise is not to bother soloing one unless you have torpor or quessience. I can do it self buffed at lvl 65 np, just got to be careful. I did it when I had torpor too but I died one of the times doing it( gw was on 2% and I was kinda oom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, more bitchy shaman, just what this board needs :-)  I love it.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I don't have a whole lot useful to contribute to this discussion except for a quick tip on how to recharge magic items.  Bear in mind that its pretty expensive plat wise, and works best on 10 charge items (I think 10 is the most an item can hold).  BTW, this is sort of a secret technique, so keep this info on &quot;Beta&quot; level secrecy (hey, something had to come after Alpha pet).<br />
<br />
Get your charisma maxxed, go quest for faction items, cast whatever illusions you can, and have an enchanter pet cast alliance on you (if that works on other people, if not do all this to him and have him cast alliance).  The point is, get the merchant to his/her rock-bottom price.  Then, make sure the merchant has plenty of empty space for new items in his inventory.  Finally, sell the item to the merchant, and when it appears in his inventory buy it back.  In the interim, the game forgets how many charges the item had, and you get your item recharged.  <br />
<br />
However, most charged items have insane costs associated with them (try selling and buying back a rez stick from a merchant sometime if you don't believe me; that's an expensive rez!), so you can just think of it as the Merchant's Union of Norath using their secret allegiance (the same way Bankers use their's to instantly transport your stuff from bank to bank) to swap around charges from all the charged items they get.  Sure you buy back your rez stick, but somewhere out there are nine other poor saps who sold merchants their rez sticks when they had only one charge left on them, and although you thought these sticks all dissapeared everytime the server got reset, they actually went to a secret merchant vault somewhere.  Then the merchants used them to recharge your stick, but made you sign away your first born child to them first :-)  Hey, you do what you have to role-play in this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That's interesting. Since asking the question I did some research and found this thread stickied under tinkering at EQtraders<br />
<br />
http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1605<br />
<br />
which is basically the same except they say you need to trade 2 items, one empty and one full. Does just one work?<br />
<br />
I agree we should keep this quiet (ie. dont start any new threads on the topic), but a rechargable snare item would be great!<br />
<br />
Also at Allakhazam it says <br />

<br />
under pricing info for the Swollen Fungusbeast Gland.<br />
<br />
Why would he say it was rechargable? I am tempted to get myself one and try a few mana batteries on it in a collapsed toolkit and see what happens...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not to be an ass...<br />
<br />
but people have been doing that since before Kunark Loramin :p<br />
<br />
It's not secret at all, and SoE knows about it, in fact that is why the rez stick is so expensive now, they purpously upped the buy back price on alot of charged items, and said so in a patch awhile back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Dunno if it's doable without torpor, might be doable with the 61 pet where you can root the GW, back out to heal while the pet tanks and you heal yourself if you get into trouble. They do hit slow so you might even be able to get off a Kraggs in between attacks, never tried it. <br />
<br />
Since I'm not exactly uber (2000hp unbuffed), I don't try one without Aego or Virtue so not sure if you'd call it soloing or not. Selfbuffed, the margin of error is just too slim. <br />
<br />
My standard tactic is to root park until malo, cripple and slow sticks, then stack Pox, BoN and wade in with a buffed puppy. Bout halfway through the fight I'll root, let puppy tank while I hit hit spirit call, back out puppy and take a breather to heal me and the pet and regen some mana while the GW munches on the puppy brigade. Also, reslow during that time. If root breaks and I get summoned, just reroot and back out again. Doing it that way isn't too difficult at 61 given torpor and cann5, but a bad lag spike or series of interrupts will still kill me. <br />
<br />
It's a lot easier with a tank. Just make sure he has a 2hander, those 500pt ripostes will eat up a dual wielder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Gwurms are definitely rough at 61 without torpor.  I tried two times at 61 without torpor and failed both.  I was fairly close both times but healing was just so rough.  Even chain casting Kragg's Mending didn't do the trick for me.  Slowed they hit every 5-6 seconds but seemed to interrupt most of the time so I let dog dog jump in and was half a second late on a heal.  Got it down to 38% that time.  I tried again basically using the same techniques and it was going great.  Kept the wurm rooted so he would keep agro on the pet and not summon me.  Got him down to 27% but right as I mass cannied root broke and he summoned me.<br />
<br />
Had I gotten some more practice I think I could have gotten it down to fairly decent success rate but I never got the time to try it again until I got torpor.  They were fairly easy at 63 with torpor and easier still at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I tried one self buffed only.  I had about 2200 HP unbuffed at the time with around 940 unbuffed AC.  (dont remember what I buffed myself to)<br />
I completely decked me and the pet and went at it.  I have epic, JBB, lizard, and FT1.  I ran out of mana when the GW was at 40%.  Was using Stoicism, Kragg's and canibalizing.  I haven't went back to try since I hit 65 (still not torpor or Q).  I think i was 62 when I tried that.<br />
<br />
I think it would be possible with Virtue and KEI/Tranq diong just what I did, however they CAN triple hit for mid 500s, so it is possible to get unlucky, and while using only that you may win, you may also die a few times for each success.<br />
<br />
Potions should make it very doable without torpor at 61.<br />
<br />
As far as blinding - I think they have to many HP and our dots are efficient enough.  Even if you had a massive mana pool I just don't see you killing it with dots/blind alone.  I could be wrong though, haven't tried.<br />
<br />
Only tried the one time, one day I'll go back and try some more if I get bored, but normally when I want to camp GWs guildies just show up to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Loramin , your description of recharging items is incorrect.<br />
As for the fungus glands, yes they are vendor rechargeable. This means they can be bought and sold...aka not no drop.</div></div><hr />

I plan on haveing Aego and KEI, but also looking for other suitable targets.  Though considering the discussion I got going it looks like I'll definatly have to try the Gwurms once I get back =)<br />
<br />
Oh, and alpha puppy with full mage kit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Snare glands are INCREDIBLY expensive to recharge just fyi (over 10k if memory serves). Not rez stick levels, but enough to make all but the filthy rich look elsewhere. They used to be pretty cheap, but that was nerfed.<br />
<br />
And yes, you have to sell a fully charged version, then the empty. So basically you have to buy it one extra time to recharge. My beastlord does this all the time with the 3 sacks of humming orbs he lugs around.</div></div><hr />
