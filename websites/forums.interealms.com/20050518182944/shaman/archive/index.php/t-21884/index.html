<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a heads up on a new hole in IE. I figured i would bring it to everyones attention cause i was affected by it and would like to save anyone else the trouble of this PITA hole and also cause there is simply no patch for it.<br />
<br />
Basicly its yet another hole in IE that will let a program be installed and remotely run with high access rights. Its already been exploited by 1 adware company ( i have felt its wrath ) and you can be sure more will be coming now that its been released in public news. MS has no patch to correct this hole but considers it such a serious hole they are going to possibly break out a patch just for this issue instead of waiting till the end of the month and rolling it out with its monthly patches/fixes.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you would like to read some more on it i found a site that has some news on it. I think its the only site on the net currently with any real info on it so here ya go ..  IE hole (http://news.com.com/IE+flaws+used+to+spread+pop-up+toolbar/2100-1002_3-5229707.html?tag=nefd.lede) <br />
<br />
If you are open minded or curious i would suggest trying the latest build of Firefox (www.mozilla.org)  which is a FREE, open source browser that in almost every way surpasses IE. Trust me, once you go tabs you never go back. Also check out the extension section for thing like , auto dictionary look up and web search in the right click menu, saving sites and tabs you open when the browser closes accidently or intentialy and just a ton of other things. Mind you Firefix is just he browser, it has no built in e-mail client, its sister e-mail client is thunderbird which is also at that same link. Plus you can get mozilla which is just a bundled all in one version of Firefox that has a build in client for e-mail, irc, etc etc. Basicly Firefox is just the stripped down bare bones version of mozilla.<br />
<br />
Also if you want you can try www.Opera.com which is a nice alternative to IE. Infact there is a few of them out there that are more secure then IE and i encourage you to try them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dont panic, the sky isnt falling, but if your like me, you like to stay on top of things like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take care.</div></div><hr />

The hole doesn't appear to be new according to this (http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/365366/2004-06-06/2004-06-12/2) bugTraq message:<br />
<br />
Are these really new vulnerabilities or just variants of old? The &quot;Location: URL:&quot; proxy really just looks like the &quot;Location: File:&quot; proxy that Liu Die Yu reported and the object caching stuff really just looks like a variation of the advisories from GreyMagic back in 2002 with the showModalDialog caching and javascript: injection. Other than those 2, the only real vulnerability on the page is the Ibiza chm stuff which still works on plenty of fully patched machines. <br />
<br />
After looking at the example, I tend to agree, however what do I know  ;).  NOTE you don't want to be trying the first link in the BugTraq message as that is a link to the site using the exploit.<br />
<br />
Eitherway as Litgruv said using a non-IE browser can help advoid exploits like this, although the down side to that is some sites require IE to function.  Using Ad-aware (http://www.lavasoftusa.com/software/adaware/)  on your machine is also recormended.<br />

What exactly about IE is better? Kinda curious to hear your answer.<br />
<br />
<br />
My biggest problem with mozilla is how insanely bloated and slow it is.<br />
Should definitly try firefox then because that was one of the major principles of it when the decided to make it. Lean light and fast browser. If thats your problem with mozilla it won't be with firefox.</div></div><hr />

Hence why i said Firefox.  Firefox is a stripped down, faster and leaner build of the mozilla browswer. This is open source so just cause it has ties with netscape like 5 years ago doesnt mean its anything close to netscape, which it isnt. They took i think more then 1 year off from mozilla to completely rebuild the code for the browser and its not very little like netscape. Again Netscape is a company ( or was ) mozilla/firefox project is its own entity, completely open source.<br />
<br />
But anyway, this isnt a  &quot;use firefox&quot; thread, i just spoke about that most cause its what i use. I personaly feel its your lose to not use it but hey, thats how it goes :)<br />
<br />
There is Opera and Avant, there is Mozilla based browsers and so on. Point was to avoid IE and support open source work if possible or atleast avoid IE.</div></div><hr />

IE ignores or perverts many web standards.  Go go embrace and extend!  Unfortunately, many lazy web designers only check their pages in IE so you'll run into many sites that are &quot;broken&quot; to work in IE.<br />

I just had 20 tabs open at once. If i wanted to have 20 pages open with  IE I would have to have 20 instances of IE running. Ive tried that before and ive run out of resources and locked the computer.<br />
<br />
Hell with 20 tabs open I didnt drop below 60% resources.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys I just found my new browser Firefox.<br />

Far as speed goes it certainly isnt slower than IE. I cant tell the difference there.<br />

Ive been checking that since yesterday and you just need to re-install your extension in 0.9 cause its moved to a new area in the browser. Themes and extensions all work and i installed a crapload yesterday to check. If there is one that doesnt work itll be unimportant cause i just didnt try any of the cute ones.<br />
<br />
So basicly 0.9 works well so far. I did hear of a mac user having flash issues with it though, but i think he needs to re-installt he plug in is all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not really sure what you're asking.  Your friend has a totaly unprotected PC and he gets a virus, well is that such a big surprise ?  Also what does that have to do with being alerted to a new variant on the &quot;Location: URL:&quot; and java script: injection: exploits, that virus checkers may not pick up (many anti-virus software picked up the less sophisticated previous variants and poped up a warning, but they will take some time to be updated for the newly discovered variants).  If your aware of the site which caused the problem, then it would be usefull if you could post the information so it could be examined to see which exploit it is using and the information passed along to the appropriate law enforcement people.<br />
<br />
If your willing to help your friend, then downloading the latest anti-virus softaware to your machine and the latest virus definition files, then copying them across to there machine and installing them should cure the problem.<br />

Yea, like i said, i didnt check all of them, just ones i guess i felt wer eimportant, like dictionary.com , the advanced ad blocking and other stuff. I thought the calander was useless since you have a calander on your taskbar in windows.  I know they are refining the extension process too, but i guess for now somethings maybe need to be updated by their authors.</div></div><hr />
