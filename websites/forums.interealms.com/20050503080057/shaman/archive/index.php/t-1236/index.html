<br />
JUST when I was leaving a new zone..Stonebrunt..was coming out.   Now, I am a 9 Ikky Shammy, back after 9-12 months off.  Im tired of FoB..and refuse to even contemplate LOIO.  (Bad memories from there)<br />
<br />
Anyone Lizards out there have other viable hunting areas other than the &quot;usual&quot; hot spots.<br />
<br />
BTW, I do have Luclin, so if I need to hit the moon..so be it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Luclin might be your best bet, being that you are lvl 9, you may still be using some other races newbie grounds to do some leveling, if not you're gonna be grouping alot. Banking is going to be a problem, Iksars can't bank anywhere in the &quot;old world&quot; without alot of faction work and finding a vendor can also be a problem. So going to Luclin may be your best bet. Try Paludal caverns you can bank..buy/sell in Shadow Haven. And with a couple of delivery quests you can even train in Shadow Haven. Or use the Kitties newbie zone outside of Shar Val. That's my advice if you don't want to use the &quot;old world&quot; or &quot;Kunark&quot; circuit to level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stormrazor has some good advice there!  :)<br />
<br />
To be honest though, FoB is probably the single best newbie zone in the game.  I can understand getting tired of being there (I did 1-15 there), but it's about the best place you can find.  Not too crowded, lots of mobs, and pretty easy.<br />
<br />
For Iksar, a good progression is<br />
FoB (1-18)<br />
Kurns (15-21)<br />
LoIO (20-30)<br />
FM (30-36)<br />
OT (30-40)<br />
DL (40-49)<br />
Karnors (49-54)<br />
<br />
That ought to get you to about 54 :)  Some overlap, so hunt where ya like of course.  Also, the above is based on grouping, not soloing.  I wouldn't recommend soloing some of those areas at the low part of the range!<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
60 Iksar shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks all...I think it's more a thing of &quot;Ive done this..and it sucks doing this again.&quot;  But alas, it needs be done.<br />
<br />
I DO know that if possible, I will forsake leveling in LOIO for a viable alternative.  It seems that every dim-wit levels there from 19-30...I have the most horrible grouping experiences there :)<br />
<br />
I also am very casual at this stage in my EQ life.  Before, I was part of a large guild, and I played 20-25 hours a week.<br />
<br />
then I re-found my life.  So, I now play 5-15 hours a week..mostly solo.<br />
<br />
This time around...fun is the key ! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Andrewe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go into Kurn's as soon as you hit lvl 12 or so... it's fast experience and a lot more fun than piddling about outside, I think. Honestly I'd find a twinked out melee that needed a healer, duo with them, and you could go from 9 to 12 in less time than it would take you to travel to some other race's newbie zone. That at least gets you out of FOB fast.<br />
<br />
After you've tapped Kurns out (around 20 or so?) You can solo in Warsik's Woods at the giant fort, or head up to Luclin and play around in Paludal Caverns. I think staying out of LOIO is good for your blood pressure, yeah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LOIO is fine as long as you turn off all channels and find a solitary corner :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I HATE this progression<br />
<br />
FoB (1-18) <br />
Kurns (15-21) <br />
LoIO (20-30) <br />
FM (30-36) <br />
OT (30-40) <br />
DL (40-49) <br />
Karnors (49-54) <br />
<br />
Find dungeons, go with friends, do something different.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you go from no-risk to high risk and kill all you group members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally i would try and stay to the old world as much as possible. The mobs have fewer HPs and lower AC then most of the expansions zones. Just a tip to consider when soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well i will not say what is best but this is what i did and most of the time i played solo or with a real life friend that was a iksar war.<br />
<br />
FoB ( 1-14 )<br />
only a few more lvls for you but if you wan to push it you might beable to tak eout the entrace skellys in kurns<br />
<br />
Kurns ( 14-18 )<br />
tis a nice fun place and you can use the bone chips to fund a raising of you mechant faction so you can lower your prices. also look for the undead crusaders while you are there, maybe you can get one or 2 skulls but you will be comeing back for them.<br />
<br />
LOIO ( 18-19 )<br />
I went, I saw, I left. that is all i have to say<br />
<br />
The overthere ( 19-21 )<br />
The low end of this place is great, not many people at all there is a vender that if people have not aggroed you can off load for reduced returns but no zoneing. and with our banded armor the warrior and me ran around without realy helping each other we where grouped but at 21 we where killing them fast enouhg someone was always pulling, some times we had a mage with us just for kicks.<br />
<br />
Warslike Woods ( 21-28 fort 28-30? out side dalnirs )<br />
this was where my warrior friend and i started takeing on our nuick name as giant killers in our guild chat. i was lucky becouse i could solo them even if he was not on but if he was we could take up to 2 or 3 at a time ( this will be much harder for you since i was makeing judicas use of the regen on the RAGE line of spells before there nerf ) i died a few times but this was very fun. after a while he had to stop playing for a bit so i moved and soloed the brutes out in front of dalnirs.<br />
<br />
then veliouse came out<br />
<br />
Great Divide ( 32 to 40 )<br />
With my warrior friend we would pull the drakal dire wolfs and on acation the scouts. I would also only solo the dire wolfs tho i killed them real fast thay are easy ( in my opinion wolfs are always very easy for there lvls ). you can also start working on your shawl.<br />
<br />
the tiem of unrest<br />
<br />
Overthere ( 40-45 )<br />
Dreadlands ( 40-45 )<br />
Burning Woods/Frontier Mountans zone line BW side ( 40-45 )<br />
solo FM ( 40-45 )<br />
We could not find a good place and i was just trying to solo where ever gave me exp. tho the group we had killing in BW was the most fun any of us had since we where all haveing to work realy hard each pull to make it work and was not a group you could just sit back in and sleep, was a pally a chanter a shaman or 2 a druid a warrior and a mage when the shaman was not there. the group ranged from 36 to 42.<br />
<br />
Solo spots after this <br />
<br />
City of Mist ( 46-56 )<br />
the last few lvls was realy pushing it but the place was realy fun exp with a partner or solo. was doing my epic since lvl 15 so at this point in time i was getting my books and reports. had a tear at lvl 49 but the rak that was up was a bugged one and could not get a raid to come back tell i was 54 or so. I was almost the first iksar on my server with epic so was rather disapotiend but oh well. <br />
<br />
afer a long break<br />
<br />
Maidens Eye ( 56-60 )<br />
was actully better for me to kill solo since the kill rate that a full group would need to keep up to beat the exp at this point was not worth it since i was killing one ever 2 mients flat.<br />
<br />
Fungase grove ( 60 AAing )<br />
the shrooms here are wimps and i requlerly have 2 on me at once. i do not have torpor so i can only take at make 3 at once. add a rogue and you can chain pull all day long ( max i have done is 5 hours ) where you pull one the spear then pull another spear then when the first one dies pull another so you always have 2 on you. takes some getting use to but boy the exp flys.IMHO haveing more then 2 or 3 hunting shrooms is a waste and the exp slows way down. with 2 the rogue and i could keep 9 to 10 killed in the time of the spawns which is roughly equal to me soloing 5 in the spawn time which is realy pushing me hard to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>sinladar orchammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Your an Iskar, why not do the Warrens off of Paineel.  Good for 12 to about 20 or so.  Faction gets you into Paineel to bank and shop there and when you get more levels move right into Stone Brunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zorshaaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kurns (8-30) is one of my best memories in the early stages of the game. Helped by the fact I had made my first EQ buddy, sadly long gone. The fun of pushing further into the zone was excellent. As previously suggested try to find a Warr of slightly higher lvl than you, well twinked, and explore. As you say fun is the key here so enjoy.<br />
With that in mind if you can find a good monk to group with there is always Dalnir (25-35). Great xp, and some loot for a change. Monks love Dalnir as there are some very nice drops for them there. Beware though as it is a tough zone if you are not of the appropriate lvl, and you really need a good group in there to do the depths, depending on lvl of course.<br />
Then there is Kaesora (30-45), the bane of my young life. I was desperate to get in as there are some good Shaman drops for a change. I lost count of the number of times I popped in to see if there were any groups inside. Nada, zilch, zero, you get the picture. Very annoying, till I got a guild group together to explore inside. Well worth it, but you will need a group so join a guild if possible.<br />
Then of course there is City of Mist (35-53). A very good place for all Shaman to hunt as we can gather some of our epic drops along the way. A little easier to find groups here too.<br />
Now I have to admit to never having been in Nurga (30-45) or Droga (35-45). Something I am going to put right next time I log thinking about it. You will not be able to spend a lot of time in these places if your experiences are anything like mine. Very hard to find groups as most people prefer the usual treadmill. Occaisionaly you can gather a group from OT to go to Dalnir, but this is often not worth the effort as people drop out and leave you short handed, once again find a good low lvl guild.<br />
Ahh, that reminds me, guilds. My first guild was a low lvl Iksar only guild that worked quite well for this kind of thing. Unfortunately I joined way too late to enjoy the benefits early on but I would recomend not looking for a powerful guild as it can be tough to get a group to do the stuff you want. Look for a low lvl, well managed, fun group and enjoy.<br />
Well that is my 2cp worth, hope it helps. I love going into dungeons in EQ, I only wish my sentiments were shared by more. Unfortunately most people just want to lvl, rather than exploring the game environment. Somehing of a shame I reckon cause Kaesora and Dalnir are really very enjoyable, and testing environments. How many people have been down to fight the Kly on a regular basis? not many I reckon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Aye i had much fun in kasoran and dalnirs ( dalnirs can be a pain ), he was saying thou that most of his time is solo. so since i had soloed most of the time i posted where you could at the right lvls. i must admit i was in a all iksar guild to begina with and was much fun, can remaber RAIDING kurns. :) but it may be hard for you to find some of your lvl to do something like that. If you do want the fun of doing the out of the way dungans ( nurga is nice as there is no roamers and parts for our cudgel drop there ) you will need to bring your own group. i would suchest to find some people that play the same time as you and say bring your self to comit to a single group going once a week in to a dungan. i know kasoranan and nurga are very friendly to the crawl type of fight so thay are more fun then the camping type. droga is somewhat pacthed with mobs so you are almost forced to deal with a crawl or sittiing on 3 spawn poitns while pulling more to fight, can turn in to a wild ride. but if you as me there is just far to many casters in that dungan and you will get bogged down with healing people.</div></div><hr />
