<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I am a lvl 39, I have the stone from the drunk barb. I want to know if invis to Animals works against the sharks? <br />
<br />
Will the sharks attack if I have to unvis to talk to the spirits?<br />
<br />
If so, and the sharks attack, will I be a spirit shortly myself?<br />
<br />
thanks :)<br />
<br />
PS I have 100 fish scales, i am assuming this will be more then enough? maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Invis VS animals worked for me.  I'd advise you to bring a friend with you.  The worse part about this test is it's very long and boring.  A friend can help pass the time and can also help if a shark aggro's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>NirohtFrozenntree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did this part of the epic back when i was 19... yes it can be done. There are (or were) two types of sharks in the waters around the island- shark and Killer shark. The Killer Sharks will saee throught invis but do not path by the spot that often.  The other sharks are about level 20 I beleive (can't remember the con). Yes this is a very boring ordeal (i didn't have anything to do at the time so i just sat there. From what I remember I had to recast EB like three times and Invis after each one plus 2 extras. I died my first time out because of the stupid killer shark. The second time only regular sharks pathed by. It was scary at that level seeing those sharks coming out of the darkness at you thinking your gonna get attacked.  So far i've done everything up to getting the 6 reports form City of Mist (have 4 already need to get some poeple to go down and the last two. Any questions just ask. <br />

Thanks again to all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LvL34 and did this easy last night, only normal sharks passed by no killers...had to cast enduring breath twice. Now i'm off to kill the 2 in Rathe Mtns....should be fun :)</div></div><hr />

here's a trick. Activate levitate, dont worry about the breath. hand the gem to ooglyn, head to -1600, +4200 over the water.<br />
<br />
Then just sit there and wait. the NPC's dont notice the dept change, and only care about vertical/horizontal alignment. Therefore you can sit on the surface of the water for the 30 minutes it takes for the important things to happen. None of the dialogue before Abe is important.<br />
<br />
The other great thing about this is as some may know if you place yourself at just a few inches below the surface of water, you can see through the murkiness all the way through the water like it was air. And as you may know, the sharks spend all of their time near the bottom of the water. Using this method you can simply wait until Abes glowing white avataar shows up under the water, and then make sure no sharks are anywhere near him. <br />

I did this at 45 with invis vs animals when I could have just as easily done it as soon as I got levitation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tankorr Turretlizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This was very easy at level 27 with invis vs aniamls up...  I had to wait for the ogre to respawn however because another shaman was there and finishing up just as I got there...  The ogre spawn is about 2 hours or so...  I have woe envy and mar's promise already for the turn in for the test of wisdom which i plan on completing tonight...  <br />

<br />
I even did it once by logging out for half an hour after heading to that loc over the water. This saved my levitate so I did not have to refresh it. Logged back in and the greater spirit soon spawned, I dove down and got my gem. The script plays out whether you're logged in or not.</div></div><hr />
