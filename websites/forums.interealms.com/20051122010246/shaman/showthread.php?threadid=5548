	<p>Created this Hunting Guide for guildmates, sharing it with you folks.<br />
<br />
Ahoy Mateys! While I have posted various threads about some of my favorite hunting spots, I thought I would set down a comprehensive list of some of my favorite hunting places lv. 15-54. Please note that while I often group, much of this may be skewed towards a Shaman or other soloing class, but not too much, and I'm adding new zones as Dobbin (Ranger) discovers their benefits.<br />
<br />
I tend to hunt where I get the best exp. (and hopefully some coin) with reasonable risks involved (not the dare-devil type). After two years in EQ (and 3 characters in their 40's) I have found the below spots the best for fast and efficient leveling. I'll add new places as I discover them with my ranger, Dobbin.<br />
<br />
LEVEL 15-20: 4 Zones I prefer: Oasis, High Hold Pass, East Karana, Lake Rathe, and PAULDAL CAVERNS!<br />
<br />
PALUDAL CAVERNS: Ok, if you have Luclin expansion, Paludal Caverns is now THE BEST leveling spot for lv. 15-24 in terms of pure exp. and decent coin. Heck, I stayed until 26 with Dobbin, soloing the last few levels by pulling from the back side on bandit camp (by the lake). I took my little ranger, Dobbin, from 15-20 (almost 21) in about 9-10 hours of play, and no, I am not kidding.<br />
<br />
Getting there: get to North Karana, Greater Faydark, Toxx or Dreadlands and go to the wizard spires. Hail the Nexus Spire person and say &quot;Journey to Luclin&quot;. You will be given a gem and you must stay inside the spires and wait for the port to the moon, they happen every 15-20 minutes or so. You will be ported to the &quot;Nexus&quot; zone on the moon. Zone into Shadowhaven (I think it is east direction). Right near where you zone into Shadowhaven from Nexus is a SOULBINDER  , use it. Have a map of Shadowhaven handy and use it to find your way to Paludal Caverns (btw you can bank in adjacent zone, the Bazaar---WHICH IS NOW OPEN!!!!!).<br />
<br />
Once in Paludal Caverns you have 3 main types of mobs. First and best is the bandits, they have a big camp near the zone. The bandits come in many different races (vah shir, human, gnome, halfling, etc) and are levels 15-20 or so. Get a decent group to fight them because they are often pulled in 2's and 3's. They are rogues, so do not turn your backs on them, they backstab hard. They drop coin, runes, and some weapons which sell for a few gold and armor which sells for 1-2 pp per piece (with rotten halfling cha). The main bandit camp closet to Shadowhaven also has the Yelloweyes spawn. Yelloweyes is a lv. 19-20 Owlbear.<br />
<br />
Mushrooms! There are big mushrooms to kill here. The shrooms are lv. 14-20 or so (lower level ones on shadeweavers thicket side of zone). If soloing, you can sit and solo the mushroom that spawns in the cavern near Shadowhaven, just before you go down the hill to the bandit camp. Sit and solo a mushroom you say? Well, they have only a 6 minutes respawn time. The are pretty tough, so con the spawns before attacking. I leveled Dobbin from 17-18 on a shroom spawn when there were not enough people in cavern to get a group (and a little when all groups were full). There is another single shroom spawn that is past the bandit camp and towards the ramp on the right. You can walk thru the bandit camp, just make sure to walk down the very center of it to avoid aggro, and if you have sneak or invis, use it. If you solo this shroom, know that there is a fisherman bandit that spawns near the big pond not far by. He can be soloed as well.<br />
<br />
Finally, the Phlargs. These humanoid fellows are a tad ugly. They are lv. 14-18 I believe, also with a 6 minute timer. Much easier to kill than the bandits. The only problem is that they cast a crud disease that lasts forever! If you have a cure disease spell, or a groupmate that does, go for it! They are spaced singly, or in pairs all around the first big cavern as you zone in from Shadowhaven--and throught all the caverns in the zone except the one by Shadeweavers Thicket. You can just walk a circuit around the caverns and kill them. The drop fungal flesh (a meal!), coins, and fungal armor (very low weight stuff, good for young monks). I hit the phlargs with guildmate, Antilife (lv. 20 necro at the time--had cure disease spell, takes 3 casts to cure the crud), when I was lv. 21. We did a circuit around the lake killing phlargs. OMG we both dinged sooooo fast! We found a sweet spot in a corner with plenty of pops nearby. <br />
<br />
OASIS: Ok, most folks know of this zone and learn to have a love/hate relationship with it. This zone is usually overcrowded and full of whiny, kill stealing misfits. So why go there? The exp. is great, that is why it is so crowded. Kill crocs, or even better, join a good orc highway group near the lake in the middle of the zone. I have also done very well camping the orc camp on the ocean shoreline on the far south-east corner side of the zone. If you are going to solo and need to med, the safest place is up on one of the rock pillars standing off the shore along east side of the zone (commonly referred to as P1 and P2). If soloing, stay near shoreline to avoid adds of desert madment, skellies, zombies. I strongly recommend avoiding the dock, people OFTEN train there. Loot in this zone is pretty dismal (esp. on the crocs).<br />
<br />
HIGH HOLD PASS: Lv. 15-20. The Orcs near the Kithicor zone line are the best. Forget about the gnolls, the gnoll spawns are way too spread out and you will have tremendous down time compared to the Orcs. The orcs all spawn on a hill right by Kithicor zone line. There is usually a group there, often with a waiting list. If the waiting list is short, it is worth getting on it. The orcs spawn fast and furious and I am convinced this spot provides one of the absolute best leveling spots for lv. 16-20 in the game. You get great exp. AND decent coins. If you are evil, you will get the all important faction hits from killing the orcs, the faction hits eventually allow you to bank in High Hold Keep. Learn to use the /assist function here because there are multiple spawns. A great place to learn basic grouping skills.<br />
<br />
EAST KARANA: A nice place to group or solo for levels 15-24. Set up camp near the vendor village or the barb fishing village. I prefer the fishing village myself since I would tend to fish while meditating. There are a tons of things lv. 11-18 in this zone. Gnolls, Dark Stalkers, etc... If you are grouping, you may prefer a camp more central to spawns in the zone. While the zone is not often crowded, training to the wooden bridge to NK is common, so do not go AFK when sitting there. After lv. 20, you may wish to try the Crag Spiders. They provide some of the best exp. for that level in the game (bonus due to harsh poison I think) and they drop a TON of spider silks, bring a sewing kit. A Chitin Shield or other poision resist gear is helpful with these guys.<br />
<br />
----Note: EAST KARANA also has a fun to kill baby clops named Broon, he is in his low 20's. He is fun to solo, and good melee practice for solo classes in their late 20's. If no one has killed him recently, you will find him standing in the water in the river, not far from the druid rings. Go kill him, and IMMEDIATELY RUN to where the ramp up to High Hold Pass ends. 2 reasons for running immediately, first, when you kill Broon, his big brother Proon spawns and if you are in your high 20's he will make toast of you, second, you want to run to bottom of the ramp so you can rest up and get ready for the next Broon pop. Broon spawns back in the canyon that is to the side of the ramp. Broon is on a short timer, 6 minute spawns. My druid, Dabbin, spent most of lv. 29 soloing Broon and would melee the last 25% of each fight to work on defense. Somewhere I still have screen shots of the little hobbit swinging his club at that clops  . <br />
<br />
LAKE RATHE: I forget the exact level I went here, but the Aviak spawns are tasty! I went somewhere around lv. 16-22. The two spawns in the towers by the Arena are the best camp. Aviak guards on 6 minute timers. At lower levels, you will need a partner to take the 2 spawns. However, there is a nice single spawn at the southern side of the zone. There is what looks like a diving board on the island with the stone tower with the nasty skelly in it. On this diving board, a single Aviak Guard spawns every 6 minutes if you keep killing them. No roamers, no worries. Very, very nice solo spawn for some quiet, relaxed leveling. At the lower level range, just worry about killing the Aviak. But as a priest class, as I leveled around 20-21, I recall using this single Aviak Spawn to work on my melee/defense skills. Very nice practice partner.<br />
<br />
LEVEL 20-35. Favorite Zones: High Hold Keep, South Karana, Warslik Woods, Fironia Vie, Timorous Deep, Everfrost.<br />
<br />
HIGH HOLD KEEP. At lv. 20-25, you want to get into a Guard Room (GR) group at the bottom of the stairs in the basement. There is often a waiting list, like High HOld Pass orc group. Again, if the list is short, it is well worth the wait to get into the group. Fantastic exp. and ok loot here. A group of 6 can handle all the spawns in the large open room and the spawns from the side room (lookout room). You can ding a level every 5 hours of play here with a good group. Often folks designate a Master Looter (ML'er) to loot all corpses, sell, and split cash with group. Try to get someone honest with a high CHA. Oh, if you over pull, or get trained by the WR group (see below), you can train extras to the wizzie in the library room, go up the stairs to the bank level, then go up next stairs to the main level. First door on your left at top of stairs is a room where nice Wizzie dude waits. He nukes trains very, very well.<br />
<br />
HIGH HOLD KEEP, lv. 25-35. You can now go deeper in the basement into the Warrior Room (WR) and Seer Room. Again, very nice exp. These gobs hit hard! You need a decent group to hold the WR and/or SR. If you join a group there and there are only a few people, or they all at lower end of the level range, beware!!! You will be running trains by the GR group up the stairs!.<br />

EVERFROST: Levels 26-30. For the soloing Ranger or Druid, there is no better place to earn some cash (unless you a Trader  ) than hunting mammoths in Everfrost. Tracking allows you to find the mammoths quicker than other classes. Bind in Halas and head out to the frozen tundra, either in the north eastern or south eastern part of the zone. More mammoths tend to spawn in NE, but almost no competition in the SE. As a Ranger, I was able to fear kite the mighty mammoths at 26---just do not pull the even cons. By 27, they all dk. blue to you. The tusks, the main reason to be there, sell for between 7.5-10 pp eash, depending on CHA. Bring a Giant sized container to put them in. Save all the mammoth meat you get. It is used in some great baking recipes, including Halas pie (lasts forever!) for which peeps pay decent coin. You kill giant wooly spiders and snow orcs to get more mammoths to pop. Good time to collect silk  You can group here, and folks oftem do, at the Mammoth platform. However, groups can be slow here. <br />
<br />
Everfrost Loot: Make sure you buy some +25 CHA steins in the bazaar (selling for 20 pp each or so these days). This will boost you to good selling prices for the tusks. Also, when not killing a mammoth kill EVRY spider you see (Giant and Large Wooly). In August of 2002, spider silks were selling for 5 pp EACH, or 100 pp a stack in the Bazaar!!!!! Between selling mammoth tusks, spider silk (at least 9-10 stack) and mammoth meat, I earned enough pp. to buy myself a pair of SCHW (10ac 22% haste) gloves for 4K. It can be done, for those characters with track.<br />
<br />
If you want to group in Everfrost, I suggest you take down the Icy Orcs. The are on a platform not far from the front entrance of Permafrost. Icy Orcs are in their mid-20's, except Redwind, who is closer to 30. There are 5 of them, static spawns. YOu can use harmony and single pull them. Be CAUTIOUS of Redwind, he is a Shadowknight and has a 300 pt harmtouch. The group healer should be ready to heal the puller immediately. Redwind drops a rune for the Ivy Etched armor quest, bracer I think.<br />
<br />
SOUTH KARANA: Levels 18-35. Nice zone! So much to hunt. If you are at the lowest end of the level range, head to &quot;KFC&quot;, the aviak village in the south part of the zone. Honestly, I never spent too much time there. The birds spawns are too few to make it worth it, UNLESS, you have a druid in the group who can harmony, some decent tanks, and a healer. Then you should head right up to the top of KFC itself, the big round birdroom at the top. Have the druid cast harmony and single pull some birds to you outside the room on the platform. Once the spawn has been broken, let a tank pull the usual way  . The birds spawn fast, 6 minutes, and there are a few spawns in the room, so a good group can have some non-stop killing action right there at the top. And there is a bird vendor on the platform that runs around this topmost room, that you can sell your looted items too (hehe).<br />
<br />
If you are level 16-20 and cannot get good KFC group, try to gather a group and bring them to Lake Rathe to hunt the gnoll.undead camp right by South Karana/Lake Rathe Zone line.<br />
<br />
Lv. 22-35. Ahhh, the gnolls spires outside Splitpaw in South Karana!!! One of the nicest leveling spots in the game. Group here lv. 22-30, solo level 30-35. Alas, many folks know this great spot and the gnoll spires are often overcamped. Try hunting here at off-peak hours ( I used to get on at 6 am EST...pretty uncrowded til about 11 or 12). The exp. and coin are very very nice. I solo'd here on and off from lv. 30-35 or so and enjoyed the nice loot and exp. You can sell at the vendor in the centaur village or the bird vendor at the top of KFC. Nearest bind for a Melee type is either the Gypsy camp in North Karana or the Arena in Lake Rathe.<br />
<br />
<br />
SPLITPAW--right off of South Karana and the dungeon in the middle of the Gnoll Spires. If the Spires are too croweded, trying getting a group inside. Get into a group that camps in the Bedroom or near the double doors (both near the beginning part of dungeon). Great hunting near this beginning part of the dungeon for lv. 28-35 folks, with a decent group. Watch out for trains and disorganized groups here though.<br />
<br />
WARSLIK WOODS: Ahhh, for you solo types, level 25-30. The caves in WW, the ones that lead to Dalnir, contain a 2 spawn and 3 spawn of Skulking Brutes, lv 21-25. They are some of the BEST soloing material in the game for their level (do not spawn fast enough for a group, on 14 minutes timers). They are great because: 1) they are static spawns, 2) give nice exp. 3) drop gems that sell for decent coin 4) are outside Dalnir and sometime you can wander into Dalnir and get a great group in a fun dungeon. Just a tip, these brutes ARE NOT SOCIAL--you can single pull them, they will not help each other. Also, the pathing can get buggy, if you get the brutes down to low health and they flee, they can flee into walls and get stuck. It helps to snare/root.<br />
<br />
TIMOUROUS DEEP: Solo or group, lv. 30-38. Kin to the Skulking Brutes in WW are the Golra's on the Iceberg in Timourous Deep. Large white apes, level 25-29, they spawn along the shore on the Iceberg in southern part of TD. Great Exp! (so-so loot). Cannot bind in this zone, just bind near docks of the boat that takes ya here. The iceberg is a tad out of the way, need to jump off boat and swim to the iceberg (and get onto iceberg from correct side of island), but trust me, the exp is very, very nice. Watch out getting onto the island, there is a golra hidden in the wrecked boat on the shore. Tis worth the travel to come here. And there are plenty of spawns and rarely many, if any, other folks hunting here. A nice little side trip from the well beaten path of Oasis/LOIO/OT/DL.<br />
<br />
FIRONIA VIE: Lv. 30-38. Ahhhh Kunark, wonderful Kunark. I posted extensively about this zone, and the &quot;Spot&quot; in it on the mid-level section of this board. A short recap: for levels 30-35, bring a group (recruit from OT perhaps). For lv. 35-38, VERY nice soloing. Head to NE corner of the zone, to canyon that heads to Swamp of No Hope zone. You will probably need invis/camo due to high Mob density you must run by. Where the canyon begins in NE corner, the ground changes color. Note this color change. Past the point where the ground changes color, no mobs spawn or wander!!!! This leads to very safe place to pull. Just before where the ground changes color, there are plenty of Drolvargs and Froggies. These provide a steady leveling diet and decent coin. I literally flew thru levels 35-38 soloing here. Save the no-drop canines to turn in for faction to the Capt. in FV. And unlike South Karana and the gnoll spires, there is hardly anyone EVER hunting here. This must be the single most underused dream hunting spot in the game! I cannot overstate what a nice safe place this is to hunt for excellent exp. It is well worth the effort of putting together a group that can play for a few hours and heading here at lv. 30-35. I encourage younger guildmates to make this effort. You will not regret it. Also, for you quad kiters, this is a perfect place to learn. There is a ton of space in the canyon to kite and learn this skill without the possibility of adds. If you get in trouble, the Swamp zone line is right there.<br />
<br />
OK, here's the full FV Sweet spot post, I finally cut and pasted it from other section of board.....<br />
<br />
SWEET FV SPOT: Level Range: GREAT exp. for lv. 30-38. Lv. 30-35 you probably want a group, lv. 35-38 great soloing or with a partner. Honestly, the exp. here just flows! I went from 35 to 38 (ok, I still need about 8 kills for 38 in no time! If you want a group, you may need to bring people. For some silly reason, hardly anyone hunts here. That's good for you, tis a nice peaceful exp. camp.<br />
<br />
The SpoT: Head to the NE corner of the zone, set up camp around pos 3500, neg 2400. If you look at a map of the zone, you will note this is where a &quot;valley&quot; leads to the Swamp of No Hope Zone (another valley leads to Swamp in NW part of FV zone). <br />
<br />
You should note that the ground changes color when you leave the main part of the zone and enter the &quot;valley&quot; area. This is important because NO WANDERING MOBS ever enter the valley area. Yup, by setting up camp in the &quot;valley&quot; area after the color change in the ground, you do not have to worry about adds wandering by. I usually set up camp by the rocks that are about 200 yards past where the ground changes color. Also, note that if you do get into trouble, you can run for the Swamp zone. Since there are no wanderers, this is an idea spot for casters/priests to solo, single pulling and root/rotting. Heck, my druid buddy learned to quad-kite on the mobs here. The valley has plenty of room. He was getting close to one orange bubble of exp. at lv. 36-37 quadding here.<br />
<br />
The toughest part for some folks might be getting to the camp spot. I have invis and sow, so no biggie. If you cannot cast invis or sow, I suggest waiting by the FV outpost area and soliciting the services of another player. The run thru FV to the camp spot requires running by many blue/yellow/possibly red mobs. I usually ran east up the coast (careful not to fall off the cliff) and then cut due north.<br />
<br />
The MoBs: The mobs are PLENTIFUL right by the camp spot. Where the ground changes color is a great assortment of MoBs to choose from. And just to the right, are ruins that are VERY highly populated. Truly, the pickings are wonderful.<br />
<br />
Drolvargs: 4 types to choose from, Savages (lv. 23-26), Scavengers (lv. 26-30), Growlers (lv. 29-32), Snarlers (lv. 32-36). They can hit pretty hard. They give NICE exp. The are the most populous type of MoB by the camp spot.<br />
<br />
Frogluks: Many, many types of Frogluks. There are Shamans, Knights, and Warriors (about 3-4 types of each class, Nok's, Tsu's, Ton's and Nal's? I forget the pre-fixes that differentiate them). They range in lv. from 26-35. Note that the Shamans can be pretty mean buggers. Unless you are at the higher end of the 30-38 range, I'd avoid pulling them unless they are in your way <br />
<br />
Leeches: Frenzied Leeches lv. 31-35 and Venomous Lamprey, lv. 22-26. I mostly ignored these since the venoumous ones seemed to be much more common.<br />
<br />
Forest Giants: If you have strong group or high enough level, there is a mini forest giant fort in the NE corner, with 3-4 giants. I have heard that one of them is far enough away from the others that you can single pull him without needing harmony. These forest giants are in the 34-42 range (mostly 34-3 . I never bothered much with them because they have high hitpoints, give blah exp., and rotten loot, unless you lucky enough to get a forest loop .<br />
<br />
Other Advantages: FV is truly like OT for good aligned characters (though evil characters could hunt here as camp is very far from outpost, no wandering guards like in OT). You can get a free bind from Soulbinder in dock area. There are trainers for MANY classes here. Fletching supplies available. Trade skills items available. You can sell and bank right HERE.<br />
<br />
Loot: Ooops, almost forgot, what's the loot? Well, not great, but not totally dismal either. The Drlovargs and Froggies drop between 5 gold and 5 pp each, average around 1-2 pp. They drop some nice gems, opals, peridots, black pearls. These are fairly rare and should probably be rolled on or evenly distributed if you hunting with a group since they sell for 10-20 pp each. Spell research pieces drop. On average, when I was soloing (made a little less when grouped with my buddy), I made about 120 pp in 3-4 hours. Not much, but considering the GREAT exp, not bad.<br />
<br />
THURGADIN MINES: lv. 36-40 SOLO or DUO--Melee or Caster. Bored on the frozen continent and want to kill some time? Head down to the Thurgadin Mines. MOBS are pretty sparsely spread out, rats, bats, goos, and spiders, lv. 29-32. Not enough mobs to justify a group here, but can solo or duo with a buddy. WARNING!!!!! Please read the post &quot;Stuck in the Mines-- A Hobbit's Tale&quot;. It's in the stories part of this board and members section. I got stuck down here, but taller folks should have no problem. The spot I got stcuk at was on the lower level, trying to walk on rails across a gap--you will fall thru unless levitated. You can climb up a ladder on theother side...but that puts you on OTHER side of gap. Taller folks can jump on rocks and jump out of where you fall in, hobbits too short. You can levi over the pit I believe. So, stay near top, avoid pit, r be tall and you have no problem. The spiders drop crystalline silk (needed for, among other things, making Thurgadin Gate potions). Bats dropd bat wings and some coin, rats drop whiskers and meat (hehe), the goos occassionaly drop dwarf heads.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OVERTHERE: L.v 30-40 (and lv. 16-20 if evil, or just daring). Yup, like Oasis and LOIO (Lake of Ill Omen), this is one of the more popular hunting zones in the game. reason? Great exp. and fairly easy to find a group. I highly recommend spending at least some time in this zone. Lv. 16-20 evil characters, head to the mudpit (much harder for good aligned classes/races to take boat to evil outpost, but can be done, and if you are careful, you can get a bind by the &quot;goodie&quot; wall inside town form another player). Lv. 30-40 folks, get a group at the &quot;ledge&quot; (near zoneline to FM on southern part of zone), SW corner group, or a group as SF zone area. Lv. 40-44, nice easy soloing here. Watch out at night for the Dragoon guards (DE's) who roam the zone. They are level 50 and can kill ya pretty quick. If you are evil, save the braids (no-drop) that drop form the Sarnak Bezerkers. You use them to get VS faction for a quest that gives you an OT hammer (when used in combat at +50 level, the hammer procs a port to OT).<br />
<br />
----Note: OVERTHERE Solo pull-to spot. Are you level 40-44 and just feel like soloing in OT? I found a perfect little spot to pull to. Between SF and the SW corner, run along the wall till you are opposite the last pillar from SF front area. Then head straight UP the wall. You will find a nice little ledge up there. You can see across the whole zone from this spot. It makes a very nice place to park a pet or simply pull to. Pulling here keeps you out of the way of adds and out of the path of Dragoons and peeps training Dragoons. When you run down the hill to pull a mob, run diagonally. Running diagonally helps reduce chances of falling and taking damage.<br />
<br />
EASTERN WASTES, lv. 35-45. Dobbin been getting tremedous exp. fear kiting Cougars, Dire Wolves, and Tundra Kodiaks near the bridge in EW. The loot is pretty bad, except some of the quest drops people will pay for (high quality pelts), but very nice exp. Also, for the young ranger, this is a perfect place to work on weapon skills while fear-kiting, esp. if you are like me and neglected piercing and 1HB.<br />
<br />
Slightly better loot and still nice exp. if you hunt Ulthork Hunters and Warriors and Walruses on the North Shore of EW. There is often a quad-kiting druid there hogging spawns but if no overcrowed this is nice hunting grounds. I recommend going along the north shore until you pass the dwarf huts, keep going west until you come to the 1st tree that is directly on the shoreline. The mobs do not wander past this trees, you will see a field of them straight ahead. The exp. is GREAT!. Save the ulthork horns or sell them to higher level people for 15-20 pp each. They are used for a quest in Cobalt Scar that results in some $$ gems. If you plan on doing Thurg. quests, save some of the odd meat that drops here, including rabbit meat from the snow bunnies.<br />
<br />
<br />
GREAT DIVIDE, lv. 35-42. Head to the Kodiak Caves!!! Will add more after I go there  . Suppossed to be tremendous exp. to be had.<br />
<br />
CRYSTAL CAVERNS, lv. 36-42. You get in by going inside the orc comound in the middle of Eastern Wastes. In the back of the compound is an outbuilding with what appears to be a large snowball on a pedestal. Click on the snowball to get it. I've only been near the entrance so far, at. level 36, but soloing the orcs is decent exp. and nice coin. The velium they drop sells very well in the bazaar!!!<br />
Also, the velium ore is used in making thurgadin gate potions. Spiders in here drop crystalling silk. One of the first mobs I ran into here was a named orc, the Herbalist. He dropped a 6 slot 25% weight reduction pack. This zone is know for having good loot in general, particularly the geos. There is a mini dwarf town with vendors and a bank. Can be dangerous to zone back out to EW then way you come in thru the back of the fort, since many folks bring trains to the CC entrance. The other way out though is at the bottom of the zone, past the higher level mobs.<br />
<br />
We did a guild &quot;bank&quot; raid in CC recently. WOW what a great zone for lv. 35-45 people to group in. YOu can fight orcs, tentacle terros, or the coveted Geos camp (they have nice gems). Anyone leveling up for exp. AND great loot in one zone, should head here 35-45. You WILL need to bring your own group.<br />
<br />
LEVELS 35-45. Overthere (see above), Dreadlands, Eastern Wastes, Nurga, Fironia Vie (solo-see above).<br />
<br />
<br />
DREADLANDS, solo level 38-42. Yup, great grouping here for lv. 40-50 folks as well. But for you solo classes, head to the Tundra Yeti caves at levels 38-42. I preferred the one in the NW corner of the zone. The Tundra Yetis (lv. 31-35) resemble Golra's or Skulking Brutes. Again, like many of the solo spots I post, these are nice static spawns. Loot here rotten, exp. is great. Watch out for the one that wanders in the cave. 14 minutes respawn rate on these guys. Nice relaxing camp. Group outside KC, at the ruins, lv. 40-50.<br />
<br />
NURGA. lv. 44-47. I do not know how good this spot would be for anyone but shamans. But Nurga Spiders have been a favorite soloing spot for shamans for a long time, with GOOD reason! Not enough spiders here for grouping though. Zone into Nurga, shrink yourself, head up waterfalls to the right, and cast invis on yourself. Go to the spiders caves (marked on eqatlas.com map). You will see a sleeping ogre, kill him to get him out of your way  , he is level 30 and needed for monk epic. He respawns every 2-3 hours, no biggie. Among your usual buffs, cast poison and magic resist on yourself. The spiders have bad poison and while most of them are Briarwebs, the occassional Strathmore spawns (these are necro's). There are two 2-spawns right near the sleeping ogre. Pull up a doggie pet and set him to guard. You may need to take both spiders at once to break the spawn. For some reason, my 1st night here, I was able to single pull with a slow, but yestderday, same methods were pulling both, so I started rooting one, pulling other and killing it fast, then taking the second. Battle can be close with two spiders, but get's easier once the spawn is broken. Once you break the 1st 2-spawn, break the other 2-spawn around the corner. Easy to hold all 4 spawns once broken, even at level 44. I went from one bubble into 44 to one bubble into 45 in about 5 hours of play here. Amazing exp. at these levels. Dinged 36 on them too. Tasty spiders indeed. <br />
<br />
BAH VERANT EDITED THE ZONE AND REMOVED THE NURGA SPIDERS!!!!!!!! There is supposed to be a future revamp of Droga/Nurga changing them to +50 dungeons like CT.<br />
<br />
SOL A., lv. 40+. Not for exp., but CASH! 40+ melee types can solo well in Sol A and get tons of FS drops. There is even a vendor in zone you can sell to. Slow but sure way of earning a lot of pp. Because of npc caster upgrades, you might want to wait until 45+ to farm here safely for FS. Watch out for the lava!<br />
<br />
TIMOROUS DEEP. Lv. 46-50. Ahhh remember your youth at KFC in South Karana? This will feel just like it. Head to TD, take the raft from Oasis and get off on Ogre Island. Head to the Spirocs!!! It looks almost exactly like KFC. The EXP. here is very, very good. I was fighting 3 types of Spirocs here: 1) Lightfoot 2) Wacthers and 3) Proven (rogues). They are approximately lv. 37-42 in level, Lightfoots being the lowest and easiest, Proven the hardest, with Watchers in the middle.<br />
Respawn time is approximately 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
There is a tower with a single spawn in it as you enter the &quot;bird area&quot; if coming in a direct line from where the Oasis raft drops you. There is also a wanderer that wanders from main bird ramps/complex past this tower towards Ogres.<br />
There is a single static spawn bird that pops on a hill near the beach, fairly close to the single spawn tower. Finally, there is a single spawn in the tower in the water (pull him with levitate on). These are the only single spawns in that area that I found. Plenty for soloing. Of course, you can pull from the main ramps/complex, but they always come in pairs unless you split the spawns. I found I could cast root on one at the bottom of ramp, and have the other one chase me until I was out of range for the other to remember me. I generally set up camp on the shore, below where the static bird hill spawn pops. I would pull up pet, haste pet and myself, pull with a slow, and DoT and melee them to death, amybe a nuke to finish them off.<br />
<br />
Loot here is basic, 5 silver to 6 pp, Spiroc Bone Dust (for Rogue poison I think), Runes, Words, and other caster spell component things. The pp does add up ok, not great. But the EXP is very, very nice. At a casual pace, I was able to level 47-49 here, spending about 8 hours per level of very relaxed pulling, mostly of the single spawns. I left at 49, to hit the Seafuries, but could easily ding 50 here.<br />
<br />
SCARLET DESERT, lv. 45-53. On the moon baby! Scarlet Desert (get port to Twilight Sea) is a nice exp. grind zone for grouping or solo 45-53. If under lv. 50, soloing may be a tad tough. Most mobs here lv. 35-48. You are gonna fight Bloodtribes, Scarlet Cheetahs, Scarlet Rockhoppers, Lightcrawlers, Sunflowers, and Sun Reavers/Reverants. Leave the other 4 little tribes of people along, you start out indiff to them and nice not to have every creature in the zone KOS to you. Plenty to pull without them. <br />
<br />
I like hunting on the north wall of zone, between the Bloodtribe caves. Bloodtribes drop ACRYLIA!!! It's heavy but SAVE it and give to your favorite smith/tailor or sell for cash. It is used for Acrylia Plate/Chain and Acylia Studded leathers. Superb and Flawless Rockhopper hides also drop here, save for Aryclia Leather armor (VERY nice 7 AC +10 Wis +5 dex +3 Str cloak is player made). <br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert sorta like DL, you can safely pull steady stream of blues. I found the place at 52. Wish I have found it sooner. I HIGHLY recommend this place for exp. groups lv. 45-53. You will need to bring your own group though.<br />
<br />
BURNING WOODS, lv. 45-53. Ahhhh burning woods, just next door to DL and Skyfire. 3 camps of note here. 1st is Hornets in SW corner of zone. They are level 35-48. Plenty to pull, great camp for soloer or a small group.<br />
<br />
Giant fort. Ahhh, more giants  These guys also in 35-48 level range. You can pull the fort and send a tracker out to get the named spawns for the Wurmslayer quest. The Ancient Giants and wurms (and hornets) are rumored to drop some +50 spells.<br />
<br />
Sarnak Fort outside Chardok in NE corner of zone. I just discovered this place recently. If you grouped, just started pulling. A 4 spawn waiting for you at the gate. If you soloing, invis. up and run inside past 1st 4 guards. I set up camp in the corner on the right hand side of the inner fortress. There are 2 sarnaks outside each of the large 4 doorways. Even though they are close together, you can single pull them. I pull with slow and bring them back to my doggie to chew on. Some of them are casters and they GATE. I found the best strategy to combat this is to keep a nuke mem'd and blast them when they get to about 1 and 1/2 yellows. That seems to be when they try to gate. Also, an occasional necro sarnak spawns. He does have a harmtouch. Not too bad, but can ouchies if you soloing or do not have a lot of hitpoints. The respawn time on these fellows is pretty fast, 6-8 minutes tops. If you run out of spawns you can pull from inside the tunnels. NOTE: the SECOND door/tunnel from the right has the entrance to Chardock, you go inside and take a cave like tunnel to your RIGHT. Chardok has a one way entrance. Once you zone in, you must go around a U turn in dungeon to get to exist. Plenty of mobs bewteen you and exit. I have tried invis to get by them and had it work, not sure if I lucky or they just do not see thru invis there.<br />
<br />
OCEAN OF TEARS (OOT). Lv. 49-54. Seafuries! Take boat from Freeport, jump off at the third island and kill the Seafury Cyclops! You can come earlier than 49 in a group, but these fellows have about 3500-4000 hitpoints, so use caution. I could not solo them until 49 and I got my 2 new +1100 point DoT's. Find a quiet spot on the shoreline and pull away! Use caution pulling, sometimes the clops cluster together and crisscross paths...you REALLY want to avoid adds due to huge amount of hitpoints. These fellows do not hit too hard given their giant size, max hit is for 72. Exp. is great for levels 49-50, I imagine it slows after that but have read many a thread where people state they stay here til 54 or 55. The Seafuries drop plat (1-6 pp) and the rare gems (Opal Braclet, Fire Opal, Fire Emerald, Mithril Bracelet) that sell for 55-95 pp each depending on CHA. If no one is camping him, there is a giant that spawns near the tents on the island, Gornit. Like all HG's he drops TONS of coins. Oh, avoid pulling the named clops, Quag. He drains you mana and is a pain to kill. Also, do not kill the tainted seafury unless you can kill his big brother, the lv. 55 Corrupted Seafury who spawns immediately after tainted dies.<br />
<br />
If you get bored killing clops, and no one else is camping, you can go to the next camp over and camp the Ancient Cyclops (pirate is placeholder I think). The AC ring Multiquests for about 4K these days. The ONLY bad thing about seafuries is that if you get adds or otherwise take on more than you can handle, there is absolutely NO PLACE to run. You cannot run out of range and have them forget you. You can root them, run, camp, and relog or just gate out of there.<br />

	<p>For 45-48 add Ten Mountains:<br />
<br />
Just outside of the grimling forest zone, or outside katta is your best bet.  Wolves and Bats require one VOS+Pet and your own melee and your set.  Low HP, good exp.<br />
<br />
45-51 Add LOIO bloodgills<br />
<br />
Underwater, i never fought em, but apparently about as good as exp will get at that level and are supposed to be amazingly easy, specially with JBB.<br />
<br />
51-54 City Of Mist<br />
<br />
Go to the U-turn, its the turn before you get to the castle doors.  You need to fight your way in though..but its only 4 mobs, which require an ebolt+melee to kill of easily.  No need to kill the mobs in the middle area, as you can get by em by huggin the wall.  Great exp, due to the ZEM, and amazingly easy.  Ebolt+Pet meant a dead mob.  You shouldnt run out of mobs if you pull both that area and the Gazebo, even though the spawn time is sub-par.  fantastic exp there!</p>

	<p>Just wanted to add a couple things about hunting seafurbies in OOT.  Quag can be handled ok if you have JBB and get a slow on him first.  I'd advise leaving the corrupted/tainted alone, the 2nd one (lvl 55) summons (found out the hard way).  The regular seafurbies are sweet xp + loot from 49 - 52, just watch out for those darn kiters, they'll run you over and not look back.<br />

	<p>wanted to make a note of just how good the mines in coldain were for me.  i've been working on getting coldain heads for my shaman because he's using thurg legs and they look weak, and he has wtov chain legs sittin in his bank.  i didn't want to mess with his coldain faction, so i brought my sk alt (34 at the time), to the mines in thurg.  <br />
<br />
essentially here's the run down:<br />
top level there are 4 spawns, 1 is up the platform as u enter the mines, 1 is right near the door, 2 are in the caverns to the left as u enter.  below there's 2 that are on the tracks, 2 by the ladder, and 3 that spawn in the back corner.  all of these have the potential to be a lesser tar goo, scuttle rat, scuttle bat, or cystaline spider.  at level 34 they were all blue, hittin for a max of 60ish.  not exactly sure on the spawn time, approx 10-15minutes i'd say.  i could keep the whole thing clear no downtime and at level 34 i was getting approx 3/4 of a blue per kill on these.  good up till 40, especially if you're looking for factionless coldain heads so you can improve giant faction w/o hosing coldain.  my sk twink is nothing amazingly special, has a 28 30 1hs weapon, approx 900ac, and a fungi, so this can be done by a shaman np.  and the great thing is it's usually not camped, as well as being right near a bank to drop off all those dorf heads <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" />.  <br />
<br />
also, any suggestions on where to go with the sk twink now that he's level 40?  *boggle*<br />

	<p>About the Kodiac Caves in Great Divide----<br />
Carefull!  If you dont pull out from cave you will get LOTS of adds.  Fluffy bears resist Cold spells very often so I suggest Root Rott.  I had a monk (40) and me (38) and we pulled nonstop.  I am now 1 yellow into 38 in just under an hour, after dining of course <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" />  Also the Velks Zone is right above the cave so you shouldnt ever die <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title="big grin" smilieid="4" />  Unless there is a train waiting on the inside <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" />  I hope this helps with your guide</p>

You cannot run out of range and have them forget you. You can root them, run, camp, and relog or just gate out of there. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>The trick here, is to know where the canoe's are. If you get in the canoes you loose agro on the Seafurbies. Just let them wander off then camp to clear agro.<br />
<br />
Also, If you have a JBB, come here at 45, with haste on the dogdog, and regen on myself, I just slow the Furby, and click away, I was getting one Yellow an hour with no down time.<br />

	<p>For 30 to 39, I leveled in the Mines of Nurga, at the cooking fire camp. It was great experience, and no one was ever in the zone besides me mostly. <br />
<br />
Also, the shroud of nature now drops there regularly. I have gotten about 6 of them now, one on each character since they are lore, and had 3 rot. I think they still sell for about 200 pp to 450 pp in the Bazaar on Erollisi Marr.</p>
