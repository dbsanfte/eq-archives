<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious to know why the price of the JBB dropped after the release of Luclin.<br />
<br />
I haven't heard of any new shaman item to replace it.  Is there one???<br />
<br />
Toh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dropped? On my server it went up. You can't find one below 20k. If not more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah what the heck are you talking about dropped?  Is 30-50k on my server, that is assuming you can even find one being sold, which you can't.  So they may as well be priceless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I paid 20k on TM after 2 weeks of non stop auctioning on a 2nd computer. At that point I would have gladly paid 30k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's slightly higher on Drinal, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Garreth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have not seen a JBB on sale anywhere for six months.  My bracer sits in my pack on raids, but I love useing the bracer for dueling or soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, if anything, I'd expect the price to go up because of AAXP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, on Bristlebane average price has jumped from 15,000 to 22,000.<br />
<br />
Sadly, I can't afford either yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It dropped temporarily on Rodcet but went back up.  I saw three for sale under 15k, but today you can't even find one for sale at any price.  My theory was that high level shaman were stripping their chars to fund twinked beastlords or Vah Shir, so the market was flooded for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, who yu been talkin too?  They still going for 30K in Ghey Fay last time I looked :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On Ayonae Ro they are actually going for under 15k, got mine last week for 10. Have never seen one for sale in e commons, but actually since our server started using a bazaar chat channel i have seen 3 for sale (the one i bought and 2 others). On a sad note there was someone on  my server who auctioned on the bazaar channel wtb jbb paying 15k for about 2-3hrs then he says he is camping out. About 15 mins later the other 2 jbb's start being auctioned for sale for 12k. Tough luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Finally found one on Lany's for 17k, guess I was VERY lucky! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I baught mine for 18k a while back at lvl 9... was chastized for spending the money on somthing that I could not use for a long time....<br />
<br />
Now I c them going for 25k minimum or so and am glad I grabed the one I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">20k a little more then a month ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">20k two nights ago, offered to me.  I had one already so . . .</div></div><hr />

That's just a market player.  Ignore him.  They lie to pick things up cheap just to resell them an hour later.  He'll tell the shaman wanting  to buy it, &quot;30K Man, they don't drop anymore and this one's pre-nerf too.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I bought my jbb for 19k last year.  The past few months i have not even seen one auctioned on TM.  I would say the going rate is anywhere from 15k to 25k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">All the druids, monks, find out the kitty shaman are l33ts and want one to twink with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Morell Thule is pretty damn cheap compared to some of them..<br />
