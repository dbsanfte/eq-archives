<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it's still the early levels, but I was stoked last night in BB, where I was the only healer in the group (16 Shaman), and kept everyone alive.  I know we aren't going to have the &quot;heal&quot; power of clerics, but these wards kick butt.  We were taking out the Captain and friends, along with 2-3 other named.<br />
<br />
Having a tank that can keep aggro, and everyone assisting MA is definitely important.  However, when that happens, the wards, plus a couple spot heals, can make us viable healers in groups, at least in the teen levels.  I was worried initially that I wouldn't be able to keep everyone alive.  But, we went a good 2hrs with no deaths.<br />
<br />
I'd hate to say it, but maybe SOE finally balanced the priest classes, which is something they could NEVER do, and NEVER WILL in EQ1.  Anyone in the 20's seeing if this falls off, or do we still remain viable?  <br />
<br />
I also didn't have to wait long to pick up a group, which is nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There have been no reports of falloff up through the mid 20's so far.  In fact, a lot of our spells in the 20's are heals.<br />
<br />
Yes, in EQ2, Shaman are Priests, and Priests heal.<br />
<br />
One of the most refreshing things in EQ2 is zoning into Antonica and seeing all the &quot;Group needs healer&quot;.  No, not &quot;Group needs Cleric&quot;.  &quot;Group needs healer&quot;.  They don't care what kind, because all three can do the job.<br />
<br />
It's also very refreshing to have polite conversations with the other Priests.  No hate because one is better than the other, just talk about how we can complement the other to the best of our abilities when grouped.<br />
<br />
Two Priests in a group is just sick sometimes.  A Druid and a Shaman in particular can be very tough to beat.  We bring not only a LOT of healing, but between them the Druid and Shaman offer a pretty significant amount of offense to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Although I don't think we'll get a slow that is as defining Turgur's, with our slow and wards, I would think we'd be one of the top choices for healing.  It's one thing to be able to heal.  Wards keep you from taking damage, and no one likes to see their health bar going down.  They also make soloing pretty viable, as well.  I'm able to solo oranges...takes just about all my power, but I'm pulling it off.  Yellows are no problem.<br />
<br />
I haven't cancelled my EQ1 accounts, yet.  However, if things keep looking good, I just may in another month or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rhodry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">for sure...<br />
<br />
my eq account is looking very dubious at this stage.<br />
I have sold all my alts gear and all tradeskill supplies I had been hoarding and given the wife the PP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well for now i cancelled one of my accounts, the other active purely cause its my main one. Playing EQ2 only lvl 15 but having so much fun again and it makes a nice change from all the mindless AA'ing in EQ1....Nice that i can log on for just 20mins do a couple tradeskill items, finish up quest or 2, and then come back after supper play for a longer stint....<br />
<br />
Not noticed any lag or problems with the game and so far its been smooth playing since day 1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree that EQ2 doesn't have that sense of desperation of living for the ding that EQ1 has.  With all the quests, you can choose to do one of those, or get one that will double dip the xp if you can get a group or kill quest mobs.  You can play for hours, or like what was mentioned, just stay on for a few minutes.  <br />
<br />
At this point, I'm debating opening a second eq2 account for two boxing.  I don't know if it would help that much.  I might be able to handle orange and possible red con solo mobs much easier (with a fighter type), but I don't see being able to handle the dungeons with just 2 characters, like I was able to do with many of EQ1's.  That jury is still out, and with the ability to get a group quickly in eq2, may not happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am not playing EQ2 currently, nor am I planning on it, but I wanted to add that for the first 3 or so years of EQ people were not looking for Clerics in EQ either.<br />
Shamans were viable healers up until PoP. <br />
The changes started affecting our healing abilities in late luclin with the introduction of the iCH for Druids and Shamans, but it was not until PoP that the term &quot;healing per second&quot; became popular due to change in game design and which relegated us to 3rd rate healers.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't want to rehash what has been said and talked over ad nauseum here, but merely pointing out, that EQ was just as Shaman friendly as EQ2 seems to be in regards to healing for the first 3+ years.<br />
<br />
So saying they &quot;learned&quot; from their mistakes and made all priests viable healers in EQ would not be correct. They just returned to its roots(from what I am reading).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I wish you all a lot of fun with EQ2 or whatever game you enjoy the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nah, they won't make the same mistakes again with EQ2.  The balance between the healers seems pretty on-target right now, and from what i've seen it stays that way up to 50.<br />
<br />
Now, there is a chance that we could get screwed with a new expansion, but I find it highly unlikely they will mess with something that is working well.  H3ll, the clerics aren't even whining about it, something must be wrong!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey all made lvl 22 this weekend..   But from my experience groups usually bring 2 healers..  Note I said 2 healers 8)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Almost 21 here and I can heal a group doing any normal mobs and dungeon crawls where the highest mob would be like a white^^ or maybe a yellow^^, depending on the tank.  I wouldn't want to be the only healer facing orange^^ mobs though as there would be too much downtime.  Two healers are needed for that really, but anywhere else I can heal just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Each of the archtypes can work together really well without overlap. If I'm with another healer, I just keep Ward up and the other healer takes care of whatever Ward doesn't catch. The only thing I've found that doesn't work so well is when a Cleric tries to use their reactive heal with my Wards. But since Clerics get good direct healing as well, it's not that much of an issue. The best combo, IMO, are Druid Regens and Shaman Wards. :)<br />

<br />
...brawlers and shamans too! :)  My duo monk partner and I make use of the ward so much that's it's just really sickening haha.  I would much rather have her tanking than any plate class, but that's just how Shaman's seem to heal in EQ2. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With some mobs, with a dual healer group, one healer is sitting on their butt looking for work.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, when doing yellow and orange ^^ mobs, especially the writs in Stormhold, they knock my Spectral ward off in about 2 seconds, and there's a 6 second recast, so another healer to step in and heal/shield the rest is needed until I can reward. <br />
<br />
I don't think shammies stack well, that's my only quibble, and it's a small one. You can have two warriors in a group but two shammies doesn't work. The wards overwrite each other and our dots/slows aren't great dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wait for Keening Haze and the Cold DoT.<br />
<br />
Shaman don't stack well, but we stack well with a Druid and if done properly, with a Cleric.</div></div><hr />

I'd be interested in seeing how Mystics and Defilers stack later on down the road once Qeynos and Freeport citizens start leveling in the same zones. Going over the spell line up, it doesn't look that bad to me. If the only thing to worry about is how you stack with other members of your subclass, I'm thinking it will be even less of an issue down the road.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have had some great groups with 2 shamans..  one wards and keeps the group alive..  the other heals MT and debuff's...  this strategy worked great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">That might be once you hit 21 and get a real debuff. At level 20, all I had was wailing haze and weakness, weakness even at app III doesn't seem to make a difference, and wailing haze at adept 1 gets resisted far too much and doesn't seem to make a big difference.<br />
<br />
The other issue is when about 5 mobs are pulled at a time, they are usually dying or dead by the time I get my slows on, and if they are mezzed, the wailing haze wears off before we get to them. With the long recast and the high resists, I'm just really not impressed with our slows in EQ2.<br />
<br />
That's ok though, our wards are kickass. And I'm very happy with our dot, Contagion. And group buffs and group heals and wards...<br />
<br />
I can solo well by myself, I can be a great healer in a group. But if I'm in a group with another shaman and I'm not the main healer, I am mostly wasted. Critters die before the dots really have a chance to get to them, and the debuffs don't seem to make a terribly big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">even below lvl 20 this strategy worked great.....  I hardly ever get resisted..  and the mobs don't die that fast..  Are you fighting weaker mobs or something..  my play group usually only targets yellow^^ or better plenty of time to get more than one slowed and weakened...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yea, on debuffs (and to a lesser extent DoT's) it really depends on what you are fighting.<br />
<br />
If the pull is a single, super strong mob, you definitely want to debuff / DoT it.<br />
<br />
If the pull is a group, probably not.  Individuals tend to die fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is intentional. Devs have stated they do not want double ups in classes in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm only 23 too and don#t know how the mid / higher end game is. But for the armor quest we are 4 guildes (2x defiler, 1x berserker, 1x bard) and we usualy add 2 others (guildies prefered). We do quite well. The other defiler does the heal part and I debuff and spot heal if tank goes down to orange or someone else gets hurt. This way we both can DD / DoT / melee too (only healing is a bit boring). Sure a druid or a cleric would be better then a 2nd defiler but it works too. If I only could get them to use HOs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have been impressed thusfar with our class at level 20.  I spend %90 of my experience time duoing with a same level brawler (20 right now) and we have zero problem taking on 4-5 mob pulls of &quot;group&quot; blues/greens, or 3-4 pulls of even con &quot;group&quot; mobs. The XP goes fairly well and the fights are a blast. I will say however that I am only using 4-5 spells regularly...Ward before pull/during fight, fast heal, contagion/slow/cripple on whichever mob shes tanking atm. Some mobs the debuffs seem to matter and some others they dont /shrug. <br />
<br />
Plus I get to be a big bear. And a hawk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I find that debuff is a lot more effective on a single, strong mob than on a group of mobs.</div></div><hr />

I guess Im just to used to EQ1 were you had adds you still slow'd n debuffed em all no matter how fast they die..  8P..

<br />
I do the exact same!  I'm a 21 Mystic and duo with a 21 Monk.  We have no problem killing yellows, oranges, green^^, or groups of 2-4 green/blue/white with about zero downtime.  I never need to directly heal, just ward before and make sure each mob is slowed and crippled, then keep contagion up on whichever mob is her target.<br />
<br />
Blue^^ mobs take about 1/2 of my power now, a blue^^ named will deplete almost both of our power, health, and hitpoints, depending on if it's in a dungeon or outdoor zone.</div></div><hr />

I'd hate to say it, but maybe SOE finally balanced the priest classes, which is something they could NEVER do, and NEVER WILL in EQ1.  Anyone in the 20's seeing if this falls off, or do we still remain viable?  <br />
<br />
I also didn't have to wait long to pick up a group, which is nice.<br />
<br />
I think it's an incredible sub.    <br />
<br />
Mystic have so many different roles they can switch in and out of in a group, and unlike the &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; I think we're pretty damned good at quite a few things. =p  I've already commented about combat in the Group Combat thread, but to re-hash:  extreme versatility.  Even at early levels, but there's a lot to look forward to IMHO.  Avatar is one of *the* end-game buffs to have!<br />
<br />
I found combat to be very exciting cause of that versatility. As far as priest classes the balance SOE was aiming for regarding the subs is pretty on-point.  Granted, I'm sure there's aspects that need tweaking across the board, but I think the archetype system is solid, and it's a great start.  Like anything else though, it's just my opinion and just based on my experience, but throwing it out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>refresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">All your comments sound great.  I started playing last night and I am already lvl 6.  The quests are awesome and the game plays very well on my comp.  I still really no very little about hot to play.  I grouped up with a friend last night to kill the Orc king on the good newb island and we did ok.  He died once on about 5 mobs that seem to keep adding by the bridge and I was unable to keep him healed.  I do like the fact that I can keep him targeted and heal as well as nuke the mobs without having to switch targets.  I have a lot to learn but I love it so far.  Someone told me that I have to trade skill my lvl 7 spells or something like that.  I got a lot of reading to do.  One thing I can say is with eq1 I pretty much had everything figured out by about lvl 10.  I am already lvl 6 now and I still don't know **** about this game.  With the harvesting, new trade skill method (that fact that you can die doing trade skills blew me away), you house, bulletin boards, furniture...I could go on for a long time.  I am very impressed with this game and can't wait to get home and play it tonight.  See you out there.</div></div><hr />

Yeah they where till all the PVP peeps ganked it all. If they keep PVP out of the game then they won't have to change the game for &quot;Balance&quot; of the class's. Right now its PVE which is how the game is set up. So heals are good across the board. Now if they decide to throw in PVP then you will see it all fudged up again.</div></div><hr />
