<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MurojTruewolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if I'm dropping this in the wrong forum, but figured General was..well, general enough.<br />
<br />
I've recently procured a friend's account who moved the char to Legends last October. I want to move these chars to my home server (he was on Lanys, I'm on Tunare). How do I go about getting the chars from Legends to Tunare? I've read the FAQ, I've done some searches on the forum, but I'm a bit lost.<br />
<br />
I've read that I have to cancel legends (which I plan on doing, since I don't want them there) and move the toon / toons back to their original server. Is that done automatically when Legends is cancelled?<br />
<br />
Any help or information you can give me is much appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kelgrael Snowstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To transfer back to the home server from legends what you need to do is cancel your legends subscription and then send a message to: legendsmoveback@soe.sony.com from the email address the account is currently registered to, with the station name (aka - the account name), the home server, and the names of the characterss to be returned to their home server.<br />
<br />
It is not an automatic process, and it can take anywhere from 1 day to two weeks.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MurojTruewolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Reading is essential. Cancelled Legends, emailed for character move. Hopefully, after the move back to the original server I won't have to wait the 6 months to join my friends<br />
<br />
Thank you again for the help.</div></div><hr />

If the billing information is yours and not the orginal (your friend's) they will not do the character transfer. If it is your friend's old account, you may want to give him the money and have him renew the account with his CC temporarily. Same goes for name changes. The billing has to be original.<br />
Please post if they do transfer the character under your billing info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MurojTruewolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I'm hopeful because a friend of mine moved his brothers char from Tunare to Torv last year, and I should assume the billing information was different. Still waiting to hear back on the Legends transfer, though I did recieve an email back from a CS rep saying I could just move straight to Tunare if I added in a note at the end saying the character was from Stormhammer. I did not mention the change in billing information, figured I didn't want to tempt fate.</div></div><hr />
