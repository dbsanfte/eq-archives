<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After having their 11th child, an Alabama couple decided that was enough (they could not<br />
         afford a larger double-wide). So, the husband went to his doctor (who also treated mules)<br />
         and told him that he and his wife/cousin didn't want to have any more children. The doctor<br />
         told him that there was a procedure called a vasectomy that could fix the problem. The<br />
         doctor instructed him to go home, get a cherry bomb (fireworks are legal in Alabama), light<br />
         it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10.<br />
<br />
         The Alabamian said to the doctor, &quot;I may not be the smartest man, but I don't see how<br />
         putting a cherry bomb in a beer can next to my ear is going to help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
         So, the couple drove to Georgia to get a second opinion. The Georgia physician was just<br />
         about to tell them about the procedure for a vasectomy when he noticed that they were from<br />
         Alabama. This doctor instead told the man to go home and get a cherry bomb, light it,<br />
         place it in a beer can, hold it to his ear and count to 10.<br />
<br />
         Figuring that both learned physicians couldn't be wrong, the man went home, lit a cherry<br />
         bomb and put it in a beer can. He held the can up to his ear and began to count.<br />
<br />
         &quot;1, 2, 3, 4, 5 . . . . &quot;, at which point he paused, placed the beer can between his legs and<br />
         resumed counting on his other hand.</div></div><hr />
