<br />
Apparently it has a -200 resist modifier, so it should land relatively easily. What is of greater interest is that it appears to stack with malos, so we will likely be able to debuff large targets by 110 PR. I assume that this will make our PR based spells much easier to land, and land for greater amounts more frequently. Hopefully that will improve our dps on raid minis and bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm a bit more cynical, Tug.  At the moment, I'm betting they're going to remove PR from our new malos upgrade, so we'll have to cast malos and the new PR/DR buff if we want to land slow and some kind of dps spell.<br />
<br />
I hope I'm wrong, but it would be in keeping with all the other bone-head ideas Rytan has about shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just want i want to do.  have to cast two debuffs before i can even begin to land dots.. <br />
<br />
mobs are mostly dead now before we can land dots with casting one debuff and slow.  you will never be able to cast both in a normal fight unless its on a mez'd, rooted, or boss mob.  <br />
<br />
more then likely thats just to make the spell ALOT less likely to bounce, almost a lure without it being one.<br />
<br />
why dont we get a -200 debuff like the druids get for fire btw?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One thing it could help with is our burst DPS against bigger single battles thus making it situational.<br />
<br />
Have a couple Shamans on a raid... hell even a few... Share duties on Malos(inia) and PD. Then cast rain spells.<br />
<br />
Our new one does 845 dmg per wave.<br />
<br />

<br />
I know it seems they get resisted a lot but well it's possible these debuffs could help a lot.<br />
<br />
That's over 2500 dmg per Shaman if all 3 waves hit. Not too shabby.<br />
<br />
but like I said, situational and IF this goes live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If what you say is true Chutoi and they gimp Malos this way, then its time to go play WoW and think about Rytan everytime you kill a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Of course, what ever the spells end up being, they still have to drop.  And from past experience, that would be on the rare to very rare tables. heh.</div></div><hr />

We have burst DPS?  Since when?<br />

They dont seen to get resisted alot...they ARE resisted alot.  Rain spells have a hard coded 20% resist rate.  It is rare that I get all 3 waves to land on a single mob even after Malos/sinia.  So much so in fact that I count on Tears doing 1300 damage, not 1950.  On the off chance that all 3 waves DO hit I just count it as a lucky strike.<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to an upgrade in it though.  Its the only viable (IMO) nuke that shaman get, so an upgrade is always nice.</div></div><hr />

As long as Malos debuffs Magic, I will stick with Curses.  Poison is still way too much aggro in short fights after a SLOW.  If I had Foci for DoTs it may be a different story, but I don't :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Necro version of it has got a -200 DR check as well now, but lasts much longer. I am sure this spell isn't even close to being finished.<br />
<br />
I love how Shamans never got resist mods for their DoTs because of the malaise line, then at one point they started to hand out resist debuffs to other classes and now they even get lure ones.<br />
<br />
Rytan, put resist mods on our DoTs already for ****s sake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Screw this spell, it's just another waste of a buff slot. just forget it and put a further -55 on all nec/shaman PR/DR DoTs. The last thing we need is another spell to waste time on before we can do anything remotely worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>philni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It seems to me SoE is spending time tuning a spell that shouldn't exist.  Is this the continuation of our disease debuff line?  The last one debuffed DR for the same amount and is unresistable...  So this spell is only an upgrade if it stacks with Mal*.  On the other hand, if our DR debuff line will continue to be upgraded it will overwrite this spell.<br />
<br />
Honestly, as a young shaman, I felt the Mal line shouldn't have included PR but rather have PR debuff included the disease debuff line.  Seemed to make sense and make the later a little more useful.  Heck, include some MR debuff as well to make it symmetrical to Mal* and now we are talking.  Of course, having DR included in the Mal line would be better but at the time spells could only have 4 effects.<br />
<br />
Now that the limit for spell effects has been increased (or am I having a blonde moment here?), wouldn't it just make more sense to include DR into Mal?  That leaves us with 2 debuff lines (disease debuff and cripple) which could be converted to the new debuffs that Brenlo? alluded to notably reducing NPC skills like Dual Wield, etc...<br />
<br />
Oh, and I agree with everybody, it's about time our DoTs got some innate resist modifiers like other classes.</div></div><hr />
