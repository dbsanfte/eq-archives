<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hotelseven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok Ive been playing EQ off and on for a couple years and have never had a problem connecting or staying connected. All of a sudden over the past week and a half, I cannot seem to leave myself logged on while in the Bazaar. It randomly boots me right to the desktop (instantly shutting down EQ) or it boots me out to the loggin screen. Im on Cable internet and have the latest drivers and Windows updates. Has anyone else experienced this?<br />
<br />
Any feedback would be of great assistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Happens to me all the time. Sometimes I can stay on for a couple of days, and other times it will kick me after 10 minutes. Never seen a pattern to it either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>slimb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been rock solid in the bazaar until LoY came out.  I know the baz randomly crashes right out and alternately LD's many people at a time recently.  I'm thinking with the release of LoY and increased twinkage, the bazaar took a performance hit for a while that caused problems.  In the past few days it's been solid again, but we'll see how that goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimmlukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is a problem with the BadWord filter in the bazaar: some /auc and /ooc's have an error that freaks out the badWord filter.<br />
<br />
You can use:<br />
/filter badword<br />
<br />
to toggle the badword filter and turn it OFF.<br />
<br />
This solved the problem of getting disconnected from the Bazaar for me - was happening on a regularly IRREGULAR basis since LoY came out.<br />
