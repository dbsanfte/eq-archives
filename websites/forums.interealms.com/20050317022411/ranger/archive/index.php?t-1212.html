<br />
'bout a week ago, my browser (ie v6, on win XP home) developped a very annoying character trait.  whenever I click a link on a web page, if it's the type that spawns a new browser window, all I get is a blank window ... the URL doesn't get passed to the new window from the link.  this is a serious pain in the ass, not to mention time consuming to copy / type-out the URL's I'm trying to get to .... so, anyone have a clue?</div></div><hr />

Then click delete files.  Also go to the advanced tab and click restore defaults.  That is a few basic steps that might make a difference.</div></div><hr />

It's my computer dammit! Let me do what I want with it.</div></div><hr />

All the repair does is make sure your files have the correct date and version.  Since there is only one out they have to be right.<br />
<br />
The other thing you can do is click start&gt;run and type &quot;sfc /scannow&quot; minus the quotes.  This will run the scan disk and check all your files.</div></div><hr />

I finally got it working the way I want it, so I'll be damned if I'm gonna go through all that again just for XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toraque-Rathe</div><div class="date">04-13-2002, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same issue, with Win98SE and IE6 . . . if I played with it, I could sometimes cause it to crash, and when it did, the error was generated in an RPC dll.  RPC stands for ‘Remote procedure call’ which is, unfortunately, something I’m not greatly familiar with.  I was unable to fix it, even after reinstalling practically everything on my system, and copying new versions of all the RPC files onto my machine.  After a while, in a drunken fury, I slicked and reinstalled my machine.  I don’t think it can be fixed, really.<br />
<br />
My working assumption is that someone’s spyware or equivalent thrashes RPC.  Neither ad-aware, Norton anti-virus or zonealarm helped in the slightest, however.</div></div><hr />
