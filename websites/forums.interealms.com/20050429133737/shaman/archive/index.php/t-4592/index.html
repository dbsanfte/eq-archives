<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sophylis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why is every modder working with the original EQUI_Animations.xml? This way it is harder to 'mix' different mods and you have to 'fix' it every time VI patches the original xml file.<br />
<br />
The animations do not have to be declared in EQUI_Animations.xml, they can stand in any xml file you want.<br />
<br />
So modders should create a new xml file. Call it like the mod it is for.. for example mybuff_animation.xml. Add one line to your EQUI.xml file before any file that uses the new animations:<br />
<br />
&lt;Include&gt;mybuff_animation.xml&lt;/Include&gt;<br />
<br />
In this file, define everything you need for your mod (textures usw), give them new names if you want to change existing definitions. Instead of A_DividerVertical call it A_NewDividerVertical (or whatever you want). Then in every file where you want to use that new definition, change that reference to the new name. <br />
<br />
So if VI patches anything, all the user have to look for is the EQUI.xml file... and if that changes, only small corrections are neccessary, as every skin still uses the original EQUI_Animations.xml and should be less vulnerable to patches<br />
<br />
So i hope every modder out there will rethink their mods and redo them to be more user friendly.</div></div><hr />

Why are people doing it that way? Because we are kinda learning things as we go. Verant didn't provide a how to on this and didn't tell us what files they would be regularly modifying. So people did the logical thing. Changed or added animations where the animations where. <br />
<br />
As people get a better understanding of things I think you will see more things like what your talking about that will ensure less problems when verant changes things. Altho hopefully verant will be changing things less as time goes on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess i just was a little angry as i have to redo most mods i am using over and over again.<br />
<br />
I have different mods that all changes the animations file, so it wasn't that easy to keep 'my' skin running with all those updates from VI.<br />
<br />
So i hope my post helps others to find out about the possibility to do the animation changes in another way..</div></div><hr />
