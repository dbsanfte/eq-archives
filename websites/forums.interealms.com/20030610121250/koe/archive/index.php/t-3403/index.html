<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rowandil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On my second attempt on the final combine on the 7th prayer shawl I succeeded tonight! I would like to thank the KoE members that assisted me in getting Royal Kromrif Blood yesterday in Kael. I would also like to thank Larain who helped me get the needed components from Siren's Grotto, along with extras which I ended up needing. :) I had never met Larain before but he was soooo helpful and we ended up grouping throughout an afternoon and evening. I'm so relieved!<br />
<br />
If anyone has any questions about the shawl quests, I'd be happy to answer them. It takes a lot of patience to get all those tradeskills up. I only managed to get tailoring up to 146 when I finally made the 7th shawl. I figured that it would take longer to get up to the trivial level for the 7th (162) than it would to recollect components to make another attempt.<br />
<br />
Now if only there was a graphic for shoulder items. :(</div></div><hr />

It was a pleasure beating those giants for the Blood :) I'm happy that you were able to make the 7th shawl too, it was quite disheartening when I heard it failed on the first attempt.  But it was a good excuse for us to go back and whack the crap outta the giants again :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Grats Row :). These shawls sound like they are a good thing to have. Is there a way that someone can post the how to's in the library or something? From Shawl one on up if possible?</div></div><hr />

I do have a question how can I get the dorfs to like me to where I can walk into the city and what is the min faction level you can be at to do the quest? I've been killing giants and wolfs and getting some faction but didn't know if there were a better/faster way to go.</div></div><hr />
