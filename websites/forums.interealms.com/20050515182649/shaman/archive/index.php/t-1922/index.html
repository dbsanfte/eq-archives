Arkand Eagleseeker's Guide to Canni-dancing <br />
<br />
First, let me make sure you all know there's nothing secret about the canni-dance. Verant is well aware of it's usefulness and the design of Cannibalize may have been intended for this use. In fact, one friend of mine was taught the dance by a GM (not a guide, a Verant employed server GM). <br />
<br />
Canni-dancing is, to put it mildly, annoying. It requires significant micro=management, interferes with conversation, and causes the other healers in the group to be constantly on edge; however, it has significant advantages for long term and emergency mana production. <br />
<br />
First, let's understand how mana is generated. Every 6 seconds, the server sends a HP and mana update to the client. The amount of HP and mana gained are dependent on a number of factors, but the important one for the canni-dance is sitting state. If the PC is sitting at the moment the server does it's calculations, the PC recieves sitting HP and mana regen. The number for HP is dependent on level and spell/item regeneration. The number for mana is dependent on the meditation skill, clarity/manasong, and the rare Flowing Thought items. The equation for meditation seems to change over skill, but at 200+ skill, it seems to run at skill/10, capped at 25/tick. Lower levels have reported skill/5, so the effect of meditation skill may suffer from diminished returns. Regardless of the actual lower level med-&gt;mana equation,. skill/10 will be used in this document. Further, a tick is defined as 6 seconds long, and begins with the HP/mana update. <br />
<br />
Cannibalize first comes into the Shaman's life at L24. Med skill at this point should be 125, or 12 mana/tick. Cannibalize converts 50HP to 20mana at this point (casting time is 2 sec, recast 5). So merely by standing and chain-casting Cannibalize, the PC gains mana much faster than medding. There is a HP cost, of course, but emergency mana production is greatly advantaged. In 15 seconds, the Shaman can gain enough mana to cast the L19 Healing spell, which could be a lifesaver. The actual maximum mana production rate of Cannib alone is 20x6/5 = 24 mana/tick and the HP loss is 60/tick. There is, however, another way to use Cannib that will serve to greatly increase long term mana production. <br />
<br />
One can notice that the casting time, 2 seconds, is significantly less than a 6 second tick. That means cannib can be cast immediately after a HP/mana tick, and then be sitting down long before the next mana tick arrives. The recast time is 5 seconds which means the spell can then be cast after the next tick. By casting Cannibalize in between the HP/mana regeneration ticks, the SHM can gain 12+20 mana per 6 second tick, or 32 mana per tick. This exceeds the straight chain-casting of Cannib by 33%, making it faster mana production. Additionally, the PC loses 50 HP/tick rather than the 60 of chain casting Cannib. This is more mana/second for fewer HP/second. It also limits the harm of fizzles, since a SHM can recast the spell before the next tick, thereby maintaining the higher mana regen rate despite fizzling. With straight cannib casting, fizzles decrease overall mana production rates. This is the Canni-dance -- casting Cannib between the HP/mana regeneration updates. <br />
<br />
To Canni-dance, first go to full screen 800x600 mode. You want to be able to bring up the transparent inventory window, which has this very convenient HP report for you. Mana and HP are regenned at exactly the same time, so that HP meter will serve to tell you when the tick occurs. So, if you aren't damaged, stand and cast Canni once, then sit. Wait until you see the HP's increase, then stand, cast Canni, and sit. Some people create a hotkey to do this (/sit off, /cast x, /pause y, /sit). You'll need to experiment to find the proper /pause value. I have found that in raid situations, there's too many lag spikes to trust a hot key, so I personally don't use it. To each his own, use what you think is best. After that, just wait for the HP to increase again and repeat. Be careful, you CAN kill yourself with Cannibalize, and it costs exp. <br />
<br />
If you can't enter 800x600 mode, then you'll have two options for detecting HP/mana updates. The first and best is for teh SHm to self-target and watch the higher resolution HP update in the selection bar. The second is to watch teh lower resolution HP bar under the SHM's name. The worst possible choice is to stare at teh mana bar, since the mana bar updates in smaller increments than a regenning HP bar. <br />
<br />
The problem with Canni-dancing at L24 is inefficient healing. Regen is the PC's most cost effective healing spell, at 5mana/tick for 10 minutes, or 500 HP for 100 mana. Converting that 500 through Cannib becomes 200 mana/10 minutes, and when you subtract the cost of regen itself, the actual mana gain is at best 100mana/10 seconds. If the PC has access to healing through other means (Bard healing song, for instance), more mana can be generated. <br />
<br />
At L39, the Canni-dance really starts to take off. Chloroplast increases the regeneration to 1500HP for 200 mana. Through Canni 1 (at this point, 50-&gt;23mana), this converts to 690 mana, minus the 200 casting, is net 490mana/15 minutes. Cannib 2 converts 67-&gt;28mana, for only 626, net 426 mana per 15 minutes. Now, that would seem to indicate the Shaman should stick with Canni 1 over Canni 2, but Canni2 provides more mana faster in emergency situations, and cuts down the number of Canni castings by 33%. This improves the micro-management a little, and increases the Shaman's communicativeness. Overall, teh spell may not be more efficient, but it's easier to use and worth the downside. <br />
<br />
L51 also inherently aids the Canni-dance by increasing sitting HP regeneration from 2 to 4. This occurs again at L55 when it rises to 5/tick. Any regeneration increase converts into mana for the shaman <br />
<br />
Regrowth at L52 is the next boon to Canni-dancing. at 2250HP over 15 minutes. This converts through Canni 2's 67-&gt;31mana to 1041mana, or net 704mana/15 minutes. <br />
<br />
And at L54, Canni 3 converts 74-&gt;36mana. This increases mana production to 1094/15 minutes, 794 net. The biggest problem with Canni 3 is the horrible fizzle rate. It runs about 20%, so the Shaman finds chained fizzles common. Don't try to cast a fourth Canni, or you'll miss the med tick. <br />
<br />
This continues until L58, where the Canni-dance ends with Canni 4, right? Wrong. Canni 4 changes the rules, but the canni-dance can continue, should the Shaman desire it to. Canni 4 changes the casting time, so that many think the Canni-dance stops being possible, but it only changes the details of the dance. Canni 4 is a 2.5 second cast with 7 second re-cast, and the conversion ratio is the same as Canni 3, 148-&gt;82 instead of 74-&gt;41. (Other spells can be cast 3 seconds later, but Canni 4 is grey for 7 seconds.) Canni 4 greatly improves the fizzle rate, down to about 5%. Since 7 seconds exceeds the 6 second tick, it can't be used for sequential ticks, but obviously could be used every other tick. So first and most obviously, the Canni-dance continues through L59 at one cast every other tick.</div></div><hr />

Wildaar:  hehe- I just wanted to make sure the stuff from the original &quot;FAQ&quot; thread was in there- didn't want Fascaser to think I was snubbing him.  ;)<br />
<br />
Anyone know if there's a &quot;definitive&quot; race discussion thread or equipment thread?  If so, these would seem to be good candidates- these are definitely questions that get asked frequently.</div></div><hr />

But on my post I only offered those links as &quot;Examples&quot; of FAQ material.    I'm sure Wildaar could whip a few up ... along with the rest of the senior reader/posters of this board.<br />
<br />
Those that would say &quot;Use the Search&quot; or just read more ... the goal of a FAQ is to provide to the causal reader a outline of commonly asked questions.   <br />
<br />
And heck ... this doesn't even have to be a FAQ ... it could be a Handbook or whatever ... section for this board.    I just wanted to get all these posts that have been stuck plus some others that need to be ... off into a separate section for ease of viewing.    <br />
<br />
Lastly ... as to Soupypoopy post on getting top end spells ... At least he attempted the effort.   Maybe it's not polished but the general outline of it hit the mark ... IMHO at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Telling people to lie &amp; scam their way into getting a lower than market price for a spell &quot;hits the mark?&quot;  I can't see how that even comes close to any mark I can imagine...<br />
<br />
What's so wrong with this:<br />
<br />
How to get (insert missing rare spell here):<br />
<br />
1.  get off your dead butt &amp; kill stuff that drops spells<br />
2.  get off your dead butt &amp; kill stuff that drops money or valuable loot<br />
2a.  sell valuable loot<br />
2b.  save the money<br />
3.  /auc wtb (insert desired spells here)<br />
4. contact a 1st or 2nd tier guild and ask their spell banker if there are copies of the spell you need available for sale.<br />
5.  repeat steps 1 - 4 as needed.<br />
<br />
Note:  to accomplish step 1 you may need to reevaluate your current guild affiliation - if your guild can't deliver, find one that can.  if you're not willing to do these steps then kindly stop whining.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as what should go into the FAQ, I'm not sure that there's much that could go into it beyond what's listed already:  slow guide, spell guide, magelos, solo guide are all fine.  Maybe some sort of getting started (something on the order of the creation guide caster's realm updated with current sta vs wis thoughts), but i'm not sure that there's been an epic-proportioned thread started on this one since the board wipe.  Most stuff that gets discussed here doesn't seem to be easy to pigeon-hole I think...</div></div><hr />

I would say something between you and Souppoopy.    At least the first half of his post.    The second half is wrong ... sadly ... it ruined the idea of the post.    But follow up posts on that thread continue the idea.    The idea ... is &quot;You don't HAVE to get a huge guild-only raid together to get your spells&quot;.<br />
<br />
That would make a great starting point for guide.   In fact ... run with our outline ... and see what happens.   I've read your stuff ... and know that you could put something together that covers all the issues.</div></div><hr />

Wow -- I thought that this was a joke, but sadly you are actually encouraging people to leave their guilds if the guild can't hand them everything. Sometimes the small guild atmosphere is more desirable to some. Sometimes being one out of 120 isn't what people want. <br />

don't misunderstand me - there's nothing wrong with small guilds and many people are very happy in small, friendly guilds that cannot take on any tough mobs by themselves.  i'm merely pointing out that you basically have two options: kill the big mobs that drop the big spells (usually this requires a strong guild) or scrape together the cash and buy the spells.  <br />
<br />
when you're in that position, you have to evaluate what your priority is.  if you decide that the small guild route is for you, then you can't (or at least you shouldn't) turn around and whine that you can't get your spells.  if you go the big guild route, then you can't whine that no one wants to hold your hand and sing kumbaya or listen to your boring stories about how your day was.<br />
<br />
it's your choice to make and there isn't a wrong way to go.  it's merely a matter of how you decide to enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />

You're missing the point. These are NOT your only two options. Hello? Are you reading the posts that you're knocking? I suggest you refresh yourself on my post where not only I, but several others agreed that Torpor, Malo, Bane and Pox can and do drop for single groups.<br />

And that's not even mentioning the various other ways of obtaining the spells. <br />

<br />
First, let me start by saying what i should've said in my previous post:  the whole &quot;guide&quot; that i posted was a bit tongue-in-cheek, sorry if you didn't read it that way.  even so, the core of that post is still valid.<br />
<br />
To answer your question, yes - i have read the posts and I'll concede that there is a 3rd way to get the spells - the spell fairy, or some other kind soul might just walk up, slap some random ultra rare spell into a trade window &amp; click trade.  Barring sheer dumb luck (the spell fairy, finding it on a vendor, etc.), it comes down to two options:  loot 'em or buy 'em.   <br />
<br />
if i take your advice and lie / scam my way into a sweet low price on a spell, i'm still buying it.  if i get lucky and buy it off a vendor for cheap, i'm still buying it.  if i have some valuable that i trade for the spell, i'm still in effect buying it.  to loot the rare 59 &amp; 60 spells, you have to put yourself into a position to fight the mobs that drop them.  like i said before this USUALLY (check dictionary.com if you need a refresher on this complex word's meaning please) requires a strong guild that can support you, but can be accomplished with good alliances or by camping the few non-raid type mobs that drop our spells (GWurms, Chottal, juggs/reets/protector/tola, etc.).  i didn't say that you HAD to have a strong guild, i said it helps.<br />
<br />
i'll just mention that i'm not in an &quot;uber&quot; guild and don't ever plan to be.  my guild is the perfect size for me - large enough that we can all support each other in doing the things that we'd like to do at the high level, but small enough that we can get to know each other and be friendly &amp; fun.  it's all about finding the group of people that fit your style.  it's each individual player's call whether that is an uber guild, a small band of friends or somewhere in between.<br />
<br />
i'm backing out of the discussion now because soupy doesn't appear to be the type of person that can engage in an actual dialogue. i'm not going to drop down into inane name-calling and ranting mode.  besides, i don't want to further hijack Bigguss's effort here :)<br />
<br />
cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The advice on where to camp the spells in soupy's thread is fine, but the trading parts are rather shady IMO and should be left out of any 'guide' posted.  I think the guide should be representative of the ideas that the community supports by majority and some o the questionable trading methods here are a bit to controversial for that.<br />
<br />
A basic equipment section might be nice, but also is quite subjective.  Perhaps the best thing would be to explain the reasoning behind why people look for equipment with specific stats.  <br />
<br />
i.e.<br />
****************************************************<br />
Shaman Equipment and what stats to look for...<br />
<br />
Wisdom at lower levels is largely not as effective as hp or straight mana items.  The amount of mana gained per wisdom is relative to level, thus at level 1-20 or so, you gain a very small amount of mana for each point of wisdom.  However at level 50+ you gain 10+ mana for each wisdom up to 200, and 6 mana for each point of wisdom thereafter.  Generally speaking, many shaman do not feel that it is as important to get 200+ WIS as it is to maintain a decent amount of ac / hp (at all levels), and resists (at higher levels).  Lastly, no shaman should ever have a book in hand... EVER! :p<br />
<br />
Hitpoints (hp) are generally considered the one stat that is always useful for the obvious reasons as well as the fact that shaman have the cannibalize line of spells.  Canni converts hp into mana, with the effect that a larger hp pool is effectively a larger mana pool.  A larger hp pool, of course, also makes for a greater chance at surviving any fight. :)<br />
<br />
Continuing on with that, hp regen is highly prized by shaman because it allows one to cannibalize more often, thus increasing their mana regen.  hp regen items such as the Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate (5hp / tick regen), Fungus Covered Scale Tunic and Fugnus Patch Vest (15hp / tick regen) are considered some of the most useful chest pieces in game for a shaman below level 60 or lacking the spell Torpor.  The hp regen is generally considered more useful than the stats one could gain from any other chest piece.<br />
<br />
AC is also considered very important for a shaman due to the fact that one of our primary roles is slowing a mob, which in turn tends to aggro the mob causing the shaman to have to 'tank' for short periods fairly often.  More ac = less damage taken = more hp for canni = more mana = greater efficiency.<br />
<br />
At higher levels, resists become increasingly important as the mobs you fight will be casting spells, have various procs and AE attacks as well.<br />
<br />
****************************************************<br />
<br />
Well, that's my take on shaman equipment anyway.  Perhaps, listing some common low-mid level items for examples would be useful, but since new expansions constantly make for better items at nearly all levels, coupled with the constantly droppig prices on currently high end equipment, making it more accessible to lower levels... I don't see actual equipment listings being useful since they'll be outdated constantly.</div></div><hr />

Let's not derail this one into the same discussion as what is taking place in that one. ;)<br />
<br />
things for the FAQ:<br />
<br />
A comprehensive list of formulas that the shaman needs.  such as this little gem:<br />
<br />
Shaman AC = 1.575 * Raw AC  <br />
(courtesy of old Blud'n'Gutz)<br />
Now I can compare JB Gaunts to CC Gaunts and know exactly how much I'm going to gain.<br />
<br />
Also, formulas for max Defense, 1HB, etc.  We all know Defense caps at 200...but what's my max at lvl 27?<br />
<br />
Alchemy is capped at (lvl - 24) * 5<br />
<br />
The formula for Mana from Wis...something like 1 Wis = Lvl/5 + 1 ??? I can't remember.<br />
<br />
How many HPs will I get from 1 pt of STA at lvl 40?  lvl 50?<br />
<br />
If we could gather up all of these various formulas it'd be great.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Here's a set of formulas (and a table) that explain the relationship between agility, level, and AC.  This can be helpful for planning future gear purchases, or for explaining to buffees what AGI is doing for them.  You can definitely see the impact of getting your AGI above 75, and of maxing your defense!<br />
<br />
Also, this fits very well into a discussion of how AC is calculated in general.  Grabbed this from the warrior boards some time ago:<br />
----------------------------<br />
AC = (Avoidance + Mitigation) * (1000 / 847) <br />
<br />
Now, Mitigation, if you're a non-monk Melee class is: <br />
(Raw AC From Buffs / 4) + (Defense/ 3) + (Raw AC From Equipment * 4 / 3) <br />
<br />
And if you're a caster, <br />
(Raw AC From Buffs / 3) + (Defense/ 2) + (Raw AC From Equipment + 1) <br />
<br />
Avoidance = the absolute value of (AGIFactor + Defense * 16 / 9) <br />
<br />
&quot;Agility Factor&quot; by agility and level<br />
<br />
(putting this in a quote so the table will format properly)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">This is a description (from parsed logs) of how damage is computed, both for mobs and players.  In the thread are a collection of values for mobs- and it seems many others could pretty easily be determined through parsing.<br />
<br />
One of the results of this investigation was an understanding of how AC soft caps come into play.  Given that AC is one of the most important stats for a shaman (along with WIS and HP) understanding exactly what it's good for can be helpful.<br />
<br />
Here's the original thread:<br />
http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessageRange?topicID=1242.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=20<br />
<br />
I'm enclosing the two important snippets.  The first describes the basic mechanics.  The second (way below) describes how these mechanics explain the &quot;soft AC&quot; cap phenom.  I'll also throw in the mob numbers from the thread.  Note that the mechanics can also be used to explain mathematically at what point will the damage bonus will make a faster inferior ratio weapon overtake a slower better ratio weapon (e.g. &quot;when will a Lammy overtake a Wurmslayer in effectiveness&quot;- not necessarily a shaman topic, but good to know nonetheless.)<br />
<br />
The snippet below is taken from the fourth page of the thread, and is a nice summary.  <br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
Mobs do damage based on the following formula: (found by Joimster)<br />
<br />
Damage = Bonus + (Damage_Rating * x)<br />
<br />
Where:<br />
Bonus is a number assigned by VI<br />
Damage_Rating is a number assigned by VI<br />
x = integer from 1 to 20<br />
<br />
*Warriors Defensive Discipline Modifies x to a range of 1 to 10.<br />
<br />
*Monks Stonestance Discipline Modifies x to a range of 1 to 2.<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
Base damage for Characters is calculated from the weapon:<br />
Damage = round/truncate[Bonus + (Damage_Rating * x)]<br />
<br />
Where:<br />
Bonus is the Damage bonus listed on the weapon<br />
Damage_Rating is the Damage listed on the weapon divide by 10 (result is non-integer)<br />
x = integer from 1 to 20<br />
<br />
*Some irregularities and possible explanations.<br />
<br />
1. Effect of High Strength on damage?<br />
(*Test in extreme strength differences of 75 or less versus 200+ to see more obvious differences)<br />
<br />
Q: Does extra damage from Strength add simply to the damage bonus of a weapon therefore increasing damage bonus and therefore increasing both max and min hit?<br />
A: Easily tested by using a character with Low strength and parsing min and max values and then buffing strength to very high and parsing min and max values.<br />
<br />
Q: Is extra damage from Strength added as an integer?<br />
A: Easily tested by the above method and seeing if the increase to min damage is the same as increase to max damage. If they are the same then damage from high strength is added straight onto the weapon damage bonus. If they are different it is possible that the extra damage from strength is added to the damage rating of the weapon and is therefore multiplied by<br />
20. This would mean that it may add 1 to your min damage and 20 to your max damage although it need not be integer values such as these as they may simply be rounded before damage is displayed on screen.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Effect of higher level characters on damage?<br />
<br />
Q: Is this phenomena caused by higher ATK ratings, damage tables for higher levels or both?<br />
A: ??? Research and logs at each level required.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Calculation for offhand damage?<br />
<br />
Q: Is the formula the same as the above with the damage bonus simply defaulted to 0?<br />
A: Put a fire beetle eye, lightsone in main hand and weapon in off hand and parse damage. Put same weapon in main hand and the fire beetle eye, etc in off hand and parse damage. What is the difference in min and max values?<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
On the subject of Avoiding and Mitigating damage taken from a mob.<br />
(particularly mitigation)<br />
<br />
The raw data listed by Aauminki while tanking Seneschal Aldikar show that hits were indeed mitigated to min damage five times greater than the average and hits were also found at max damage two times greater than average.<br />
<br />
Indeed 37% of all hits that landed fell as either max or min damage. Note that the fact that this is a single set of data makes this unreliable but does point at an avenue of exploration.<br />
<br />
An initial hypothesis is that x (as used above in the damage by mobs formula) is not initially calculated as an integer between 1 and 20 but is truncated and/or rounded to this in the final steps of the algorithm.<br />
<br />
Example: Mobs ATK is compared to your AC and the R.N.G. is also used somewhere and comes up with a number. That number is then truncated/rouded and made to equal 1 for any number lower than 1 (therefore mitigating damage to a min. hit) and made equal to 20 for any number greater than 20 (making sure that the damage does not go above max damage).<br />
<br />
*Your AC is much higher than the mob's ATK:<br />
More x values are lower and in quite a few cases are negative values and therefore made into an x value of 1. Comparatively few hits are for max damage.<br />
<br />
*Your AC is much lower than the mob's ATK:<br />
More x values are higher and in quite a few cases above 20 and therefore made into a value of 20. Comparatively few hits are for max damage.<br />
<br />
*Your AC is almost even with the mob's ATK:<br />
The x values have a fairly even spread between most possible values except for the min and max which have more occurences than the others. Reason being that x may still have been in a bigger range than just one to twenty, i.e. -15 to 35.<br />
<br />
This snippet describes how these mechanics explain the &quot;soft AC&quot; cap phenom<br />
<br />
Then we can infer that if your AC is high enough that the non-random part of hits is mostly BELOW N = 1, you will get the largest spike at minimum damage. This represents a ceiling on mitigation AC, since the random component will always put SOME hits over (N = 1) and reducing hits further below (N = 1) doesn't help. If the random component continues to be reduced even when the modal hit is far under (N = 1), this becomes a soft<br />
cap.<br />
<br />
Secondly, we can infer that as the modal hit moves through the range (N = 1) to (N = 20), we see the 'sharp dropoff' effect that so many people have reported in the AC 700 to 1200 range.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, we can infer that if the modal hit is often over (N = 20) most times, you see the big spike at max damage. This represents a floor on AC, which has been observed but never really commented on. Since at (N = 20) the random component will ALSO be large, we find that the floor is softer than the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Here are the values from some mobs- pulled from the thread:<br />
<br />
Mob: DB, DI<br />
Cazic Thule: 200, 20<br />
Doomshade: 110, 15.5<br />
Gozzrem: 180, 15<br />
Kromzek Captain: 60, 10<br />
Lcea Katta: 160, 20<br />
Lord Nagafen: 75, 7.5<br />
Vessel Drozlin: 75, 12<br />
Yelinak: 100, 25<br />
Sontalak 125, 15<br />
Avatar of War: 254, 45<br />
Innoruk has: 20, 1<br />
Phin Esprinap: 254, 5.1<br />
Priest of Discord: 254, 5.1<br />
Ssra - Elite Temple Guard: 151, 15<br />
Ssra - Temple Guard: 99, 9<br />
Vorash (LoIO final monk fight):  60, 6<br />
Xenovorash: 70, 7.5<br />
Velks Lab regular spiders: 20, 4<br />
Talendor: 120, 19<br />
Kael - Staff Sargeant Drioc: 45, 4.5<br />
Kael - Dlammaz Stormslayer: 80, 21<br />
Kael - the Sentinels scattered around Tormax's Castle: 80, 10<br />
Kael - Yetarr: 110, 16<br />
Sebilite Juggernaut: 55, 6.1<br />
Froglok Reet (Insert Name Here): 45, 5<br />
Myconoid (Insert Name Here): 45, 5<br />
Trakanon: 120, 25<br />
PoA - Thunder Spirits: 50, 5<br />
PoA - Sirran the Lunatic: 256, 90<br />
PoA - Azaracks: 55, 6<br />
PoA - Gorgalask: 50, 11<br />
PoA - Spirited Harpie: 60, 9.5<br />
PoA - Watchful Guard: 50, 12.5<br />
PoA - Heart Harpie: 75, 15<br />
PoA - Avenging Gazer: 75, 14.25<br />
PoA - Shimmering Meteors: 113, 8-11... depends on which one you fight<br />
PoA - Keeper of Souls: 1, 20 <br />
<br />
So, Cazic Thule can hit for 220, 240, 260, ..., 580, or 600.  It turns out that kick/bash damage is DB + some integer, so CT could kick for 201, 202, 203, ....<br />
<br />
The min hit is therefore DB + DI, and the max hit is DB + 20*DI.<br />
<br />
It becomes apparent that we can derive these numbers from a max and min:<br />
DI = (max hit) - (min hit) / 19<br />
DB = (min hit) - DI<br />
<br />
Good stuff!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">snapdragn:  Clarified a few things on your formula list<br />
<br />
Shaman AC = 1.575 * Raw AC <br />
<br />
Note:  Spells which increase AC do not increase Raw AC.  This putting on a 10 AC bracer will give you 15.75 AC, but casting a spell that has a 10 AC increase in it will only increase your AC by 10 points.<br />
<br />
Offense, Defense, 1HB, 2HB, and Piercing all max at 200, and are capped at:  (Level * 5)<br />
<br />
Bind Wound is capped at (Level * 5) until you hit 200.  At level 50, it can be increased two points more per level, for a maximum of 210.  A bind heals skill/4 damage.<br />
<br />
Alchemy is capped at (Level - 24) * 5 <br />
<br />
The formula for Mana from Wisdom is:  Mana = Wis * (Level / 5)<br />
<br />
Note:  Items with +mana are said to be scaled by level (so an item with +50 mana may not give a true 50 mana at lower levels.)  To my knowledge, this scaling has not been experimented with.<br />
<br />
Each point of additional stamina will give a shaman (level/20) hit points. <br />
<br />
At level 10, you get 0.5 hp per additional stamina point. <br />
At level 20, you get 1.0 hp per additional stamina point. <br />
At level 30, you get 1.5 hp per additional stamina point. <br />
At level 40, you get 2.0 hp per additional stamina point. <br />
At level 50, you get 2.5 hp per additional stamina point. <br />
At level 60, you get 3.0 hp per additional stamina point. <br />
<br />
(For priests its Level/20, for INT casters is Level/30, for warriors its Level/10, not sure about hybrids)<br />
<br />
Spell skills (Alteration, Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination) max at (Level * 5).  At level 30, you may choose specialization.  Specialization gives you a chance to cast spells in that family for less mana.  For us, alteration is generally considered the best skill to specialize in (for buffs), conjuration as a second choice (for DoTs).  To choose a skill, put a point in it at the trainer.  You can choose more than one.  Casting spells in that family will cause the specialization skill to rise, but the first specialization skill to raise over 50 is the only one that can be raised over 50.<br />
<br />
Who has more?  :)</div></div><hr />

Haste Explained - By Xaaz Swiftail - Iksar Monk - Tarew Marr - v2.00<br />
<br />
For those unfamiliar, something that has a &quot;Haste&quot; effect is<br />
something that makes you faster, something that gives you a greater speed in one way or another. As far as EverQuest goes, Haste more accurately effects how fast you attack. The speed in which you attack is represented by your weapons &quot;Delay&quot; attribute (Del). Delay is measure in tenths of seconds. For instance, a weapon with a Delay of 20 would attack every two  seconds. Likewise, a weapon with a Delay of 44 would attack every 4.4 seconds.<br />
<br />
A common misconception is that a Haste effect directly alters the<br />
Delay of your weapons, when in fact it does not. Haste is  measured in &quot;Damage Increase Over Time,&quot; not Delay Decrease. An item or spell that adds a 40% Haste effect does not lower your weapons Delay by 40%, but rather increases the amount of Damage you do over the period of time in which the Haste is active by 40%.<br />
<br />
Although Haste is measured in Damage Increase Over Time and not Delay Decrease, it does change the Delay of your weapon, albeit indirectly. The reasoning behind this is simple; to increase your Damage Output Over Time one of two things has to happen. Either you have to do more damage with each swing, or you have to swing faster. In EverQuest, Haste uses the latter. To increase your Damage Output Over Time by say 40% it indirectly alters the Delay of your weapon, making you attack faster.<br />
<br />
The formula for determining what a &quot;Hastened Delay&quot; would be is<br />
simple. It involves three steps. <br />
<br />
[u]Step One: Add 100 to the known Haste Percentage of the Item/Spell/Song.<br />
<br />
Step Two: Divide the previous result into 100.<br />
<br />
Step Three: Multiply the previous result by the Delay.<br />
<br />
The result you get after Step Three is the weapons Hastened Delay while a Haste Effect is active. Below are two examples of the formula in action.<br />
<br />
Delay 30 with 40% Haste<br />
Step One: Add 100 to the known Haste Percentage of the Item/Spell/Song.<br />
	    100 + 40 = 140<br />
Step Two: Divide the previous result into 100.<br />
	    100 / 140 = .71<br />
Step Three: Multiply the previous result by the Delay.<br />
	    .71 * 30 = 21.3<br />
Finished: A Delay of 30 with 40% Haste becomes a Delay of 21 (21.3).<br />
<br />
	Delay 15 with 85% Haste<br />
Step One: Add 100 to the known Haste Percentage of the<br />
Item/Spell/Song.<br />
	    100 + 85 = 185<br />
Step Two: Divide the previous result into 100.<br />
	    100 / 185 = .54<br />
Step Three: Multiply the previous result by the Delay.<br />
	    .54 * 15 = 8.1<br />
Finished: A Delay of 15 with 85% Haste becomeas a Delay of 8 (8.1). <br />
<br />
Looking at the formula we can also manipulate it to discover exactly how much of a Delay Reduction the Haste indirectly causes. The steps start out the same as the previous formula, but after Step Two it goes off on its own tangent.<br />
<br />
The formula for determining &quot;Delay Reduction&quot; is as follows.<br />
<br />
Step One: Add 100 to the known Haste Percentage of the Item/Spell/Song. <br />
<br />
Step Two: Divide the previous result into 100.<br />
<br />
Step Three: Multiply the previous result by 100.<br />
<br />
Step Four: Subtract the previous result from 100.<br />
<br />
The result you get after Step Four is the percentage by which the<br />
Haste has reduced your weapons Delay. Below is an example of that formula in action.<br />
<br />
Delay 40 with 21% Haste<br />
<br />
Step One: Add 100 to the known Haste Percentage of the Item/Spell/Song.<br />
	    100 + 21 = 121<br />
Step Two: Divide the previous result into 100.<br />
	    100 / 121 = .83<br />
Step Three: Multiply the previous result by 100<br />
	    100 * .83 = 83<br />
Step Four: Subtract the previous result from 100.<br />
	    100 - 83 = 17<br />
Finished: A Delay of 40 with 21% Haste reduces the Delay by  17%.<br />
<br />
Also of note, you might have notice that Step One in both formulae mentions &quot;Item/Spell/Song&quot; Haste. Those are the three different Types of Haste in EverQuest. Their definitions are as follows.<br />
<br />
Item Haste is from equipment that you wear, for example Armor. It is also sometimes referred to as Permahaste, in that it is a permanent effect of your armor/equipment; always in effect. Item Haste does not include &quot;right-clickable&quot; equipment that has a Song Haste Effect or a Spell Haste Effect. <br />
<br />
Spell Haste is from an actual Spell that has been cast on you, for example the spell &quot;Swift Like The Wind.&quot; This Haste is generally not permanent and has a &quot;duration&quot; (the time in which it is active before fading). Spell Haste also includes any right-clickable Hastes that count as Spells. For example, if you have a pair of Gauntlets that when right-clicked add &quot;Alacrity&quot; as their effect, it is counted as Spell haste.<br />
<br />
Song Haste is generally an effect that is applied to you from a Bard Song, for example the song &quot;Anthem De'Arms.&quot; Haste from Bard Songs is what you might call &quot;Semi Permanent,&quot; in that as long as the Bard keeps playing the song you will continue to be Hastened (which could be an indefinite amount of time), but as soon as the Bard stops playing the song you lose the Haste. Song Haste also applies to certain right-clickable items and equipment that have an effect that's a Bard Song.<br />
<br />
At any given moment during gameplay a player may only have two Haste Effects active. The first is Item Haste (the permahaste that is always in effect), and the second is either Spell Haste or Song Haste. Spell Haste and Song Haste are interchangable. You may only ever have one active Item Haste and one active  Spell/Song Haste. If you are wearing two pieces of equipment that both have Item Haste, for example, the one with the highest Haste Percentage will be in effect, and the other will simply be ignored. It is the same way with Spell/Song Haste. If you have a certain Spell Haste in effect and then a Caster casts a greater Spell Haste on you it will overwrite the lesser Spell Haste.<br />
<br />
Hopefully now you have a deeper understanding of what Haste is and how it works in terms of EverQuest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you mention bind wound and the skill cap, it's worth saying that once you get to 201 you can bind to 70% health, before that it's 50%.<br />
<br />
The mana formula is:  (mana below 200 * level / 5) + (mana above 200 * level / 10)  or at least that's the current best guess AFAIK.<br />
<br />
Skill caps are generally (level + 1) * 5.<br />
<br />
I agree with Sciek that the really detailled information might better live in a seperate document. For example the FAQ might say:<br />
<br />
Q: What effect does haste have?<br />
A: Haste makes your character attack more frequently. The overall effect of haste is to increase your average damage over time. Haste figures are quoted as a percentage - this percentage can be thought of as how much extra damage (on average) you will do when hasted. For a fuller explanation, see [link to detailed document].</div></div><hr />

Your natural meditating mana regen rate is:  Meditate skill / 10<br />
<br />
This can be increased through spells (clarity line, etc.), AA skills (mental clarity), or Flowing Thought items (one point of mana regen per tick per &quot;Flowing Thought&quot; point, up to a maximum of 15.)<br />
<br />

&lt;b&gt;Lodizal is soloable and has been done on test.  Test gives us an advantage for things like this because of the low player base and general respect others have for players they see doing something.  It's pretty unheard of for a guild to jump in and ks someone or a group of people doing this big lummox.  A major downside though is I had been trying to do this for a couple months and every time without fail the server would drop while I was engaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me 35 min and alot of luck.  The bracer is pretty unusable because of the time you have to spend torpor'd and canni'in down.  I did use ds potions, but all other buffs came from myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluevulpine.net/howjan/lod/eq000004.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pic 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluevulpine.net/howjan/lod/eq000006.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pic 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluevulpine.net/howjan/lod/eq000015.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pic 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluevulpine.net/howjan/lod/eq000016.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pic 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluevulpine.net/howjan/lod/lodlog.txt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;<br />
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loot shot has been left out because I don't have time to edit out the &quot;questionable&quot; language.  The only bummer is I didn't get the kill message because either the dog or the dot took him out.<br />
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well there it is, believe it or not.  I didn't post on here after it was done because I don't have the time nor the want to deal with the ones that would think me a liar.  My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=98203&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gear&lt;/a&gt; is by no means to be considered &quot;uber&quot; but it serves me quite well.  Replace the vindi bp with a fungi and there you have it. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
&lt;br /&gt;The log is some great reading!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">How fizzles are computed (thanks Relv for this quote from an old Archmage post!)<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Q: How do spell fizzles (and missed notes on songs) work? <br />
A: When you cast a spell, we call a fizzle check. There is always a 5% chance of succeeding (regardless of how low your appropriate skill is) and a 5% chance of failure (regardless of how high your appropriate skill is). What modifies a fizzle check are (a) your appropriate skill (Abjuration, Evocation, Brass, Wind, etc.) (b) your primary statistic (Intelligence for Magi, Wisdom for Priests, Dexterity and Charisma for Bards) (c) the difficulty of the spell and (d) the level of the spell. <br />
<br />
When you gain a new rank of spells, any spell that you cast of that rank has a 20% chance of fizzling. This assumes that (a) your appropriate skill (Evocation, for example) is at its maximum value (b) that you have a minimum of 75 in your appropriate statistic (Intelligence, etc.) and (c) that we did not set the difficulty of the spell to less then average (some spells we assign a lower difficulty, making them easier to cast - to date, we have not made any spells with higher difficulty). <br />
<br />
If your appropriate statistic is greater then 75 (Intelligence, Wisdom, etc.), we reduce your fizzle percent by 1% for every X points of your statistic above 75. <br />
<br />
Each spell assumes that you have a skill equal to (5 * level you go the spell). A Wizard getting Bind Affinity (Wizard gets her 4th rank spells at level 12, so 5 * 12 =60) would have that spell assuming that she had a 60 Alteration skill for purposes of casting. With a 60 skill in Alteration (the appropriate skill) and a 75 intelligence, our wizard would have an 80% chance of successfully casting Bind Affinity. For every skill point that our Wizard has above 60, the percent chance of fizzling goes down by 1%, to a minimum of a 5% chance of fizzling. Thus, three levels (15 skill points) after our Wizard gets Bind Affinity, she will be able to max out her Alteration and have a mere 5% chance of fizzling the spell. <br />
<br />
A high intelligence would help her to max out her ability to cast Bind Affinity without fizzling earlier. <br />

Am I the only one that thinks this game mechanics stuff is super-cool?  :)</div></div><hr />
