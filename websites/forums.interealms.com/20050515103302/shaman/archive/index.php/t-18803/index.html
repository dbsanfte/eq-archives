<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do Focus Effects stack with similar Focus Effects?  I know that different Focus Effects stack, as in Spell Haste III will stack with Extended Enhancement IV, but what about similar ones?<br />
<br />
For example, will Extended Enhancement III stack with Extended Enhancement IV?  Or will two Spell Haste III items stack with each other, effectively doubling the haste?<br />
<br />
Searched the posts and didnt see anything about this, so I figured I would ask.  Or, if anyone knows where some info might be posted on this, please link it for me.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Poutros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Focus effect of the same kind don't stack, ie if you wear 2 focus that have the same effect the effect are not added, only the best one is used.<br />
<br />
For instance, if you wear extended enhancement 3 and 4, it is equivalent as wearing only EE4, and 2 haste won't add up, only the best haste will be used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Poutros--Thanks a lot.  Makes my gear selection a little easier now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Note that they don't stack by &quot;type&quot; of effect, not just name.  So you can't stack Affliction efficiency (reduce mana on dots) with Mana Preservation (reduce mana on all spells).  The highest one takes effect.  Same thing if you tried to use spell haste and beneficial haste, just the highest takes effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm...that makes things a little more difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you want to see exactly what stacks with what, look up an effect on lucy.allakhazam.com and then click the &quot;Stacking&quot; button in the top right.  Any effect listed on the resulting page won't stack.  Just a note though - you have to remember that there's Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only), Limit: Spell Type(Beneficial only), etc, etc - and that these effects won't stack, but are each applicable to their particular spell type so you would ideally want one of each (or an effect that didn't have a limit at all and covered both beneficial and detrimental i.e. didn't have a limit listed).  It shows the limits on the Details screen for each spell/effect.</div></div><hr />
