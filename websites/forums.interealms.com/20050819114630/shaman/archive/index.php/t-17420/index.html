<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>twilite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where's a good spot for a 42 shaman (me) and a 35 shadowknight. Frog and ogre. He has decent stuff, so do it. Tried nagafens lair , got bored of CC , and dont have enough time for constant adventures. thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">DSP.  Zelniaks.  There are a ton of them.  They arent social in DSP.  Only things that are annoying are the lightcrawlers, but only cause they blind.<br />
<br />
If the Zelniaks are too boring, you can get a group killing tribals.<br />
<br />
You could aslo try Gunthak harbor on the beach.  should be good exp still for you.  You are gonna want to gp to dulak soon anyway to get the bottle for your Stoicism quest.  Stay away from the diseased and excaped drogmors; they have WAy to many HP's and they regen at an insane rate.  Anything else is fair game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">City of Mist.  Pick up your epic pieces while you're there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>twilite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gunthank might be good.. Tried CoM but we got owned because the SK can't take hits of 100+ yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, since the revamp from a month or so ago the mobs there have been tooled up from what they were before.  Id peg this zone as a 50+ area now, and one where an enchanter wouldnt be unwanted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exp is Unbelievable.<br />
<br />
Will be a little slow for you after 43 but he'll catch up quite a bit, which is something you'll need to move on to harder stuff.<br />
<br />
The gnomes are all 30-35 or so and give 2% exp per kill solo up to about level 41, and they have around 1k hit points max, so you just rip through them.<br />
<br />
Awesome, Awesome exp.</div></div><hr />
