<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all!  Just wondering what the best duo in EQ could be?<br />
<br />
Lets see...<br />
<br />
I know Bracy and Yodelroy!!!<br />
<br />
Bracy could slow TIME and Yodelroy can do EVERYTHING.<br />
<br />
See how simple it all is !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think Fancy the Bard could &quot;TK&quot; every PC in the game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">just remember that they need The Quon the cleric to loot everything</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, bracy has such high DPS with haste AND slows..he you could probably just have duo bracy's and it would be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Guys, Yodelroy is actually an amazingly great bard and good all around EQ player.  Gigantic ego, yes, but he has earned it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Umm gotta ask is Yodelroy the &quot;IN TEH FACE&quot; guy ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is Yodelroy: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=15747</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't know anything about Yodelroy but i know posting shms suck on the shm boards is a little more then a gigantic ego</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Guys, Yodelroy is actually an amazingly great bard and good all around EQ player.  Gigantic ego, yes, but he has earned it.<br />
<br />
<br />
He might be a good bard, but he's stupid as a sack of bricks. He thinks he knows what it's like to be a shaman, when he doesn't have a clue. The more I read of his posts the more I think he's even more clueless about his own class.<br />
<br />
Yodel needs to take a hike. The Crucible only dislikes stupid people when they don't think they're stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Oh and Jinheim I dont know if you're applying to this guys' guild or what but your ass kissing of him is really really pathetic, he obviously has a severe case of class envy with all of these &quot;anything you can do I can do better!&quot; posts.<br />
<br />
And he hardly knows what he's talking about, and has earned jack.</div></div><hr />
