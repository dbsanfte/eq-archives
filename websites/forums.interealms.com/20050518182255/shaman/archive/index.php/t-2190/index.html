<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont think it's so much that the shaman class is broken, as other classes, particularly melees are broken. When a rogue or warrior can solo at 60th and kill mobs faster than a level 60 shaman, class balance is out of whack, imo.<br />
<br />
With weapons that have insane dmg/delay ratios and fungis, Velious BPs with Invigorate, Aura of Battle items, and AA regen, I've seen melees who can solo mobs in Velks and FG with practically no down-time. Get 3 or 4 of these melees together in a group and they dont even need a healer anymore.<br />
<br />
When an entire archetype (healers) becomes unneeded for even basic xp groups, I think there's a problem. Hopefully the healer class balancing that Verant is supposedly starting to look at will fix things, but I'm not going to hold my breath.<br />

edit- Ah, fook. Meant this to be a reply to another thread. But it's still a valid point for a new thread! :D</div></div><hr />

- I usually solo 2-3 mushrooms simultaneously.<br />

<br />
My Shaman doesn't solo too bad now with some pretty mediocre gear, getting Cannibalization skill will help out immensely.  That should put me around the efficiency that I have with my Monk.</div></div><hr />
