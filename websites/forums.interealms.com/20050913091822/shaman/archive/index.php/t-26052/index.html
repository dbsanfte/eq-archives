Slouken, one of the UI designers for Blizzard, has acknowledged a problem with the way the client saves some of its window/ui frame positioning data. While a permanent fix is on the way (not until the next content patch, which there is no telling when that will be), below is a temporary fix that has worked very well for me.<br />
<br />
1) Open Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer).<br />
2) Navigate to your World of Warcraft game directory.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
1) Right click your World of Warcraft game icon on your desktop.<br />
2) Select &quot;Properties&quot;, then click the button that reads &quot;Find Target&quot;.<br />
<br />
3) Double click the &quot;W T F&quot; folder. (spaces added so it's not censored).<br />
4) Double click the &quot;Account&quot; folder<br />
5) Double click the folder that is named the same as the account name you use to log in.<br />
6) Double click the folder for the character you're experiencing video lag/low fps with.<br />
7) Double click (edit) the file named &quot;layout-cache.txt&quot;.<br />
8)   Look for instances of the parameter named &quot;FrameLevel:&quot;<br />
<br />
Any of those instances with a numeric value higher than 50, edit the numeric value back down to the number &quot;1&quot;. Do this to ALL instances that have a value over 50!<br />
<br />
Save and close the file.<br />
<br />
Restart World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
While this may not resolve all low video frame rate issues on all systems, it has worked very well for me when I notice video lag or low FPS.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.FYI, &quot;50&quot; is just an arbitrary threshold I decided on personally. Usually the ones causing problems have values in the hundreds of thousands and are easy to identify.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You might need a text editor other than Notepad. I use UltraEdit and have to tell it to format it as DOS text for the text to layout properly and not be a jumbled mess.<br />
<br />
If you've logged in with any of those characters, that file (in each characters directory) *will* have data in it, though the problem referenced in the original post may not be present on your system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is great, but I tell ya, going into folders, editing text, assigning arbitrary values, all to fix a problem on THEIR end with a game - does this strike anyone else as shades of EQ ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You're becoming jaded again Faern. :)<br />
<br />
A fix is coming. Bugs will be present in EVERY piece of software ever published. You should know from your experience that MMOG's aren't immune to this. We live with it, we adapt, we put temp fixes in place until devs can deploy a permanent fix. Otherwise we bitch and moan and stop enjoying the game(s).<br />
<br />
I choose to put temp fixes in place so I can continue to enjoy playing. YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A few weeks ago all of a sudden I was getting 5-10fps on only one character in almost every zone. I ended up having to delete his config file in the *** directory to fix the problem. <br />
<br />
I spent about 4 hours messing around before figuring that out though. What a PITA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I play on Silverhand. AKA Silverlag.  You'd be jaded too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had this exact problem. I ended up deleting my character profile in the directory they list and it fixes the problem. You will have to reconfigure your chat window settings though.<br />
<br />
Its weird that it only happens to one of my characters.</div></div><hr />
