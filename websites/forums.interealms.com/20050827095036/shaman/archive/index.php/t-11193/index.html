<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I never thougth I would say this but the EQ bug has bitten me again.  For the past few day I have been trying to reactivate my account with my shaman on it.  But before I do, I have a few questions.<br />
<br />
First of all, after I quit eq i ended up losing the cd key to my account.  Is there a way to reactivate my account without the cd key<br />
<br />
Second, I havent played in over 1 3/4 years so I am not going to bother asking what changes have been made. What  I would like to know, however, is how the AAXP system works in both luclin and POP and when I should start working on AA.<br />
<br />
Lately I have been looking at screens of some of the luclin and POP zones.  If they look even as remotely good in the game, who knows I might be able to reclaim that sense of awe that I had the when I first started playin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd suggest getting to 60 then get Run3/Regen3 at least then either level more or go for 65 then AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you remember your account name and password, I believe it should be as simple as logging in and setting up the billing again. If you've forgotten the password, I suggest you get in touch with Sony (start from the website) and ask them what you can do. Any answers you get here will be anecdotal, and you'd have to go to them about it anyway. :)<br />
<br />
For AA, you can start earning points at 51, but most people say it's not worth thinking about until 55, and then only for run 3. The general consensus is to get 60, then work on AA. Of course, with PoP and level 65, opinions are divided as to whether you should stop for AA at 60, or go on to 65 first. It mostly depends on what you do and where you hunt. (Most non-PoP places are green at 65).<br />
<br />
As to how the AA system works, well, that would take a long time to explain properly, but basically, you can put your exp earned into levelling or into AA, and each AA &quot;ding&quot; (equivalent to level 51 worth exp), you get an AA point which you can spend on certain abilities. For Luclin AA, you need to spend 6 points in General before you can work on Archetypes, and you need 12 points spent on Archetypes before you can work on Class AA. Some Luclin and PoP AA has prerequisites too.<br />
<br />
For a rough description of shaman AA skills, you could read this: http://eq.crgaming.com/archetype/default.asp?Action=Cat&amp;ClassId=4 which isn't brilliant, but hopefully gives you an idea, or you could look at the AA screen in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's all about the account.  If you remember the login/pw, you can go to Account in EQ and restart the billing.  I had to quit for over 7 months at one point, and my Shammy was exactly as he was before I left.  The only thing that changed was /played, which reflected when I restarted the account, not when he was really born.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Whew, thats a relief.  For a minute I thought I might have to buy the gold edition over again.  At least it saves me a few bucks<br />
<br />
The first order of business once I get back online is to get to 58 (was halfway into 57) and reequip.  When I left I gave all my droppable equipment away to guildmates and friends and gave my account info to a guildmate just in case the guild needed another shaman for raids.  Once I get 58 my plan is to get run 3 then level to 60 so I can get natural regen 3 and work my way to getting Cann V.<br />
<br />
I dont have access to POP yet, which is not a huge worry because it will take me a bit to get 60 and Malo/topor.  Besides my guild is mostly raiding high end Velious/Luclin and I gotta catch up everyone else<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, I heard that they smoothed out the xp so that there are no 'hell levels' anymore.  Is this true.  Also how rare are the post 50 luclin spells for shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi Sarnian,<br />
<br />
I've been out about the same amount of time, and recently restarted. <br />
I actually was in level 45 when they got rid of hell levels, and was there when I quit. Having just gone through it and into 46, I can say that it was still a hell level in my case, but I guess that's just exceptional circumstances.<br />
<br />
I know you didn't ask for this, but since I was in the same situation, it might help - Big differences I noticed, some of which are obvious, and some not so:<br />
- You can now alt-tab out to another window, althought this is slightly bugged for Windows XP (there are workarounds)<br />
- Lots of fun with the new interface - check out the various posts around. <br />
- you have to type /hotbutton to make a hot button now<br />
- the bazaar is sweet, but kind of a slideshow<br />
- more spells per page in your spell book<br />
- we've got a pet box with all the commands and *gasp* dogdogs health in it!<br />
-SoW is slower (jk!)<br />
<br />
Hope that's of some use. Oh, and another confirmation - you just need your username/password.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
