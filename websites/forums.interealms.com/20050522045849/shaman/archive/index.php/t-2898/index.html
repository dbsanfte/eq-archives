<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am at work so my searching ability is limited.  Many obvious gaming sites are cut by the corporate firewall but interealms isn't :)<br />

In another thread talking about AE in Luclin someone stated:<br />
&quot;Verant added on something like 10 or 15% to the HPs &quot;<br />
<br />
I'll search for the exact post later from home but I'm pretty sure the increase in HPs was close to 2%  Just that small a difference is enough to make one more Nuke have to go off to force them into running mode and make the AE group a bit less efficient.<br />
<br />
Blame VI for everything they do wrong (there's plenty to go around) but give them credit for when they do something correct.  That small a HP increase really put the beat down on an abusive tactic. Well, the occasional MR mob also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, taladaen, I believe the quote you mentioned was in reference to the HP of luclin mobs in general.  Not purely the changes in the grey (though I may be misremembering).<br />
<br />
Most luclin mobs of like 48-53 level mobs in luclin seem to have abou 6-8k hp.  Some have 10k.  Most similar level mobs in kunark seem to have 4.5-5k hp.  Experience earned is similar.<br />
<br />
Obviously we can find exceptions to refute the above numbers, but that seems to be my general experience with luclin.  I would say that it is BY FAR the worst expansion VI has released. Frankly, only the mob spawns and zone experience modifiers in a couple of zones make me at all interested in exp in luclin.<br />
<br />
I'm not even going to get into the hell that is the Vex Thal key quest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Typically, this is what I see for dark blue critters with decent xp:<br />
<br />
Old World:  epic, scourge, ebolt, dog, a little melee.  Dead before scourge ends.<br />
Kunark:  Old World+add an ebolt.  Dies just a little after scourge ends.<br />
Velious:  Old World+add an ebolt and another epic click.  Dies before Curse is done, but it's a mana-free dot.<br />
Luclin:  Old World.  Then once more, with feeling.<br />
<br />
I strongly dislike the fact that I have to curse, scourge, ebolt, ebolt, curse, scourge, and ebolt the things to kill them.  Even slowed they have the time to put out some decent melee damage on myself and my dog.<br />
<br />
And is it just me, or do you folks find Luclin mobs have a hellishly high ability to break whatever root they have on them?<br />
<br />
edit:  Only upside to this is that the vampyre bats (dblu, even, and yellow to me at 53) have about the same hp that the lower luclin dblus have, so I can actually get more xp for the fight... if my spells land.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, not really, assuming that they're not immune to it in the firrst place (like 90% of the 'shrooms in FG are, by example). PE usually goes for 2+ minutes, sometimes even to the max duration, most of the time. Solid like a rock too... sometimes have to use multiple bracer blasts to break.<br />
<br />
You are using some kind of Mal* on those, right?</div></div><hr />
