<br />
1.  Shaman healing was unsatisfactory in PoP.  Non time shaman cannot act as the main healer past BoT/HOH.  Even after that (ie. time equipment, healing aa's), if shaman are the main healer in an elemental group and slow is resisted it will be a group wipe.  Due to the lack of real healing ability, against unslowable mobs, shaman are dead weight.<br />
<br />
2.  Slows are mitigated and can be completely resisted, meaning weighing heals against slows is really screwing shaman.<br />
<br />
3.  Shaman were shafted on heals in pop, so that after 50 levels of soloing, druids could be re-included in groups.<br />
<br />
4.  We thought the healing balance would be restored in GoD.  It was not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healing for shaman is better than what it was, but not up to what some of us would have liked.  Can we heal in a Justice group... YES.  Can we heal in an Earth group.  YES.  Hell, i can solo in earth, so I I know that I can be the main tank or main healer in an earth group if needed.  We don't have problems with healing in non-GoD situations.  Can we heal in Ikk trials now?  YES we can function as the 2nd healer, however we aren't as good as having two clerics, or having 1 cleric and 1 druid.  Last night I did Ikk 2 and 3 as the 2nd healer.  It's possible, but it's not going to be done without alot of mana and without the AAs/gear.  If we had another healer, then I wouldn't have had to be the backup healer, and could have concentrated on being solely the debuffer/ slight dps that we needed.  I kept our main tank up for 90% of the final Tipt named Archer fighting him a few days ago with me alone.  However, it wasn't like I was keeping him alive, it was more like I healed him as fast as possible, while his hps continously dropped, DI kicked off and then they dropped again till he died and the rogue nimbled him till he died.  Was just lucky.  Cleric and bard got rampaged and killed at 95% and although I dind't get in one crit heal, managed to keep the server's best tank alive long enough to win.  Perfect situation for me, minus getting no crit heals.  Would it happen again... 99% chance that I couldn't do it again.  Oh, if you were having problems healing a torment group, it was because you were using Kraggs Mending.  Let me put it to you.. put that spell in the back of your book, and only use it when you absolutely have to (IE..... almost never).  You will never use Kraggs in a raid setting, because your 10 sec max AAd mini-CH that heals for max 2250 dmg isn't going to save a tank.  You are better off using Tnargs and hoping for a crit heal.<br />
 <br />
Okay, onto your other issues.  Mitigated slows is one of the banes of our existance.  In return of having mitigated slows, our advantage over the other slowing classes makes it much less and therefore.  But this reason in itself isn't the sole reason that we are struggling.  We are also struggling because with the now popular straight dps fights, with the mob lasting less than 40 sec, our dots aren't lasting for full length (especially if we have to debuff prior to that).  When our sole dps now goes with us being able to cast one Bane that gets in maybe 2 ticks on a mob, pet dps (which is at max 40dps) and maybe one cast of Velium Strike, we suck at dps in quick fights.  Next reason is, we do not have a mana regen spell (hence another reason why beastlords and chanters will get the slowing spots before us now especially in GoD).  With the emphasis now on quick fights, there are only a few factors that need to be taken a look at.  What is your dps and how good is your mana regen.  That is why we suck.  We do not have a way of giving other classes any form of mana regen, and for ours we must be standing still while not doing anything else but hitting the canni key.  DPS wise, if the fight lasts for 40 secs (that's really long for most fights too) then how much dmg do you expect to get in during that fight.  Assuming that you have Balance of Nihil, you will still only be able to cast one Bane, maybe 2 VS and 1 Tears of Saryn plus dogdog.  Okay, so that's 40dps from dog, along with MAX (offensive AAs maxed) 12k extra dmg in a fight, and that's only with criting all bane ticks and criting all DD casts.  But, that is a perfect situation, and we know that without malos first on a mob, we aren't likely to land every spell that we cast, especially not for full.  And this dmg is nothing compared to what any other class can do.  Not to mention, the agro from slow and bane alone would keep the mob's attention on us.<br />
 <br />
So, what is stands.. right now our main problems are:<br />
 <br />
1.  We have literally no means of dps in short fights.  Too long cast times on our spells, especially our top DDs.  Dots will not run the full length on mobs, even our magic based ones.  And with no lull type components on any spell other than GoD slow, we get resisted far too often.<br />
2.  Slow mitigation has removed our advantage in dps fights.  With our serious lack of dps and a mitigated slow, we have lost any real advantage over the other slowing classes.<br />
3.  Mana regen.  With our lack of dps, we should make up in other areas and we can with mana regen.  But, this is our mana regen, not others.  Being able to keep myself near full mana does nothing for the real dps classes who are constantly using that mana.  A beastlord can give SD, which gives everyone 8 mana regen and they can renew this buff whenever.  They also have an AA that gives mana/health regen every 15 min.  A chanter has the best mana regen in the game with VoQ.  Shaman have  nice mana regen.. but it's in the form of self regen only and only while standing still.  It's active, it's not passive.<br />
4.  Heals.  We don't have a problem keeping tanks alive outside of some parts of GoD.  With our new heal, we are better healers, but we are not ones that can normally function as the backup healer.  We cannot do the main healer duties anwhere from Vxed on, and from Ikkinz on we are suspect at best in our duties as the backup healer.  I've done it a few times, but it's not something that didn't happen without the proper classes around (read: we did have a pally there healing if needed, and we had a def tank with alot of hps.).  As it stands, our 1550 base heal increased to about an1750 heal would work wonders for us.  Would shut me up <br />
5.  Buffs.  So.. what buffs again do we bring to the table?  Well, we can focus someone, and those 554 extra hps are always nice.  But, then again, a beastlord can buff someone for more hps than we can (SV and Kraggs &gt; focus).  Well, we can FA someone, but Fero &gt; FA minus the recast time (more attack and it gives resists instead of giving out stat buffs when people are maxed out on stats already).  Well, Bily is nice, but yeah, can't cast it indoors.  If you like buffing, then Uqua is a shaman buffers paradise.  Problem with our buffs, is that they are almost all stat buffs, and most of us know that most people don't need stat buffs anymore.  Hell, if your magelo is correct Aprry, then even you don't benefit from stamina anymore, and besides that and focus, we have nothing (minus the occasional CHA for DI purposes).  <br />
 <br />
Guess the last thing is... there are numerous threads on this subject already on the EQlive forums as well as the Crucible.  If you want to see good and bad points about each one of these, go to one of those, there really was no reason to start another thread complaining about what we are missing.  Rytan has said that he's looking at our problems as soon as he can.  Let's hope he really is.</div></div><hr />

Actually, properly geared shaman can be the main healer in an earth group, if needed. I did it last night (and I am nothing but a half elementally equipped shaman). Our cleric went ld and we continued on even through the cleric never came back. We had a paladin as a backup healer and it was fine. Not ideal, and not optimal by any means, but feasible. <br />

You cannot main heal an earth group alone.  You admit it.  So you kept the group alive between cleric LD's.  Don't think for one minute that makes everything alright.<br />

hehe, so your first example of not being able to heal in plane of earth was shot down as rubbish, so you hone in on a specific trial, at a specific level and continue on.... classic.... hehe...<br />
<br />
I never tried to main heal at 63 and therefore can't debunk this. Should I roll a new shaman to try it, or de-level and give it a go?</div></div><hr />

Far from it, your post clearly states you had a pally backing you up.  Also, you state the cleric was there between ld's.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as trials go, the PoJ trial concept was so bad, sony had to unlock several of the planes to keep eq alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You said main healer Aprry, not only healer.<br />
<br />
I said we had a cleric as our main healer, and he went ld. I then said he never came back. Now, this in your eyes must mean that I was still a secondary healer. I guess the fact that the cleric never came back is irrelevant here? Should I have disbanded the group and re-invited them, thus ensuring I was crowned &quot;Main healer&quot;?<br />
<br />
If there is no cleric, druid, and I am the one performing the majority of the heals then I am the main healer. Tough concept I know.<br />

You cannot be the main healer in a Earth group without Pally backup.  Feel better?  <br />

Up through PoTime raiding, my heals were still quite useful for patching split tanks.  Hard LDoNs were the start of shaman becoming useless as main healer due to fight lengths being so short that the effect of slowing got drastically cut.  GoD took that to a new level, thus the major complaints about our healing/slowing powers.</div></div><hr />

If you guys think I can heal in PoE let me know.<br />
<br />
The gist of my message is this:<br />
Shaman need better heals.<br />
<br />
When I say shaman cannot heal in elemental groups, I need to clarify.  I cannot get a elemental group as a main healer.  The word is out, true or false, that shaman cannot heal in the elemental planes.  I apologize if I offered your better judgements by saying I can't.  Let me say If I tried to get an elemental group going as the main healer, i would still need 5 more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Your magelo explains a lot. Generally the only groups in the elementals are guild groups. I see that you are time flagged, and have a TA, but the rest of your gear is a ~50:50 mixture of nonraider stuff together with a smattering of elemental elemental/pre-elemental stuff. That would suggest that you are a new recruit to a high level guild. In all likelyhood the fact that you are not taken into those areas as a main healer probably means that you guildmates simply do not trust you in that role at this point. That is not the same as saying that you can't do it. In fact it has been repeatedly pointed out by many high level shaman that you can in fact do it.<br />
<br />
Oh, btw, accusing Val of being a BL with a shaman bot because he didnt agree with you was good for a few giggles, it was that absurd :D</div></div><hr />

So I get it, clerics and druids can walk into a elemental planes main healing situation as an unknown and get a group, but, shaman have to be trusted.  There is something distinctly retarded about that logic.<br />
<br />
When you are setting for hours trying to get those GoD flags, and you think back (if you can remember that far) to he11 of trying to get through PoJ trials, remember what kept you back in both situations, the lack of a real heal.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Hmm when I was elemental equipped I did find it hard to be a main healer in an earth group. I think  it really depends on the composition of your group and how controlled the pulls are. If the pulls are chaotic then a shaman has little chance of keeping up on heals. Also the tank has to be good, and have cleric/druid buffs.<br />
I don't think shamans should necessarily be upped in healing power though. First and foremost, shamans are slowers/debuffers. By being able to fill in the spot as main healer and slow 100% of the time, it makes little use of druids and clerics. It would be useful though to have a minor rez spell for the class. And some more boosting to buffing power+ debuffing. Playing final fantasy 8 recently, its interesting seeing other concepts such as zombie, blind(where all hits miss), silence, bezerk, confuse, and I've forgotten others but more debuff/status changes could be a nice addition for shaman.</div></div><hr />

I have a wife, a house, kids. I play roughly 10 hours a week, 4 of it raiding, 6 of it doing other stuff. I am home all day due to a disability, and I am STILL not &quot;uber&quot;. <br />

I might concede this point to you (except the stupidity part, as I mentioned already), those posts of mine were totally arrogant. Hey, heres a clue though, if you wanna see some REALLY arrogant posts, look up everything this guy &quot;Aprry&quot; has said. Talk about full of himself. <br />

<br />
Thats just fine, considering every time you open your digital mouth, you stick a digital foot in it. <br />
<br />
On a more serious, less arrogant side note, look at your gear man. Its a pathetic mix of twink crap and awesome stuff. It doesnt take a genius to see that a Valorium Ring of Gallantry is far better than a Coral Ring, and a Steel Earthan ring is even better than that, if you can afford one or win the role on a couple Elemental Stones. Did you even know that the Elemental Stone is a 90K tradeskill drop in Earth? Or did the person looting in your groups there fail to mention it if one happened to drop. Did you know you can SOLO a Valorium ring pretty easy, and even work the tradeskills up yourself to make it, and usually buy whatever you need in the bazaar? (enchanted metal, razorfiend talon, mettalic liquid, etc). Have you even bothered to LOOK UP ANY INFORMATION AT ALL?<br />
<br />
OK, I guess I am getting arrogant again. Grats on the TA and the Coral Ring combo. Its very solid. Rock on in Time man, your the bomb.</div></div><hr />

I had someone correct my pronunciation of a word just last week and I was thrilled because I now know how to say it right.

How about I just have an opinion that shaman can't actually effectively serve as main healers in elemental experience groups based on actual experience?  But they can survive.  woo woo<br />
<br />
All this thread has are guys stroking themselves while essentially conceding the groups really don't function well with shaman as main healers.  <br />
<br />
Except for root-rotters.  That's a sure demonstration of healing power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">A lot of this depends on gear and AA, and NOT JUST YOUR OWN.  So having a blanket statement about what does and doesn't work really doesn't apply well here.<br />
<br />
It's probably pretty fair to say that if a shaman is the main healer in an experience group in earth, he had better have a pretty darn good tank, both aggro and defensive AA and gear as well.  <br />
<br />
And he had better not have a bad run of slow resists.  And of course he should have all his mana-enhancing AA and preferably his healing and avoidance/mitigation AA coming along pretty nicely, if not already all the way there.<br />
<br />
I've healed in plane of earth when our main healer has died, too, but if slow resists and you get aggro on you, many elemental level shamans are paste pretty quickly.  Even if you get past the interrupts, you can't heal yourself faster than an unslowed mob can damage you before someone else attains aggro unless your gear is very high level.  The average guy is very likely to be in serious trouble on a resisted slow -- with perhaps no rez for when things go wrong.<br />
<br />
If you have fabulous luck and never get resisted slows, then you can do all right for a while, but then you have to take downtime to canni here and there, which a druid or cleric healer wouldn't.<br />
<br />
Combine a class who is a distinctly third-rate healer even with all his relevant AA's -- far worse than either a druid or a cleric with hardly any AA's at all -- with a bunch of people who don't want to die and get no rez because they're counting on a healer who is both inferior AND can't rez -- and you really have no reason to be invited in as a main healer in POE.<br />
<br />
People can if they want to, and are willing to pay the price of possibly slow pulls while you canni back mana, occasional deaths that a cleric or druid could have easily avoided without breaking a sweat, no rezzes when the deaths come that a third-rate healer can bring you.<br />
<br />
Being with time-geared and GoD-geared shamans who have 500 AA each can unbalance the equation, but so can being with shamans freshly elemental with little or no elemental gear, or being with shamans with not much in the way of AA.  And that doesn't even factor in absolutely critical factors like how much your tank has in the way of gear, AA, hitpoints, defensive AA, aggro generation capability, or the DPS of the rest of your group.<br />
<br />
It's too hard to say whether shamans &quot;can&quot; or &quot;can't&quot; heal in one place or another without bringing in enough clarity that you render the question almost pointless.<br />
<br />
There's such a wide variety in the levels of shamans and groups that different people can have completely different answers, and neither one from mere empty theorizing -- both earned from actual experience.  What a time-geared and an ornate geared shaman have to say to each other can just uselessly bounce off each other's skulls on an issue like this, neither one really listening to the other or understanding their completely valid perspective.</div></div><hr />

My comments were based solely on looking at his gear, and speculating that a lazy attitude in that direction probably translates to a lazy attitude in his play. <br />
<br />
As for the Big Dog comment, that was strictly a Message Board related comment. Meaning, basically, if you cannot stand to get flamed, you probably shouldnt post. Go look and see how much I have been flamed here. My rep list looks like a christmas tree, half red, half green. I have been shredded by some of the best, including Giac, Murtak, etc etc. Am I whining about it? Did I quit because someone dindt agree with me? Hell no, I just keep plugging away.<br />
<br />
As for the comment about shaman healing in EP groups, you are right, its doable, but not effective. I have done it a few times in Fire when our healer went LD for a while. /shrug, a lot depends on your gear, and your tanks gear, and your DPS in group. Most of the people I XP with tend to be in the &quot;upper half&quot; (mostly EP/VT, but not quite Time level) of those areas. <br />
<br />
Sorry, but people who wont even make the SLIGHTEST effort to improve themselves (and off the top of my head, he would probably get 200 hps with a few hours camping and 10K in pp or so) do not impress me in the SLIGHTEST. You wanna play and not improve yourself, fine. But dont come here flappin your gums about MY CAPABILIES when your wearing stuff I wouldnt even put on my twinks.

Who cares what the guy's magelo is?  It means nothing.<br />
<br />
Tons of retards who post on these forums have great magelos, and I've certainly encountered lots of people in game with crap gear who do great.<br />
I think his point is this:<br />
<br />
If you are going to complain you cannot function in a given zone you had better try hard before you complain. That includes working on your gear. When you still party wear Kunark-level gear you clearly are not trying hard in the gear area. To complain about getting shredded on slow resists when you are basically half-naked is hypocritical.<br />
<br />
That about sum it up Blazz?</div></div><hr />

Pretty much Murtak, thanks.<br />
<br />
Another thing is in perception of attitude. Gear is something I work on to increase my characters strength. I don't obsess over it, and i make some bad choices (hence the 2 Marr's Gift items, bah, why did I bid on that cloak!), but its something I pay attention too. I have seen guys like Appry in game. You say &quot;Why are you wearing that Widget Of Sukkyness&quot; and his response is invarabily &quot;I cant find anything better&quot;. So, I take 4.25 minutes, run to the bazaar, another 30 seconds to bring up bazaaar window, look up slot, sort for HPs, and link him the &quot;Far Better Widget of More Hps&quot; for only 1200 pp. That just isnt the kind of guy I want to play with, honestly. Nothing personal against him, he has every right to play as he sees fit. Had he said &quot;Too lazy to find something better&quot; I could actuall deal with that. <br />
<br />

<br />
This is true. I USUALLY do not measure a persons skill level by his gear, unless its OBVIOUSLY so poor that it seems tossed together from 3 or 4 twinks (and his was, seriously). But it doesnt take much effort. OK, you cant afford Steel Earthan Rings, I can understand that. Wear Valorium. Next best thing. See?<br />
<br />
/shrug. Apathy, especially when it comes to gear, doesnt score any points in my book. Like I said, if you want to play and not be concerned about inproving yourself, fine. Have a ball. But dont come here spewing nonsense about inferiority when you are not even willing to work on yourself.<br />
<br />
This is just me though, and I don't expect people to be as nitpicky about it. Its one of those things that just BUGS me, you know? For myself, and speaking ONLY for myself, the upgrading of my equipment is one of the funnest parts of the game. I did the shawl quest. I am currently in the middle of the Aid Grimel quest. I have camped my loot. I didnt let my guild hand me my spells or RGC, I camped/traded/bought them mysself. I LIKE to work on my character. I come here to see other peoples opinions, their ideas, their AA likes/dislikes. <br />
<br />
Yeah, ok I was rough on the guy. I was probably in a bad mood or something. Sorry. Happens. I am human. But there is nothing worse to me than someone who says &quot;I can't&quot; but isnt even really trying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're the main healer, someone else would be doing the slowing. To do otherwise is courting disaster. You dont see too many clerics or druids slowing, so why would a shaman acting as primary healer be doing that?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Blazz, just have to say that I completely agree with your comments about gear.<br />
<br />
There's nothing worse than someone who complains about their gear and does nothing to try to improve it (well, in some cases except for waiting for drops on guild raids).<br />
<br />
There's no excuse for really sucky gear at high levels, there's not one person who couldn't save up a few kpp at level 65 and I've seen people at 65 wearing stuff I wouldn't twink with.</div></div><hr />

I had such a problem with one of my former guildees who was in Time with us, because he was wearing dropable gear from the bazaar that I wouldn't put on my twink, yet he had so much dkp to rate in the top 5 of guild.  Then he decided to finally upgrade some of his gear, but he'd only settle for the top items, meaning he got a Quarm ring, while stilling wearing a 45 hp shoulder item.  I could have lived with him, but he was just an embarassement to our shamanhood.  After not playing for 2 months he decided to come back and convenietly announced that the next TA was his (was before I got mine, when she hadn't put out in like 15 kills and I was next).  Thankfully he wasn't online the night that it dropped and I got mine, as well as the same thing happening the next time she dropped one.  Think that he finally quit playing, after looting two quarm items, time bp and time legs.<br />
<br />
It's kinda the same problem that I had with Karaab.  I didn't have a problem with him not having money or playing in a raiding guild, i had a problem with him talking about how bad he had it cause his gear sucked and blaah blah but he wouldn't do anything about it to earn money to get better gear or anything.</div></div><hr />

LOL...i think a few of my items fit that description :)  I try to upgrade my gear, but seeing as i am not in the high content stuff, the gear i own does me just fine, and all the chain patterns that i have looted, except the hauberk (i bought that one hehe), are my prized items.  Someday if i get a lot of free time, i may join a high end guild and get hardcore, but now im a casual :)<br />

Lazy git by the sounds of it but doesnt DKP enable people to do this sort of thing?.Doesnt it also mean that he was within his rights to do this ?.Sounds more to me like there was a problem with your guild as if he was as badly equipped as you say i wouldnt have thought he'd be able to pull his weight on the raids he had been on.<br />

I really have no issues with a person like you wearing whatever you choose too. Are you whining about not being able to heal in a VERY dificult zone? Probably not. Are you wearing any Time items to go with your Coral Ring? Again, no. <br />
<br />
Just a tip, Valorium Ring is better than Coral. You can solo the guys who drop Metallic LIquid, or duo them with a tank friend really easy. They root well and dont seem to resistant to DOTs. Also, bag the Lodi for an EB only item, and grab one of the very very nice LDoN normal drop capes with nice HPs on them. <br />
<br />
If you get to TIme, then whine about your ability in the EPs, and you are still wearing the Coral Ring, then we will have issues :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Myself I do not have any issues with people wearing items, at any level, that I would not touch with a ten foot pole. It does not affect me at all, unless I group with them, and then I can always just leave the group.<br />
<br />
When those same people complain about not being able to tank, heal, slow or whatever other role they want to fill but can't due to gear though, I get annoyed. Gear is a big part of EQ, at least as important as level and AAs. If you neglect your gear don't expect to be able to do everything as well as someone who did not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">When I first got into elementals I was sadly geared.  However, the rest of my guild had already been there a bit, so they weren't.<br />
<br />
I remember my first trip there was me as main healer and an SK as our main tank.<br />
<br />
Had no problems other than multi pulls (we had no enchanter).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, that is of course if i ever get to PoTime.  Im a casual, and for now ill stay that way.  Thanx for the advise tho, i was actually planning to start replacing a lot of my wis items with gear that had more hp.  My hp sux :)  i have 2 valo rings, but they get used by my SK.  Might have to steal one or both MUAHAHAHA.<br />
<br />
<br />
But i love my coral ring.  Was given to me at lvl 26 when i was still a shaman in learning, well im still in learning but you get the idea :) , and i thought i hottest thing since sliced bread.  But sentimental value can be overlooked to beter the Phats hehe :)<br />

There's nothing wrong with your gear, Phattey. Really.<br />
<br />
What I was referring to are the people such as Valsuvious mentioned. People who complain about their gear yet do nothing to improve it. Such as the person in my (Quarm capable) guild who was wearing Pauldrons of Ferocity (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=1531), and a few similar items, and complained about how crap his gear was. A quick bazaar search yields several better items for under 10k.<br />
<br />
Another thing that bugs me is people who won't pick up loot that they can get, which would be a big upgrade, which is virtually rotting, because they're holding out for the *best* items. Like the guy who's wearing a Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement and an Earring of the Solstice when he's had numerous opportunities to loot the phase 1 time earring (Pulsing Emerald Hoop).<br />
<br />
It's kinda like someone dressed like a street urchin who won't spend a little cash on clothes because they're saving up for a $100,000 car.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">A time tank wearing those shoulders is pitiful indeed.  <br />

I certainly understand that point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I have been main healer in PoE and PoF xp groups.<br />
I have been the ONLY healer in PoE and PoF xp groups.<br />
I have been the ONLY healer in Sol Ro xp groups.<br />
I have done it quite handily.<br />
I was also doing it before I got all of my healing AAs.<br />
You sit on your horse, drop Q on the MT, and heal where needed.<br />
Q is almost enough to completely heal the tanks I party with (10k/2k warriors) when they tank stuff.<br />
As I am currently geared, I have taken over main healing on the 900 hitting partial slows in PoF 2nd wasteland, on top of doing malos/slows.<br />
Your inability to be main healer in POP is your own problem.<br />
I can handle 90% of healing in POP.<br />
The only stuff I can't handle is when mobs start to hit for more than 900 like in the 2nd castle in PoF or the sharks in PoW etc.</div></div><hr />

Not flaming or being a jerk BUT, keep in mind, you have some very decent gear and you are PoTime flagged (found your magelo on EQRankings).  With good gear and a group with likewise gear, you SHOULD be able to do content that you've passed (granted, not trivial content for one group).  Sure, YOU can handle that content, but that's not the gist of the discussion here.  If you look back to what BlargX said somewhere around page 2, healing in PoE and camps of similar dificulty are all dependant on your gear and the gear of your party.  A shaman in early elemental gear will have a rougher go of it than you, especially if his/her group is similarly geared.  While gear should limit what you can do in the EQ mudflation game, it shouldn't be a requirement to make exp content doable when that role is doable for other classes with lesser gear earlier (hope that makes sense and is taken in context).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Agree with Tarthug.<br />
<br />
Sure, I can go back and heal content that I've already passed and farmed.  I mean, is this a big surprise?<br />
<br />
The conversation seems to me to center around being able to contribute in the cutting edge encounters - be it healing, DPS, or debuffing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">I can heal okay against zone trash in Kod'Taz too - just need a cleric on the nameds, which is the main reason anyone goes there, so not much use really....

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">One of the biggest complaints about Gates so far is the sucky XP. People are going back to EPs for the amazing XP that is available in Earth and Fire. I bet if Gates had comperable XP, you would see more people there, and more input on the topic of &quot;Is a shaman valuable enough day-to-day in Gates&quot;. We already know we are basically useless on Nameds, and that a big, fat warrior with 2 solid healers (one MUST be a cleric) is required for these guys, but there is other related stuff. I mean, while a Time equiped shaman and a time equiped group could XP in earth, are they gonna be taking down the Pris Basalisk or The Living Earth without at LEAST a druid as main healer? I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">I don't know Blazz.. I think that we could main heal against a named in Earth, well, depending on group composition that is.  I would think it safe to say that I can do it with most of the warriors in my guild.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, from what you said about GoD.  Let's not confuse things.  Almost all named in Kod'taz are slowable.  The mini and boss mobs in ikk are not, but we can be the second healer now in those trials (I still haven't done the first one though since I passed it, so not sure how easy that one would be).  Scroll up and see that I main healed a tank vs. the Tipt archer.  And while, I wasn't exactly keeping him healed against the dmg being done, with DI and my heals it delayed the inevitable enough so that we won with him dying at 3% (I took over healing duties when the cleric died at 90%)</div></div><hr />
