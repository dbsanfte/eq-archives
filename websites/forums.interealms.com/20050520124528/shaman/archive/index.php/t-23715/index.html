Nooffense but it's a bit slow withthe semmingly hell levels and I dont want to devote all of mytime to be the serverwide first 70 shaman =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zamiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Screenshots can be faked and people live in different time zones.<br />
<br />
I was thinking more along the lines of just listing your server so people could verify by logging on and creating a level 1 mule. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can usually tell if a SS is faked unless they're a pro.</div></div><hr />

Revision: For those complete *cough* losers *cough* with an army of DPS bots, the first level 70s will appear within 2-5 hours (before 9am PDT September 15th).</div></div><hr />

<br />
People exploiting to get xp ?  Never happen in EQ!  ;)<br />
<br />
I'm actually more concerned about the mention of 'rollbacks'.  whats up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sounds like someone was using a known exploit, well known by quite a few that were in beta (even the Devs that were told about it), in a particular OoW zone where you could kill mobs, lots of mobs (think on the level of 1 AA per 5 mins lots), without them being able to touch you.   I guess the Dev's were watching and rolled them back.  If so, serves them right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
and not many could do so even if they wished... there are probably 5 people who seriously have the ability to do it</div></div><hr />

They shouldn't have rolled them back, they shoulda been permabanned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Nah, roll back is good enuf, can't ban them and lose the $.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>jratkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think wasting all that time to be rolled back to 65 is a decent punishment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jkana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">They apparently rolled back some people taking advantage of a certain Ikkinz encounter as well.  That one has been around even longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">3 people in Thlayli's guild are currently level 70 on Xev. None shamans yet though, but they were in PoFire pretty much 100% since the servers came up.</div></div><hr />

It was actually a group of AV, all roomates that played together for just over 21 hours straight.  The group was a Ranger, Warrior, Rogue, Druid, Shaman and an SK.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">A group of Altera Vita guildmates and myself just completed a 21.5 hour exp grind to ding us all level 70. So i thought i'd post and share some data with everyone that's interested in what they can expect.<br />
<br />
First, the entire grind was done in PoFire in teh second castle. All mobs were level 68. The exact time of the grind took 21:38:40 (rounded to the nearest :05). We killed 1255 mobs. That averages to 0.3195% reg exp/mob and 0.30877%exp/minute.<br />
<br />
here's teh breakdown in # of mobs it took to ding each level.<br />
<br />
67 - 261<br />
68 - 291<br />
69 - 332<br />
70 - 371<br />
<br />
Additionally, AA exp on these mobs at lvl 70 was right at 4%/mob as compared to 5%/mob at 65.<br />
<br />
I hope this information proves useful and informative to those heading out this week to grind it out.<br />
<br />

<br />
Wow, 261 PoFire mobs to ding one level.  BoT would require alot O_o.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Exponentially more since they were fighting 68s at db to them, whereas at 65, most bot mobs are db already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Well I made it, finally. I know a few had said others were first, but I didn't see any ss's so gonna post one anyway =p<br />
<br />
I was 3rd on the server, next to two of my guildies, a warrior and cleric. I'm on Solusek Ro btw.<br />
