<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mazirus Slaymaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">IS there something special about these?<br />
<br />
they would take 50 mana and add 30hp<br />
<br />
A friend keeps telling me there is some secret that makes them really good for shammies</div></div><hr />

Lots of AC,  HP, and a resist most shaman aren't extremely high in.   Wis is easy to get in other slots.  Hell if you are doing NTOV you will be overflowing with Wis and Mana soon enough.  Get your stamina to 205, it adds a good bit of HP.  Don't worry about going over 205 because you'll always have Talisman of Brute up from casting it so much so any excess stamina is wasted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">These *almost* have monk priority in my guild.  The hps are nice tho, but to be honest my wis is lacking lately.  Going to a pure melee class set of legs for a mere 50hps plus what . . like 30 more from the stam add (approx. equal to my current SS legs), a lot less wis and mana . . . increase in only ac in the end of it . . . nah not worth it.  AC is also cheap lately.  These are GREAT monk legs tho, and I'd hate to take that away from a guildie monk who needed em.  Heck, I'd take em for my twink monk before I'd loot em for my main.  <br />
<br />
As it stands I'm having a hard time finding legs better than my current set . . .perhaps Kael chain if I can snag a pair.  Don't mention the onyx ones either . . they lack all hps and hps are important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont consider them an upgrade over wolf caller's either. I prefer the total stats on my old green pants over these, plus a few guild monks still need them yet and they are ugly as hell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">These almost rot for us, being divided between fashion-loving bards and desperate-for-AC rangers. Shamans tend to keep their Skyshrine pantaloons, while monks wait for flayed Barbarian flesh trousers.</div></div><hr />
