<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keldrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So... if shamans have weak heals to compensate for having slow, where are the zone's where mobs mitigate heals?<br />
<br />
I'd love to see mobs where slow was fully effective, but heals of the damage they do could only be &quot;slightly&quot; or &quot;partially&quot; effective.  How loud do you think Clerics and Druids would scream if the situation was reversed?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Eh, then we'd be equally screwed, because our heals which are inferior would be scaled back by the same ammount.<br />
<br />
If heals only did 25% in a zone, you're basically comparing healing against a fully slowable mob with a 325 point heal versus a 1875 Cheal or 690ish supernal Light.<br />
<br />
I think the example you're looking for is one which presents a situation where cleric and druid ability to prevent people from dying is penalized and shamans are not.<br />
<br />
Such a situation simply cannot exist</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are mobs that have AEs that reduce the effectiveness of heals, Balance of Zeb is one such effect  (as Grizlor pointed out).   There are also mobs in GoD that have effects like that.<br />
<br />
I dunno where this post came from, cause slow mitigation is OLD NEWS.  Before you run around spewing out this crap about having slightly effective heals, you should remember that it would hurt us worse than anyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Or we could make a zone where heals do damage and vice versa, and then!....<br />
<br />
Well ****, nevermind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What are you smoking to imagine that, say, a 20% heal mitigation would hurt us worse than clerics?  Our oh-so-impressive 1300 hp heal would be reduced to 1040.  A complete heal would be reduced from 7500 to 6000.<br />
<br />
For the math-impaired:<br />
We'd lose 260 hps for the same mana.<br />
Clerics would lose 1500 hps for the same mana.<br />
<br />
I don't see the sense of calling for healing nerfs, myself, but please.  Can we at least have arguments with a shred of logic and/or accuracy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I fail to see how asking for zones to be tuned in a way to hurt other classes is positive. Healing appears to be the debate of the day, and yet there is a rift over HoT vs blast. Strange how any kind of CH gets lambasted. We want to heal better but ensure that our heals are just not quite good enough for us to have to do it on a raid. And yet, the same people complain that on a raid they can go and get a haircut while they wait for the boss mob to be killed as they don't stack.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if some courtesy is shown between all three sides consensus might be found. When differing sides have to dig in in a defensive position the only real discourse appears to be counter attacking.<br />
<br />
I'll wait till you all kill each other, or meet in the middle and listen before I add my healing thoughts, I wonder how many others are doing exactly the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just give shaman an HoT that heals 950 pts/tick for 450 mana and 5 second cast and be done with it.  That would be about equiv. to what GoD mobs hit for vs. what kunark mobs hit for back when Torpor was introduced.<br />
<br />
I know it's not too likely, but hey, I wouldn't mind seeing a 950 pt/tick HoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think you guys are missing Keldrak's original point.  All he is saying is that heal mitigation would impact clerics and druids (among others) the same way slow mitigation impacts shaman (among others).  Everyone takes slow mitigation for granted now, however, I think we all agree that there would be an uproar if there were more pervasive heal mitigation in game.  <br />
<br />
However, the point is that slow mitigation limits our effectiveness and in some cases usefullness.  The same would happen to clerics and druids if there were more heal mitigation.  However, their heals (with very little mitigation in game) keep getting bigger and bigger, while our slow (with more and more mitigating mobs in game) has been stagnant at 75% for years.<br />
<br />
Just something to think about, no more, no less.<br />

A zone where nukes are mitigated. Try to imagine the outcry on the wizard boards .. hehe<br />

<br />
Have you fought many mobs that have effects that change how healing works?   Maybe you haven't and maybe you have.  My experience is centered mostly on the effect you find in Ssra and one that you see in GoD.<br />
<br />
The ones in Ssra, which proc Balance of Zeb (- linked above), for example, hurt me a lot more than they hurt clerics.  Let me explain.<br />
<br />
They reduce healing effectiveness TO 25%.<br />
<br />
cleric - complete heal - 7500 - w/balance 1875<br />
cleric - holy light - 3275 - w/balance 819<br />
<br />
druid - karana's renewal - 4680 - w/balance 1170<br />
druid - sylvan infusion - 2100 - w/balance 525<br />
<br />
shaman - kragg's mending - 1950 - w/balance 488<br />
shaman - tnarg's mending - 1300 - w/balance 325<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd still argue that since our heals are the smallest, we suffer the most from changes like this that cause them to do less healing.  A bigger heal, even cut down to 25% is still a bigger heal...and everyone has bigger heals than us.  A cheal will still land for 2k with AA, when an effect like this is on a tank.  That is still significant.  The arguments we have been having about our heals being weak haven't been about efficiency of heal, it has been about SIZE of heal.<br />
<br />
Since Heal over time is a fixed amount per tick, they are not effected by this type of effect.  In this way, we have an advantage over druids, but we are still far behind clerics in ability to heal around this.  Since we lack an AA heal over time (like clerics, druids and beastlords have) this also makes it difficult to say that we are hurt less than other classes.<br />
<br />
The only other heal reducing ability that really doesn't impact shamans is one I have come across in GoD.  It reduces healing spell effectiveness on healing spells with a cast time of 10 seconds... so specifically a nerf on cheal and iCH.  I guess it could theoretically be bad for us too, if anyone actually used Kragg's mending.<br />
<br />
I just think it's pretty funny that someone would say:<br />
1.  We get bad heals because of slow<br />
2.  Now ( 18 months ago ) there is slow mitigation<br />
3.  We should get more mobs that mitigate heals to punish druids and clerics too<br />
<br />
...oh wait, that would hurt us as well... in fact make our problem with weak heals even worse.<br />
