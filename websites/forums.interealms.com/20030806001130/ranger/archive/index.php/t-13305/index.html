<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwerdon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hehe ok so, I'm stuck here. I've gotten a copper, iron, steel and stone key and none of them work on the doors. I fell in through the false floor and now I'm stuck. Any idea on how to get out of here? Any info would be greatly appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Umm . . . know any porters who can come and get you?<br />
<br />
Or do you carry a Thurg Gate potion on you at all times?<br />
<br />
If the answer to these questions is no, then I've got one last question.  Does your server have a port channel?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwerdon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. Yes, but I prefer to get myself out. :)<br />
2. No I'm a very poor ranger<br />
3. I play on Rallos Zek, which isn't well known for it's community aspect, so I doubt there is a port channel. :(</div></div><hr />

 r RE: jail area  By: Fallacy, <br />
&gt; there's a pitfall that lands you into a jail <br />
&gt; cell which has a single secret wall you can <br />
&gt; walk through, which in turn leads to a second <br />
&gt; jail cell with the front door busted down. <br />
&gt; there is no way to escape from this area, and <br />
&gt; none of the goblins we killed in the entire <br />
&gt; time we were there yielded a key...petitioning <br />
&gt; just got us a &quot;you're sol&quot; response. bring a <br />
&gt; group gater, or get ready to bent over and <br />
&gt; slowly starve to death in this nonsensical area <br />
&gt; of Droga. on the up side, the second jail cell <br />
&gt; seems to be safe if you sit on the back wall. <br />
<br />
The goblin penmaster which spawns in front of the jail (around the fire there) and who has a placeholder which is one of two spiders (neither dropped anything that I recall, other than spider silk) drops two items that unlock the outer and inner door to the jail.  These items do not look like keys, and it took us quite awhile to figure out what they were for. <br />
<br />
The penmaster spawn is targetable from inside the jail, although he can only be pulled with a spell (arrows have a tough time getting through the grating.) So falling in without a key isn't necessarily a have-to-gate-or-pick-lock situation. <br />

You need to kill the goblin Penmaster, and you need a bone key to open the inner door and a bone neclace to open the outer door. So you need to kill him atleast twice. He is a random spawn outside the jail so you need to shoot and kill everything outside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Magrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just a FYI, I found bind sight invaluable in targeting specific mobs outside the jail cell when I found myself there.  But, after killing a few key dropping mobs, I gave up trying to get out the he-man's way, and just gated to Thurg.<br />
<br />
You really should look into getting your pottery skills up high enough to make the Thurg gate potion.  It's really not that expensive, and it has saved my silly ranger tookus several times now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The item that opens the door is a bracelet of some sort, not a key.  And yes, carry a Thurgadin gate potion with you at all times, even if you're KOS in Thurgadin.  CR in Thurgadin is easier than most dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwerdon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks everyone, I'll let you know when I get out. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Icye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL sorry bro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwerdon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Oh I finally made it out (forgot to post). The Bone key opens the inner cell door and the bone necklace opens the outer door. They drop off the penkeeper and the penmaster. :) Thanks everyone for their help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">glad you made it wout without any problem ...</div></div><hr />
