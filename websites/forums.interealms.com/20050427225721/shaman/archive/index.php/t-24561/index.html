woohoo, excellent!  I don't regret blowing my bankroll in EQ on some upgrades for my monk then!<br />
<br />
Damn I'm stoked.  Time to start saving me pennies!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cool, thanks for the post. I wasn't able to get into beta for either WoW of EQ2. I was going to go ahead and say &quot;screw you&quot; to Sony and play WoW but recently I've changed my mind and I think I'll go EQ2 to start with. I may switch to WoW later or play both eventualy.<br />
<br />
What has turned me away a bit from WoW is just the amount of idiots on thier forums and the fact that the game seems to be made for the kids. Also, at first I didn't mind the cartoonish graphics in WoW, but the more videos and info I see after the NDA was lifted for EQ2 WoW looks goofy at times.<br />
<br />
Any, enough of my tired rambling.</div></div><hr />

I think you will get that everywhere...except here ofcourse where we are all sensible, intelligent people :)<br />

<br />
There is definately a lot more humor in WoW than in EQ. Six-legged crocodiles and radioactive gnomes tend to make me laugh. But most things a couple of levels above you and elite mobs several levels below you will kill you quick if you just stand there laughing ;)</div></div><hr />

I guess I should have said that there are more idiots on the WoW forums than most other game sites. I also don't mean that the game is a cartoon for kids. I should have said the game seems to be made for someone that doesn't want to put effort for a long period of time into their character. And finally I should have just said that the graphics in EQ2 look so cool I want to see them more than WoW's.<br />
<br />
I shouldn't start typing after I've only been awake for five minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats great, now they just need to release the damn OB so we can all start playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Right now the driving factor between my WoW or EQ2 choice is the relative quality of the products.  EQ2, which is no where near ready for release, is bound and determined to open in November.  WoW, which last summer was (content and bug-wise) better than EQ or SWG at their one-year-after-release anniversaries, &quot;may&quot; be released in November (if it's not right, it's not right).<br />
<br />
I don't think I'm up for another SWG-like release with SOE.  The Jump to Lightspeed (JTLS) beta test once again reinforced SOE's philosophy of &quot;get it out there for some bucks now - we'll fix it whenever.&quot;</div></div><hr />

well allot of blizzards products are directed at &quot;kids&quot; so that might be the reason for the high number of &quot;kids&quot; that will join in WoW at the beginging ...<br />
<br />
about the hole cartoonish thing about WoW ... well you have to accept it since it is based on the 3 games that came before WoW so it is really ment to look goofy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail, a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
Though in truth I do believe that there is pressure from Vivendi to release for sure.  For a # of reasons which include a lot of time and money in development so far with little to no return yet, the pending holiday selling season, and issues with regard to competition with EQ2.<br />
<br />
I am an adult, and WoW appeals to me.  I don't care what the game is you will run into plenty of mature and immature alike, regardless of age.  Yes b.net is rampant with kiddies, but that is primarily because WC3/TFT are standalone games and online gaming is free for those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm pretty sure Blizzard came out and said &quot;don't believe any release dates regarding WoW unless you hear them from US - we'll be plenty excited and won't be 'slipping' the information to a lone reporter&quot;... or something like that.<br />
<br />
As much as I want to play this game, I'm glad they're taking their time.  It's fairly obvious that EQ2 is being released FAR ahead of any hope of its being ready.</div></div><hr />

November 8th  + 2 weeks (IE, 14 days) = November 22nd.<br />

Hmmmm you do realize that the game has to go GOLD first. And AFTER it goes gold it takes a month to make the cd's, boxes, etc etc and then ship them to various places around the world. HL2 went gold already but it's not in the stores YET. I do believe we will be playing retail by Christmas. But nov22 just seems rather early.<br />

They can do all that in a week. <br />

It doesn't really matter. Open beta is a few days away so we will be playing this game sooner then later.</div></div><hr />

I'm trying to decide if you are a pessimist or a drama queen.  Like Div says, DAoC went from gold to my doorstep in 7 days.  Vivendi doesn't waste time with that &quot;burn 'em, box 'em, ship 'em&quot; process.  <br />
<br />
I can't speak for HL2 - maybe Bioware hand paints their boxes.  Or maybe they just wait until the gold CD is cut before they get started on documentation!  I'd be willing to bet the WoW manuals and boxes are all sitting in a warehouse somewhere as we speak, and a couple of hundred CD-burner/labler machines are powered up and ready to go!</div></div><hr />

I always thought Shipped software was stamped out, not burned.</div></div><hr />

Hey i wanna play WOW as much as the next guy i just don't see it happening this soon. It's just my opinion. I know beta is &quot;soon&quot; (sigh that is the new and dreadful word we will have to get used to &quot;soon&quot; In Blizzard terms has been proven to mean anywhere between 6 months to a year :D )<br />
<br />
At least i know that Open Beta will be in november and that makes me happy. As for the retail i will probably get the collector's edition. WOW on dvd &gt; CD and the artbook /drool :D<br />
<br />

<br />
mass produced CDs ( the normal ones atleast ) is indeed stamped instead of burned since it takes too long to burn a CD <br />
<br />
about the manuals i dont think they have been printed yet ... chances are that they will find a correct a few things in open beta that would make a pre openbeta manual outdated ... it does not take that long to print them any way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I always thought Shipped software was stamped out, not burned.<br />
/shrug.  Thanks for the correction.  Mentally replace the word &quot;burned&quot; with &quot;stamped&quot; in my post - it's all good now.<br />

True enough - Blizz is one of the last of the major developers (iD and Valve being the others!  :) ) that ships when a program is ready.  Luckily their standards are higher than my own &quot;SOE-influenced&quot; standards as I would have shipped last summer.  Since that time the content has exploded, graphics have improved immensely, and gameplay has been refined well beyond what I expected.  It'll be worth the wait whenever it comes out.  ;)  Besides, if the last 4 months of beta are any indication, content will continue to expand at a rapid pace after release.</div></div><hr />
