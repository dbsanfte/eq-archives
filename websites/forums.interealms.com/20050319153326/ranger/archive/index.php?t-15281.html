So i'm new to this game, and maybe this has been covered to death. Someone should write a guide for newbies. I did the armor quest in sarufel and am working on a couple other small quests, but pretty much i'm just stumbling around. Is there somewhere i can go to hunt for good armor? Or are<br />
 there more quests out there for low level players?<br />

P.S.  Stop shouting for buffs every three seconds.  All you are doing is clogging up the chat window with your whining. <br />

Most of the quests are designed to be completed by groups though, so if you wait to do it when you can do it solo the reward will not be very good for you. I suggest you try and do most of them the old fashion way by talking with NPCs in the game. This makes the story line of the game and the quest a lot more fun and exciting. However, if you want quest info you can allways try http://everquest.allakhazam.com/   good luck.<br />
