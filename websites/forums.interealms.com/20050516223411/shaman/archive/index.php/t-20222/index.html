<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It was early afternoon, and there I was in KoD, watching another trial group being formed.  Long and behold, I was asked to be in a group  :eek:  :D .  <br />
  Now most of you know already how things get going for these trials.  We buff, run close to the trial zone in, and the Cleric DAs himself.  He then runs in and everyone else follows (fastest way).  And of course, who is the ONLY person that dies ?  So then the cleric runs back out, DAs himself again, and pulls my corpse to zone in.  Pulls then started even before I had mana to shrink myself.   <br />
<br />
 After about 45 min of trash pulling, we finally came to the second and final boss mob.  The cleric then told me what he wanted me to do, &quot;I am going to need you to stand next to the chanter and keep him alive, while the Druid and I keep the tank healed&quot;.  Well, that wasnt exactly the extent of what I had in mind, but I figure I can sneak a few dots and spot heals in when no one was looking.<br />
<br />
 Things went quite smooth.  Obiously this seemed to be the right group for the job.<br />
After about 3 minutes we had the mob down to about 5% hit points, then of course everything got ugly. <br />
 The adds broke mez and ripped the chanter in half, then proceded to drop the warrior face down on the floor.  Then all of a sudden the cleric shouted &quot;Burn, Burn it down&quot;.  I figured we didnt have a chance in hell we could even cast a spell without being eaten alive. But..........................<br />
<br />
The cleric then ran into the room, as all the mobs scowls over to him.  And it was there that I watched in awe, seeing the cleric die five times before my very own eyes {xxxx Death pact has been benevolently fulfilled}.   &quot;hurry, burn it down&quot;.   &quot;My dots are doing all that they can, I do not have my small DD memed&quot;.   The boss was then turned into dust as the druid criticaled the final blow to the mob.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy cow that is some AA you have&quot; ........ &quot;Its not bad, but im sure you have some good AAs yourself &quot; ....... &quot;Well, we have 2 broken AAs, and an expensive AA that lets our pet get hit by group buffs &quot; ...... &quot;?, I thought shaman pets have always gotten hit by group buffs&quot; ...... &quot;Yes, they used to at one time, but I guess the devs didnt have time to think of any usefull AAs for us.  So they denied us something, then made us work to get it back&quot; ...... &quot;We really got nothing usefull thats worth braging about&quot; ...... &quot;NOW, that is not true.  They gave you Godly Clerics /wink &quot;<br />
<br />
I couldnt stop laughing, discovering the secret of the devs class balancing resolution (they gave everyone uber clerics)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nice story but.... Cleric AA divine intervention makes them divine aura, he wouldnt of held agro over your other group members.  This divine aura will last for approximately 36 seconds with buff focus though, long enough to sit and camp out while under attack, which is probably unintentional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He's not talking about BDA<br />
<br />
He's talking about Touch of Divine, which gives the cleric a chance to automatically get rezzed after a death. It's awesomely awesome, but sometimes funny when they keep popping back in and end up killing the rogues.<br />
<br />
It's the kind of AA a cleric needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I &quot;touched&quot; this argument in another thread. This AA is incredibly powerful for many reasons. In my opinion it is too powerful and, if you try to argue with a Cleric you get the &quot;It costs 60 AAs!&quot; answer right to your face from them(as if that mattered).<br />
The cleric was probably clicking off the DA and casting DI on himself as well to double the chances and keeping aggro.<br />
<br />
This is no class envy or anything, but a skill that gives a full mana heal, heals you for 400 per tick for 6 ticks, DA's you for 36 seconds(allowing you to camp off in a safe spot) and seems to have a success rate of 50% on top of all the other things, seems a bit too much of survivability to me.<br />
<br />
You will notice that this was an exception and that this skill usually won't pop 5 times in a row, but an Innate Divine Intervention that fills your mana bar(you will lose all your buffs when the skill kicks in fyi, just as if you had died minus the rezz effects and the empty mana bar), is a skill I would have liked for sure(even without the built in super DA).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">an expensive AA that lets our pet get hit by group buffs &quot; ...... &quot;?, I thought shaman pets have always gotten hit by group buffs&quot; ...... &quot;Yes, they used to at one time, but I guess the devs didnt have time to think of any usefull AAs for us.

<br />
<br />
As long as I have had the capability to cast group buffs, my pet was never hit with them. <br />
<br />
I seriously can't believe you are complaining about a cleric self-DI AA heh.   It costs 60 points, and it's far from a sure thing.  I think it is pretty reasonable AA for this expansion, where CRs are a bitch.  It has a fair number of drawbacks, all buffs stripped - cannot cast while DA'd.  If you click off the DA to cast, you are buffless and more vulnerable.  If your agro isn't cleared, cleric splatter.  <br />
<br />
Honestly, it's complaining and class envy posts like this that keep people from taking us seriously.  This ability does not infringe on our power in the slightest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, now I am confused. If you are referring to my post, you are dead wrong. This skill would have been nice for Shamans due to the aggro we take and the pure lack of defense, but in no way am I saying that this infringes on our power.<br />
The class envy paranoia is getting a bit old. If the Wizard class got a DT, it wouldn't infringe on my powers either, but I sure as hell would call that overpowering(and it wouldn't matter if it cost 300 AAs).<br />
<br />
I mentioned the &quot;drawbacks&quot; in my post, but I am not sure you can call those drawbacks considering the Cleric would be *dead* otherwise(the mana heal easily offsets the loss of buffs). While this can still arbitrarily be called a downside, I will not accept &quot;cannot cast while DA'd&quot; as such. A 36 second DA is the first and only DA that allows a class to camp out safely(looks it's the class with the rezz stick, how handy!). In addition, it doesn't prevent you from casting, since you can just click it off whenever you like.<br />
<br />
Not making a huge fuss about this. This skill has a 50% success rate. I have yet to see it work more than 3 times back to back, but I still think that the clerical defensive abilities are a tad too high compared to the 2 other priests, if you add the various other abilities.<br />
<br />
Edit: Groupbuffs have never hit our pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mbbkw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Where did you get the information that it heals the cleric's mana?  To my knowledge it doesn't.<br />
<br />
And it's just like Divine Intervention in that you have to be low on hp for it to fire.  If you're getting nailed by hard-hitting mobs, chances are pretty good that you die without ever getting the chance for TotD to fire.  If you have the full AA (60 points), it makes us pretty friggin hard to kill in duels, but against GoD mobs?  Psssh.  I have a hard time believing that TotD fired for a cleric five times in a row in GoD.  I smell something fishy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was under the impression that at one time group buffs did hit dogdog if you targeted him when casting...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaffo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It does NOT heal your mana, if it goes off  it places a HoT and DA on you and stripes your buffs and you are left with what ever mana you had before it went off so if you where OOM then you will still be OOM if you where FM you will still be FM, the same way the spell DI does, but the spell dosen't strip your buffs, where the AA does.<br />
<br />
   And about it going off 5 times in a row /shrug, sounds like that was one lucky cleric who most likely had the spell DI up also. I have had it go off only one time in GoD. The only time it seems to actually go off is when I don't want it to. Attempting to make invis potion corpes in GoD, running and die so I could get a death drag to raid. Trying to die so I could get clicked back in and divine rezz myself due to the fact I was running OOM. (Was funny as hell though, the monk yelling DIE cleric DIE already....It fired 2 times in a row for me then :) ) But everytime I have wanted it to work it hasn't, as I said i have had it fire 1 time for me from mob damage. /shrug The spell is actually better since at least then I don't lose my buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mojarda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was under the impression that at one time group buffs did hit dogdog if you targeted him when casting...?<br />
<br />
You are correct.  I didn't notice this until Velious Era, but if you targetted Dogdog and cast any group buff (at least the ones I had), he would get them as well as the entire group (no other toons' pets got the buff, though).  I remember doing this with Spirit of Bih'li (sp?), so they ability at least made it to early Luclin Era.<br />
<br />
IIRC, prior to PoP's release, I was unable to buff Dogdog this way, and I don't recall any mention by SOE of the nerf.<br />

<br />
I think this is incredibly unfair, Henora, and not the kind of reasoned thinking I've come to expect from you.  I don't think the point was &quot;nerf clerics!&quot; -- while I'll agree that class envy is silly and ugly; I thought it was pretty clear that what he was really trying to draw attention to is the fact that our GoD AA's suck sweaty, hairy, diseased donkey balls.  Coupled with the fact that other classes DID get fun and/or useful AA.  Lots of them.<br />
<br />
There's no subjective opinioning going on here.  These AA are crap.  Whereas clerics got this 50% DI, enchanters got Doppleganger, nukers got another tier of SCS and critical nukes, melees got more dmg and/or hp type AA....  (rogues got hastened escape - which is a 100% get out of jail free card, btw - where's our hastened canni?)<br />
<br />
What are the shaman core abilities?  Slow, buffs, and healing?  Did we get AA with GoD that improved ANY of these things?  Nope.  We didn't.  Judging by the extreme cost of getting our pet hit with group buffs, I guess we're to believe that our PET is our core ability.  Oh, wait, that pet is JUST above the SK pet in terms of survivability and DPS.  <br />
<br />
I'm sorry if people think that drawing attention to this pathetic set of AA makes us whiners who justify everyone's opinion that we're undeserving of upgrades, but I just don't buy the &quot;be patient, all will be well&quot; crap anymore.  No, I don't worry about my place with groups OR my guild, but for chrissakes, could we have some FUN aa at least?  I've given up on getting anything useful, I'll settle for fun.  Something I'd bother spending points on.<br />
<br />
I'm far more tired of hearing people complaining that drawing attention to this crap is harming our cause, than I am of hearing from those who complain too much.  I'm now complaining about the people complaining about the original complainers.  *grin*</div></div><hr />

Doesnt always strip buffs and most certainly doesnt give back mana.

This is exactly what you should expect from me.  Listen, my point is, if you want to draw attention to our problems, that's fine.  Post a review of our AA, at the end maybe compare it to some other classes who get AA that you think is a good example of something that is helpful or useful.  Comparison is part of the game and comparisons can be done without being a post of whining and class envy that we are constantly accused of.<br />
<br />
If you think that this particular AA is overpowered, post about that.  I'd suggest including some testing that you have done with a cleric who has the skill so you can provide evidence that you think it is too powerful.  Making inflamatory posts, with a title like &quot;The ALMIGHTY Clerics&quot; it sure as hell doesn't say to me &quot;Shaman GoD AA needs review for upgrades&quot;.  If you want to get shaman AA changed, the way to do that is not to go off about how uber the AA of another class is.<br />
<br />
This is not a discussion drawing attention to our problems, or the fact that shaman AA are boring and unuseful.  This is a rant about how someone doesn't feel useful and is jealous of this cleric AA.   <br />
<br />
-Henora<br />
 <br />
P.S. - For the record, I'm jealous of this particular AA too.  I think it's nice and I too would like it for myself, if I could sample through the AA's for all the classes, there are certainly ones I would want more.  Like Divine Arbitration...  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">LOL, well this was blown way out of proportion.  Look, I was amused by what had happened to me.  Yes, I was a little jealous, but we did win.  <br />
I am not saying the clerics are overpowered, even though they seem to be imune to dying now.<br />
<br />
The next morning I did have a little chat with the cleric.  Apparently it was all mostly luck, due to the fact that the add mobs hit light, so the skill had a better chance of working(il talk about that later).  He also had DI spell on him, which did save him one of the times (buffs are not striped when the AA skill works).  He then proceded to brag, as he dueled me.............<br />
<br />
1) &quot;xxxx Death pact has been benevolently fulfilled&quot;<br />
2) &quot;xxxx Death pact has been benevolently fulfilled&quot;<br />
3) &quot;xxxx Death pact has been benevolently fulfilled&quot;<br />
4) &quot;xxxx Death pact has been benevolently fulfilled&quot;<br />
5) &quot;xxxx Death pact has been benevolently fulfilled&quot;<br />
6) &quot;xxxx Death pact has been benevolently fulfilled&quot;<br />
7) &quot;xxxx Death pact has been benevolently fulfilled&quot;<br />
8) &quot;xxxx Death pact has been benevolently fulfilled&quot;<br />
9) You have slain xxxx !<br />
<br />
After about 1 hour of that, the cleric then told me the secret of the DI skill and spell.   Apparently it can only work, if your hp is in between 1hp-10%hp.  So if you are at lets say 16%hp, and the mob hits you for 2k+, your dead.  And since Shaman have no type of nuke like that, I couldnt slay him on the first try.  According to the 3 clerics that maxed this skill already in my guild, it seems to work about 85% of the time, if you get in that hp range.</div></div><hr />

Henora, you seem to have lost the main functions of what public forums are.  It almost seems as if you only want people to post about <br />
&quot; discussions drawing attention to our problems, or the fact that shaman AA are boring and unuseful &quot;.   Everyone seems so wrapped up in jealousy and bitching, that no one seems to see any posts as anything else.   <br />
Look, I thought what had happened was amusing.  Infact, when I heard the cleric tell me, &quot;NOW, that is not true. They gave you Godly Clerics /wink &quot;,  I was laughing my ass off.   I figured some of you would have approached it on the same way.   Guess not .....  :(</div></div><hr />
