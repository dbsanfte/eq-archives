<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK last night while auctioning my coldain skin gloves and my sarnak battle shield (/boggle) I recieved a tell and was asked if I would accept Barbed Rubicite Greaves for em. Now Imedietly I thought this was a joke, anyways I make the trade ( SBS and Gloves (4k for both ) Greaves (25 30k on quellious). Just wondering what to do now, keep em? ( 65hp and 22 ac is nice along w/ wis/dex/sta and minor sv's ) or sell em? ( I have full thurg armor ). Sooo what to do?<br />
<br />
PS: Im 52 and the legs have recommended lvl 51.<br />
<br />
PPS: hehe Btw I have JBB/fungi so no real upgrades needed except for a new shield &amp; coldain gloves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">keep those legs, i'd say... pretty hard to find legs with that many hit points outside of ntov / luclin ueber encounters.<br />
<br />
the shield and gloves are trivial to obtain.  on tribunal, the gloves sell for 2k and the shield for 3k.  in fact, the sarnak shield is considered a twink item to almost everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree Talamay - good leg pieces are tough to come by, and those are well above average.  You do not appear to have any immediate use for the plat, so go with the greaves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What are the exact stats oin barbed rubicite greaves?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ac22 +65hp +3dex +3wis +3sta +3sv fire +3sv cold</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I might have to disagree...<br />
<br />
Those legs are definitely great for the end-game, where HP are more and more important due to Cann5, and the fact that every item you're wearing has tons of AC and WIS already on it.  I see you're 52, though, so it's not obvious that your gear selections primarily revolve around HP.<br />
<br />
Remember, tradeable gear depreciates.  CT gear is depreciating rather rapidly.  If it's going to take you another year to hit 60 with enough AA for Cann5, I recommend selling these.  You'll be able to buy them back for a fraction of what you can get for them now when you actually need them.<br />
<br />
If you'll be hitting the end-game in the next month or so... keep 'em.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sell em, buy something better/cheaper.<br />
<br />
<br />
Barbed Ringmail Leggings:<br />
<br />
AC 25, +7 Stamina, +3 Strength<br />
<br />
(Dropped in Velk's, easy to get if you spend any amount of time farming the castle)<br />
<br />
<br />
Peerless/Matchless Dragonhide Breeches:<br />
<br />
AC 24, +7 Stamina, +11 Dexterity<br />
<br />
(Add 2 to those stats for Matchless)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty hard to beat those two (three) without getting Velious quest legs/NToV legs, and what's better is those legs are more common atm than the Barbed Rubi are, so they're also cheaper/easier to obtain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">could you post a magelo banana? my guild has been doing kael recently so ill eventually get some thurg armor, id like to see what the stats are on the full set.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I say keep the damn legs!  HP like that is hard to top on leg items.  You got a fungi, you got a JBB, you got full Velious.  What do you need that's purchasable?  Nothing, 'cept maybe spells.  I'd wanna keep them until you need that cash for malo etc. atleast.<br />
<br />
And bigguss, HP has nothing to do with being end game.<br />
<br />
More HP = More Canni = More mana = better for group.<br />
<br />
More HP = Better soloing = Better exp = more levels. (using the tank/slow/melee method)<br />
<br />
This is in the standard game, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jebeksis Stormcaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ask the person if they want to trade some more of their nice gear for some crack.<br />
<br />
anyways, i'd keep the legs ... it's damn hard to find a nice set and those are pretty sweet. as far as HP goes, those are very hard to beat. They have more outright HP than any of the velious quest legs, and end up having more than just about anything without massive STA on it as well. (can you tell i've been on a HP kick recently? had to pry my new pants out of the hands of some slobbering monks, and I felt kinda bad about it but at least I'm set on legs basically forever :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Xican:  <br />
<br />
&quot;More HP = More Canni = More mana = better for group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nah, just means a larger mana-pool.  It's all about mana and hit point regeneration- in the normal game, I mean.  :)<br />
<br />
&quot;More HP = Better soloing = Better exp = more levels. (using the tank/slow/melee method) &quot;<br />
<br />
Same here.  If you're healing yourself (soloing) then it's all about HP/mana regeneration speed.<br />
<br />
Looking at Banana's magelo, I'd be tempted to see if I could trade the rubi leggings for an Artificer's Ringmail belt / helmet / bracer.  Of course, it looks like Banana is in a raid-guild... so he might be needing end-game equipment way before me.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">. What do you need that's purchasable? Nothing, 'cept maybe spells. <br />
<br />
Yeah, except those spells are ungodly expensive, spent 90k on torpor and malo alone last summer when demand wasn't as high...  Luckily for me, I spent all my time farming phase spiders in necropolis for their carapaces, and back then they sold for 30k each :D   Made 120 :cool: <br />
<br />
I'd say wolf caller greaves are better though.  For one, lots of wisdom and mana on them.  For someone who said hp is mana, well mana is mana and wolf caller's has 80, which is around what one canni IV would give ya :D <br />
<br />
Second of all, it comes down to AC vs HP.  Wolf callers has more ac and more agi, but barbed rubicite has more hp (15 more) and more sta.  Your choice really, but since I haven't capped past the 1k mark on AC, unbuffed, I'd give preference to AC.    <br />
<br />
If you have thurg leggings, then it's a tough call.  Both would have same ac, but you still have the 10 wisdom, 30hp, 80 mana on the thurg legs.  Actually, the thurg legs would actually end up giving you higher AC because of the +5 agi.  Personally, I'd still stick to thurg leggings because:<br />
1) Not like I can resell them<br />
2) I can sell the barbed rubicite legs :D <br />
3) High AC/wisdom/mana &gt; high ac/hp combo imo (and 3 wisdom ain't that much on leggings)<br />
<br />
What I'd do is sell the barbed rubicite legs, and save up for lodi shield.  You can use the extra ac/wis/cold/fire/magic.  Other than that, pretty nice stuff!</div></div><hr />
