Free for personal use, very easy, very simple.  My only problem with it has been it kicks me off of IM like every 45 minutes and though it autoreconnects, everyone complains that I sign on and off that often.  Also, I think it's partly responsible for my problems with chat channels in EQ.  Quite often, any channels I /join just stop responding to me, the text commands don't work, and I don't get text, have to zone or camp to get them back, and that only works sometimes.</div></div><hr />

Nah that is just VI's shoddy programming. Happens to everyone, with or without software firewalls.</div></div><hr />

/sigh seems to happen to me a LOT though.  I've started to /bug and /feedback EVERY time I lost channels though, I figure eventually they'll either pay even less attention to my /bug and /feed than they already do, or they just might actually fix it</div></div><hr />

For a good description of the basics to a firewall, check out http://grc.com/intro.htm<br />
<br />
Steve Gibson is very knowledgable, you cannot deny that fact.  His writing style needs a little to be desired, however.  Did you know your computer could be getting SNOOPED or possibly even ATTACKED right NOW?  Sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>umpaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I also use zonealarm.<br />
<br />
Just a heads up though. Since I installed it I've been having problems with EQ freezing up. I can kill it and restart fine as my PC hasn't actually crashed. Last night when this happened, since I suspected that zonealarm might be the culprit, I minimized EQ (eqw), disabled zonealarm and then maximumized EQ again. I immediately unfroze and went ld.<br />
<br />
I think that zone alarm may have an issue when you lose connection to EQ and your client tries to reconnect. I believe that this causes an EQ freeze. I know that temporary disconnects, big lag spikes, have not kicked me off before I had zonealarm as I have seen my connection go all the way past red to no connection and then bounce back.<br />
<br />
This is mostly speculation but I think I'm gonna have to start playing EQ without zonealarm up. Unless anyones got a solution for this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bilei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Zone Alarm gets my vote. Free, very easy to use and effective.</div></div><hr />

but,  ZoneAlarm gets my vote for ease of use if that's what you looking for</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yea zonealarm is great...free version does WAAAY do much for being free, but who am I to complain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Even if you have a router with a NAT firewall, ZoneAlarm is still a nice tool.   ZoneAlarm give you a notification every time an appication attempts to access the internet. .  If you have a problem with spyware installed on your box, ZoneAlarm will shut it down.</div></div><hr />
