<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fico</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just dinged 43 and now thinknig about throwing my crappy equipment out. so need an advice from elder shamans here. My magelo profile is <br />

<br />
My self buffed HP is 1200, AC is round about where it is in Profile. Usually am on C3 98 % of the time so wis doesn't matter, only thing that is scaring me at this point is my AC. will really appreciate if i can get some advice on replacing my crappy equipment with some AC gear.  Saving up for a JBB right now so budget is tight ;) . I am on Xev so if any approximate prices on the equipment will be very helpfull too. Thanks in advance. <br />
Safe hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This one is easy, look at the stuff you have with ZERO AC and replace it.  <br />
<br />
Neck - ivory collar from Chardok<br />
Face - crystal spider eyes, bone mask of the jarsath, enshrouded veil<br />
rings - pair of velium fire opal<br />
ears - electrum black sapphire earrings<br />
shoulders - tattered mantles<br />
head, legs, arms, hands - JB<br />
Shield - clay guardian sheild<br />
range - goranga idol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>fico</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks so much gloria. Is there any stuff in there i could get at my level, will be fun to get the stuff at my own, am tired a bit of XPing. so need a little break anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What Glor mentioned is basically what I wear, none of it can be obtained at level 43 except by uber HG farming for plat :)<br />
<br />
One important thing about AC, MAX DEFENSE!  I cannot stress this enough.  Solo tank mobs until you get your defense to max, do this each level.  I think I maxed my defense faster than most people (was 200 at level 42).  Defense is the single most important piece of AC equipment!<br />
<br />
BTW, thanks to this board I am now a complete AC/HP freak, wis can go to hell.  I can count the number of times I have been oom, in a group,  on one hand.  At level 49 with 950 buffed AC I can tank nearly anything around my level.  Seafuries do about 1-1.5 bubbles of damage to me, while I tank them through a whole fight.</div></div><hr />
