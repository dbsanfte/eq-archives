------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
** General **<br />
<br />
- Improved sound for many users.  Should eliminate a lot of the &quot;choppy&quot; sound issues<br />

- Reconsidered and changed Fred to willowisp.<br />
- Pets no longer pace.  Pets will now, when close to you, STOP.<br />
- Many higher level NPCs now have a random delay before they initially spawn.  This means that they will appear at a more random time interval after servers or zones are brought up.  This is designed to provide a fairer distribution of these NPCs across all time zones<br />
- If you right click to auto-inventory an item that you are looting and it will not fit into your inventory, the item will simply appear on your cursor as if you had left clicked on it<br />
<br />

- Characters below level eight will no longer see light blue cons<br />

- Pets can now be targeted by typing their full name after the /target command (or at least enough of it to distinguish it from the owner)<br />
- Knockback now works correctly when on a horse<br />
- Summoning a horse in Plane of Sky will no longer allow you to levitate<br />
- Gating when in the same zone that you are bound no longer causes problems<br />

<br />
<br />

** Quest Related **<br />
<br />

** Tales **<br />
<br />
Grand Master Glox sat silently staring into the black waters of the Cabilis aqueducts, his thoughts tracing and retracing the recent visions that had upset his nights.  The Lord Cazic was trying to tell him something, but he could not yet decipher what it was.  The hand on his shoulder startled him and he turned quickly, striking the intruder with a quick blow to the chest.  The figure crumpled to the cold ground.<br />
<br />
Glox stood over him with a look of horror, it was one of his own pupils he had struck.  He lay bloodied and bruised at Glox's feet breathing heavily with much effort, he was obviously dying.  The pupil reached up toward Glox with something in his hand.  Glox took the items from his hand and peered at them intently.  There were two items, one was a glistening serpentine scale, the other an ancient stone symbol.  Glox recognized the symbol almost immediately with horror.  It was the symbol of the Soriz, the ancient Iksar tribe that had been the slaves of the Shissar empire.  Glox looked down at his pupil again.  &quot;Where did you get this?&quot;  The dying Iksar used his last ounce of energy to point up toward the night sky and the moon of Luclin.  &quot;sSs... Ssraeshza... has... returned...&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">*blinks*<br />
<br />
Ok so they reduce the time on the ragefire pop right after they recently INCREASE the time on two majorly contested pops of the enchanter epic.? (Verina and shissar)<br />
<br />
congrats clerics.  This is exactly what i'd like to see for enchanters (and others with stupid long spawn times).  spawn times &gt; 24 hours are ridiculous.  They just arent fun!  this game is supposed to be fun right?  please tell me i'm not nuts and just going through self torture...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I will be darned.  I guess if enough people yel the same battle cry long and loud enough, you eventually get heard!</div></div><hr />

Ok so they reduce the time on the ragefire pop...<br />
<br />
Well the SolB Ragefire is back down to 24 hours (like the *original* patch message for this quest said), but you still have to kill the Skyfire Ragefire, whose spawn time appears to be 5-6 days.  So it looks like they fixed the &quot;double-bottleneck&quot; back to just one bottleneck.<br />
<br />
Not that I am bashing chanters, I think more mobs should be triggerable like Faydedar...I totally agree that camps &gt;24 hours are the suck, especially for those of us with jobs and/or families.<br />
<br />
Anyways, without getting myself all miffed at was was left *out* of the patch, I must say that I am kind of impressed with some of the changes, specifically the &quot;random delay on zone reset&quot; that Fall quoted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ohhhh i think i misunderstood.  I thought that handing in the item to the ragefire guy in solb triggered the ragefire guy in skyfire to pop.... like at that instant.<br />
<br />
so basically its still a sucky camp to get a chance at fighting a mob that the upgraded and stuck in a zone with a bunch of aggro monsters.<br />
<br />
yay VI :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">* Alan updated the Cleric Epic Quest section of the Developer's Corner with a bit of news. Without further delay here's his post:<br />
<br />
First let me say that it looks like the change for the spawn rate of the SolB version of ol' Rage didn't make it into the patch. I'm sorry that it didn't happen. We'll get him on the proper timer as soon as we can.<br />
<br />
A player wrote:<br />
<br />
Is the cleric quest at the end working as intended? When I say the end I mean the spawn in Skyfire.<br />
<br />
Once the SolB version is corrected, then I'd be willing to say that the thing is working as intended. I know that there is a desire for a more frequent spawn in Skyfire, but we just don't want the epic entering the world any faster than it does.<br />
<br />
But, as I've said, we're going to keep our eyes on this and we'll change things if needed.<br />
<br />
Alan   *<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, as of a couple of days ago, there has been 1 cleric epic in Veeshan and about 12 in all of EQ since the patch. It seems that the new dragon spawn timer is about two times the lenght of the other Karnuk dragons.  Toss in Spawn time &gt;= to avg patch time = bleh. ( I feel for the chanters also with a new spawn timer of up to 130 hrs. ) Basicly Alan has said  &quot;screw you guys&quot; as far as these items go. While this may reduce some of the disputes on these &quot;camps&quot; , it almost elimenates the chance for guilds that have finnaly reached the level to achieve these things to obtain them. <br />
<br />
<br />
But there are a couple of nice things in the patch that are years overdue. It worries me a bit that in the past after each expancion the team started working on the next one while debugging the new one. This time they are fixing old issues ( while debuging the new one ) Part of this is the new &quot;vision&quot; ie. changing of the guard, but it makes me wonder what VI has in mind a year down the road.</div></div><hr />
