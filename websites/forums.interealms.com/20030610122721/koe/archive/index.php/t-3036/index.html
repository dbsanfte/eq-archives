I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I love listening to them.<br />
Song By Charlie Daniels Band -- In America<br />
<br />
Well the eagle's been flyin' slow<br />
       And the flag's been flyin' low<br />
       And a lotta people sayin' that America's<br />
                fixin' to fall<br />
       Well speakin' just for me<br />
       And some people from Tennessee<br />
       We've got a thing or two to tell you all<br />
       This lady may have stumbled<br />
       But she aint never fell<br />
       And if terrorists don't believe that    <br />
       they can all go straight to hell<br />
       We're gonna put her feet back<br />
       On the path of righteousness and then<br />
       God bless America again<br />
<br />
       CHORUS<br />
       And you never did think<br />
       That it ever would happen again<br />
       ( In America, did you )<br />
       You never did think<br />
       That we'd ever get together again<br />
       ( We damn sure could )<br />
       Yeah, we're walkng real proud<br />
       And we're talkin' real loud again<br />
       ( In America )<br />
       You never did think<br />
       That it ever would happen again<br />
<br />
       From The Sound up in Long Island<br />
       Out to San Francisco Bay<br />
       And everthing that's in between them<br />
       Is our own<br />
       And we may have done a little bit<br />
       Of fightin' amongst ourselves<br />
       But you outside people best leave us<br />
                 alone<br />
       'Cause we'll all stick together<br />
       And you can take that to the bank<br />
       That's the cowboys and the indians<br />
       And the rebels and and the yanks<br />
       You just go and lay your hand<br />
       On a Pittsburgh Steelers' fan<br />
       And I think you're gonna finally<br />
                understand<br />
<br />
        REPEAT CHORUS TWICE</div></div><hr />
