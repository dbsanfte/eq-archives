<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyntanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I posted a while back on duo'ing with my husbands rogue.  We just recently dinged 55 and are still having a blast.  My question is on my shoulders I was going to get an upgrade to my hp adding dex and agi.  But then we started thinking of the Obulus Death Shroud for mana conservation but since I do all the tanking I though the HP may be better.  Any thoughts on this?<br />
<br />
Here is my current gear.<br />

I also plan on getting a Valorium Ring of Gallantry and the Ceramic Shield of Valor as my next upgrades.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ODSs are very nice for 60 and under.  I still wear one at 62, and will probably do so til 64 (maybe, I'm not sure, may keep wearing it then even).<br />
<br />
I took it off when I got a sharp claw ahlspiess or however it's spelled, but once affliction focuses were nerfed, I had to go out and get a new one.  Think of it this way...Spell Casting Mastery, the arch AA, costs 12 aa.  Wearing an ODS (or other mana pres III/IV) is like giving yourself SCM3 at no exp cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok, I'm not talking to you. You have some stuff thats better than mine! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bathemael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still use ODS well into the 60s.  Your slows will always be affected by ODS.  Personally i'm going to stick with my ODS until i get something godly to replace it or a MP4 item.<br />
<br />
Your gear looks really good for your level.  My one suggestion is Death Mask of the Elysians(spelling?), for the -1int/wis you will pick up 4ac and some saves.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gruel Dorfbeater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally, I chose a crystalline torque and death watcher's shroud over the tracking wolf collar and ods.  That maybe something you might want to consider too.</div></div><hr />
