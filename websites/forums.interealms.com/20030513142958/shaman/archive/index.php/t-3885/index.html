<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>b0wsar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Topics says it all, im 37 atm and wondering if theres a big diff<br />
between canni I and this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think its worth it (51 shaman).  Its not that hard to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">question really should be will u like canni 1 till u are 54...its going to hurt not being able to regain mana faster even if its not the most efficient<br />
<br />
especially if u going to be a raiding shm in your low 50's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bullwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I put this quest off a bit myself, but when all was said and done it turned out to be very worthwhile. Looking back now i wish that i had done it sooner. <br />
<br />
My advice is do the quest, or buy the spell (The final spell is not no drop) as soon as you can.<br />
<br />
The quest was really pretty easy. Its even MQable if you have a hard time with any of the pieces. The only no drop components were the bones from KC, and the ground spawn diamonds in TD are ALOT easier than doing it the long way around.<br />
<br />
You will be very happy when you can eat your health down at a much faster rate.<br />
<br />
Do you really want to keep pressing that Can1 button again and again more often than you do now? It just gets worse as you get bigger and have more HP. Can2 is a great spell for its level range.<br />
<br />
My advice is don't wait for Can3, get Can2 as soon as you can use it.  The whole Cannibalize line just keeps getting better as you get bigger!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">100% worth the hassle of doing the quest.<br />
i'd say get this as close to 39 as you can!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yet another vote for doing it.  The bigger chunk of HP/Mana makes it worth the time, I couldn't imagine sitting at lvl 53 and still pounding on Canna I<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree.  Huge improvement time-wise over Cannibalize.<br />
<br />
Doesn't quite prepare you for the fizzlefest that is Cann 3, however.<br />
<br />
I hope Cann 4 is better, tho I'm a good ways off.</div></div><hr />

Of course I don't find this thread until I'm only a few blue from 54 anyways.  I didn't think Canni 2 would be worth it, so I didn't bother.  As a lvl 53 shaman, I canni ALOT, and might have been able to save a few more lives if I had been able to canni faster.  I'm wishing I had done the quest, but now that I'm about to get Canni 3 anyways, I won't bother with Canni 2 unless I'm super bored and just go get the spell as a matter of pricipal (being able to say that you have a 100% full spell book is pretty cool, and might get you into a good guild).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Due to periods of restricted playing time (job, school) and a bit of laziness, I never did the canni2 quest and I can tell you from experience that canni1 just is NOT fast enough at levels 50+. It is a frustrating spell in cases where the sh*t has hit the fan and all you can do is hope that your groupmates can last long enough for you to canni up enough for one more heal. In most cases, you can still manage your mana in an okay fashion, but you must cannibalize constantly with canni1 in the higher levels. I've recently turned 54, so *WOOT* I use canni3 now. It is soooooo much better, although it does fizzle alot. To make a long story short, if you have the time, do the canni2 quest. Don't get to level 50 still using canni1 if you can avoid it. Your fingers (and nerves) will thank you. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I didnt get cann2 till lv51 and god did I hate myself for not getting it sooner. At 51 it cut the good old cann dance about in half to take 2 bub's of hp's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I never did the quest, its not your end game canni so doing the quest is based on how fast you plan on leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I certainly hope so!  I just recently ding'd 50 and also came to the realization that all I seemed to be doing was hitting Cann 1, so have decided to go after Cann 2.  The ground spawn in TD was simple, had hunted in CoM so all ready had the ochre clay, having trouble getting the bone chips from KC though because I do not want to hunt here.  I'm an Ogre and would like to keep my faction with VS for a few more levels at least.  So every now and then I pop my head in and just /ooc to see if any bone chips are rotting.  Yes, I'd recommend getting it ASAP and not waiting like I did.<br />

I did the Canni2  quest and all I can say: It was worth the time. Not only does it get you more mana per cast, but I used it even longer than lvl 54, because it fizzles a lot less than Canni3.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I skipped Canni2 because the quest looked like a pain and it looked inefficient (worse hp/mana ratio).  By the time I got Canni3 I was hitting Canni1 so much I'm suprised the key is still on my keyboard.  If I were doing it all over, I'd do the Canni2 quest, even though by the time frustration was *really* sinking in with Canni1, I was almost to Canni3 and I just toughed it out. <br />
<br />
Level 53 on Canni1 just outright sucked. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hail,<br />
<br />
I wish I had done it.  Had 2 out of the 4 pieces for the longest time.  Picked up the 3rd in low 50's.  Finally grabbed the last piece at 53, but never got around to finishing the quest.  I've since donated my tradeable pieces to guild shaman of fewer Winters.<br />
<br />
The first real problem I had without it was at 52-53, where I found myself hitting the Canni button over and over, virtually non-stop.  This wasn't too bad except when I'd run low on mana, when it became tiresome.  Regenning mana on raids became a major chore.  Soloing at 53 this became really noticeable, to the point of being a PITA.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for me 52-53 went fairly fast.  54 took awhile. ;)<br />
<br />
Glad that's all behind me. :D<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">got this spell yesterday, at 46. DEFINITELY worth it.<br />
<br />
the diamonds are cake, of course, have had them since 39.<br />
<br />
the greyish bone chips were also easy, walk into KC and /ooc Anyone killing skely warlord? Will buff group for loot rights on greyish bone chips. shouldn't take more than five minutes to get.<br />
<br />
TT yun shaman was hard, only because all my tracking friends were always busy =( eventually got a 52 dru friend to help me out with the tracking. Good place to go for these is all the way down the river from SoNH zone towards Sebilis. once you get to the big pond at the end of the river should be easy enough to get a yun shaman on track; and he is cake to kill with a puppy and Venom.<br />
<br />
strange ochre clay i thought would be the hardest part of all until a friend of mine found it on a vendor(!!) in halas -- the point is this one is droppable so you shouldn't have much trouble finding it either in the bazaar or on someone who is spending the time in CoM anyway for the exp.<br />
<br />
the ratio is almost exactly the same as cann 1 -- i don't notice a difference in the amount of mana i get from (almost) a full bar of unbuffed health. BUT it is MUCH faster (in terms of the number of casts you need) than cann 1 -- 1/3 faster to be exact. WAY worth it. Get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes, it's definitely worth it. Like someone else said, if you don't do it, you'll find sitting to be more efficient than standing to cast Canni 1. Just not enough mana back at that level.<br />
<br />
I levelled through the Canni 2 levels pretty quickly, and I soloed a lot... Canni 2 definitely aided that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">def worth it all around and questing for it is better than wasteing 2kpp since theirs some1 selling the spell for that much on sol ro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Slisth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm 52, almost 53 and never got canni II. I suppose I will wait until 54 now for canni III, but if I were to do it again, I would do the quest. It really sucks having to cast Canni 40 times while a Ranger heals me for extra mana on a raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well i got Canni 2 at level 39, a guilde picked up the yun shaman powder while hunting in TT and the ochre clay while hunting CoM. Only hard part is the Yun shaman powder, other 3 r easy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fleury Moistfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This quest is 100% worth doing. I imagine that using Canni 1 all the way up to lvl 54 would be extremely painful, I was noticing the slowness of it at lvl 39. I've just completed the quest this week, so before my memory fades (which is rather fast these days) I'll give some tips:-<br />
<br />
Froglok Yun Shaman - I used my druid to help me catch this guy, there were a couple of these up on the day I got this part, all in the south end of the zone.<br />
<br />
Skeleton Warlords (or Skeletal I can't remember, see my memory is terrible) - these seem to spawn in the courtyards and castle in KC, I sat there for 3 days /oocing to loot the bones. Got lucky on my 3rd day when someone pulled a warlord to zone and killed him.<br />
<br />
Army Behemoths - This part I think is the pain. These mobs are said to only spawn in certain places in the city of mist, at the temple area or Lhrancs house. The other spots are the reaver area, which is only really accessible if you are taking a group down or raiding reavers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">With Stoicism I find that I'm hitting Cann 2 NONstop, cancancancancnacnacancacnacnacnaca Stoic, cancancncacnacnacnacnacnacnaccancn Stoic,<br />
<br />
I can't imagine doing that with Can 1.... it would just take forever... cause you have to kill about 900 hps with can to max efficiency on stoic  and even then its 13 canni casts, which is like 30 secs (I'm either canning, or stoicing, so... like half my game time is spent canning) I'm hurting so bad for canni 3 I can't stand it<br />
<br />
Porgy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Helorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">At first I didn't think it was worth it but now that my mana pool is so much larger I can only imagine how it would be to still be using canni1 and see no different.<br />
<br />
Bone chips and diamond were easy, a guildie got me the clay, and I had to hang out in TT for like 20 hours to find a yun shaman, couldn't get a guild tracker to help so we just hung out and waited in the &quot;hotspots.&quot;  Finally a druid had one on track and told me his loc and there were like 4 of them, haha.  I beat them with my stick for retribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Theo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It really does make a difference. A couple of weeks ago I found that all I was doing with Theo was mashing that Canni button. Yeah I had a Canni macro setup but still I was mashing it alot, too much. It was driving me nuts! Thats exactly why I didn't start a Bard lol. Anyways I did some research and found out I needed to get some better mana regen, and found 3 ways to do that at my lvl.<br />
<br />
1. Canni 2- 39th lvl spell but hard ass quest at that lvl.<br />
2. Horse/Drogmar med while you fight. I liked that idea so much I went out and bought one.<br />
3. ER of Solstice for FT1 - pretty self explanatory. I'm working on this one now.<br />
<br />
Well the Drogmar helped a bunch, I've read that it's equivalent to FT7. I'm not sure if it's all that but it is ALOT more than I had before. Now having Canni2 makes it just that much better. To all you Shammies out there who have read (like me) that Canni2 is worthless well you just keep mashing that Canni button til lvl 54 ok? Take it from me the ratio is much better than Canni 1. And it makes playing your Shaman alot more enjoyable. Just my 2cp worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">mmmmmm, Canni II and Stoicism.. GREAT combo. Nuff said..</div></div><hr />

but then again.. i always get KEI and i'm using a Lezard mount.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Cann 2 is 100% worth it.  I do fine without c3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Each Cannibalize spell is at least as efficient as the previous one. That wasn't always the case, but it is now, since they changed it in a patch around 2 years ago.<br />
<br />
I'd add my recommendations to getting Canni 2 though, I got it at 39 - with the help of a ranger for the shaman powder, I got the Strange Ochre Clay from a guild CoM raid, and the Greyish bone chips from hanging out in KC. I think only the bone chips are nodrop, and they can even be MQd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">What is the spawn time on the crushed diamonds in TD??  There now and still no spawn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>MojoTroll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Tikcuf - the spawn time on the Diamons are ridiculous - something on the order of 6 - 8 hours I believe.<br />
<br />
I ended up sitting there for 3 - 4 hours waiting for it to respawn after a friend had gotten his a few hours before I went.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Ouch...<br />
<br />
Thanks...  Actually starting to think 250pp in bazaar for them is worth it no...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I have spent the last two levels hunting in FV.  During that time I have looted two different types of Shaman powder.  A white and black powder.  Both of them are lore.  Will either of these work in the quest?<br />
<br />
I am 99% sure that the white one is the wrong one, but what about the black one?  Nothing I have read has given a clear answer about this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">The powder you need is black but I believe that it only drops in Traks Teeth.  The powders from FV don't work.  To be sure get it identified.  If it's not &quot;Yun Shaman Powder&quot; it's the wrong stuff.<br />
<br />
I have to agree having done the quest twice.  My first Shaman waited till 51 to do the quest hmself and I was kind of forced to do it since I felt almost useless with so little mana regen.  My second shaman started the quest s soon as he could then bought the spell in the bazaar for 2500pp just to avoid Karnor's Castle (I HATE that place).  Sold the three pieces I had for 600pp in the bazaar.  I paid 1900pp for the spell and still think it was a bargain for the increased efficiency and speed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The black powder from fv is no drop (I believe) and will not work. The black powder from Traks is droppable.  I made the mistake of turning it in and losing the rest of my items. <br />
<br />
With Stoicism, cani II is well worth it imo. The faster you can drop the hp's, the quicker you can sto, rinse and repeat.</div></div><hr />
