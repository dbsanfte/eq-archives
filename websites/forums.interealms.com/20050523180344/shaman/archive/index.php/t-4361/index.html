<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abandoned Soul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I've spent every last penny on my shammy gear.  Here it is...<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=341292<br />
<br />
Would you suggest any retuning?  Are there any items that I wasted money on or could have put something else in its place?  Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Also, should I only be looking to get a horse when I hit 45 and get JBB, or will it be useful before then?<br />
<br />
Thanks greatly!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I may ask, is your shaman really level one or have you neglected to update the level correctly on Magelo?  You may find comments more forthcoming if you actually play your shaman instead of simply playing dressup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abandoned Soul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry all, I didnt play with the finer details of the Magelo system.  He is currently lvl 39.  I'm putting my 60 monk on hiatus for a while, and wanted to re-equip the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Very nice gear choices.   :)<br />
<br />
Your magelo AC isn't working- at this point the only gear changes you might need to make would be those that put you over an AC marker (for instance, if your commonly self-buffed AC is 890, it might be worth it to swap some WIS gear for AC gear to get you over 900- howling harpoon for goranga idol, Totemic helm for JB, etc..)<br />
<br />
Other than that... looking real good.<br />
<br />
I'd keep your eyes open for the JBB now.  Getting to 45 won't take you long with that gear, and they don't get sold all that often.  If I was liquidating your gear for JBB money, I'd probably start with the gloves (replace with JB), dragon bracer (to be replaced with JBB), legs (replace with ry'gorr/jarsath) - each is a good money item that you won't lose that much by replacing with something cheaper.  If I had to, I'd replace everything but the fungi, REIF (and maybe even that), and JBB to get the horse once you get the JBB.  JBB + Horse at 45-52 = godlike.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stuff looks good, let me rephrase that, the overall numbers look good, but you'll likely look like your mother dressed you.  A couple things I'd look into though for future upgrades is a seahorse cloak for the back spot and once I got to 51, I'd consider that helm out of CT over the totemic.<br />
<br />
Just because your gear is good for your level, I would not neglect skill development while PLing.  Max it, max stuff you think you'll never use.</div></div><hr />
