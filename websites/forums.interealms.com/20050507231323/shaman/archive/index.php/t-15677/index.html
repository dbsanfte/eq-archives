<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stripperfella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a Level 38 Troll shaman on Cazic Thule server.<br />
My AC/HP are about 780/1200. I use a Jade Mace and some 12/25 spear (forget the name) My 1h blunt is maxed but piercing is very low like 20 and I havent used 2h blunt yet. ( I don't have a haste item yet)<br />
In my 20's and low 30's, it was very easy to solo melee in high keep, I was soloing the Raider room at 34 with pet.( I always keep pet buffed)<br />
Now that I'm 38 I have tried lotsa places, OT, Ry'gorrs in EW, DSP and a few others.<br />
Even when I slow and weaken the mob my pet dies real fast. I can more or less tank the mob if I add a dot or two. But each mob seems to take like 3/4 of my mana to kill. ( Wis near 200)<br />
I have some nifty items to  help like, Ikky regen BP, Fungus staff and the symbol of Innoruuk to help snare mobs. Since I have all this regen and being a troll I can do the canni dance for a long time.<br />
<br />
I have tried to root and dot the mobs while I med but root lasts like 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
I really want to solo so I can keep ALL my skills maxed, not just alteration. <br />
I have absolutly no problem in a group and can keep 6 buffs on everyone all the time including regen.<br />
Maybe once I get to 39 soloing will be a lot easier?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it's always tough soloing right before the next spell level. 39 will help a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
At that level I was using the tank IN TEH FACE method with the pet stationed behind the mob.  Make sure to five the dog 2 weapons to make him dual (it doesnt do it a lot, but every bit helps.)<br />
<br />
At lot of times I would aslo root the mob and toss a dot on it before I or my pet engaged.  Getting it down 10 or 20% really helps when soloing.  You can aslo use that time to canni mana and regen health.<br />
<br />
Other than that just stick it out till 39.  New pet and new spells will make a lot of difference for you.<br />
<br />
 But each mob seems to take like 3/4 of my mana to kill. ( Wis near 200)<br />
<br />
Just noticed this as well.  As a troll with near 200 wis you HAVE to have a ton of wis gear on. Wis gear is usually pretty poor on core stats for shaman. Try trading some of that out for items that have higher AC and HP counts than what you are currently using.  (without a magelo its hard to say for certain which pieces, but chest, legs, arms , head, face and wrists are usually the problem areas for young shaman.)  With more Ac you wont take nearly the beating and with higher HP you have a larger pool to take hits with AND make more mana with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Make a magelo and throw it up in the gear session. Some of us bored trolls (or is it board trolls) will stop over and give ya some advice on gear, it'll help out  abit I'm sure. 39 should be a huge level for ya, so maybe you'll want to group up til ya ding then go back to the solo grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>greatmilenko_00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hmm iam not sure what my ac/hps at your lvl were but, judging by your high wis you might find more ac/hps items better suiting for soloing.<br />
<br />
also try getting a clarity before you start hunting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Once you get 39 things will get easier again.  I can't remember for certain, but I think I went to echo around your level and started with the 4 spawn in the hall...they can all be single pulled and there's about an 18% ZEM in echo.  If echo is too tough, just grind out 38 in DSP on the large zels.<br />
<br />
Another option is find a tank to grp with and do the pool room in solb (and echo should definitely be doable with a tank partner).  I'm partial to warriors since I have a warrior alt, but SK's also make great partners.  (ok, pally's too, but I like the evil races for tanking  :) )<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and post your magelo and bank account if you can...there's lots of people on this board that can give good equipment advice. ;) <br />

If you'd like to send her a tell in-game (Ashras), I'll be happy to hunt with you. Just bring your 39 spells because you'll ding fast. I usually play 7-10pm CST.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">DSP is the best place. What I did was.<br />
<br />
Pull with slow, /pet attack. Stack your two posion DoTs on it and melee it to death. I would recomend using the spear...but its your choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cazic Thule, eh? Then I can safely pass this on:<br />
<br />
LoY Zones!<br />
<br />
Gunthak at 38. You can melee the mobs there, no problem (slow 'em first, of course, but that should be instinct by now). All you need is slow...maybe incapacitate if ya feel like it. No DoT's needed.<br />
<br />
Dulak at 40 (might as well start camping for Stoicism anyway).<br />
<br />
I went from 35 to 40 in Gunthak in a few days, then from 40 to 52 in Dulak (stuck at 52 with all my XP going to AA's while my dual box catches up. Otherwise, I could be 56 by now in Dulak easy...probably higher, but I would really need to have moved to Nadox by then)<br />
<br />
If you are on the Lanys server, this does not apply. The LoY zones on Lanys are barren wastelands with a few mobs that quad for 1000hp each and drop no loot.<br />
That is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm going to second DSP.  Dawnshroud Peaks is incredibly easy for the levels on the Zelniaks, Mushrooms, and Goranga Tribals (though they will add).  I've been soloing effectively there with my WARRIOR in the 30s.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's an easy commute to civilization.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hmm at that level I was soloing kodiaks in GD pretty easy to single pull and I was aggro kiting around the large rock in that area exp was very nice if i remember right ... i stayed there till 43 and did giants in RM till 45 to get my money for JBB <br />
then hit spirocs in timoroud deep till 52 ... note I soloed from 1 to 57 (with the ocasional group of course)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd have to say you're just not used to being a Shaman yet. That's all I can think of really, and I'm not trying to be mean. At 38 I was out soloing in BW, doing anything from blues to light reds. Melee on blues, aggro kite on anything tougher. Even though reds are killable, it's just not worth it in terms of downtime. The xp you'll get from a light red will not be much more then a yellow.<br />
<br />
At 39 you'll get a real attack speed slow, Togor. Tagar's is pure ****, and for some reason SOE never took a look at that spell and made the correct changes. Walking Sleep is STILL better then Tagar's at 38, and at 39 Togor's is a lot better then Tagar's. The small percentage Tagar's has over Walking Sleep does very little for the amount of mana and cast time, and it lasts exactly the same time. Don't use tagar's it simply eats up mana for no real benefit.<br />
<br />
You need to use every buff that grants you HP and AC if you want to melee. That includes keeping your berserk spell up, stacked over your STA, AGI, AC, and Tailisman buffs. As well as Regen and Quickness refreshed per uptime. Yes, Fury (or whatever you have) is worth keeping up. It lasts as long as regen, and adds AC. AC is GOD (the EQ mantra).<br />
<br />
If you need the exta 1hp/tick, use your bearform. Slam is just a fancy trick when you aren't facing casters, you won't miss that 1 point of damage. (Contrary to what some Iksar posted, bearform regen does stack on top of Troll regen. 4 for Troll, 2 for sitting, 5 for Regen, 1 for bear. 12hp/tick at your level.)<br />
<br />
I was taking, and still can take, 2-3 blues per up time. But that's because I know instinctively how my class works and the buff times. I've been playing SHM a long time, and this is my fifth SHM, second Troll SHM.<br />
<br />
At 38 my WIS was around 130ish, AC and HP FULLY buffed at 800/1350ish. My weapon skills just don't go up even though I melee a lot, so I had maybe 150ish skill.<br />
<br />
You've got better gear for the most part then I did, a much larger mana pool. So it's just lack of experience on your part.<br />
<br />
Root and rot is for dungeons, outdoors you can aggro kite. (ALWAYS turn taunt off of your dog! Taunt and shaman pets is for advanced aggro kiting and needs to be switched on the fly. You don't need to learn that for at least 11 levels yet.). Or you can just melee. Remember melee for a shaman always means using slow and a dot. Root and rot takes a lot more mana then an aggro kite. Use MalX/Decay only when you need it.<br />
<br />
(One perk to Decay is that is is a disease. Which means that it slows down natural regen. So any LONG fights it prevents the mob from healing as much as it normally would. You can test this on yourself, it does in fact slow your natural regen.)<br />
<br />
If you've got the snare necklace, then you use it when the mob turns to run, and thus prevent any adds in case the runner takes too long to drop.<br />
<br />
Always find a spot with little to no pathing. Always pull back to that spot. It only takes one fast acting (poison) DoT to get aggro away from your dog. And it's generally best to leave your dog at the spot (guard here) anyway. (Always haste your dog, it's useless without it. Always SoW your dog, otherwise if you kite, it might not be able to hit your target. STR/DEX/HP buffs are optonal, Regen it if you think it might take some beating. Other buffs do very little to nothing for your pet. It's not a pet, its a walking DoT with hit points.)<br />
<br />
There's a lot more I am sure. This is about all you need to know for your level range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gunthak Beach until 42-43.  Go to Gunthak and camp the empty flask for stoicism at 44, then do the elementals in Nadox (Buy an HP buff btw).  Yes, they will be very hard at 44, but you can do it and there is no better xp in the game for the effort than those guys.  At 44, your talking 3%+ per kill and you can single pull them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stripperfella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I can honestly say I never actualy expected all this great advice. <br />
You right about not used to playing a shaman. I never realized how hard it is to play this class. Seems I am constantly casting something, buffs, haste, heals or canni. I have a cleric, druid, wiz, necro and bard also.<br />
I just looked at 39 spells and that new slow will be awesome. Just did the canni 2 quest last night, had to wait 6 hours for the bone chips to drop.<br />
I tried magelo once, seemed like a lot of work. Now that I can alt-tab between screens it should be easier now, Ill do it tonight.<br />
<br />
BTW, I usualy play 1 AM-6 AM EST. It's tough as hell to get in a great group in those ungodly hours. At least I'm learning to speak Australian playing at that time, aye and g'day, hehe.<br />
<br />
I think when I ding I will try Gunthak, I defintely want stoism at 44.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Seems I went 38 to 39 on the West Commons corrupt guards, easy as pie camp, but the loot really sucks bad. Krenk is right on the money, I was still using Walking Sleep all the way to 39 (sat down and figured it out a long time ago and al lvl 38 it seems there was less than 5% benifit to using Tagar's). Face to face mele was the method I used against these guys and once I had the spawn split it was no problem at all (and that was in full Totemic, uber!). I would pull with slow and me and the dog would just beat on them till dead, occasionaly having to self heal during the fight. They were good for working mele skills on. 39 is a really, really good level for shaman, a huge upgrade to slow and VoS will make life a lot better for you. Good hunting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Another good spot to hunt is in Temberous Mountians.  Its off the beaten path and most people only go there to farm if even that.  Once School starts back up that area should be prim hunting grounds for you at your current level.  The Grimlings there drop Acrylia Ore and Gems that can sale for over 200pp depending how well your Bazaar market is.  Once you out grow the grimmlings around level 43-44ish the Brown/Redish Aliens drop Ore/Gems as well.  All these mobs are quite the push over and should be simple work if you tank and let the Alpha pet beat from behind.  On the casters its best to send in the pet and let it take the first hit then just open up with your nukes and Nuke it to paste.  To split them root one then run out of agro range along wall and kill it.  Once the first is dead wait till your ready for the next and step up and slow the next.  An extended Range focus item works well here.  Just beware the Wolfs and bats they see though Invis and is why people dont like this place.  Its quite the peice of cake though.  You can make some good money and exp here just takes bit work.  Btw there is a bank both in KATTA (Inny Trolls KOS here) and in the Kitty Fort in Grimmling forest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once you get 49 and HoS/IoS the buffing much easier.  One spell for stats (2 if the melee is practicing skills - agi buff), and regen.  I'm only 51, so I'm not sure if it gets even better at higher lvls yet.<br />
<br />
For me, 39 and 49 were the big boosts.  Of course, I haven't completed stoicism yet, so if you got that at 44 that might help alot.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Here are my suggestions as to what you might want to look at doing<br />
<br />
1)Get rid of those boots!  You should be able to sell those to some caster for 2 to 3K.  Get some Polished tin mail boots for a cheap (500-1K plat on my server) upgrade.  <br />
<br />
2) Lose the book and get a shield.  IH2 is nice, Ill admit.  However at this level you wont really be using the heal in a combat situation.  You heals are just too small so they will be downtime heals.  Drag the book out then.  Look at getting a shield that has some HP and AC to it... Sarnak Battle shield (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1131) comes to mind.<br />
<br />
3) replace the neck. Again, that trinket could be sold and replaced with something with more AC/HP.  Large Smoothmetal torque (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=8776) are usually cheap in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Thats just a few possible upgrades.  I see 6/65 rings on you so you already know what direction to head in.  The key now is taking it all the way.  Good luck to you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kayleigh88</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I am a Level 38 Troll shaman on Cazic Thule server.<br />
Maybe once I get to 39 soloing will be a lot easier?<br />
<br />
at level 39 you will get chloro, new pet, VoS, and new slow spell so yes, soloing will get more efficient.<br />
<br />
As for what to solo for efficiency, there are many places. Most of my twinks level in the newbie side of Echo Caverens in order to keep an eye on that Great Saphro ( drops Remove Curse spell ). I am sure you can kill the Boggie Warriors just fine at your level. Loot is okay too in EC since the merchants in the zone will buy and sell with you. DSP is also a great suggestion.  If you want more ideas in addition to what is posted in the hunting grounds section of this shm board, go check out the druid boards and find out what druids quad. Usually quad fodder is efficient hunting for shamans as well because quad mobs have lower hp on average for their level and no special resists.  Also check out  the level 35 gnome Watchman Halv in Steamfont, he should be good xp at your level. loot suxs but the good thing is that he is a fast spawn (~5min) and is one click of the book away from PoK if you want buff like clarity, temperance, etc.....<br />
<br />
As for equip, get more hp stuff. also try to get a Mana Preservation item if you find that you are using too much mana for one kill.<br />
