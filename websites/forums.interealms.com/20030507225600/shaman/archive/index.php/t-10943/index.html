<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My kitty shaman is level 25 now, soloing in Netherbian Lair.  I’m having lots of fun playing him and I was wondering what kind of clicky items I can start shopping for.  My druid has items that allow him to root and cast Drones of Doom.  Can anyone help me with a list of items my shaman can use, other than the JBB, which I have no hope to afford yet, but is on my Christmas list?  <br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bufflo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Offhand some common ones are:<br />
<br />
Black Fur Boots<br />
Silvery Mask<br />
Earring of Cleansing/Purity/Twisted Leaves<br />
All of the Jaundice Bone pieces<br />
Bracer of the Hidden<br />
Gobby Earring<br />
Some Pieces of Thurg/Kael/SS armor<br />
Bracer of Hammerfal<br />
<br />
There are a lot more, but these are among the cheaper/easier to attain.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Styks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most shaman clicky items don't take effect till your 40+.  I know the JB stuff is like that and thurg armor you will not be able to get till your 45 or so.  You have to be warmly or above to coldian for  those quests.  Personally the legs, boots, and chest are the only pieces worth getting, not sure on the bracers and helm though.  CC arms work better for me, along with leaf scale gloves.  I'm 54 now and have yet to wear any JB armor.  If your looking for good stat items i recommend Arctic wyvern wristbands and gorgot or a large smoothmetal torqe.  Metal Linked crown is good too but i think it has a level requirement.  Just look around, good place to ask whats in for shaman fashion is here.  So keep posting.  =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the suggestions.  In spite of having two level 51 characters, I’m always poor.  Or maybe that’s because I have two level 51 characters to try to keep equipped.  *grins*  Actually, I’m just terrible at making money.  Half the gear on my two mains needs to be replaced.  My druid, for example, is still wearing gnome skin gloves.  And now I’m having fun playing a shaman. Ack!  Most of the armor on my shaman is banded and he has other items like +2 wisdom rings on.  After reading posts on different threads here its rather embarrassing.<br />
<br />
However, I’m having fun in spite of any equipment shortcomings. So it’s not so bad. But some day I’ll have a bit of money to buy a few things. I was thinking that some clicky items would be fun to use.  And they would help save manna as well. I hope to start a list so that I can keep an eye out when I pass through the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Search is your friend.  Here's a post I made a month ago in this same forum:<br />
<br />

<br />
Contains loads of good stuff I and others have found useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thank you very much for the link.  There are lot more items than I expected.  There are a couple I wish I had right now, assuming they would work for me at my level.  The Tae Ew Ritualists Mask, for example, would be great to have. I was thinking of hunting at the Lake of Ill Omen, but I really don’t want to make that run past the spiders without invisibility.  And unfortunately we don’t get that spell until level 29.  I didn’t realize until I found my current hunting grounds that many herb vendors sold invisibility potions.  Still, the mask would be fun.  <br />
<br />
I’m pushing hard right now to reach 34th level and get my first pet, just eight more levels to go.  At that point I’ll take a look at my gear and try to get some money for upgrades.  Hopefully I’ll be able to get a fun toy or two as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">THere is also Fang Amulet of calling (summons our weakest pet, but instant cast, so can be nice for emergencies... so far only ever used once... but that once paid off) and Earring of Frozen Skull )Divine Aura).<br />
<br />
   I love to collect clickies, so if you hceck the last couple bags in my Magelo you will see a couple clickies, normally get new ones on a regular basis, tossed a lot into the bank lately since i was becoming unable to even loot :(<br />
<br />
   Oh yeah, also a VERY nice tool is the Necrotic Divining Device.</div></div><hr />
