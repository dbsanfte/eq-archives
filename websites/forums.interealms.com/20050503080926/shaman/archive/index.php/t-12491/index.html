<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know why these names sound so familiar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dulak was the name of the city in Shrek<br />
it is also a bastardization of Du Lac..lancelot's surname<br />
<br />
Flotsam is just a common word</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Flotsam and Jetsam were the names of the two eel looking things in the little mermaid.....also they are words that refer to garbage from sunken ships.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Flotsam and Jetsam was also the name of a band in the late 80's early 90's...Jason Newstead, formerly of Metallica was in it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In game, there was a zone (I think Dagnor's, which you might be confusing with Dulak) which had a mob named Flotsam (there might have been a Jetsam too, my memory blows).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think Flotsam is also a city name in the Dragonlance books. Or maybe Edding's books, which I forget the series name to, starts with Pawn of Prophecy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In maritime law, flotsam applies to wreckage or cargo left floating on the sea after a shipwreck. Jetsam applies to cargo or equipment thrown overboard from a ship in distress and either sunk or washed ashore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sony has a long history of skating by narrowly around copyright laws.  And viciously protecting their own copyrights of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Argh, you are long past the camp.  Please have sympathy on those of us that still aspire.<br />
<br />
In none of EQ have I encountered quite such an abnoxious camp as the Drunken Pirates.    And I am so very glad I will never ever see them again.  Except to kill them.  Which I will.   Horribly.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Drunken Pirate is bad?!?<br />
<br />
Obviously you've never done any of the Iksar Cudgel quests.<br />
<br />
After completing those quests my RL friends commented that I'm a much more patient person lately.  I think i broke my impatience bone or something..</div></div><hr />
