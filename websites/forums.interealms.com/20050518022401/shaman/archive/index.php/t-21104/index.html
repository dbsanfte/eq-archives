pretty good post over at the beastlord forums about defence, found this quote amusing<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;As it is, a 3% increase in avoidance for a 100 AGI increase is a joke anyway, SOE might as well remove the stat completely and reduce the CPU load of having to calculate its effect. &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
/bump, that was an excellent (albeit technical) read.<br />
<br />
Conclusions:  CA&gt;CS.  LR&gt;ID.  Agility buff = at ~3% per 100 agility, it is still pretty worthless. :p <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I get /tells for agi I will dig into my spellbook and get Feet like Cat or something.  Most never even bother to look at the stat increases, they just want to verify that they have a boot icon in their buff window.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been telling people forever that agi is a total joke and that dex and agi should have been one stat from day one. thanks for that link, its nice to see a parse of the complete uslessness of agi some where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Primary use for AGI is for skilling up defensive skills, beyond that it does add a small amount of defensive capability.

<br />
On the LR v ID argument, I think it fair to point out that the data he generated was an extreme case, where a druid was the melee. He claims that ID only works on the portion of damage over DB (this is probably true), and suggests that on real mobs the amount of damage reduction will be less % wise (he provides no evidence for this). However, these things actually have been tested by warriors, and the consensus is that LR and ID both reduce damage on normal mobs by about 5%. It is equally likely that while the mitigation might be limited by the DB, the magnitude of the mitigation is determined by the size of the hit (you still get for max btw, since the calculation likely has a test for activation included).<br />
<br />
Classes which take a lot of hits should have both of these aa skills maxed early in their career.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a similar note, our requests for STA have gone down drastically, since our guild is nearly all equipped with at least minor elemental pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only time I worry about agi is if that little ac increase it gives (1 ac per 6 agi I think) will push my warrior over a 50 point plateau.  For example, if my ac is 1346 and an agi buff will bump me over 1350, I'll ask for it because it will make a difference (albiet small, but that's the way everything in this game works.)  However, if I'm at 1360 ac I won't ask for agi because it won't bump me up to 1400.<br />
<br />
Of course, once we get going I don't ask to get agi refreshed unless we have some down time or it's my shaman bot doing the buffing  :p</div></div><hr />

I'll go ya one better.  Guild leader wont even allow us to cast agi.  Takes up a valuable buff slot ;)</div></div><hr />

Confirms the standard wisdom on agility; nice to see the numbers-and the correlation with similar data from PoN.<br />
<br />
Nice summary Frekkels :) <br />
<br />
Fortunately, most of my play involves small group/solo grinding; the mana used to cast the agility buff is worth it just to &quot;get on&quot; with the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, I'll bite, how does wrulans cause mana regen/haste/atk buffs not to land?  ;) <br />
<br />
You probably mean that it has filled up the last spell slot, but that is just sloppy spell management - something that doesnt only apply to wrulans. When I'm playing my warrior I see VoQ and that cleric spell haste in the same way  :D In any case it isnt a big deal, all of those spells are just a click away from fading anyway. These days the only shaman spell I want on in raids is soul and sometimes CHA. The rest takes up buff slots I dont have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">its not sloppy managment its a spell thats never cast on raids. imagine the havoc a shaman could cause to a buff session if we started passing out all of our group buffs. acumen/cha/crappyhaste/regen with a guild that knows their roles you dont have to worry about stupid buffs like agi popping out of nowhere. theres usually room for all you want on a raid with left over for the other class crap you dont really need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I posted this up on my guild message board to make it aware to everyone what parses in agility are showing. I don't often get asked for Agility but still do from time to time, each time I tell the person asking that it's really not worth it. <br />
<br />
However recently my guild has been getting a lot of new Shamans and I have been seeing some cast Wrulan on raids so I felt putting the parse up there would be good for showing them that it's not worth putting up and taking a valuable buff slot.<br />
<br />
Well, I got chewed out by some people and the majority not believing the parse. Saying it was a bad parse since it was a druid attacking a beastlord and that Agility is still very important for monks and warriors. I even linked a post up from the Steel Warrior where the majority of Warriors there were saying Agility isn't that useful. /shrug<br />
<br />
Anyway, some questions came up, one was what exactly are the breaking points in Agility, if any, that give melee a big boost in AC/Defense?<br />
<br />
Also, a Paladin and Warrior have offered to do some parses with me in the future when we get some time. However does any have any links to other parses? I did some quick searches and didn't find anything, mind you I haven't had too much time lately to do more searches, just hoping someone has some handy they can link up so I can post them up to my guild till we can get some parses done ourselves. :)</div></div><hr />

I still toss it out there out of habit more than anything despite that.<br />

<br />
My understanding is AC works in 50 point increments.  For example, having 1301 ac is the same as having 1349.  It's been a long time since I looked at AC parses in any detail, but I know pretty much everything I've learned about things like that has come from TSW.  (i.e.:  I'm 90% certain I have seen parses on TSW supporting the 50 point rule)<br />
<br />
Personally, I only worry about AC if it bumps me over a 50 point mark.  Of course, even then, the difference in one 50 point mark isn't enough to warrant a buff slot if you have something really useful for that slot.  (I think of agi as a trash buff to keep up if fighting something that dispells)  Also, my guild is short on some classes, so it's rare that all of my buff slots are filled with useful buffs - so adding agi as a trash buff is ok in my instance - especially since it's my bot shaman doing the casting.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Zavix, the answer is 75. Below that and you take a major hit to AC. About the only time I get asked for agility is during certain Time fights due to the aoe's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
75 AGI is it. See: How much AC does my Agility give me? (http://www.users.qwest.net/~taleisin/pages/AC%20from%20AGI.htm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thanks guys... I mis-worded my question though. I meant to say what are the breaking points in AC, if any. Abynormal seemed to understand what I was trying to say though, lol.<br />

So 50 point incremants eh? Gonna look into that, thanks again. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Coprolith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hello Shamans<br />
<br />
I'm the author of the parses linked in this thread and i would like to comment on the breakpoints in AC/agility.<br />
<br />
It's been clear for a while now that the AC number listed in the UI is actually a composite number, the sum of an avoidance AC and a mitigation AC. So if there are breakpoints in mitigation and/or avoidance at all, you would expect to find them at rounded mitigation or avoidance AC numbers, not rounded values of the listed AC. For instance, if i have a listed AC of 1099 it could very well be made up say, 578 mitigation AC and 521 avoidance AC (just pulling some numbers out of my hat, you get the idea). If i were to bump up my AC 2 points with a AGI buff, my listed AC would be 1101, my mitigation AC would still be 578 and my avoidance AC would now be 523. So there's no reason to assume i would suddenly see a jump in avoidance just because i crossed the 1100 listed AC mark.<br />
Secondly, considering that it took a parse of ~150k swings just to show with a reasonable statistical certainty that 100 AGI adds only 3%, you'd never notice such a bump during normal gameplay underneath the normal statistical variance. Same goes for mitigation; if the breakpoints exists, the actual jump is too small too notice.<br />
<br />
Personally i don't think these breakpoints exist at all and that they are a myth brought into the world by the bad statistics that have always plagued defensive parses. You need 4 datapoints to see a breakpoints, each point having a uncertainty smaller then the actual jump. Considering that these bumps can't be more then 1 or 2 % at a time, we're talking samplesizes of 200000+.<br />
But even if they do exist, they wouldnt occur at neat AC values, nor would they be noticable during normal gameplay, so for all practical purposes, AC can be considered a smooth function. <br />
<br />
I posted this up on my guild message board to make it aware to everyone what parses in agility are showing. <br />
... <br />
Well, I got chewed out by some people and the majority not believing the parse. Saying it was a bad parse since it was a druid attacking a beastlord and that Agility is still very important for monks and warriors. I even linked a post up from the Steel Warrior where the majority of Warriors there were saying Agility isn't that useful. /shrug <br />
<br />
I feel for ya. I know firsthand how zealous some people can be when it comes to the effect of agility. They'll grasp at any straw to say it ain't so and agility really is important. But parsing against a druid has absolutely zero consequences for the conclusions. Sure, the avoidance numbers themselves are much higher the you'd see during normal gameplay fighting blue con mobs, but the qualitative behaviour doesn't change. <br />
The programmers at SOE did not write separate combat codes for every possible permutation of classes fighting each other. They've got one code which takes as input the defenders defensive skills, worn AC and agi. Then the attackers offensive skills are checked against that. The actual avoidance and mitigation numbers that result will vary with class, but how change depending on agility, AAs, etc, is always the same.<br />
Everything else you see in my parses is in perfect qualitative agreement with existing parses made against NPCs, so why wouldnt the agility results be? The only real difference is my parses have better statistics then you could get parsing against NPCs, so it verifies all the hard work done before me.<br />
<br />
You are right, the warriors on SW consider CHA more important then AGI because it enhances Divine Intervention. If you dig long enough, you'll find similar sentiments on every other melee class board.<br />

Great points Coprolith.  What you say makes perfect sense and now that I've thought about it some, you're probably correct.  (thinking about it a little more, it would complicate the coding to use breakpoints instead of a smooth scale)<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to do the parses and analyze the data.</div></div><hr />

Coprolith,<br />
<br />
I finally found TSW post I remembered that listed AC improvements as occuring in stages as opposed to a straight linear progression.  What do you think of the logic and conclusions in this post (particulary near the end of the first thread where it talks about the ac impact on 'x')?<br />
<br />
TSW link (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?t=13) <br />
<br />
Note:  again, I'm not trying to debate the subject (because I haven't done the research myself to create an informed position), but I am very interested in getting opinions from people such as yourself that have done extensive research.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Coprolith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ah yes, i remember that post, great work from the wars. However from how i understand it, the theoretical model they use is based on the pure assumption that the modal damage of a mob is a step function. That's not an unreasonable assumption by itself, the programmers could be using lookup tables, where a damage distribution is selected based on the mobs ATK and the PCs AC. With lookup tables, you'd expect to see jumps in mitigation every time you cross over from one table entry to another. Unfortunately, parses don't seem to support this model since damage distributions appear to change smoothly with AC.<br />
<br />
Mind you, that doesnt rule out the fact that the program indeed uses some sort of lookup table for mitigation and/or avoidance vs AC, its just that the lookup table must be so finely spaced that you can't notice the actual bumps.<br />
