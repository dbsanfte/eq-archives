<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Merchants don't want these things and most of these are Lore and/or No Drop, so I'm assuming they are for quests.<br />
<br />
I've looked on Everlore and AllaKhazam to find out what these drops are for.  Didn't find anything. <br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.<br />
<br />
1) Behold Optic Fluid (dropped in Gorge)<br />
<br />
2) Snow Griffan Feather (EW)<br />
<br />
3) Snow Griffon Talon (EW)<br />
<br />
4) Tundra Mamouth Tail (EW)<br />
<br />
5) Snow Bunny Pelt (EW)<br />
<br />
6) Rygorr Scalp (EW)<br />
<br />
7) Tundra Kodiak Paw (EW)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have vague memories of the Optic fluid being part of an SK quest (out of Paineel? don't remember, been too long).<br />
<br />
The various body parts from EW don't have any know use currently, although there are a couple of avenues to try - since they set it up recently that npc's will return items that are not needed for a quest they have, you can try giving them to various local npc's.  There are two npc's in Thurgadin (well, one in Thurg, one in Icewell Keep) who talk about hunting in the area.  One of them is upstairs at the inn just past the second bridge as you enter Thurg.  The other is the Royal Huntsman (or some such, forget the actual title) who talks about the Dain's hunting trophies.  Might see if either of them will actually accept one of these items - if so, then there is a previously undiscovered quest there.</div></div><hr />
