I am moderately equipped, rogue is decently twinked, and the monk has fungi/SoS/adamite Bo stick.<br />
<br />
Are we going to be reasonably safe clearing up and down in Nurga?<br />
Are there any notable drops here and where do they drop?<br />
Is there anything besides the salts/skins I should save to sell in the baz?<br />
How many hours of clearing at this level will it take to be ally Chardok?<br />

Equipment question:<br />
Which item do I save for first, 2nd, and 3rd?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nurga can be assessed directly from Frontier Mountains zone, so I'm not sure I understand the question.<br />
<br />
No idea whether you can clear it, or parts of it.  Probably, but it depends.  Let the content be your guide.<br />
<br />
Nurga is a good choice in my opinion because of its design.  Wide hallways for root parking, no roamers and empty rooms scattered about for safe medding/afking.  <br />
<br />
There's no loot at all essentially in Nurga.  Droga has some, but is more difficult.  <br />
<br />
Why do you want to be ally with Chardok?  That's a great zone to hunt in later on.  Fun, cool and useful for epics.  If you are all planning already to quest for spirit wracked cords, I think that's a bit optimistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&gt;Are we going to be reasonably safe clearing up and down in Nurga?<br />
Unless Nurga has changed, you'll have most solo or double pulls.<br />
If you get 39, you'll have togor's, and you will probably be able to handle the pulls nicely.<br />
<br />
&gt;Are there any notable drops here and where do they drop?<br />
I don't know of any special drops in Nurga.<br />
There may be a few random drops here and there.<br />
<br />
&gt;Is there anything besides the salts/skins I should save to sell in the baz?<br />
I don't think so.<br />
<br />
&gt;How many hours of clearing at this level will it take to be ally Chardok?<br />
I spent a week killing stuff in Droga as a 60 shaman, and I never broke the Ready to Attack mark, climbing up from max kos.<br />
<br />
&gt;Equipment question:<br />
&gt;Which item do I save for first, 2nd, and 3rd?<br />
<br />
1.  JBB<br />
You can use a JBB anywhere.  At level 45 it helps immensely.  It stays very usable up to level 60 and beyond depending on your spells you have acquired.  And once you outgrow it, you can still sell it for most of the cash you payed.  Going rate on them has been about 20k for ages and ages (on Brell)<br />
2.  Horse<br />
Get this next.  It adds HUGE mana regen, assuming you hunt outdoors.  If you have a JBB, you can med while you shoot stuff with the bracer.  You can also be a better healer since you keep medding while you care constantly casting.  You don't miss a med tick doing the cannidance.  Also, you don't get sitting aggro when memming different spells.<br />
3.  Earring of the Solstice (already have robe for it)<br />
This is an ok earring.  You can get them for pretty cheap nowadays.  If you spend much more than 8-10k you are paying too much for the whole earring.<br />
<br />
don't forget:<br />
4.  Fungal tunic.<br />
Permanent 15hp regen owns.  Nuff said.</div></div><hr />

Until mobs are green to the rogue.  And you'll still be scowling.  Chardok faction takes forever to get.  On the bright side, however, chardok faction goes down very slowly as well.  It's not at all a bad idea to get ally, then just exp there until you're dubious, it takes a bit of time.  Once you're dubious, go back and ae nurga/droga for a few hours, and you'll be set.  Also handy for finding the named mobs you can farm solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have hunted nurga with a 33 warrior, 30 Beastlord, 30 Cleric, and 26 bard group.  The only time we ever got into trouble was when the warrior got bored and pulled 4 on purpose (in nurga you have to go out of your way to get more than 3).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ive soloed Nurga with my 43 SK. The only mob that ever gave me a problem was those Staleknights (?) the Harmtouching ones. Anyway, with a  monk you will get single pulls maybe a double pull , they are fairly spread out , so i think you can do it fine with or without KEI.<br />
<br />
As far as equipment ..<br />
<br />
Jbb first<br />
Horse<br />
Earring.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Turley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As far as Nurga is concerned, when I was level 39 I was able to solo Nurga easily.  I had a a fungi and always had KEI, but it was real easy.  Invis and go up the waterfall.  Run to where the sleeping ogre is. From there you have 4 pairs of mobs to pull.  Root one and kill the other however you usually do it then get the other.  If root breaks just reroot and keep them seperated.  If they start to run let them, mobs are really seperated and their fear paths dont bring them near each other.  BTW, I was able to do Nurga at 30 with a lvl 30 monk who had fungi and Bo stick so you should have no problem.  Its intimidating at first, but the best solo xp for us shammies at those levels are dungeons that no one goes to anymore.  You may screw up a few times trying to figure it out, but its definatly worth it when you do.  I remember I did Sol A, Nurga, Labor camps in TM, Jaggedpine Forest, Kaesora, Scarlet Desert, etc. at those level all solo.  When you figure it out, 3% a kill is normal and the levels fly.  At any rate, your group should do well.  Nurga has like a 14% ZEM and nice loot.  I definatly suggest it.  Dont get discoraged if you die... It gets better everytime you go back.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />

These rings are nothing to sneeze at for a class that uses hp to mana.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6903<br />
<br />
 The first ring gives 65 hp 45manna with wis/int/cha all +1. Now for a necro (who usually has a set of 6ac/65hp rings) where HP is going to save you so much more than the scraps of ac that we have been given who are hiding in the corner frantically trying to sew together something strong enough to protect our left toe, you get the same hp as 6/65 rings plus 45mana and a +1 to int/wis/cha but lose 4 ac....Ask a necro if they go for HP or AC on an item first. My necro looks at HP/manna before considering anything else. AC comes in pretty close to dead last on the priority list. 90% of a fight i am sitting medding. If I get hit while sitting, I'm going to be hit for max no matter what my ac says. So I will definetly take this ring over the 6/65 rings.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12316<br />
<br />
The second ring is 5ac 5sta 2wis/int/cha 85hp 45manna ....20 more hp, 1 less ac,45 more manna, 5 more stamina and +2wis/int/cha than the 6/65 rings...plus a 25point damage shield thats insta click and lasts 25 minutes to really piss off that mob that thought he wanted to hit me till i stood up and clicked it. This one is definetly more tank geared with the DS and the 5 sta but still very nice for a necro with that 85hp and 45manna.<br />
<br />
On my necro, I wanted (and got wooo go me) both rings. On my shammy, I want the second one only but have to do all the work of the first one anyhow. It took me 1 1/2 months(maybe farm droga 2-3 nites a week) with my necro to get from max kos to max ally (spent some hunting time in chardok before doing the quest). Once you get out of KoS, the faction flies. Especially if you help others kill warlord skargus.  <br />
While farming droga, I walked away with 2 Idol of the Thorned, so many circlet of shadows that at least 1 rotted per nite, about 20 Essence of Dol, 4 stone of Morid, like 40 Rukgrus stickers, 2 choker of Majdd, 2 Book of Rings, a few Earring of Essence, a tomb of the eternal, a shroud of nature, a couple spiked goblin rings, 4 mantle of mirth, so much ore, goblin grinning brew and salts that my blacksmithing got a nice jump in skillups and just turned in skins for faction. So in that month and a half of farming greenies for faction for the rings, I made about 10k on my trader and about 20 free skillups in smithing. I'd say time well spent, and could only have been better if I had gotten xp off the mobs. Starting early and getting the faction going while xping will make it seem alot less like faction work. So I don't think I would call it optimistic...more like being more efficent and saving greenie faction work later. And around the time you start hunting in chardok, you are able to get the rings. You already have the faction, ding 50, get the rings then go slaughter chardok. Other posts show how easy it is to keep the faction in a range where it is very easily fixable to recharge the ring.<br />
<br />
If I had known about the rings when I was in the level range to get xp in Nurga/Droga, you can bet I would have been xp hunting in those zones.</div></div><hr />
