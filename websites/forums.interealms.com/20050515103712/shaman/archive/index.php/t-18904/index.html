<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zooce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a '99 casual player Shaman, took me four years to get 65, and currently on 10 AA. There have been many times over the last four years that I've been proud of the achievements, getting the epic, getting 60 etc... <br />
<br />
One thing I never expected was to get power levelled when at the most powerful I've ever been, this Paladin - Garethe - on my server (from the top guild on Quellious) he's got 410AAs and mostly Time gear was the MT for this BoT South grp for a bunch of us lowbie 65s, and oh my god did we rock, and okay we all knew our roles and gelled, but honestly five 65s were being powerlevelled by this Paladin, I could NOT steal aggro even when I really tried, we had up to 6 mobs at one time (okay our chanter was good), but really, even if I had a resist on the slow his 10kHPs just slipped slowly down.<br />
<br />
Damn if only I could grp regularly with guys like Garethe, gimp lowbie 65s like me could actually get some AAs! <br />

I remember a time when I used to own pallis in PvP.<br />
<br />
Now when they show up, I run.</div></div><hr />
