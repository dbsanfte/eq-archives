<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering about trade skillz and how my race/class effects me with them. Since being a shaman allows me to solo and &quot;farm&quot; I guess you could say at least the higher lv stuff easier its good in that respect but what about my race.<br />
Being an ogre and doing trade skills etc. <br />
Will being that race/class combo affect me money wise, and just overall easyness of being able to go anywhere that has lots of tradeskill resources.<br />
It seems being a melee for tradeskillz would be much easier but I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Thx for any info<br />
Geist 50 shaman =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Qeynos Human druid<br />
<br />
Qeynos culture smith are the only culture that can make none diety amour, also can make lots difference dieties amour; Qeynos <br />
culture can wear by many race too include Orge<br />
<br />
druid are best for trade skill, port, track,sow are good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Geist, unless you want to be able to track or port, your fine.<br />
<br />
tradeskills now are 99% done in thurg or shadowhaven/bazaar, both places can be on good faction to anyone if you do some work. shadowhaven is far superior to thurg, but slightly laggier, and it takes a few hours to raise faction, on good zone times.<br />
<br />
if you need a hand with that, there's a good quest i know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ya a hand would be good no clapping either =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eahlfereth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A Couple notes:<br />
<br />
As far as cultural armor goes, I believe with the recent patch, pretty much all races can make some sort of non-diety specific cultural, tho diety specific usually has superior stats.<br />
<br />
Humans can make all Human Cultural armor regardless of which city they started in, Freeport or Qeynos.<br />
<br />
I personally might consider Human Enchanter or Human Druid if I wanted a Tradeskill only type.<br />
<br />
Enchanter could Enchant all the various ores and make the purified/crystallized/etc vials of mana.<br />
<br />
And Human Cultural is wearable by a larger outlay of races than most, and I believe at least Rallos Zek Heraldic is widely hailed as some of the best cultural and wearable by all races that can have Rallos Zek Worshipping Warriors.<br />
<br />
A Druid could be useful for sowing, porting, and tracking to most efficiently gather large quantities of the drop items needed, although you could also hire newbies to collect stacks of em in many cases. More and More Drops for trade skills are off pretty tough things anyway (i.e. Thought Leech Hide Armor)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From my experience, shamans are far superior at tradeskills than a human of any class. Human stats are just too low. <br />
<br />
My shaman has wisdom of about 232, and well over 200 str when buffed, and can buff his charisma better than an enchanter. Int isnt that high, but since wisdom is higher, that doesnt matter. Tradeskills basically go against your highest stat between str, int, or wis to check for skill-ups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">High Wisdom/Int and high charisma should be main concerns.<br />
<br />
Tracking and ports are a bonus but not necessary.  <br />
<br />
I think the best overall would be a high level enchanter as they have int/wis buffs along with charisma faction boosting buffs.<br />
<br />
Next choice would be shaman because of charisma buffs plus sow.<br />
<br />
Druid for tracking and porting.<br />
<br />
However if you are a troll shaman and doing smithing, good luck getting past 170ish skill when FS Plate goes trivial.  We don't have cultural armor...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Forage is extremely useful for several tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Notice how lots of the new cultural stuff needs poison making - ugh. <br />
<br />
They really should let shaman make that stuff with the alchemy skill as well. It makes no sense to me that dark race shaman would have to find a rogue to assist them in their smithing or that an Ogre couldnt find an Ogre shaman to make them the mystical substance they need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My barb shaman does quite allright at trade skills.  We have high wis, good cha and can buff all secondary stats.  At some point I would have liked to have a druid to track spawns, especially for crag spider hunting, but the pet makes up for the extra time you need to find things. You tag the mob, pet takes it down, no mana used.<br />
The one trade skill where you would really like a forager is baking past 143, cinnamon sticks are the cheapest way to go on from there.<br />
I personally made me a lvl 12 chanter to make mana vials for tailoring Wu's armor.  Keeps the cost down if you don't have to buy those vials with the customary 3 pp surcharge.  If you take it to lvl 16 you can also enchant electrum, this reduces the cost of skilling up jewelcraft.<br />
smithing 191<br />
jewelcraft 184<br />
brewing 180<br />
fletching 172<br />
pottery 160<br />
tailoring 158<br />
baking 144<br />
alchemy 101</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shaman  be quite guud in trade skill overall.<br />
<br />
If joo interested in a specific skill then race / class can make <br />
a big differance.<br />
<br />
Easy examples are...<br />
<br />
Jewler == Enchanter<br />
Tailor == Wood Elf Druid<br />
<br />
Currently the only skills that make much cash are JC and Tailor.<br />
<br />
Overall if joo want to be rich then trade skills is not a guud idea.  Do them if joo think it is fun.<br />
