<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">and get exp at 65???  If so anyone have a link to a guide or map of the area?<br />
<br />
Anyone know any good spots to 2 box in PoN?  I have been pling some of my other chars at the zone in on trees and spiders - very very boring and light blue to me so no aa exp.<br />
<br />
Anything in new expansion for 65 to get exp?  I went and bought a green monster horse thing and that is all I have seen of the latest expansion.<br />
<br />
And/or looking for suggestions for fun places to 2 box at at 65 for fun and TREASURE!!  I have been spending lots of time in SF, but everything is green except GWs and they are rare, but lots of spell drops and pl place for my &quot;others&quot; and fights with GW guarantee adrenaline, but they are starting to get light blued out too for my plees.<br />
<br />
Maybe we could have a 65 place to hunt forum?  <br />
<br />
I have been hoping they would upgrade some existing unused zones for the 65 plus crowd - seems like a no brainer but not seeing any evidence of them giving us stuff to do.  I am starting to worry about that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yes yes 60 to 65 forum - not much help at 65 - I was suggesting a 65 ONLY forum to address the problems specific to people who have reached 65 and realize there is nothing to do by yourself or 2 box.  And also I am asking some specific questions -feel free to answer any or all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoJ enforcers/punishrers will be horrible exp at 65, if any at all...  I was hunting there at 62, and getting so-so exp.  After dinging 63, I killed 21 mobs, and was still at 0%.  For the 5 or so hours it took me to ding, my warrior (already 63) was at 100% aa, and got like 35%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Groz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 65, for exp grinding i make sure i'm within the 5 level bonus.  Can't speak much about PoS, but it seems only Razorfiends + Wasteland mobs (Golems, crawlers and spiders) are 60+.  <br />
<br />
Exp grinding without the within-5-level bonus just plain sucks.<br />
<br />
At 65, you are pretty much stuck to Tier 2+ zones for good exp.  I know certain people kill the High Guardians in PoJ but I&quot;m not sure about faction hits and splitting them.  (Usually it is a cleric/chanter combo  so i'm assuming pacification or a druid with Harmony of Nature).<br />
<br />
You didn't state what flags you have.  My advice would be to PL the other character you 2-box so they can pass the trials as well (if need be) and just exp in PoS or PoV.<br />
<br />
Make sure you kill mobs which don't mitigate slow (unless the other char is also a caster).  <br />
<br />
In terms of light blue cons, once a mob turns light blue i believe you only get 1/2 of the exp.   That means you have to kill twice as many as before when they were dark blue.   The only times I kill lt blue stuff is when I'm farming stuff... like in PoJ caves for the ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After I completed the exe trail, I couldn't wait for a group to clear the way to Mauvin so I went and gave it a try solo. I have approx 2K hp and 1K ac unbuffed, no epic, worse gears u can imagine. Using horse, JBB and alpha dogdog, I cleared all the way to Mauvin, killed all Punishers and Enforcers with back respawns almost caught up to me. Barely made it but it is solo-able. If u have epic and better gears, it will be a cake walk.<br />

Ring is 10AC 20 wis and 50 hp.  all/all.  Player made with JC. Groz is wearing one if you look at my magelo.<br />
<br />
You need 2 crystalline eyes which drop from beetles and an alkaline stone which drops from wurms.  Both of these mobs are the PoJ caves.  There's been a bunch of posts about it if you want more detail.  <br />
