<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phleggma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">These words are beginning to be the bane of my existence.  Especially when they come from someone that's not a part of the Main Tank list in raids.<br />
<br />
Situation is this, I'm one of a few shaman in our guild.  Im the only shaman with MGB.  One of the other shaman is someone who is of the same mind I am, and I can trust to get the job done and get it done on time.  The other one, well when he's at a raid, I'm still the only shaman there.  As a result I end up doing most of everything since Im the most active.  However I've been getting this a lot lately and it's really getting on my nerves.<br />
<br />
I cast MGB Focus on the raid, and then will give Focus of the Souls to the MT and ST.  Invariably there's always a few people I have to give FoS to because of death, which I don't mind.  But there's a certain paladin in the guild who's a prime example of &quot;I MUST HAVE THE BEST BUFFS&quot;  It doesn't matter that he's not in the tank chain, he just HAS to have the best buffs around.  At first I just buffed it and forgot it...now Im to the point where Im ignoring him.  Only problem is, there's many in the guild that do this too.  <br />
<br />
Think it's time to lay the law of shaman down and tell them what the situation is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yep .. lay down the law and just tell them how it's gonna be<br />
<br />
if they dont' like it .. tough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I find myself in your situation alot too.  I just tell them that I'll do it when I can.  They get the point that I'm either too busy and/or low on mana to do it.  But I do get them when I'm able.  Sometimes it's a minute later, sometimes it's 30 minutes later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have that problem too all the time.<br />
<br />
Gets especially worse when you announce MGB Khura's (no Fo7 yet .. sigh), get like 1/3 of 'does not take hold' messages, and 3 Minutes later you get 10 tells for new FoS. Happened so often I just freaked out on the last raid ...<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your mana..your call.  End of discussion.  Thats how it runs on our raids.<br />
what Bugs me is the clerics with their proccy hammers wanting melee buffs.  Bugs the fire outta me because Ive did on more than one occasion when I bounce a  slow  and the cleric was too busy shoving his/her hammer where the sun dont shine to toss a heal my way.  <br />
<br />
At first I started carrying my JB armour with me so they could get mana free buffs...now I dont even do that anymore.  <br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
My mana, my call.  Dont like it?  Bitch at someone who gives a damn</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's less hassle to buff people and canni the mana back than tell them no</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree.  You'll find 15 peeps ask the first time, then 7 then 3 then 3 then 3 then 3.......     If you're top Bear, then YOU set the Shammy buff rules, and make sure the others support your decision.  You don't have the time or mana to /targ 30 seperate people on each and every raid (often 3 times during the raid) and cast FoS.<br />
<br />
When this happened to me, I explained it to each of my bear patrol members and then sent:<br />
<br />
/gu ****, I spent 9 points for MGB for a reason and unless yer on the MT team, are the monk puller or Archery 3 Ranger, it makes no diff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">In my guild we buff everyone who wants focus with focus.  None of our shaman have fo7 and can be a bit of a chore with 70+ raids.  But there is usally 4 or more shaman so not too bad.  The key for me is to spread it out.  It means that you get tells for focus often but never a flood all at once.  If you can arrive at the raid early start buffing people as they zone in.  With c3-c5 and cani5 having enough mana isnt an issue add in the bard mana song, pot9 and beasts sd and you have so much mana it becomes hard to run low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My guild made it guild policy before PoP came out that the raid lived with the best group buff. Only MT, pullers etc for single target buffs.<br />
<br />
It simply isn't worth the hastle for the caster, the added reagents for clerics and time for the entire raid.<br />
<br />
It isn't much of an issue for us anymore since we have several copies of all the group spells now and we just use those.<br />
<br />
I definitely agree tho that group buffs are the way to go compaired to single target buffs. Much more time and mana efficient especially when your using MGB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am pretty much the only active shaman in my guild. When time permitted I have in the past been freely handing out Focus of Souls instead of MGB of Focus of Spirits. Now I am regretting it. The guild has grown and we are doing bigger raids so instead of 15 people who want Souls I now have about 30-40. So i am now in the procces of saying NO to Soul and sticking to MGB of Khuras except for the MT, Second Tank and Pullers. Same goes with the sta buffs since I don't have the new group sta yet. <br />
<br />
I think I will cry when I get Focus of the Seventh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Before my old guild disbanded, Everyone got Khuras. FoSoul I saved for the Main and Secondary Tanks, Myself, and any other shamans present. If people weren't cool with that, tough :p  Explain that you have other stuff to do than spending 600 mana to give someone 112 more hit points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I used to have the same problem... We even had some sneaky bastards that would pretend to have died so that they could get the single target FoS that they knew we all had.  The problem for them was that if anyone other than a plate tank asked for single Focus, they got good ol' Focus of Spirit. <br />
<br />
For a while I'd get the inevitable reply asking why I don't just buff them with the good single target version, so I calmly explained that when we did the next MGB or even group focus on their group, it wouldn't overwrite FoSouls and I wsan't about to refresh FoS every hour on everyone, so they had to live with old focus until next MGB or group refresh. ;p<br />
<br />
Don't think your melees and even casters will try to fool you into casting single target FoS, they will!  I used to have one mage who refused to summon me focus items until I gave him the good focus... Damn mages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm one of those freak shamans that love to buff.  I don't bother with khura's focus.  I just keep up FoS/Boar/PE and buff the hell out of everyone.  I spam raid chat with &quot;Check your shaman buffs&quot; every 30 minutes.  Honestly, buffs and heals, slow/malo/malosini are all I do.    I only bother with DPS on boss mobs.  I got 50% buff haste and can5 so life is a little easier....  The only thing that peeves me is getting spamed for buff requests a minute before a pull (hence why I spam).<br />
<br />
It's got to the point where it was me and another bot shaman on the raid, and I was the only one getting buff tells even tho the bot shaman was more than willing to buff...  The bot was cracking up because the shaman he was botting has a reputation for not buffing so no one sent him tells !<br />
<br />
The only time when this is an issue is when I'm the only shaman after a wipe out.  If there are 2 responsive shamans and we're rezed in early we can get people buffed very quickly.  Fortunetley we don't wipe much! ;^)<br />
<br />
But to each his own, I don't blame anyone that get's pissed at single buffing everyone.  It's alot of button pressing, but that's what I like.  If I didn't enjoy it so much, It would drive me crazy =)  And if it drove me crazy, and I told them, &quot;this is the way it's gonna be&quot;  they have to listen.  If it's an issue, talk to the raid leader or tell them to.<br />
<br />
The only thing that pisses me off is clerics asking for Dex...  Just get pot9, and like it.    I've started just focusing clerics that ask for dex just so they'll learn =)<br />
<br />
<br />
I too will shead a tear the day I get Fo7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">focus of souls was the bane of my existance i HATED casting single target souls..... and how everyoned asked for it.  i was very adament about who got it and quite rude :p<br />
<br />
then we got a copy of fo7 and i love it love it love =))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What really rocks is when people click off Khura's and Brute and then ask you for Souls, Boar and PE so they can &quot;check out their new max HP's&quot;...<br />
<br />
GRRR!!! :)<br />
<br />
I thought people asking for PE was bad enough but now I have Ferine Avater I let slip I can keep it on 6 people or so (thanks to 1 min recast time + 8th Shawl + some SCR).<br />
<br />
Ranger_01 tells you &quot;Ferine Avatar please so I can see my new Max ATK, I managed to score a Savagery from the Beastlord&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's easy:<br />
<br />
&quot;I need Focus of Souls&quot;<br />
<br />
No you don't.<br />
<br />
&quot;I MUST HAVE THE BEST BUFFS&quot; <br />
<br />
No, you don't.  Here is why...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">First off, this guy needs to be shot for buffing a paladin. <br />
<br />
Joking aside, you cast the buffs, you make the call and if someone whines, get annul magic up and invite him into your group. Take it from there. <br />
<br />
WE are the buffbitches, WE call the shots. Issue closed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">yes, happen to me before I get Fo7; pal/sk alway complaint about they need FoSoul heh, coz I advertise tank /tell for soul please after MGB Khura's focus<br />
<br />
while bore and waiting, I don't mind single buff everyone with FoSoul, I remember I once single soul to 50's people while waiting few more coming before move, that take like 10's minutes lol<br />
<br />
now with Fo7, it not longer problem; but I see cleric have more trouble if they don't have HoV, they MGB aego but almost everyone ask for Virtue; single virtue on everyone is big big downtime</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have had similar problems in that I can be the only shaman on a raid of 60+ quite often. <br />
<br />
It's not so bad on the initial buffs as i do grp Boar on groups sequentiallly or the 'tell me for xxx when group is full', do the odd bit of Souls on main tanks and a few odd bits of filler here and there ,buff out MA / puller etc fluff here and there, then MGB Khuras on everyone. I also call warnings on when i'm doing MGB. <br />
<br />
Then if anyone dies, lose a tank to flurry etc, i'm usually right on them on rez rebuffing with Boar/souls unless it's a dispeller etc.<br />
<br />
The biggest problems are when re-buff time comes up, and another shaman has been a bit liberal with the souls.<br />
<br />
Even running a 2 mins/1min/30sec ' /rs MGB focus inc in xxx, PLEASE click off souls if you are not MA/puller type' there are still plenty of muppets who do not listen and you get the 10mins later 'waahhh focus gone' when you are strechin you massive mana regen to the limit dumping Q/Tnargs here there and everywhere ;)<br />
<br />
The very worst people are the ones when, you have just done 8 groups with boar at 550 a pop (before scm), Q self, bit a rod/c5 and smacked out MGB focus then filled in tanks with souls, insist they must have Agi/billy/acumen/dex right now plz when pulls are soon to be coming in etc and muggins here will be blowing tons of mana on malo/malosinia/turgurs/tnargs/quiescence constantly ;). <br />
<br />
Now I usually get round to filling out what I would consider 'key' classes with full buffs after I have done raid ie: monk team gets Agi souls boar, but there is always the melee who is the centre of the universe (but strangely didnt make the tank list) who needs 'the works' plz and assumes he has to say this every 10-15 secs until they miraculously fill the buff list out ;)<br />
<br />
Basically, the solution is, when you are only shaman and stretched you have to be a blunt hardnosed bastard sometimes and not take any whining/posturing ;) (and this is with SCRM/SCM2 canni5 MGB on my part). <br />
<br />
Fo7 would cure a lot of these problems for me, and luckily my alliance is moving into solidly tier3 (have HoH/BoT/CoD, and we've killed behemoth once) and seeing more runes drop, so it's at least on the tangible horizon ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gnawl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When I got Focus of Souls, my single lvl 60 focus spell was put at the end of my spell book. I give everyone FoS. Never used the lvl 60 single focus since. Dont see a problem with it at all. It might take some more time to buff all. If I was single shaman or we was 6 shamans on the raid I always used FoS. Now with F7 its even better. Dont have to use single spell anymore ;)<br />
<br />
Buff, debuff, a few dots here and there, spot heal is what we do.</div></div><hr />

If I have problem with a guild melee, i will cast that on him once.   Then let him know I can do that during the fight too.</div></div><hr />

Haha, I now have a point to doing the stoicism quest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I really don't mind buffing and before I got Fo7 I tended to be happy to do FoS requests after massing Khuras, the only restriction was that to stop it prolonging raid buff time I kept to a strict timelimit, called for buff requests, and dealt with them on a first come first serve basis, it really helped people to get there buff requests in fast rather than asking for buffs as the pull was being done.</div></div><hr />
