<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I noticed on Lucy that shamans get Infusion of Spirit at 49. However, from looking around, it seems that the only source for this spell is Ethereal Parchment turn-ins to the Beastlord guy.<br />
<br />
Is this correct?<br />
<br />
If so, why on earth give shamans a level 49 spell that you have to get via Beastlord parchments? That seems ridiculous to me.<br />
<br />
I don't want to use valuable parchments getting multiple copies of Beastlord spells in order to get a mediocre level 49 spell - it would be bad enough getting multiple copies of my shaman spells that way, let alone Beastlord spells too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's just the way it is, I'm afraid. :\  I managed to pick it up for 500pp in the bazaar, and Clerics seem to like it, so I suppose it's worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CLerics, enchies and wizzie so far ALL adore this spell.   When I first introduce them to it they wonder what on earth I am talking about, but after explaining it to them and having them watch stats while using either self buff and Fuse or FoS only they tend to ask for a new Fusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Mages surprisingly still prefer FoS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since when has SoE/Verant shown any thought anyway with the spell drops and such? Lvl 49 spell for shamans can be aquired only in PoP, when one is way past 49.. Lvl 52 Primal Essence drops in Ssra Temple, where I bet the lvl 52 shamans are greatly wanted. Seek no sense in things what Verant/SoE does, there isn't any...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think what people don't realize is:<br />
<br />
YOU HAVE NO GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO EVER SPELL/ITEM IN THE GAME AT ANY GIVEN LEVEL.<br />
<br />
I got PE and group acumen at 60, bfd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What you clearly don't realize Arisai is that it should be possible to aquire (very difficult is OK) every spell of your level at the level of the spell.<br />
<br />
It can be very difficult. That is at least understandable.<br />
Effectively impossible is neither understandable or acceptable.<br />
<br />
In the case of this particular spell, it probably would have made more sense to not make it Shaman usable in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the response everyone.<br />
<br />
I guess I'll wait a while, maybe it'll start being sold in the Bazaar more from Beastlords who get duplicates.<br />
<br />
Arisai, I have no problem with having some spells harder to get than others, but name another class that has a 49 spell as an ethereal parchment hand in?<br />
<br />
Shamans do seem to get a tough deal of it compared to other classes. Shaman spells are among the rarest and most expensive. Malo and Torpor are Kunark spells, but rarely sold in the Bazaar, and when they are, you're talking 50k or more. It's not like we can sit in the Nexus all day selling buffs to make it back, like enchanters can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kianor, in addition to watching the Bazaar I'd also suggest talking to the high level beastlords on your server.  Just do a <br />
<br />
/who all beastlord 55 65<br />
<br />
or something similar in order to get some names and see if they're willing to chat about it.  I'm sure some of them have gotten extras in the process of acquiring their other spells, and may not be willing to go to the trouble of putting it up for sale with so few beastlords around to buy.  I doubt many of them realize it's also a shaman spell, just as few shamans realize it's available to us.<br />
<br />
I was taking this route after three parchments yielded me three other beastlord spells.  Although I eventually got my Infusion from a shaman friend, the beastlords I'd talked to all seemed very helpful and willing to discuss making a deal to our mutual advantage.  One even offered to give it to me outright if she got another one out of her turn-ins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks, Verdandi. I have already asked the 61 beastlord in my guild, but I hadn't considered asking others at random.<br />
<br />
I would be willing to trade an ethereal parchment for this spell, but I don't want to do the lottery on beastlord spells on top of shaman spells - the parchments aren't common enough (at least to me) for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">IMO this spell really isnt worth getting until you get Talisman of Kragg.  IoS + Kragg is superior to the level 60 Focus, so I wouldn't worry about it until then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Crash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Correct me if I have this wrong but at lvl 60 IoS plus kragg plus sta gives more HP than FoS plus sta?  Would have thought they wouldnt allow IoS to stack with sta.  If it doesnt stack with sta I dont see how its better than FoS plus sta buff.  Also IoS plus kragg plus sta loses to HP of lvl 62 focus of soul plus sta.  Therefore I dont see myself buying IoS in bazaar for 5k as I am lvl 61 at the moment.  Please correct as needed. Thanks.<br />

Level 49 Necrospell Dead Men Floating ist much harder to get than PE or Infusion of Spirits. You can buy Infusion of Spirits for 1-2k in Bazaar and PE isnt hard to get too. I think every class has some spells thats hard to get, not only Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At level 61 I still don't have Primal Essence or Acumen of Dar`Khura. It's not that the mob would be hard to kill with a good group, it's just hard to get people all the way to Ssra when the XP over there is so much less than in PoP Tier2+ zones.<br />
<br />
Edit: correct spell name</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ive yet to see IoS in the bazaar for sale --;<br />
<br />
you guys are lucky =P itd go for a lot more than 75pp or 500pp on tallon zek.... hoping ill get mine soon enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've seen it on TZ the last few days for 3k  :(  Bit overpriced imo.</div></div><hr />

I have seen Primal on sell ONCE.</div></div><hr />

Zaral, D Men F drops in Kunark, and that is a very different situation than parchment turn ins.<br />
<br />
For D Men F, you can get a group or two and camp the mob, who always drops the spell from what I'm told (you just have to get him to spawn...) In fact, in these forums there is a post about shaman SOLOING this mob to get DmenF and trading it for torpor/malo...search around.<br />
<br />
For IoS, you have to do turn ins to the BST guy and hope you get it. You'll be using parchments you COULD be using to get shaman spells.<br />
<br />
Or you could be like me, who has all her 61-62 spells (except Replenishment...*shakes her fist at Sony*)...I'm not bragging, just saying that I don't want to roll against other ppl who need parchments for spells just so I can blow them on stupid beastlord spells in the HOPE of getting IoS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm, sorry to disappoint you..but Replenishment can be bought from the shaman vendors in PoK (at least that's where I think that it is..regardless if only through a vendor).  I'm assuming by your comment above that you have been trying to get this through the eth. parchment turnin :(</div></div><hr />

At lvl 65 you get a promotion, mate.  You are no longer an Oracle... you're a PROPHET!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">heh Vals. not being observant as always...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">6.5k for ios on ar and my bl friend thanked me 1000x as he went to get it.. (I saw it for sale and quickly msged him).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Vexz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It's been said that IoS plus Kraggs is more hp than Focus.  Given the difficulty of the spell to get, plus the fact that most tanks that would be receiving Focus might cap sta or at the very least hit 255 after which they only get half hp per sta and the fact that soon after Focus at lvl 60 comes Focus of the Soul at lvl 62, I'm not going to bother.  I'll soon be 60 (almost 59 now) and from there straight to 62.<br />
<br />
Granted Vexz is my secondary whose sole purpose in life is to lvl my paladin.  It's kind of like the paladin epic.  If you get it.. great.. get it.  If not.. move on.  It's subject to debate because there are other options (fortunately).  Just from a convenience standpoint, once I get group focus I'll never go back.  (Definitely overcast souls and boar on the tank if I hit 62 and get the spells).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">At 54 with an unbuffed STA of about 150, IOS + my STA buff takes me to the cap of 255 easily.  This obviously gives me more HP(2044) + enables me to GET IN THE FACE and tank more effectively.  Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I don't use IoS to buff melee, I use it on Casters and folks who do not want a Focus type spell because they conflict with the Casters' self buffs.<br />
<br />
I use it with VoB which I also paid 4k for when I am soloing.  Like I said, it may not be the most useful buff we have but it add flexiblity to the way we can apply buffs.<br />
