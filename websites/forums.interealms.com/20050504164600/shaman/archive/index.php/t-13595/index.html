<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eluj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alright, I've been reading the boards and trying to play as a good shammy should, and now I want some specific advice.<br />
<br />
I know that I should get some hp/ac items, but also get my wisdom up a bit. I would also like to get a horse to avoid aggro while sitting. I just saved up 1k. My question is... should I go for the horse or get some better equipment? Or will the better equipment come with levels?<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=676976)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd start with gear personally.  Start with the easy stuff:<br />
<br />
Black sapphire electrum earrings x2 (ac2 hp35 mana25 each)<br />
Velium fire wedding ring x1 or 2 (ac6 hp65 each)<br />
<br />
With only 1k your options are kind of limited but that's a good start.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cirys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just one bargain suggestion:  Acrylia Studded Masks are dirt cheap 5AC, 5 WIS, 5 CHA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get some AC/HP gear.  I got the following for around 3.5k ( I know you only have 1 k but just wanted you to see how much I got )<br />
<br />
Black Sapphire Electrum Earring x 2 ( 2 ac 35 hp 25 mana )<br />
Enshrouded Veil (7ac 2wis 2int 30hp 30mana svF10 Summoning Eff III )<br />
Metal Linked Crown( AC: 12 STR: +6  WIS: +6  HP: +30  SV MAGIC: +5 )<br />
Platinum Fire Wedding Ring x 2 (AC5 HP: +55 )<br />
Leaf Scale Gloves(AC: 14 DEX: +3  WIS: +5  AGI: +4  HP: +30 )<br />
Ceremonial Hate Amice(AC: 8 HP: +35  MANA: +35  SV FIRE: +4  SV DISEASE: +4 SV COLD: +4  SV MAGIC: +4  SV POISON: +4 )<br />
Brown Chitin Leggings(AC: 12 STR: +5  WIS: +4  HP: +25  MANA: +25  <br />
SV DISEASE: +8 )<br />
Barbed Rubicite Bracer(AC: 13 WIS: +5  INT: +5  HP: +35 )<br />
<br />
<br />
I got the metal linked crown and leaf scale gloves for like 50p each.  They are great items, but so common in the bazaar that the price is way down.<br />
<br />
I'm on Tunare so your server may be different, but there's a lot of good stuff out there that's not too expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Like Eluj - I need advice.<br />
Just about got $$ for a horse/lizzie - but should I be buying a mount or upgrading equipment. Please checkout my wardrobe and advise.<br />
As I tend to solo a lot (or small groups), I am usually involved with melee. I've got the barbarian spiritualist hammer for melee and tarnished driveshaft when it's not required I melee. I've also got the leaf scaled gloves for when it's not urgent I melee.<br />
TIA ;)</div></div><hr />
