<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grigs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have read that you can buy the items needed for the earring at around 9k depending on server. What i want to know is if 1 mana more per tick is worth it? Or would my 9k be better spend somewhere else. My gear is down below if you want to take a look.</div></div><hr />

The question you have to ask yourself, is 9k the price you would pay for an ear slot like that?<br />
<br />
I would..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For the stats you get with the earring 9k are cheap. Have a look to the earrings droping in CT (lizard bone / lizard tooth). Slightly more HPs, a little bit more sta, less / no wis, some other stats. These earrings go for 60k+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grigs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">good points. will seriously consider getting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't seriously consider it, just get one.  They rock.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But don't pay 9k or buy a package if you can avoid it.  Hunt for low prices on the components.  I did mine for  a little over 3k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">6k is the package deal right now on usually-overpriced Xev.<br />
<br />
Best cash I ever spent on gear.  You'll wear this earring till you stop playing EQ, I'll wager.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Looking at your equipment I don't see any place where you are hurting. The earring is probably you best bang for the buck.  It's the next thing on my shopping list. <br />
<br />
You may want to upgrade the rings to velium fire wedding rings and the shoulder slot is not that weak but could be improved for about 1-2 kpp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is a very nice earring and I will prob never replace it.  You can find it on a lot of high end shaman megalos.</div></div><hr />
