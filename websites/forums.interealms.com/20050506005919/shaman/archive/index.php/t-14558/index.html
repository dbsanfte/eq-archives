<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durdend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day I was in PoI (my first trip to the planes).  Was in a pretty good group at zone in (we were all lvl50-54), so none of us really wanted to venture too far in.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the lvl52 paladin was getting pretty insistant that I cast slow right off the bat.  My normal routine was to stand out from the group so I could see the mob coming around the bend and cast Malosi (being lvl53 at the time, I didn't want to go through 2-3 slow resists, so I figured malise then slow - which was working pretty well I thought).<br />
<br />
Well, this went on for about 20-30 minutes.  Until half the group decided to run to PoK for KEI, and I and didn't feel like waiting around until they all found a dealer (there wasn't anyone dealing in PoK so they went on to the Nexus).<br />
<br />
But, I tried for 20 minutes to let the paladin know that what I was doing - malosi then slow was a better solution then just spamming slow until one sticks (fyi, I never had a resist on slow after Malosi).<br />
<br />
How do you all deal with players telling you how to do your job?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Justanote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">People like that are generally not the norm. Most people let you do your job, your way, in peace. Just do what works for you.<br />
<br />
If they do feel the need tell you how to do your job, I usually tell them to log on their shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While its true that Malosi will make it easier to land a slow you have to consider that Malosi also checks against magic like your slows do. So if its hard to land a slow it will also be hard to land Malosi. So if you have few resists on Malosi its probably not worth it since slow would also have few resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bear in mind though, that slow resist is large agro, malosi resist is not so bad. Even with a paladin tanking, you can still get slow agro from a resist, and at 53 in PoP, that could well be fatal.<br />
<br />
At any rate, Durdend, that's your way of playing, and you have your reasons for it, and they're not bad ones. I wouldn't like someone else telling me how to play, and I don't tell other people how to play. Having said that, if they're doing something that looks stupid, I'll sometimes send them a tell and ask them politely about it, trying to offer advice rather than telling them how to play though.</div></div><hr />

People who offer suggestions don't bother me. If someone suggests something that makes sense, or might work better, sure, I will try it.<br />
<br />
I've played my shaman since the day the servers went live, but I learn something new or learn how to improve something almost everyday. This is either from learning it on my own, or from someone making a suggestion about something, then trying it out to see if it works.<br />
<br />
However, if someone suggests something that you know from experience is just wrong, ignore it and do what you know works.<br />
<br />
From what you describe, you were playing smart. I would have done is just ignored what the paladin was saying, and kept doing what you were doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">. . . and, I would think you debuff would help his Stuns, too.  Suggestions are one thing, demands/commands are something else entirely.<br />
<br />
I have pretty regular group members.  When venturing into new territory, I'm usually the one that will make the decision on how things will be &quot;tried&quot;.  But, I always try to &quot;ask&quot; or &quot;suggest&quot; ways to do things, not tell folks what to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have always cast debuff on incomming in pop, and if resisted, one more shot at debuff before slow. With a Warrior tanking, I can have a maloxx resisted and not get agro. I realize they have the same chance of being resisted, but if debuff is resisted, especially 2 times, the rng is on my side and usually slow lands even if both debuff attempts fail.<br />
<br />
I went all the way to 65 with no malo, and have done a lot of exp groups in bot and hoh, and have never had a problem with my approach as far as taking too long to land slow. In an emergancy, with multiple adds, I will cast slow with no debuff and if resisted or not, root the adds to the side and then finish slowing them.<br />
<br />
Got tired of trying to get malo, so now that i'm 65, I will be able to afford malos shortly. Saw it for sale last week for 18.5k on my server, usually runs about 24k these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Malosini line of spells is much faster casting, lower aggro and much less mana wasted than Burning slows on resists. There's that annoying recast refresh time on slow to take into account as well. <br />
<br />
Before I got malo if I knew I was going into a zone with resistant or high level mobs I pretty much used malosi spells on everything. Get resisted once, It's already saved you mana and aggro.<br />
<br />
If someone starts telling me how to play my class, unless they have a similar or higher level shaman to back up their experience of playing the class they can pretty much go to hell. People who think seeing a person play a class means they know how a class works are just plain stupid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">just tell them to ****, shrink them twice and then cast your lizard and go stand on top of them for awhile... ;-D<br />
<br />
no but seriously you are doing fine.  Just tell them to **** and there is no need to give them an example of what would happen if you didn't malo the incoming mob because that could hurt.<br />
<br />
Plus the pally also fails to realize that debuff also helps his stuns and all of the casters spells land as well... but he is just a moron and that is why he's playing a simple melee class.   Tell him he's a noob and should have been an sk ;-D and then put him on /ignore lol<br />
<br />
edit:   also don't forget to rip on his armor and his weapon and tell him how your lvl 34 friend has better equip and instead of complaining about your playing which isn't hurting the group (it's actually helping) he should be spending his time alt tabing between pulls to look up gear upgrades he can do because he sucks at tanking.   Then tell him his mom sucks and that your shaman dog is doing more damage than him :)  <br />
<br />
Then tell him how your cha buffs ownz him and how he is nothing without it!!!! (this part is key)  <br />
<br />
hehe!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I tend to take a different approach depending upon the type of group I'm with.  I consider it more important for everyone to be on a system that is fluid and works than to uphold to a personal preference.  If I walk into a group of people and they are all in the same guild or play together regularly, I'll ask how they would prefer me to do my duties.  <br />
<br />
Nine times out of ten, they won't care/know.  But, I get credit for asking.  Then I lay out to them how I would prefer it to work based upon the hunting grounds and those in the group.  I've actually learned a few things by listening to others who aren't Shaman but have grouped with or are guilded with players more experienced/skilled than myself.<br />
<br />
If they do request something of me that I don't necessarily agree with, I'll go with it long enough for it to flop and then suggest an alternate route.  This tends to eliminate tension and I get my way in the end anyway.<br />
<br />
That being said, I tend not to worry about Malo with PoI entrance mobs.  They may resist a bit, but not often enough to warrant the extra damage they'll be doing which costs the healer mana.  Nor does it offer enough relief to warrant the extra mana I'll be burning by Malo'ing every demmed mob.  <br />
<br />
Everything is relative to the members in your party, but if you have an SK doing a deep darkness or a Pally doing stun on the incoming, they'll build more aggro than you'll overcome with even a couple of failed slows.  If I do happen to pull a mob, I just root it and take a beating until someone else picks up the aggro.  If you have a Warrior pulling, that changes things a bit.  In one group where I was a bit higher level than the others and we had no Aggro-masters, I actually had them pull the mob directly to me.  They couldn't afford for it not to be slowed and we didn't want it ping ponging around, so I just slowed on the incoming and took a few hits.  If things get nasty, drop a Stoi on yourself.   :D <br />
<br />
With regard to jerks:  I make my way out the door if I'm getting heat for no reason or someone is just being an ass.  I'll try to find myself a replacement for about 10 minutes, but then I'm gone.  I play this game because I enjoy it.  I don't have the time or the desire to play with people who are going to be a detriment to me having a good time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1. Buff their CHA so they're much nicer to you<br />
<br />
2.  You have THE experts here telling you that your method of slowing makes perfect sense.  Who cares what a Pally with shammy_twink_03 thinks?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I dont take being told how to play well at all.  Even my guildmates get told to go F themselves when they get annoying....<br />
<br />
If someone makes a suggestion, I'll give it a try unless its something that I KNOW wont work.  If they harass me about doing something, I will tell them off, and if they continue I leave.<br />
<br />
Its a pet peeve of mine, well... more of a major psychosis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I usually warn the puller that i will slow on INC message (so if he needs to split, better not call inc, cuz i'm already on assist on him :) ) and not when the mob is at the spot at my feet hitting me.<br />
This allow me to have time to cast maloxxxx when the mob is not yet at spot and to cast slow when the mob is at spot. And if there is some adds, then i land a slow without malo to get the aggro and go root it some place else, unless there is a chanty to mezz.<br />
<br />
Now we all know that the sooner a mob is slowed, the better it is.. so next time just spam the pally with &quot;SLOW RESISTED.. SLOW RESISTED...&quot; severals times.. then land one at 10% of mob HP.. and then say.. &quot;woaaa hard one.. should have debuffed him first but you asked me to slow straight, so just did it untill it lands..&quot;<br />
<br />
with this final sentence: &quot;does the cleric need a mana break or should we pull again?&quot;<br />
<br />
you should now have the pally request for a debuff before slowing :)<br />
<br />
works even better if the pally has to use his LoH ;)<br />
<br />
but to be honest, you did exactly what i did at your level, and still do at 65: wasting 3sec casting maloxxx always worth it when the slow lands on first cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You grouped with a 52 pally? Shame on you....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Casting Malo or Malos is always worth if the mob is resistant because it always lands.<br />
<br />
Casting Maloxxxx has no better chance to land then slow and I don't think it is always the best choice.  A lot depends on how hard the mob is to slow.<br />
<br />
Before malo, I would just alternate slow and maloxxx until both landed starting with slow and the casting maloxxx during the long recast time on slow.  I expect to get pounded from time to time but this is not much of a problem and overall a quick slow is more efficient for the clerics mana even if he / she has to pay a little attention to my health bar.<br />
<br />
If the mob is very resistant it is probably a better use of mana to just pitch in healing but even this is a judgment call based on hp / attack rating of the mob.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think the Knight was a jerk because of the way he behaved but also I must agree with his assessment.  Stand next to MA and slow on incoming.  We are built to take the pounding and it is not like tier 1 trash mobs hit all that hard.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well you're first mistake was grouping with a paladin (of any level)...next time use an SK...<br />
<br />
Being your first time in the zone, you did exactly what i did my first few times there.  I was in PoI starting at 51, so things started yellow con, and rather than getting flattened by a resist, I malo-ish'd everything, after a few levels and some bravery with groups of friends, I 'tested' throwing out slow immediately.  Eventually establishing a confort level of not needing to debuff.<br />
<br />
I can kinda see why the pally wanted things slow immediatly, being 52 he'd go down pretty quick before the slow.  Hate to see what he did against the archaics (/snicker).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If a stupid Tank tells you How to play your Shaman simply say &quot;Oh okay thanks&quot;... &quot;Oh by the way I have Imbune Justice&quot;.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As someone who plays a caster as a main, Malo is a must in any situation.  Caster are basically damage dealer and the easier it is to land their spells the faster the mobs going down.<br />
<br />
Upon joining a new group, I always make sure my Spell effects are on so that I can tell if the Shammy or Mage is malo'ing the mob.  If they are not, I simply send them a tell asking them if they could do this and explain why.  Most are normally happy to do this for me.  I do feel bad at times as I know this may cause additional agro on them and may cause the healer having to cast a quick healer on them, but ultimately if mob goes down faster, healer is using less mana (well hopefully)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Reading that whole thing again, I think the worst part was even staying in the group while waiting for them to travel the server looking for KEI....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I found myself, level 53 shaman, in a PoI group the other day myself.  I got two rezes in about a dozen pulls before learning to malosi first, and slow second.  Basically I have probably below avg to average equipment for a 53rd.  My HP are about 1775 unbuffed, 950ish AC.  The PoI yard trash, while only hitting in the mid 100s, ripped me apart when they were unslowed.  <br />
<br />
I first died, and figured that it was because the group ranged from between levels 48 and 54.  Got my 90% rez, and got back into the fight.  About the fifth pull I was at about 15% life when someone got the thing off of me, and I thought I'd have to try something different.  After that I malosi'd the MOBs before slowing them.  Went pretty well, till I ran into a couple of resists, so I skipped the debuff.  Well he resisted the slow as well, and even though he was about 60% life, he beat me down before the cleric could salvage me.  So I figure given a similar situation I would let multiple melees balance their own agro till I manage to land a debuf and a slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shere Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You know, I once had the opposite in PoI. I was playing my beastlord and shaman together (both 65) helping a friend level a bit (53 enchanter). This monk botting his cleric suggests going into the factory and I agree. Sounds like a good plan as it would be much better xp for all of us.<br />
<br />
Anyway playing a Shaman and Beastlord no doubt I am quick on the slows. Beastlord pre-slows and shaman never gets agro and it's slowed before it even hits the group. This monk who is level 61 tells me, &quot;Don't slow until 80% health&quot;.<br />
<br />
I promptly ignore him and we head into the factory. I keep this up and he gets very irritated my Beastlord drawing agro and getting the mob slowed instantly and keeps telling me to wait until 80% health. I send my enchanter friend a tell and suggest that this guy is a tad annoying and he needs to be taught a lesson.<br />
<br />
He pulls a golem and I sit on my haunches drooling (as polar bears do) and wait for him to solo this unslowed golem down to 80%. At 85% after the 4th complete heal he was yelling at me to slow it. So I said not until it's 80%.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well considering you didnt say anyone had to go look for a rez i'll assume no one died. Some people panic when mobs arent slowed right away sounded like you were doing fine. Was the pallies health really hurting? I found as a pally with repost damage sometimes being bad i'll just cast my aggro spells and not even worry about swinging. Keeps teh mob on me and unslowed causes less damage til i see the yawn message. <br />
   I dont do that often just depends on the mobs and the group but sounded like the pally needed to adjust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What I'm thinking the whole deal started with...was the fact that the pally is prob used to having his shamans be able to slow stuff pretty easy.  I remember not having many problems slowing almost anything ever until I started in PoP.  Now, you will almost never see me not malo/s something before I slow it.  Slow resist is the devil and you will get beat down hard and quickly no matter how L33t you think that you are with no concern with how many hps you have.  This being said....it all depends of course on your level and of course the zone.  <br />
<br />
Really, the other day while I was trying to get that stupid gate talisman finished...in PoI, PoJ, PoD and PoN....I never once cast malo before I slowed.  This was of course at level 65, so I was not too worried about getting a slow resist.  When I went here at 60, this could very well have spelled the end of me quickly.  My suggestion is that pally just prob didn't realize that in PoP it's not as easy to slow things non-maloxxx before you try to slow.  And like you said...a slow resist will lead to a serious beatdown.  <br />
<br />
What's fun though..is after you get 65, a bit of AAs and better equipment...and go back and do some of the things that you used to think that you couldn't do.  I took myself to PoV and was duoing with my roommates 63 rogue the spiders to get the no-drop piece....and I would malo and slow on the pull....and did it while another group was sitting there just totally flaberghasted at how I was able to tank the mob just like that.  Quiesence has become my best friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dimdim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Tell the pally to taunt (constantly, throughout each fight) and tell him he has multiple stuns and he can memorise them all, tell him to LoH when someone looks like they might die (before the next pull, and then on each pull after that, include the fact it is 'really good for hitpoints'), tell him you hope he's concentrated on ac and not stats as he's a tank and.....if that doesn't work tell him if he was a warrior he wouldn't take such a beating before you got a slow off (but only if the rest fails, that might shut him up).<br />
<br />
Well really, telling a shammy his job, it's not right! I'd agree, though, a lot of people aren't used to the resist rates in PoP, couple of sessions and it becomes natural to expect a good slapping now and again. It actually reminds me that they are very nasty and hey, it gives the clerics something to do =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">A resist on slow at the biginning of the fight at your level means you will probably die.  Or get damn close.  and what if you get 2?<br />

Maloxxxing is the smart bet.  I always Malo first in the Planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I switched from playing a Shammy to a Paladin recently (Paladin is now 57). He ceases, then desists, and you can get 3 slow resists and it won't come off him. Paladin agro is pretty broken right now, he was right to say slow right away, because he knew you wouldn't strip agro. Also, a Paladin will not care if his stuns land, resist = agro anyway. Most paladins don't use stuns to mitigate damage anymore since mobs are slowed normally anyway.<br />
<br />
Oh and if a slow resist means the group will wipe, I don't understand how he is living through the malosi cast + slow cast. Malo is one thing, it's a sure thing, anything before that is a gamble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">While its true that Malosi will make it easier to land a slow you have to consider that Malosi also checks against magic like your slows do. So if its hard to land a slow it will also be hard to land Malosi. So if you have few resists on Malosi its probably not worth it since slow would also have few resists.<br />
<br />
I disagree, slow is a lot more aggro than a magic debuff like malosi. Try casing maloxxx on any mob 10 times, see how much aggro you get. Now try the same thing but with turgurs.. if you get to 10 must be a good sk holding it back =] specially if it resists...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">However, if someone suggests something that you know from experience is just wrong, ignore it and do what you know works.<br />
<br />
IMO this has never happened to me. If I was sure what I was doing is best (in your case it is) I would do 1 of 2 things. (The non confrontational) start casting heals on the mob (no effect but at least you'll be casting) and wait for the paladin to die. When he dies tell him all your slows resisted.<br />
<br />
Or start telling him how to do his job. Like can you stun? is he stunned? can you link your weapon it doesn't seem like it's holding aggro enough?<br />
<br />
Of course this is if the person bugs you enough to post on a shammy board. In my experience last I remember being told something was I was soooo  used to guild warriors that I was getting aggro off of the none guildie warrior so peeps had to run and taunt it off of me =] then my friend and guildie sent me a tell and said, &quot;When this happens to me I stand next to the warrior and he can taunt it off of you easier.&quot; I replied &quot;Hey it can't get any worse than it is now =]&quot; I took next to the warrior and wow! the mob would turn and look at me, but by swing time he would be swinging at the warrior. <br />
<br />
Anyway you can see he gave the advice in a hey we're buds and working together kind of way. And that's how advice should be given.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">That being said, I tend not to worry about Malo with PoI entrance mobs.  They may resist a bit, but not often enough to warrant the extra damage they'll be doing which costs the healer mana.  Nor does it offer enough relief to warrant the extra mana I'll be burning by Malo'ing every demmed mob.  <br />
<br />
With regard to jerks: I play this game because I enjoy it.  I don't have the time or the desire to play with people who are going to be a detriment to me having a good time.<br />
<br />
I went to poi as the only healer with necro as backup I was also the only slower with a rogue ranger monk warrior so we killed each mob in about 30s no kei, no problem. BUT I remember going there at 54 with 5 other guildies and getting our asses handed to us time after time after time after time =] I wasn't 52 a long time ago so I still remember, specially without any ToV or even Thurg gear you gonna get beat on really fast, don't loose site of that.<br />
<br />
And AMEN BROTHER to your 2nd statement!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">You have THE experts here telling you that your method of slowing makes perfect sense.  Who cares what a Pally with shammy_twink_03 thinks?<br />
<br />
<br />
Notice he said THE experts? FJ ALWAYS takes time to compliment himself =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">If the mob is very resistant it is probably a better use of mana to just pitch in healing but even this is a judgment call based on hp / attack rating of the mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is not what the topic is about, but it's a VERY good point. The difference between the BEST shaman and just good or great shaman is the ability to recognize when their forte is **** and start spamming the heals.. this is something I am still trying to get the hang of, the problem is it's a rare situation, but always a critical one so we don't get enough practice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did this once.  Did it for about 3 hours.  No Warrior.  O-M-F-G.  After about the first few pulls, I started drinking heavily and my eye was twitching noticeably.  I don't know which I cast more, slow on the mobs or Stoi on myself trying to keep mana up.    :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Deciding to malxxx or not before slowing is, IMO, situational. Genreally, I do Malxxx first, but not always (for example, farming outside Akheva Ruins, slow seems to always stick, and if I'm duoing with a melee, Malxxx seems unnecessary). <br />
<br />
However, the point is that while it might be a situational choice, there is probably nobody better qualified to make the decision than you are. Usually, if offerend unwanted advice, I say &quot;okay, thanks very much&quot; and continue to do it hte way I want to...in fact, 2 days ago, I grouped with a mage in Veksar, who, when I asked him for 2 summoned weapons for dogdog, said &quot;why? your pet can't use weapons&quot; (he was level 65), so I asked him to humor me...fortunately, he was polite enough and gave me 2 great weapons, and the 80% pet haste belt and +500hp pet mask!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">This reminds me of why I had my old bio read has it did.....<br />
<br />
250+ days played, 180 AA points spent.. I know very well what my spells and skills do. If you feel the need to tell me how to play my class. Then you have N,F,C, on how to play this game.<br />
<br />
On the rare times I would end up grouped with someone like this. I would simply say &quot; Hay Soandso read my bio&quot;. At this point most of the group useally would. They would start to laugh and say how much they liked it. Soandso would get pissed off and / or leave. Eather way who cares. Get a replacement and let the fun begine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Since you don't have Malos or Malo, then I would agree with the paladin.<br />
<br />
In PoP, prior to Malo, Malos, I would alternate casting Slow and Masosi(ni), because of longer recast of slow. The spell I would start casting first depends on tank and situation. If I can cast on the MOB well before in reaches the camp, then start with Malosi(ni), because of low aggro. If not, then it depends on the tank.<br />
<br />
If it's a warrior, then start with Malosi(ni). If it's an SK/Pallie, start with slow. The reason here is 2-fold. First, the warrior can tank un-slowed MOBs better, so it's somewhat safer to debuff first. But secondly (and probably more important), Pallies and SKs can gain hard aggro very easily and quickly, so a resisted slow is less likely to get you attention.<br />
<br />
So, IMO, the pallie was giving you good &quot;advice&quot;. Either way is not wrong. One is more efficient than the other. The problem is that the one that is more efficient is not always the same and depends on the situation.<br />
<br />
The big question is, whether the pallie was just trying to give you advice or was he telling you what to do? If it was just advice, take it. If he was telling you what to do, well, that would merit a different responce, regardless of whether he is right or not :P</div></div><hr />
