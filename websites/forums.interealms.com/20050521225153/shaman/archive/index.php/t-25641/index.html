<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cunoblin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">back in the day, some friends and I were hunting Kith, just outside Misty.<br />
<br />
It was myself, a necro at the time, my RL wife, druid, and a good friend who is a Mage...<br />
<br />
we were having a good ol time, then they annoying newb kept on bugging us,  he wanted me to turn him into a skeleton, just how I looked.. SO, I got a mod rod from the magician,  here, this will transform you into a skeleton,  now this newbie DID NOT have enough hp to survive..  we all knew this.. and he ran around a few min with his shiney new toy... then BLARP,  he falls down dead.  we get a tell right after *** happened?   oh sorry I guess it didn't work.  that happens sometimes, come and try it again.. so he does.. we killed him twice, then he realized what we did and got really pissed off.. so we got him 2 rez's and gave him 50pp and told him to bother someone else...<br />
<br />
then later in the hunt, this got even more fun. we were running low on food/water, so another newbie walked by and we bribed him to go buy us food and water, what can I say we were really lazy...  he came back and gave us the food/water n such, we sent him on more errands.  he was nice.. then the magician deciced to give him a present.. yeah you guessed it.. a mod rod.  he ran around yay a high leveler gave me a really cool item!!<br />
<br />
BLARPZAP  he died.. we laughed SOOO hard.  this time it was more funny since he was nice.. we rez'd him too ( had a cleric friend nearby )<br />
and gave him 200pp for being a good sport.. he was happy in the end.</div></div><hr />
