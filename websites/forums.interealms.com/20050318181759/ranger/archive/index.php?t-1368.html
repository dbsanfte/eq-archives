<br />
Fella and his lady are pulling up in front of her house.  When they stop, they both start talking at the same time.  Well they laugh and the girl tells the fella to go first.  He says, &quot;I'm not ready to get married&quot;.  She of course get's sort of a hurt look on her face so he asks her &quot;What were you going to say?&quot;.  She says, &quot;I won the lottery.&quot;.  KILLED ME!  I have not laughed at a commercial that hard in a long time.<br />
<br />
They show the jilted guy later talking to his buddies as they try and cheer him up.  &quot;I mean come on, after taxes it's only like 20 million&quot;.  Right at the end of the commercial, you see one of the jilted guy's buddy on the phone calling the girl.<br />
<br />
Floored me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Althalonas Cazicbane</div><div class="date">04-16-2002, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe thats pretty wierd cause there was an advert I saw a while ago over here in britain that was pretty much exactly the same, except from the other way round the guy had won the lottery and the lady dumps him before he can tell her. I have no idea what the ad was for though :(<br />
<br />
Hehe was well funny though :D</div></div><hr />

My favorite recent commercial was the one for a rental car company (I forget which one), where they give some guy a jet pack so he can get from the airport to his car faster.  Another guy is trying to shout instructions over the noise of the jet pack &quot;MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THE PRESSURE BELOW 400 PSI!&quot;<br />
<br />
The shouts &quot;WHAT?,&quot;  then shoots up into the air and gets tangled in a power line, sparks flying everywhere.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen that one in awhile, but it cracked me up every time I saw it.  :D</div></div><hr />

They even featured it on &quot;Worlds Funniest Commercials&quot;.</div></div><hr />

There is an OLD security guard lounging in the lobby of a bank. Robbers come into the bank, and proceed to stick the place up. The guard pulls some matrix style moves outta nowhere and beats the crap out of all of them, at one point I believe he flips an object into the air and then flying kicks the object into the face of one of the robbers. As he is dusting himself off, he says &quot;Ha cha cha cha cha&quot;. <br />
<br />
Flip to the guard lounging in his chair again, and obviously nodding off. A woman asks &quot;where can I find the loan office&quot; or something like that. The half asleep guard responds &quot;ha, cha cha cha cha&quot;<br />
<br />
Dunno why, but I thought that was so funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm scarred for life after seeing that.</div></div><hr />

&quot;When I bite into a York Peppermint Patty, I get the sensation of...    Well, I'm just glad I GET a sensation...&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buntar</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hah Those Midas commercials are great.  I like the one where the guy goes, &quot; We here at Midas love cars so much, it's all we can think about.&quot; Then it cuts to a scene with a Midas man in full uniform in a hot tub with a woman in a bikini on each side of him, flirting with him.  He's staring off into nowhere with a big grin on his face and a thought bubble with a car inside of it.  It cuts back to the first Midas man. &quot;Sad, isn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mwuaha.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that one was a good one too, Nitefox.  And Evil Calvin is neat, but I'm not sure it fits you. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tulouis</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL - I like the midas commercial where a spokesman holds up a large card with some great deal they are offering. He says &quot;You'd be crazy to pass up this deal&quot; Then he holds up another large card, this one with one of those shrink ink blot deals on it, and says &quot;If you see 2 sheep mowing the lawn, you're crazy&quot;. Then it just cuts to the midas logo, and that's it. I liked that one a lot.</div></div><hr />
