<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sounds like a really stupid question, but I don't think it is.  I got Torpor yesterday.  I was duoing Guardian Wurms last night with a monk friend.  We have done this before, and I used to keep him healed with Kragg's.  I always used to have Chloroblast and Kragg's memmed - one as a quick fix, and the other as a big slow heal.<br />
<br />
Anyway, last night I started using Torpor in conjunction with Chloroblast, and he died.  Basically it was because I am not yet proficient in using Torpor and healing with that added tool in my toolbox.  <br />
<br />
Which healing spells do you keep memmed in different circumstances (solo, duo, group, raid), and how do you use them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personnally, I keep chlor, Kragg's, and torpor memmed. I DON'T use torpor on an emergency heal for the tank. Since I have Kragg's I now only use torpor for myself when I cann up and to top off the tank's health in between pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Torpor is a pre-emptive heal.  It's not a very good spot heal for melees since it's a major snare and slow.<br />
<br />
Guardians hit for 530+, so torpor at 300 pts/tick heal isn't really able to keep up with that on it's own.<br />
<br />
Use torpor before the wurm ever hits you so you can have it up while you try to slow and get aggro'd -- OR if on the monk (not good since it mucks up his damage output) -- use it before he's wounded very much and let Torpor run as the wurm's hitting him to offset some of the GW's damage.<br />
<br />
Torpor isn't really a heal, it's more of a damage offset tool.  Don't use it on a severely wounded melee who's still getting pounded by a heavy hitter as it just won't keep him alive long enough to heal him.<br />
<br />
Without counting AAs:<br />
<br />
Torpor takes 30 seconds from cast to finish to heal 1200 damage.<br />
Kragg's takes 10 seconds from cast to finish to heal 1950 damage.<br />
<br />
Do the math.<br />
<br />
Use Torpor when your target is at full (or good health), and you ANTICIPATE they're about to take one helluva beating over the next 24 seconds.  Not when they're at 30 health, have already taken one helluva beating, and are still being pounded like some big GW chewtoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's totallly situational for me.  Solo, Kraggs Mending is out of the lineup.  Torpor for heal over time and Chloroblast for a  quick fix.<br />
<br />
Grouped, it depends on the other healers.  If I have a cleric or druid (or both, /drool) in the group, Chloroblast for patch heals while the cleric and druid dish the big heals.  I don't Torpor the melees during a fight.  DPS goes down the crapper if you do.<br />
<br />
If I'm the only healer, Torpor and Kragg's Mending USUALLY.  Torpor myself and other casters, KM the melees.  Depending on what other support classes are there, I might keep CBlast memmed still for a quick heal or there.  Especially if there is a chanter, you give up your Celerity spell slot for Cblast, you'll need it to keep the chanter alive.  :p  I've been in groups where I was  the only healer, keeping all three memmed, because I didn't need any haste or damage dealing spells.   I still don't Torpor melees during battle though.<br />
<br />
If I'm duo'ing with a light melee like a ranger or rogue, I prefer to tank, in which case I follow the solo idea (CB and Torpor memmed)... essentially you're just soloing and the light melee adds DPS in this case.<br />
<br />
In your case of duoing a GW with a monk with the monk tanking, I would have healed the monk with KM and healed myself with Torpor.<br />
<br />
That's just how I tend to run it... but it's all situational really depending on group composition, DPS of the mobs involved, etc...<br />
<br />
Grats on Torpor btw. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shekina Wolfhowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use torpor on the cleric while he is healing the tanks and getting some aggro.<br />
<br />
Mostly I use torpor on myself while I am canna dancing.<br />
<br />
Kraggs for the big heal and chloro for the quick fix.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's very useful guys, thank you so much.  I knew getting Torpor would change my game, but didn't realise quite how much!  I need not to think of it as a heal, I think, as Ciccero says, and just use Chloroblast and Kragg's as the healing spells.<br />
<br />
I actually find Kragg's more useful for mana regen when not fighting - Canni down to practically nothing then Kragg's.  In a fight, of course, low health aggro is a PitA, and so Torpor is more useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I cant speak for everyone.  I think I had torpor about 2 weeks before Kraggs mending came out.  But, here's how I use it.<br />
<br />
I cast it on everyone while we are recovering from a wipe out.<br />
<br />
I cast it on myself when Im busy canning health down (its a better ratio than km)<br />
<br />
I cast it on casters after they have taken damage (but are no longer aggro)<br />
<br />
I cast it on tanks who are a couple bubbles down in health, AFTER the fight, while waiting on the next pull (if they are NOT the puller)<br />
<br />
I cast it in places like Halls of Testing, to heal casters out nuking and taking ae damage (as long as the ae damage isnt also dispelling, like gorenaire or naggy will)<br />
<br />
If I'm healing melee during a fight, it's almost always using km.<br />
<br />
If a robe, like our enchanter, is aggro'd, and the mobs hit hard, I usually spam chloroblast.  I might could get away with casting torpor.  But, the times I've tried, It usually goes off with the enchanter at about 10 percent health, and she dies anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit - I can't spell<br />
<br />
edit # 2 - apparently I spell worse than even I thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">think of topar defencievly  use it to give you time to do something else. avoid using it on a mele unless it is unavoidable <br />
<br />
hit casters with it soon as ya see them get argo usaly enought to keep them full till the tank can steal argo the snare is usally enough to keep them from running like chickens with there heads cut off helping the tank get argo back.<br />
 use it freely during downtime. use it freely on yourself use it freely on casters<br />
<br />
i mem spells like this<br />
<br />
1 topar<br />
2 karg mend<br />
3 can<br />
4 slow<br />
5 used for switching out buffs cloroblast here when not buffing grouped. malo solo<br />
6 bane<br />
7 pox/dd<br />
8 gate solo malo grouped</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use Torpor and Krag's as my main heals.  I've not memmed Chloroblast since I dinged 60th.  Yes, it takes some getting used to, and as an emergency heal, it's not going to cut it.  Duoing with a light tank against heavy hitters I tend to use Torpor at 50%, but my preferance is Kragg's, if the damage is not too unpredictable.  On 4k+ tanks (most these days when buffed properly) I tend to hit with Torpor, then Krag's.  This give close to full healing if you start off at 40% health.  I'd like to keep Chloro up too, but there are just too many spells that are needed.  Maybe when I get new heal (1300 for 400 mana?) I'll figure something out with that.  In the mean time I keep this in mind: &quot;Heal early and often&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't forget creative use of torpor to correct behavioral problems:<br />
<br />
*  torpor on the ranger who can't control his aggro - takes em a while to figure out they can click it off<br />
*  torpor on the caster who gets aggro and runs in circles, making it impossible to taunt the critter off him<br />
<br />
Man, I wish I'd been able to snare my party members back around level 30-40.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hehe - LaughingWoman, those are great.  It was also suggested to me that if that quadding druid is annoying you, invite them, and if they accept Torpor them.  See how they like getting trained.....<br />
<br />
After a solid weekend's play in raids, groups, duos and solo, I think I have Torpor more or less sussed.  I have no doubt I will improve in time, but I am no longer killing people with it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dispell magic works much better on mobs being quadded around you by druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Torpor is WONDERFUL spell - I have it memmed all the time.<br />
<br />
When I duo with my warrior I Torpor him when he gets back to the fight spot with his pull in tow.  Then I let him taunt while the mob pounds on him and epic is cast - by then he as good agro and I can slow the mob without fear of mob jumping on me unslowwed from a resist or some such.  Usually after slow Torpor is still cooking on warrior and he regains full hp before torpor ends and then we proceed to kill mob and take his treasure.  After fight I use it to heal him and myself after big canni almost wipes me out (need more hp!!).  <br />
