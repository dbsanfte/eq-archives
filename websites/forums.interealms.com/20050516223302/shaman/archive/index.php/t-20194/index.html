<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently joined a guild that is strong enough to seriously work on planar progression.  We  have been rapidly keying members for ssra emp and VT as well a completing some of the lower lvl flags like the caprin cycle, TT, and HoH trials.<br />
<br />
My point is that while I'm farily well equiped for a pre-elemental and have all my pre GOD spells,  I am one of 5-8 Shaman that show up for raids.   How can i contribute?  Obviously shaman 1 and 2 handlle most of the debuffing except in cases like bertox where a few extra slowers are useful.<br />
<br />
My heals, even with IH IV and healing adept seem inadequate.  My DPS as you all know is so-so ( Bane seems somewhat useful).<br />
<br />
So are there suggestions for how I could be useful on raids?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Winterfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">1. Make a hotkey that auto-replies, sets target to the person sending the tell, casts a buff, and announces it to your class channel. Then, spam a hotkey &quot;For Boar/Focus, pst&quot; so that everyone knows who to ask for buffs. When they send your tell, hit your hotkey and relax. Your main Shamans will be very happy to be relieved.<br />
<br />
2. Run around looking for toons looting their freshly rezzed corpses and apply Focus and/or Boar as needed and report it to the class channel.<br />
<br />
3. Encourage raid targets that require significant multiple teams (Xegony north/south/mob teams, Emperor OT teams, Coirnav root and AE wave teams, etc.<br />
<br />
Just a couple of thoughts. I'm a member of a 7-person Shaman team and as the newcomer, pretty much the last guy on the list so I know where you're coming from!<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Curing and healing AE's will be a pretty big part. <br />
<br />
Having access to both Radiant Cure, preferably level 3, and RGC with a casting haste item will make you somewhat useful.<br />
<br />
Otherwise maxed spell crits and SoT is always fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yah get used to nukes, because thats the life for shamans 3+. Oh and when you crit for less then a druid nukes for without crits you'll get used to the laughs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/shrug.  If you feel inadequate then maybe you are.  Seriously, I wouldn't worry about your heals not mattering or your nukes not doing that much dmg.  Alot of other classes are in the same boat.  What do chanters do when there are no mobs to mezz?  <br />
<br />
Anyways, we don't assign jobs to specific shaman.  That way everyone can help do the debuffing.  We assist heal and nuke whenever possible.  There isn't a moment where I don't feel like I'm doing something in a raid.  I think that maybe if you think there is times where you are just sitting there bored, you guys should speed up the pulling a bit.  Normally at any one point in our raids, there are 2 - 4 mobs in camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm no longer ina  guild but when i was we usually had 4-5 level 63-65 shaman's and me as a level 60. I'd malo bosses and try to slow em just like the rest of the shaman, and help keep my groups alive. Occasionally I'd get slow in first and announce it and get kudo's from the senior shammys, was always a big thrill to beat em to the punch. If ya feel inadequate then your not trying hard enough to find a use, theres always adds to slow, people to heal and so on and so forth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can always rotate who's slowing and such.  We have anywhere from 1-6 shamans depending on the night.  Sometimes I slack off when there's a lot of us and just take a buff or two and nuke, sometimes I'm slowing mobs before anyone else has a chance to.<br />
<br />
The other option is to roll up a twink that your guild needs. (Clerics are ALWAYS needed)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm one of 12? active/semi active lvl 65 shaman in my guild.  Some days if i arrive later than others i am the &quot;last&quot; shaman, and if there are more than 4 there atm, i sometimes have little to do without discussing it.  Here's something you can/could do.<br />
<br />
Setup a channel for the shaman. <br />
<br />
Decide who will do what when as best you can.....malos/sinia/slow/MD and give everyone one of these with duplication on sinia/slow for boss mobs<br />
<br />
agree that on multiple mob pulls, it's FFA, but have them spam your shm channel so raid doesnt get pissy<br />
<br />
make sure no ones ego is so large that they mind having one mob slowed multiple times... at 65, slow is low mana cost (especially with conserv item) so it shouldn't aggravate anyone<br />
<br />
make sure all agree on boss mobs that you only get 2 - 4 depending on number of shaman dots you are allowed to cast.  With only 30 debuff slots, maloXX, slow, cripple, tash, few others, make sure each person has enough space to add their best dots<br />
<br />
practice your assist healing skills<br />
<br />
ask to alternate rolls if you haven't been slower/whatever for long time <br />
<br />
if really not much YOU can do as all things spoken for, try and help raid with setting up groups, looking up info or whatever<br />
<br />
probably more, but these good start</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/assist heal.<br />
<br />
Every raid should have a full comlpiment of assist healers imo.  For one you get to keep your brother and sister shaman alive.  Most of the assist healing that takes place is needed in the first 10 seconds of a battle when all the debuffers and clerics are battleing most against the main assist's aggro.  Your single heals can be the decideing factor in a battle for sure.  Keeping that key cleric up, or bringing a warrior out of purple uncunsciousness is a wonderful thing.<br />
<br />
For those that dont understand, /assist the enemy you are fighting, and heal the enemies target.  You'll be suprised who is being naughty and snagging aggro.</div></div><hr />

you could load all your disease dots+decay then once boss mob is all dotted up load ALL your poison dots and see how many you can land before you get summoned. my best is 10 so far and no I cant tank seru for long unless the clerics are really on the ball.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We usually have 3-5 shaman on most raids.  Normally we have a slower, maloser, and buffer.  It all depends on numbers but usually the 3rd+ shaman pick a class to FA and nuke/heal.  Granted in most situations after the 3rd shaman the raid is better off with most any class but we can still be useful.  With max nuke crit AA we can do a little damage and with max healing AA we can heal a little.  <br />
<br />
On boss type mobs I always spam cast tnargs on the MA, duck out of it if it isn't going to do much or let it go if the MA is under 30-40%.  I'm certain I've saved the tank and  possibly the raid a few times doing this.  Switching tanks when one goes down on an unslowable mob that hits for a ton is rough.  If healing is more than adequate after watching the tanks health for the first 15 seconds or so then switch to nukes.</div></div><hr />

We have 3 shamans with slow sticks and for the most part they do all teh slowing. i tend to slow once then /as the mobs and heal then go into battle shaman with my 1600 attack and Hammer of hours and beat teh crap outa mobs cuase it makes me feel special!!! In time though all teh shamans get put to use on alot of the mobs. I usually have to heal entire groups on mobs like CT and am always in a cleric group for bertox. of course time is a great place for a shaman to feel usefull. on teh other hand GOD makes me feel like the worst class in all of EQ ;p<br />
<br />
as one of the last shamans in your guild just bust out the DPS and buff.<br />
<br />
not much else to do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I wonder why no one called the MOST IMPORTANT job of the 3rd+ shaman: entertain the raid! Tell jokes on /gu. Start a comedy show on /shout! Of course you can bring the raid leader a mug of hot coffee if you can reach him in RL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We're Quarm level raiding guild with usually 3-5 shaman on a raid.  At that level you very frequently deal with multiple incoming mobs, so everyone debuffs and slows.   With mobs being able to two-round even a well equipped shaman, there is no time to sort out who slows what and when, you just debuff and hope someone is getting the mob off you fast. This also spreads the unavoidable deaths pretty evenly over the shaman. <br />
In single mob fights our shaman are usually group healers, or do damage using rains/dots.  It's amazing what kind of damage a shaman can put out once everyone has learned a fight and stops taking excess damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Everyone debuffs and slows on our raids.  First one to land wins.  Honestly, I prefer it this way.  Mobs are always slowed within seconds of making to camp or sooner.  When we know there are multiple mobs incoming, we call our targets in our shaman chat channel to avoid everyone debuf/slowing the same one, thus 2-4 mobs inc at once and all slowed within a couple seconds of hitting camp.<br />
<br />
This seems to work fairly well for us with 3-5 shaman per raid typically.  I'll never understand guilds who limit slowing to 1 or 2 shaman and tell the rest to sit back and rebuff or whatever.  Why the hell wouldn't you want 3 slows hitting the mob at once tripling your chances of landing one right away?<br />
<br />
If nothing else, you can always go into DPS mode.  Bane, Tear, and Spear do decent damage and don't have so much aggro that you get summoned to your death usually.  If you can contribute a consistent 100+ DPS to the raid, you're not worthless IMO.  Another class may put out more DPS than you, but you don't have another rogue at the raid, you have another shaman... so make the best of it is all you can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I agree that more than one shaman should be debuffing. After all, where one shaman gets resisted, another shaman might not (/hug random number generator). Mobs get debuffed fast that way. Once that's done, back-up heals where applicable or whatever damage you can contribute. Usually one or two shamans get the brunt of the buffbish tells freeing up the others to concentrate more on the fighting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You have all forgotten, you take over for shaman #1 and #2 until they get rezzed after getting smooshed from debuffing and having slows resisted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree on boss type mobs.  Everyone should be trying to slow then.  On the other hand on clearing trash to the boss I'd prefer to have one shaman slowing and calling resists if needed so someone else can slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Alot of other classes are in the same boat.  What do chanters do when there are no mobs to mezz?  <br />
<br />
<br />
What do chanters do?   Charm a mob that can hit harder and take more damage than any tank in the game, while slowing damn near as well as we can, nuking better than we can, hasting the melee way better than we can so they do more DPS,  and providing fantastic mana regen to other DPS classes such as wizzies.<br />
<br />
This is why people pick chanters for groups over shamans all the time.  But according to Sony and the other classes, we have no reason to complain.  Yeah, right!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Nuke, help heal, help slow train pulls.  Keep FA up on as many melee as you can.  Communication with the other shamans helps a lot, although sometimes it feels like more work than just doing everything yourself :).  Sadly one shaman is usually enough for raids with under 50 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">What do chanters do?   Charm a mob that can hit harder and take more damage than any tank in the game, <br />
-Except for the fact that Charm pets won't be tanking on raids due to pet aggro rules and most raids your enchanters won't be charming anyway due to mobs being flagged immune.  There are exceptions where ENC can and do Charm, but then again those raids are often raids where multiple shaman come in handy as well.<br />
<br />
while slowing damn near as well as we can, <br />
-Except that Shaman do the slowing on raids almost exclusively since you want the absolute best slow possible when fighting mobs that hit for thousands per round and triple/quad attack and worse.<br />
<br />
nuking better than we can, <br />
-Granted, ENC have a better nuke than we do, but they also have an 8 second recast on that nuke... So, if the mob is highly MR, ENC are screwed.  If they don't have both Insanity and the GoD nuke, the recast kills their DPS.  I'd be willing to bet that a SHM in DPS mode can easily match an ENC in nuke mode in most situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
hasting the melee way better than we can so they do more DPS,  and providing fantastic mana regen to other DPS classes such as wizzies.<br />
-buffing doesn't stack.  1 ENC can cover buffs for an entire raid, 2 makes it more manageable.  No different than a shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is why people pick chanters for groups over shamans all the time.  But according to Sony and the other classes, we have no reason to complain.  Yeah, right!<br />
See the subject of this thread.... RAID ROLE.  SHM and ENC stack just about the same on raids, with shaman coming out slightly ahead IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">FA ho - not glorious, but a possible +10dps per person is nifty.<br />
<br />
Our official title for the 6th shaman is &quot;bear in charge of spirit pouch and group cha&quot;.  Truly though, it's a LOT LOT LOT of assist healing.  As was mentioned above, chain-casting the ol quick heal and ducking if the MT is above 3/4ths health will every once in awhile provide you with that warm glow of having saved the tank, and possibly the raid.  Nobody will notice, but you'll feel less like you should've rolled up a frigging druid, because your nukes make people giggle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I am one of three active shaman in my guild. There is a fourth that is semi active (not everyday ^^) and the rest are on every once in a while. Basically in fire one of us Malos's and the rest sinia/slow/crip til it sticks. After debuffs its all assist healing and patching the main tank. On things like Magmaton that rampage and can not be slowed one shaman will try to stick sinia/crip and the rest will patch the rampage tank. I guess if you have 7 shaman on a raid then raids on Tantalasia Jeggedtooth (Earth) and Babnoxis the Spider Queen (Fire) would be the most ideal since we can cure the group of the DoT using Blood of Nadox. Basically when you have a lot of shaman, you get a lot of patch heals. You can assign buffs and tell forward too! I know you wanna be the guy that has to tell the other guy to focus then get blamed when he doesn't! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>CamaenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Adjust to the situation.<br />
<br />
Well my guild (Quarm-GoD) usually has 4-5 shamans a raid - and I've seldom if ever heard any complaints from anyone of shamans not stacking. We all try and debuff to reduce the mobs initial dps (akin to trying to put the brakes on a jetliner) - then after that its all about adjusting to the particulars of the encounter.<br />
<br />
Some raids are no-brainers where you can fire off debuffs then nuke to your hearts content. Other raids -Some PoP and GoD- can be trips into EQ hell where group hp's are in constant flux. A mark of a good raiding shaman is being able to tailor how he is playing the game to the situation at hand and add up his abilitys to contribute the sum of them all.<br />
<br />
Multiple adds? Assist heal and assist debuff. If adds throw in heals on TM's and debuff the adds - cure any nasty dot's when able. If you see an add run from one side of your screen to another...its a good bet that wasnt intentional and its a good target to assist heal.<br />
Hard hitting bosses? Assist heal MA after mob is debuffed - while watching group/raid hps for rampage/dot's.<br />
Low Dps on raid? Nuke as much as possible - but always keep an eye on the goal of keeping everyone alive.<br />
<br />
It's been beaten into the ground here again and again that shamans are not the best healers/nukers. But we do have the ability to do both and increase Dps via buffs, when you have alot of shamans the challenge is just finding the most effective way to utilize these abilitys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">My role in such a situation is to hit autofollow and watch tv:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Yossarian Runningwol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Elemental flagged raiding we usually have anywhere from 3-5 shamans.  When we first started we chose a job for the night...someone slowed, someone malo~ed, someone buffed Fo7, etc.<br />
<br />
The advantage is it allowed you to keep up certain spells w/o having to constantly keep re-memming buffs (especially for someone like me that lagged horribly).  It also kept every shaman busy and it didn't leave anyone feeling left out.<br />
<br />
The disadvantage was that usually got constant /tells for buffs adn who was doing what buff and in the end you realize it's just as easy to go ahead and take care of the buffs needed.<br />
<br />
Now we just FFA...we buff whomever sends us a /tell.  Incoming mobs it ain't uncommon for it to be malo~ed 3 times and slowed 3 times.  It's even a competition to get to it first.  <br />
<br />
Nice thing is we have a beastie that joins our shaman channel and when she lands her slows we don't even bother (except on boss mobs).<br />
<br />
Most of us DD...myself I've always been a healer shaman so I'm usually /assist healing.  <br />
<br />
While my mates like getting the crits and killshots...I prefer the crit heals.</div></div><hr />

Couple possible versions<br />
- duck out of casts<br />
- have a couple shaman on malos and a couple on slow - duck out as needed but with a bit of timing you can often have malos and slow hit within a second of each other, often before MOBs reach camp (not recommended on bosses).<br />
- assign locations, i.e. left/right/center to each shaman<br />
- assign MOB types to each shaman<br />
- hotkey Malos to say you are malosing before you cast. That should give another shaman just enough time to assist you and land slow right after Malos hits.<br />
- watch the battle - odds are, if a MOB runs up to a shaman he has attempted to slow it. If he did not call the slow, odds are he needs a heal now and his MOB still needs slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">thanks veeshanMurtak, this is a good start, ill try to work somthing out from this :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">depending on the raid you can have enough work for 3 to 6 shamans.<br />
<br />
we work in debuffing-teams of three, one malos, one sinia, and the third on slow (that way a mob is debuffed and slowed within 1 or 2 secs in optimal situations)<br />
<br />
when we have enough shamans and depending on the target (like a faster fr-move etc.) we do 2 separate debuffteams of 3 shamans (or 2 shamans and one mage), for faster debuffing/slowing.<br />
One team is the main team, always tags the first mob, and if questionable the leftmost mob, the other team tags the second mob or the rightmost, if they are at same height. <br />
<br />
That way we for one free mages from casting malosinia and do nuking/petdamage instead and have the mobs debuffed and slowed really fast.<br />
We normally share the buffingwork, too, without assigning anyone on buffduty or similar crap. When you see someone looting you announce his name in the shaman-channel and buff him, when you get requests and cannot comply fast, we write it in the channel and another shaman takes over the buffing, works great so far.<br />
<br />
I've been the only online shaman for many raids so its possible to do elemental raids (not gods cept FR though) with one single shaman (but he will die alot when you try to do your job good), but its possible to speed up things and keep up to 6 shamans busy :)<br />
<br />
and when debuffing is done, we first do assist-patchhealing and nuking, dots are useless due to mezzing and fast killed mobs.<br />
<br />
And if your shaman team is bored, make the wonderful VP-AFK-Checks on wizards etc. Just push a mob to the next caster of your choice you think that he is ninjaafk and wait if he moves  ;)</div></div><hr />

How to kill casters in 3 easy steps.<br />
1. Wait for a moderate to big pull. 5+ should work.<br />
2. Spot a hasted MOB that is not being killed. Flurrying and backstabbing MOBs are a bonus.<br />
3. Take aim and VP it right behind a robe wearer, preferably a sitting one.<br />
<br />
Bonus points for announcing said MOB to be malosiniad, crippled and slowed.</div></div><hr />

I can't begin to count the numbers of times (POEB, and Tier3 come to mind) where my slow bounced and I have a pissed off nasty mob in my face.  Only to have some other shaman's slow land a second later.  And then I'm able to &quot;tank&quot; the mob well enough to survive.<br />

Another big area shaman area in some fights are cures.<br />
<br />
Another big area is CC vs NonMezable Adds.  Debuffs being necessary for roots to land.<br />
<br />
Another big area is Spot Heals.  This can, and has saved raids before.<br />
<br />
Another big area is group healing.  Quiessence can be better in some cases than a Pally.<br />
<br />
Another big area is DPS.  If your tanks hold agro well enough.  Bane + Blood alone can be 100ish DPS.  Factor in Focuses, Crits you are looking at 20%ish.  Add in a some nukes for flavor ((know your agro bless SCS3)) and you can do decent dps 150ish while still being available to Spot Heal when needed.</div></div><hr />
