<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hate the hole... Everytime I have ever been down there on a raid, nothing has been acomplished. <br />
<br />
Now it's my turn, I went down there last week with 2 groups of 50+ mainly 55+ with my buddy Braxton who helped lead it for me. W/o him I probably wouldn't have gotten past the ent. <br />
<br />
What I'm wondering is how can everyone get / kill Kirn? Even with a large raid I saw it get raped in the City. <br />
<br />
The hole is really the only thing that I have in front of me, I have gotten my tear already and two of my RL friends are 60 mages (whats the chance of that? /boggle).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drydon - Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can clear to the rev tower with just me playing 5 chars.  The thing you need is a level 60 puller.  This keeps adds to a minimum (but still expect to see up to 5 golems at once).  It is alot easier now that all the mobs down there are mezzable.<br />
<br />
What I do is this:  Set up group at the entrance to the right of the entrance to the city (largish area with no mobs).  Clear the 2 entry mobs, and the one directly inside.  Puller goes in (staying to the left, but not entering any buildings).  There will be one golem to the left and a broken wall to the right and a hallway straight ahead (refer to this as point A).  Use aggro radius pulling to get the golem.  Depending on level of spawn, you will get 2-5 golems on this pull.  Kill them.  Then everyone to in front of the More Than Mushrooms shop (this is if you passed point A without going to where the golem was).  Pull group goes in the door and hugs right wall.  There will be the hall to the docks.  Kill the roamer patrolling that door and the 1-3 rock golems (don't go into dock, thats 3 more mobs to fight).  Once all the adds are cleared, have rest of the group come to you, again hugging the right wall.<br />
<br />
There will be a doorway to your right which leads to another part of the city.  Make sure puller can get to that doorway without any aggro (kill any that do aggo).  Once it's clear, the entire group needs to charge into that next room.  There is 1 elemental in the little pool there and 2-4 roamers.  Kill all these.  Then puller starts clearing toward the tunnel.  Expect 2-3 mobs at a time in camp as well as the rev roamers which will probably be repopping.  Once all is clear, then move group into the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Speed is of the essense.  Respawn in the hole is only about 20 min, tell everyone to not plan on any afk's.  If a non-vital person goes LD, leave them behind and have your hafling rogue scout drag the corpse to you once you get into the tunnel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok two ways to fix your problem.<br />
<br />
1) Faction. Get max ally to TS and you can skip hole. By Max I mean just that - max. &quot;You can no longer improve your faction yadda, yadda.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still want to bump heads with the Hole?<br />
<br />
2) Ok I will presume you have 2 groups of 51-54. Standard mix.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
(You or someone you know create a Rogue who worships Brell Serillis. Station them at entrance)<br />
<br />
TIME IS YOUR ENEMY. RESPAWN WILL OVERWHELM YOU.<br />
<br />
Start by whacking the MOBs at the entrance. Check with the Enchanters and make sure people are assisting. Get that straight - NOW - before you head on.<br />
<br />
Clear all the way to the little tower with the unlockable door before the drop off. <br />
<br />
Everybody jump and take damage. Move to the left put yourselves against wall.<br />
<br />
Have puller start on the first building. Bring 2-3 at a time, don't waste time with single pulls.<br />
<br />
Designate a tank mezzer or two. (Important later)<br />
<br />
Have loot pre-determined. Nothing like spending 5 minutes deciding who gets to roll on some POS loam / Dr00d crap.<br />
<br />
Get through the building heading left and down.  Have the person leading you use &quot;/yell&quot; so people can easily follow.<br />
<br />
You should make it to the square pool room pretty quickly. Clear this room and the little building.  Pull the roamer from the sloping floor leading to the city proper. (A ghost / revenant)<br />
<br />
Get down the sloping dirt floor and pin yourself against back wall.<br />
<br />
Ok - it's been all fun and games until now. Time to get serious.<br />
<br />
Pull the two elementals. Puller should be off and running as soon as first one dies. (SOP - you must pull non-stop.)<br />
<br />
Clear building to left. <br />
<br />
MOVE IN.<br />
<br />
OK it's been 6 months since I've been in there - bear with me.<br />
<br />
You are moving in and to the right  between two buildings then taking a sharp left. <br />
<br />
Your puller must be constantly pulling. Have him watch his aggro as well because 3 Golems = not fun. (Hence why you need a MA, PTM and STM)<br />
<br />
Ok you've succesfully negotiated all the Golems and Elementals and are headed further down the tunnels. (You'll know you're in the correct one - the gate is blown out TOWARDS you - as if something escaped)<br />
<br />
Say hi to Master Jaeil the Wretched. Continue.<br />
<br />
You will eventually reach (after fighting many tunnel MOBs) an open area that appears relatively clear.<br />
<br />
ILLUSION. Here it gets REALLY congested.<br />
<br />
Move away from the tunnel and the spawns. Situate your groups about dead center in the Valley. <br />
<br />
Be prepared for 5-7 at any given time. (/assist, /assist, /assist)<br />
<br />
Have puller con MOBs before engaging. If they're indiff - leave them alone. <br />
<br />
TIME = STILL YOUR ENEMY.<br />
<br />
Will be two MOBs at entrance to undead area. When you pull them - start a clock. If you're not moving in 6 minutes, re-set and start over. (From here not entrance :)= )<br />
<br />
Once these are killed move up and only puller moves inside building. Make SURE puller knows where he is going and what he is looking for.<br />
<br />
Pull the first couple of MOBs inside building leading to Kirn. Once area is clear, check your clock and scoot inside.<br />
<br />
LEAVE THE INDIFF MOBS ALONE.<br />
<br />
If you've gotten this far - congrats.<br />
<br />
As you press towards Kirn, watch for Roamers and side aggro. Stop and kill if anyone gets aggroed. Don't drag them. (You don't have the firepower).<br />
<br />
Kirn himself is a wuss. Do your thing with him, and gate out.<br />
<br />
Gratz - Rak is much easier with two fire pets.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps - it has been a loong time since I've been on a Kirn raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;What I'm wondering is how can everyone get / kill Kirn?&quot;<br />
<br />
Keep trying.<br />
<br />
Keys:<br />
good mezzer<br />
high level puller<br />
keep group level as high as possible.<br />
<br />
Once you get there you'll wonder why it seemed so difficult.<br />
<br />
(Can also invis to undead to the top of the revenant tower. Make sure anyone who gets aggro just drops on the stairs.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We did it with a level 51 puller, a level 55 bard for crowd control, and entirely too many rangers as our damage output.  We had two full groups total, most under 55.  Highest level was a 59sk.  The key is to just pay attention and move fast.  If you are getting killed by adds, get some better/more chanters.  If you are getting popped on before you can clear out the way ahead and move, get more damage output.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">when you reach the ghost area, you can always invis vs. undead to skip killing through them, and just run up to Kirn's area.<br />
<br />
bah, someone already said that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Hole is so much easier now that a good enchanter can line things up and mess with their brain pans while the others get around to them.<br />
<br />
I did it with 2-group set of 50s folks before the fix.  I haven't gone that far down since the change, but where I have gone is much nicer now.<br />
<br />
/salute Faern for an excellent post.<br />
/sigh Faern for almost-but-not-quite-suggesting it get skipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You need 3 things in the hole:<br />
<br />
1. A raid leader who actually knows the zone(from your post you are missing this).<br />
<br />
2. A puller who actually knows the zone(from your post you're missing this too).<br />
<br />
3. People who are paying attention, knowing their roles, and shutting their mouths. Of course, with the new mez rules this isn't quite so important, but still:<br />
<br />
 Even with a large raid I saw it get raped in the City.<br />
<br />
tells me you were missing this too.<br />
<br />
Figure out who will be pulling for you.<br />
<br />
Figure out who will be leading the raid.<br />
<br />
Then the three of you make rogues with brell as your diety, and explore the zone. Otherwise you'll continue in your blind leading the blind rut.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well Braxton is a buddy of mine, lvl 60 shaman who knows the zone quite well and has led many raids through there, he is also our puller. Anyways thank you for your imput, going to try this again this week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First of all, check out <br />
http://www.bol.ucla.edu/~berjd/hole/<br />
for a good map of the hole. Then create a halfling rogue of brell and explore the place. <br />
<br />
We always prefer to pull as little as possible, just move the whole raid from one staging area to the next, bringing what roamers you agro. Once you've dropped down and cleared the courtyard roamers, move the raid to the first pool room, kill what you brought. Next move down the tunnel till just before the cave with the first building. Kill those roamers and move into that cave away from the building, over by a pool. kill the other few mobs that agro and pull two roamers from the tunnel further in, a ratman and a revenant. <br />
<br />
Now you get to the map labeled city1 and it gets kinda hairy. Drop into the first big room and kill the 2 guards and the roamers that path to you. Hug the right wall and move to the next cave. Kill roamers. <br />
<br />
On the map, you'll see a building label with Polzin Mrid (quest npc), move the raid to the back of that little dead end ally in front of the building. You won't get any roamers there. Now clear the first few mobs inside that building, one will be a healer and you don't want him CHing rock golems. Now you have your puller clear the way to the dock. Preferably have a feign puller here and someone to peel off him, this is the only place I know where you can get a massive pull by mistake. Once the way is clear to the dock area, rush it and kill the mobs in there. You can get to this point in about 20 minutes once you get the hang of it. <br />
<br />
Now you get to the fun part. Jump off the waterfall and kill the 4 mobs at the bottom. Start moving up the tunnel, fight when you get to a mob, there's only about 4 total. Now you're at the tower entrance. FROM HERE ON, NO AOE SPELLS! If you have 2 groups, I'd only take one inside. Invis to undead and move up the ramps until you get to the last loopback before the top floor. If anyone looses ITU on the way, tell em to stand and die. If your cleric looses ITU, drag him back outside and let the cleric from teh 2nd group rez him. Pull the guys around kirn to here then move up into Kirn's room. Take him down (easy fight) and port out. <br />
<br />
Assuming nothing went wrong, you can be done in well under an hour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Like everyone else said all you need is a level 60 puller, our group had 1 60monk(ntov + ect.) 56 enchanter(great during the city when we had 8 mobs) 53 cleric, 55 cleric, 60 wiz, 54 shaman. It was easy except not enough melee. Just get a few players who know what there doing there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Hole used to be much harder when epics were first put in. Several times we tried fighting down to Kirn's tower and ended up wiped out in the city, thus commencing a 2 or 3 hour corpse recovery. It's much easier now, or so it seems.<br />
<br />
Best thing you can do is learn the zone so you know exactly where you're going and what's in your way. If you can do it, get the raid leader and puller to do some exploring ahead of time. <br />
<br />
You can make halfling rogues of Brell and get a druid to take them to Toxxulia and bind them outside the Hole entrance. Any rogue of Brell would probably work, but I usually make halfling since they have hide and sneak at 1st level. Many of the earth mobs used to not attack Brell worshippers (but this could have been changed). Either way, a hiding and sneaking Brell character can still move anywhere in the zone safely. These 'hole moles' as I call them are the best way to explore and learn the zone, and also handy in case you need corpse recovery.<br />
<br />
For the actual raid, you will need people who can follow directions quickly and stay alert. Getting to earth city isnt that difficult, and once you are through earth city, it's much easier. Inside earth city you have to kill fast and move fast so you vacate an area before respawns start. If you get stuck in respawn, you will probably die. <br />
<br />
Get the highest level people you can and you should be able to do it with about 2 groups (or less). I wouldnt try it with more than 18 people, because then you are just asking for unneeded aggro trying to pack more people through the city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heya Kuud,<br />
<br />
The main problem we had doing the Hole for you was this. First, people kept going LD, which held us up. Second, one person went LD and died and we had to back track to find them. Third, most of the people that were there, while they were trying their best, they were kinda low in level. Fourth, people were in a rush and kept sending me tells every 5 seconds&quot;How muc longer to Rev tower?&quot;, yet, we were not killing the mobs fast enough to pull any faster.<br />
<br />
Hole really is not that hard, just need 2 goods groups or one solide group of 60's.<br />
<br />
Ill be glad to gie it another go, we just need to get the right class, namely cleric and enchanter.<br />

Let's handle these in order shall we?<br />
<br />
1) Not much you can do except make sure they have clip plane down, Show spell effects off, all chat channels off, etc etc.<br />
<br />
2) If they can gate out - go grab them via coh. If not - sometimes you need to cut losses. Tell them to camp and log on an alt and you'll go back and get them.<br />
<br />
3) /assist, /pay attention, /mana management<br />
<br />
4) Tell them to have a nice glass of **** and quit bothering you.<br />
<br />
Here is a nice raid guide...page down to the Raid Rules from Vellen<br />
<br />
http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/raids.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uloff Bonecracker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ahhh nice to see some more Quellious shaman.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I've done Kirn for a lot of shaman people in the past - 99% of the time with no enchanter at all. (There generally are a fair few rock golems which can't be mezzed anyhow.) Here's a few tips....<br />
<br />
* AE slow is your friend (I use tigirs a lot these days - nice for doing 1 group &quot;raids&quot; in Umbral doing Tawro and Radir with no chanter) Turgur mobs as needed after the initial slow.<br />
<br />
* Keep moving (Even if people go LD - keep moving, let them die and res them later if they need it)<br />
<br />
* Make sure people don't sit right on the walls or when moving make sure they don't move along the walls.<br />
<br />
* Fight in Kirns room, there is one agro revenant and one non agro revenant. (The one in the left corner when you enter the room scowls but never attacks/assists) The one behind Kirn is agro so kill that revenant, buff or whatever then kill kirn after the handin.<br />
<br />
* A good group of 55+ can do this no sweat. Make sure the puller is 60 though. (Might need more if you don't have a lvl 60 shaman.... Usually I handle the slowing so it's kinda hard to know what resists &lt;60 will get)<br />
<br />
* ITU into the castle after the non undead mobs (Marked at point 13 on my map) are dead.<br />
<br />
I've outlined the pull spots that I always take when I do the hole below. I usually pull all mobs between each pull spot before moving to the next....<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm a little bummed they dumbed the zone down so much :/<br />
<br />
Hole was an exceptional spot to teach raid discipline to growing guilds. Also a good zone to teach raid leaders that they need to be *******s sometimes. It was like the old hate and fear, raid training grounds.<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
Now it's just another no skill required zone, the only challenge is hitting the water if your guild does the quick way to yael/nortlav.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Regarding Brell rogues, i sneaked one down to Kirn 3 days ago so it still works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I ran/walked my rogue from the revenant tower to the locked door at the top yesterday so it still works I think.<br />

Im on Quellious too so if you need help with CR and I am on you are welcome to give me a call :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yup I can confirm Brell Halfling rogues still work in the Hole too.<br />
<br />
I've done Kirn twice, I'm hardly an expert. But here's an alternative idea - find a local uber guild who are doig a hole raid for epic drops (maybe rare these days however). Blag your way into the raid, and bring a mage friend. Bind your mage friend on the safe ledge outside the undead tower.<br />
<br />
Come back the next day with all your friends, and have the mage COTH you to the safe ledge. Use ITU to get up to Kirn.<br />
<br />
That's how I did it the first time (for my epic). The second time we did it the traditional way - we had about 4 groups I think, getting through the city was hard, but as has been said, keep moving is the key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Regarding LDs and deaths...if you don't have a non-kos Brell rogue of raid level available, have someone bring along their level 1 explorer.  They tag along with the sole purpose of scouting for the pullers (if needed) and dragging the corpses of the LD back up to the raid.  <br />
<br />
On my raid we also had a system that anyone who died would get someone to drag their corpse until the clerics were safely able to rez (no rez sticks were along).  We needed the every body possible so the emergency Brell rogue was only logged on to help clean up when we'd gotten past the city to a spot in the tunnels we could hold.  Most bodies due to deaths en route were dragged along by whomever the deceased consented till the clerics had sufficient mana to rez.  It worked well.</div></div><hr />
