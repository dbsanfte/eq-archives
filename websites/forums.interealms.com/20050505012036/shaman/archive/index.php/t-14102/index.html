<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have all the key AA skills now and am wondering which one of the three to go for next.<br />
<br />
(1) Healing AA<br />
(2) Channellling AA<br />
(3) CS3 and ID5<br />
<br />
Any view would be welcome )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't have them to say for sure, but I've heard the PoP abilities come in handy.  At least 1 point in spirit call and VP can come in handy and save your arse a time or 2.<br />
<br />
Aside from those, I'd probably go with CS/ID myself, I have not heard anything good about channeling, and I heal 95% of the time with Quiescence, which isn't affected by those aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd say 1 point in spirit call just cause a pack of dogs is fun.<br />
<br />
At least 1 point into VP because a disease based aa root is handy. Not to mention the knockback with it has lots of uses.<br />
<br />
You might also look into innate enlightenment/Planar power. They would provide you some additional mana/hps.<br />
<br />
There's also metabolism which is always handy with stat food =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do have a question myself...and I'd like for some of the higher people that have alot of experience offer their opinion.  <br />
<br />
Basically my problem is this, I'm in a higher level raiding guild (by higher I mean we are elemental flagged) and what happens alot to me is that I manage to take agro alot.  Now, while it's not totally bad, what happened alot was that I was dying..alot.  So, I decided instead of using my AAs that I get now on finishing SCM, I've decided to spend it on CA and LR5.<br />
<br />
So, that brings me to the question.  I take alot of dmg from mobs in every zone.  I have already invested into CA3 and up to LR2 almost.  Should I take the time to get CS1 - 3 and then head up to the ID route?  I'm asking if their is a noticeable difference in the damage that one gets delt with ID5 on then.  I can already tell the difference with LR1 and I know that 5 will be just that great.  <br />
<br />
BTW...I will finish with SCM 2-3, however my problem on raids isn't running out of mana, it's getting hit alot.  I'm more effective if I'm alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i have all those aa and cant really say one is better than another. They arent something youll see a huge difference in, but every little bit helps<br />
<br />
-healing aa turn our ch from 1900ish to 2300ish<br />
<br />
-channeling aa wont turn your epic into a jbb<br />
<br />
- the defence aa's, your probly better looking for graphs on the warrior boards<br />
<br />
just pace your self .. and get em all<br />
id probly knock out the defence aa first tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LR seems to help more than ID for us Shaman by a wide margin. I heard it might be different for tank classes with higher Defensive Skills to begin with. But every bit helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Looking at his magelo, he already has CA3 and LR5.  In fact, he has a lot more than the &quot;key AA skills&quot;.  He is being pretty humble about his 120aa.<br />
<br />
That being said, I would recommend first getting 1 rank of spirit call.  The extra damage they do doesn't really impress me, but I find them quite useful for pulling.  Whenever I am pulling a 2-spawn in PoP, I can send my pets in before I aggro the mobs myself and trust them to stay alive long enough for me to root one and slow the other.  Also, I hunt a lot in tactics where the Daiku Death Knights HT for 1091.  A HT + triple 583 that stuns me and allows him to triple me again can quite likely kill me.  I use my pets to eat the harm touch.  Also, if you duel a lot, they are really great mainly because no one can channel sh1t through 4 pets and it causes people to panic that haven't faced it before.  Most SC advocates say it is a good AA because it is free damage every 12 minutes.  I disagree because the damage is rather unimpressive, but I think it is still a good AA for the utility.  I wouldn't go past the first rank for a while, though.<br />
<br />
I have also heard that CS and ID are not that great for us in comparison to CA and LR.  I have CA3 but have no started on LR or CS yet, so I can't really say.  The way I understand it, with max CA and LR you have a decent chance of having a lucky streak of misses, thus saving your life if you get aggro from some big baddie.  With CS and ID you will be taking consistantly less damage from every mob, but that is probably not going to save you.  If you get quadded for 2000 instead of 2500, you're still gonna die.  If the mob misses half of those, though, you will be alive :)<br />
<br />
I know nothing about channeling focus =\<br />
<br />
As for Virulent Paralysis...  A lot of people swear by it, but I never really saw it as being that useful.  It doesn't refresh fast enough for me to feel safe unmemming root, and I doubt that a disease-based root gets resisted less than a magic-based root does on a malos'd mob.  I do not have this AA, though, so I cannot really testify.  I was considering training it, but then I got ornate chain legs which have a right click greater immobilze effect, and that ensured that I will never ever train VP.<br />
<br />
The healing AA's, though, I do know about.  I have HG3 and AHG3, and I am very happy with them.  HA and HG function sort of like CS and CA, respectively.  HA will make you heal for more.  A 1500pt tnargs vs. a 1300pt tnargs is a decent upgrade, but the 200hp difference is most likely not going to save someone's life.  HG, on the other hand, gives you the chance to double your heal.  A 2600pt heal WILL save peoples lives.  I have only had HA for about 3 weeks, and I have already saved more people's lives with crits than I can begin to count.  The ideal answer is, of course, to get both :)  However, I feel that HG is hands-down the more useful of the two, and you should max it before you even start on HA.  Also, I went in to Advance Healing Gift thinking it was going to cost 2 - 4 - 6, but it actually only costs 2 - 3 - 4 which was a pleasant surprise.<br />
<br />
I also notice that you have quickbuff2, but no haste of mithaniel or other spell haste item.  That leaves you with a 4.5 second Q.  I have nice items in my shoulders and range slot (only place a haste of mithaniel item can go) that I am unwilling to get rid of.  Thus, I went ahead and trained QB3 and I am very happy that I did.  A 3 second Q is really awesome.  Between QB3 and SCRM I can keep Q up on my entire group, ensuring no one dies to medium-strength AEs.  QB3 is also very nice to have for.... you guessed it... BUFFING.  When 20 people die and get rezzed and all ask for rebuffs at once, it is nice to be able to do it in half the time.  A lot of people feel that QB3 is a waste of AA, but I do not feel that way.  Eventually I will have a spell haste item that will make QB2 + that haste the same as QB3 and thus render than 9AA obsolete, but I feel that it was worth the 9AA to have a 3 second Q in the meantime.<br />
<br />
So, my advice would be to spend 4 on spirit call, 9 on QB3, and then 20 on Healing Gift.  That should keep you busy for a while :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did CF2,because I was just so tired of getting interrupted when doing a heal (espacially on myself).  I've really enjoyed the benefit and think that it's saved some lives (and a pelt or two).  <br />
<br />
I've been going down the IR route, without the numbers to back up the investment.  What IS the percentage avoided with IR5?<br />
<br />
I'm probably going to do the ID route next, even though I SHOULD suck it up and finish QB (impatient bear!).  What's the total percentage mitigated with ID5?<br />
<br />
DOH!  Am I cheating again?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have just finished SCF3, mainly for comedy value and to wind friends and guildmates up. I'm now getting close to 2k nukes on velium strike+rizolnas. Tears crits for 1300 pretty often. just makes me smile ;)<br />
<br />
Healing gift is fun too, especially with an IH4 focus item, I regularly crit Tnargs in the 2700-2800 range with HG2, you know its worth it when you pop a near 3k heal on a cleric/ench etc about to go purple.<br />
<br />
I just got bored of sensible aa, and had this vision of a fat lazy troll throwing crit heals an nukes back to back, works for me.<br />
<br />
My next plan is to finish HG3/Qbuff2, then bite down ca2-3/LR then go from there..</div></div><hr />

VP is actually usefull for soloing, but you have to have VP3.. it refreshs about 5 seconds before it wears off on a mob.<br />
<br />
It allows you to solo gurdians in fire, the first set in the first castle give about 10% aa exp solo every 4 to 5 minutes, the second set, I do the ones outside of FR's ring about 19% aa every 6 to 7 minutes. This is before the upcoming solo exp nerf. the only time its ever wore off early is when a ranger that tagged along wouldn't stop useing his proc bow.<br />
Btw if you try this keep in mind these mobs hit for 900+ and fast ( i dont bother slowing them when I solo) though i have never died doing it I have been yacking while killing these and missed the refresh on VP and gotten smacked a few times.. LR5 and VP's knock back are the only things that saved me.<br />
<br />
Its advantages over other mr based root is on mobs like these with low dr.. you can use it as a timer, it never ever break unless you nuke.<br />
<br />
ND3 and LR5 are extremly useful if you get hit a lot you will love LR5, ND3 is a no brainer.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info, thats the best explanation of VP I have heard yet.  I just have a couple of questions:<br />
<br />
1)  Does it still work well without malicious decay?<br />
2)  Do you really mean it NEVER breaks unless you nuke?  That's just spiffy :)<br />
3)  What does it cost for ranks 1, 2, and 3?  Castersrealm is incorrect too often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ragathor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have LR5 and ID5.  I notice a vast difference with these AA's.  With an attentive cross healer I have survived flurries from kingpin bosses that used to hit me for 1800-2300 now they hit for around 1300-2000 but still hit me for max damage at times.  Also nothing is better than seeing Coirnav tries to hit you but misses 3 or 4 times.  Having these AA makes old world content a complete joke really.  The guards at the first castle hit on average now for around 300 with many hits in the low 100's.  I sit at 7400hps during raids fully buffed and that is from first getting the PLanar Power and natural Durability maxxed out.  <br />
<br />
I personally think defense &gt; Heals.  Although I am working my heal lines now.  I only use Tnargs Heal and will crit for 3400 and common heals at 1700, give or take a few HPs.  It really depends on your personal view point and what type of shaman you are. IE Raid Vs Group.  Anyways GL on whatever path you choose.  Im just pissed at myself for having inate Stamina and not having the foresight to see that most all PoP gear had mass STA on it.  I rarely even mem Boar now. hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) very well, in fact in fire I do use MD to pull with, w/ extended distance I have plenty of time to root before mob gets close.<br />
<br />
2) clarifying it never breaks in poFire when pulling with md, keep in mind I only do the gaurdians (the gaurds with the firey heads), in tactics I have great success soloing in arena with it but it does break early semi often there.<br />
<br />
3) I believe its 3 3 3 but I cant honestly remember.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gradukk Gravelbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Honestly I would go with the Healing AA's. I recently completed AHG3 and AHA3, and when you add in the Elemental Chain Arms, Tnarg's becomes a huge heal. normal heals between 1500 to 1800, and crits anywhere from 3000 to 3600.<br />
<br />
I use Tnargs all the time for patch healing or picking casters off the floor, a well timed crit can save a rampage tank and sometimes even the main tank if your clerics are sucking that day.<br />
<br />
I find I use Tnargs alot more now that I have finished the healing aa's, moreso than Q for sure. I have not done CA/LR yet, so I cannot comment much on those, working on wolf army next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">you got a 3600 heal ? doing the math it sounds right, but personally ive never hit over 3400ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't think a 3600 point crit heal is possible. <br />
<br />
Crits only double the base amount of the spell not the aa/focus items.<br />
<br />
So the max should be 1300 + 1300 (crit) + 1300*.44 (aa's)<br />
<br />
Problem is that results in a max of 3172. Might be that it takes aa's but not focus.<br />
<br />
(1300 *1.19 (aa)) *2 + 1300 *.25 (focus) = 3419<br />
<br />
That one seems to work out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gradukk Gravelbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Was just a rough guess actually, usually I am too busy chain casting em to pay much attention to how big the crits are, i know for 100% that i have gotten over 3400 crits, just not sure by how much. I will test it some later tonight and get back to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Depends on how you play your Shaman, as others have said. Personally, I don't solo, nor do I find myself healing much, so I had to find something to do with all that extra mana and went ahead and got FoM3 (after the obvious, more practical AA's). Sure, my nukes aren't going to save a raid, but with Magician focus items and Bard song, casting Velium Strike 4-5 times a fight, I can contribute some meaningful damage to a group.<br />
<br />
Just an idea, depending on your playstyle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I made a similar choice recently and choose Channeling Focus 3 since I notice I got interupt lots during tanking solo, or still got some interupt when you agro tanking; so hope this AA is more useful in this situtation when you need them most, look like it is good invest for me<br />
<br />
I am still decide which AA next; Healing Adept3/advance for 20% extra heal, or spell casting fury/Fury of Magic for crit nuke; both isn't good, I think I like nuke more than heal <br />
<br />
from what I heard, CS/ID line isn't that good but I will put 2 points in rest of Archtype AA to make it CS1, SCF1, Heal Gift1, CS;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm...these thread has turned out to be a good discussion on AA.<br />
<br />
I am a raiding shaman and my guild raids in elemental zones often.<br />
<br />
Healing is not so much of a choice, it's a must.  Even when we have a cleric in the group, the cleric may be busy doing CH on MT or MA.  So I become the healer.<br />
<br />
Even when I group for grindage, I usually just heal and slow and buff.<br />
<br />
I have more or less decided on pursuing healing AA first.  Just trying to figure out Healing Adept or Healing gift first.  I have people telling me Healing gift proc a lot and thus it is better than Healing adept and I also have people telling me the opposite.<br />
<br />
Would be glad if anyone with both max Healing adept and Healing Gift can shed some light on the two AA skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't know...I guess that I'm still basically concerned with the advantage over having CS3/ID5 than spending those 27 points on something else.  I mean, I think that if we are say....going after RZTW in Tactics, and I take agro from anything that we pull...then if for max normal hit, them mob will double me in the 500s, but with ID5 he will hit me in the 300s...then it's more than worth having it.  <br />
<br />
Hmmm.... well, at least I will have a bit before I'm able to max out LR.  Might be able to finish the 12AAs needed by the end of my days off...but after that I'm still curious. <br />
<br />
Question:  SCM affects all spells right..and not just the one that you specialize in?  If I get this up to SCM3, then will I save mana on all of my spells...or just the alteration specialty (what I specialized in).  I think that after LR5, then that might be a good path to take, although my need for more mana isn't usually an issue.  However if it affects my mana on everything, then soloing in places like PoFire become more plausible with SCM.<br />
<br />
Another question:  What are the benefits of having RC3?  I realize what RC1 does, but wondering how much more effective and worthwhile it would be to get 3.  <br />
<br />
Bah, so many things to spend AAs in and so much time needed to get them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>uklugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You should go for healing skills in my opinion they are very helpful and have helped me save many peoples lives in raids.They have also made me able to be sole healer in good exp spots like first castle in fire with ease. After finishing my healing aas i have put kraggs mending on page 50.<br />
<br />
With aha3, ahg3 and elemental arms tnargs have never critted for more then 34XX so i would assume its impossible to get 3600 crits unless you have greater focus then 25%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Honestly I would go with the Healing AA's.

Why does it vary? I know crits are random, but are the Adept or focus effects random too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">the random is the healing foci items, like Marr's Gift (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3502&amp;source=Test) or Improved Healing IV (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3501&amp;source=Test)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gradukk Gravelbiter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well after watching my crits on healing for the last few days, it seems the max heal on Tnarg's is 3419. I knew it was over 3400, just didn't know by how much. This is with AHG3, AHA3, and Marr's Gift focus.<br />
<br />
The max non crit heal that I saw was 1872, I am unsure if this is the max possible non crit, but it still seems to be quite a bonus from the normal Tnarg's.<br />
<br />
As for the guy that wanted to know which to get first, AHA or AHG, I did the AHA aaxp's first, I figured that AHA effects every single heal, where as AHG is more random. So I boosted all my regular heals before moving into the crits. Seems personal preference would reign in this department though.</div></div><hr />
