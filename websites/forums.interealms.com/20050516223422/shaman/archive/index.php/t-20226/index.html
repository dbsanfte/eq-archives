<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seeing as how we love to debate and because I am really curious I would like to know what people actually would want as an upgrade for our heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I checked the: 1800 hp heal. 3,75 casting time and 2,25 recast time <br />
1sec cast is just too much to ask. really, and I believe a 1k8 direct heal with quiescence would be enough for our healing section ;)<br />
But there is still stat buffs and canni to solve ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd personally like to see our spam heal with like a 3.0 second cast time.  That'd put it at 1.8 seconds fully focused with the cleric buff. And doing in the 1700 - 1800 range.  Heal over time doesn't matter to me a lot unless they reduce the cast time to where I can actually have time to use it in a big fight...right now it's just spam tnarg's and spam tnarg's and hope for enough lucky crits that the tank doesn't die.  If our heal over time cast a lot faster I could take the chance on casting it and hoping that the tank lived for me to get it on to maybe get out of the tnarg's cycle.  Though, that being said, I won't argue against a 500 hps or more heal over time, it will help with bringing tanks up to full after fights are over so the druids and clerics can save mana.  And it won't make us anymore mana efficient at gaining mana back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Basically, I feel we need two things from heals:<br />
<br />
1) The ability to save someone's ass when things go bad, or to effectively patch a MT between CHs<br />
<br />
2) The ability to sustain healing output for the duration of an adventure/expedition. <br />
<br />
A druid+shaman should be at least the equal, and probably better, than a single cleric at doing the above. Combine a 500/tick heal with druids healing power, and occasional emergency shaman heals, and I'd be happy.<br />
<br />
I voted for <br />
<br />
Hot upgrade to 500hp/tick and a 1800hp heal that casts in 3,75 sec <br />
<br />
but would be equally happy with <br />
1800 hp heal. 3,75 casting time and 2,25 recast time<br />
plus the 500/tick heal over time.<br />
<br />
- but that'd be 2 votes and I just wanted to go for one option. I do feel the recast time would be good though - it keeps us a little behind the druids fast heal, plus they still have their 4k heal to supplement it.<br />
<br />
I definitely don't want a new semi-CH type spell. No CH chains for me, thanks very much.</div></div><hr />
