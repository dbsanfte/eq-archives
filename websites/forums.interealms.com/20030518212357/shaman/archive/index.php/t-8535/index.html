<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fuden felsire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, <br />
   i am looking for tactic's that have resulted in success vs lord rak since the changes to the mage pets. i have heard that mage pets have a severe vulnerability now to the aoe he casts, since using the masters resists vs there own. thanks for all the info in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check out the Shaman FAQ that been put together by many of the most knowledgeable shaman here.  I'll see if I can find a link for you.<br />
<br />
**EDIT**<br />
Found it.  It's stickied in the Quests forum<br />

From my understanding of the changes with Rak, fire pets are no longer immune to his AE fire.  The best way seems to be lots of FR gear on either the mages or the tanks, or both!<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ragnarita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pet use the master's resistances only if it's higher than its own. Done my Epic 2 weeks ago with only 1 fire pet, no way the pet would have survived if he has only his master resist. <br />
(Or maybe was I really, really lucky :) who knows)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ah!  Perhaps I've drawn the wrong conclusions from reading other peoples' posts on Rak.  I'm very interested, as I just killed Kirn last Tuesday, and am now seriously looking at the rest of the quest.<br />
<br />
You used only 1 mage fire pet?  How many healers?  any other people to add DPS, or a long fight with the same fire pet?  Did you pull him out of the castle?  Fight him there?  Did the pet tank the whole fight?  Did the mage have to re-cast his pet at all?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>fuden felsire</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well.... guys i will let you know further i am going to attempt this this next weekend on sat. 14th of dec. ..... wish me luck. <br />
<br />
-i am going to attempt it with one mage fire pet. and hope for the best.</div></div><hr />

Don't risk your tear with just a mage, get yourself a Tank. Fire pets do not have the resists anymore to take down Rak.<br />
<br />
Check out this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=97578#post97578) for infor on how myself have taken down Rak since the resist changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also: Rak is now using different wizard spells which would kill the firepets pretty fast. Get a few good tanks and some healers and Rak is cake.</div></div><hr />
