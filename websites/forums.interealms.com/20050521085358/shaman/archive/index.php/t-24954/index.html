<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a thought, but with everyone leaving EQ for the new shiny car on the other side of the fence, why not take care of the one you got.  <br />
<br />
I believe that EQ2 was released simply because you can't keep expanding content in current EQ.  We now have 70 levels and gear with 200hp and mana.  How much more expanding can you do?  Where do you draw the line?  Does it get retarded at some point? Yes, indeed it does on many levels.  So what is the solution?  We release a new game.  Why not give the old game new life?  Give it a new perspective....<br />
<br />
I have been asking myself lately if the flavor is lost cause we have been asked to swollow to fast.  If you know you get a drop now that will be outdated in a month, why work so hard to get it?  Stuff is being trivialized and it almost means nothing when you obtain it.  The whole point is to release, upgrade, progress.  Just to up your stats and really there is no motive or drive.  What is the point?<br />
<br />
I looked forward to getting a TA and time gear and enjoying it for awhile, than the new releases come and bam my gear is worthless with the old focus items.  Gear is upgraded and before you can really feel like you accomplished something you are getting upgrades for gear you have been in a month.  I remember wearing my vindi BP for at least a year or more.  That felt good when you knew you did a hard encounter and you could enjoy a piece of armor and be set for awhile.<br />
  <br />
Maybe its just me, but I think the money bus needs to slow down.   Releasing expansion upon expansion only lessens the experience of the game.  If you can't enjoy a zone or an expansion for at least a month before the new one comes out, you kind of question why even bother.<br />
<br />
If you take away the hard work people put into a game and minimize it for money, I guarantee people will loose interest.  People want the hard work and effort to mean something.  They want to enjoy the game and the gear they work hard to get.<br />
<br />
I think SOE really needs to focus on shifting the pattern of content and making EQ an experience of its own.  I am talking about rounding out the whole game.  Make it an experience that you can only get in EQ1.  Bring everything on par with each other, but revamp the delivery.  <br />
<br />
Stop releasing new stuff and maybe combine some encounters with quests. Progress a guild through quest encounters and raid experience.  <br />
<br />
I would try to tie the encounters to a path in the game for guilds.  Have them follow a story line and some form of faction.  For instance make guilds choose a faction and stick with it to gain better abilities.  Then allow them drops aligned with those factions, that was the fun of velious.  You could eliminate people from using the gear for twinks if you make it faction specific. <br />
<br />
The other fun for me in this game was competition for content.  I am sorry, but that in itself attracted many folks to EQ.  It was competitive.<br />
<br />
If the guilds could prosper as a whole it would make it much more exciting. If one guild could get an edge over another through the use of skill, it would ignite the game back to life. If EQ could somehow move toward a group benefit as opposed to an indivdual benefit it might bring a new perspective to the game.  Make guilds work to quest special traits that only they can master based maybe on faction. Only one guild could align with a faction this making them masters in that field.  No other guild could gain that faction once its taken.  You could have the different factions allow only those guild members special abilities in the encounter or game.  <br />
<br />
I would take the emphasis off gear and make higher end progression a more complex beast than linear progression of gear and harder hitting mobs.  The same equation with new character models gets old fast.  <br />
<br />
Making a new game and starting over in a different world will only hold the attention of people for so long. <br />
<br />
I am writing this cause I don't plan on leaving my shaman and it pains me to see other people's hard work thrown down the drain.  It bothers me everytime someone says they are leaving this game.  This game just needs to be adjusted to keep people playing.  I hope that a few ideas might be considered or is it to little to late? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thormiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly, I think EQ is such an old game now that to make sweeping changes the way you described would mean redesigning the game engine so much that it's almost like making a new game. Which is kinda what they did with EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's a bit late, sadly. The dev's have covered up relatively bad gameplay with a focus on massive gear inflation. That's lead to massively overpowered PC's straining the game mechanics, they can only really challenge a skilled guild using scripted trickery, and an expectation that new challenges inevitably lead to another round of power inflation. It's a vicious cycle that is accelerating. But of course none of the established players would want their power adjusted even if that would give the game greater longevity.<br />
<br />
Progression centric games have strangled themselves, eventually, in this way since I played pen and paper D&amp;D. It's the time at which the frustrated DM kills or retires the characters and everyone rolls up new ones for a fresh new story. <br />
<br />
I've seen nothing to suggest WoW and EQ2 will be any different, they both rely on progression for player motivation, but they're new and fresh now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've seen nothing to suggest WoW and EQ2 will be any different, they both rely on progression for player motivation, but they're new and fresh now.<br />
I am not sure its possible to make a game that is any differnt. Personally, I think the trick is to make the ROAD itself as long and entertaining and rewarding &quot;fun-wise&quot; as the destination promises to be.<br />
<br />
One of the things I liked about OoW was that it barely mud-flated the higher end at all. Instead, it closed the gap between the raider and non-raider by a HUGE chunk by making insanely good items available to the average casual player. I took my lvl 56 Pally twink, and added about 500 hps, 100 AC, gave him an uber sword, pumped all his resists by 20+, etc, JUST by camping for runes for my main and winning drops in RC, WoS and PG. Since I had smithing skill, I made him 4 or 5 pieces of Magnetic. Not the charged, just the regualr, Lightning Cores are too rare to waste on a &quot;twink&quot; IMHO. <br />
<br />
Overall, given the age and current state of EQ, I think this was a good thing. Gates introduced some insane gear at the top end of the game, but OoWs top end stuff isnt THAT much better. So far, its mostly just equal, actually, except for the new focii, which is fine by me. Who knows what we will see in CoA as more and more guilds gain access to that place, but still, by and large, OOW closed up a gap that needed to be closed. <br />
<br />
A big problem any new game will have is breaking tht EQ mentality of &quot;There is no road, only a destination&quot;. In EQ1, its all about getting to the 60's, THEN looking to &quot;play&quot; more. Heck they may as well let you start new characters at 55 in EQ1. The game barely begins before PoP anymore at all. But new games MUST be attractive enough at the lower levels to try to wane people off that idea that its all about &quot;rushing to the highest level you can as fast as you can&quot;. Not gonna be easy, thats for sure, for ANY new game. If EQ1 came out today, bug-free, it would still be a laughing stock, with the slowness of play, and the puny level of its gear. My god, I remember REJOICING when I got a 25 AC BP, or a 16/34 sword on my Paladin that procced an Undead nuke for whatever. People laugh now at gear we wore 4 years ago as &quot;top end&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree, too much content too fast.  SOE is stripping the game, taking as much profit as they can as fast as they can, because they are expecting people to move on soon, if not to WoW and EQ2 then to next year's big new games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One thing I am not liking, and something I think makes the new expansions less exciting is that they don't tie all the expansions together. Outside of the new epics, there is nothing in the new content to even suggest that the old content is even there, aside from a quick way back to PoK. <br />
<br />
As I was sitting in WoS, hoping for a rune drop for the millionth hours since I started grouping there. I thought about how nice it would be to have a good ol Spectral Parchment or *shock* have some of the Glyphed rune words (or whatever the 65 rune are called) drop off these mobs, because dammit, I still don't have all of my 65 spells. Now I'm 66 with half of my 65 spells and none of my 66 spells. But going to hang out in BoT for no exp and trains to hopefully get an SP to drop off a mob just isn't that appealing right now. <br />
<br />
It seems with the old world, you could get to places by running from zone to zone, or way back when, by taking a boat (although that was before my time). These days, You can run from a GoD zone and find some cool and unexplored caves or canyons to run through to get to the new zones. They're unconnected. <br />
<br />
/shurg. just a newbs opinion on subjects that have no doubt been talked about to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yes the content is moving too fast ... there a lot of people that started the game late or scrapped their characters and started a new class (this is what I did) or just level slower than some.<br />
<br />
Because of this there is a lot of high end content that is wasted because no one uses it anymore ... because the gear isnt worth it :/<br />
<br />
places that should get a revamp shortly after every expansion or once the zones average population drops a bit. <br />
<br />
VP (just happened ... yaaay people want to go there again)<br />
NToV<br />
Sleepers<br />
VT<br />
Time to be added to this list at some point in the future :/<br />
<br />
These are all places that should be able to be expirenced but no raiding guilds that I know of even try these anymore they start with pop :/<br />
<br />
this is just my 2 cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">These are all places that should be able to be expirenced but no raiding guilds that I know of even try these anymore they start with pop :/<br />
I still feel the smopothest path of progression for any guild is SSra-VT-PoP-Time-Ikky. Sure you can combine, like doing PoP flags while farming VT once a week, and getting folks flagged for KT etc, but this path is going to provide a fairly quick way to gear up a large raid force with the lowest amount of time invested. <br />
<br />
A lot has been said for the whole &quot;Skip VT, head straight to the EPs&quot; theory, but personally, while I know its possible, and I know its doable, I  think thats just making life hard for no reason. Keying for VT can be done mostly solo or in small groups, except the Orb thingys and Emp rift. As you are farming Emp keys, you can raid the mobs in Ssra. Some of those drops are still very good. And you can be doing PoP event all the while as well. But PoP just cannot provide the sheer VOLUME of gear that VT does. That is why I think, despite OoW, guilds will have a hard time trying to skip Time and head straight to Uqua-Qvic. Sure, you can gear up in KT and the Ikkys and some OoW mobs, but overall, you cannot compete with the sheer VOLUME of loot in Time. <br />
<br />
While I agree that it would be nice to see some upgraded raid zones, I would honestly rather they spent that programmer time either fixing current content or creating new content. As attractive as it sounds, I have no desire to go back to Kael Arena, ToV, or ST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm not sure where you are getting this &quot;If you can't enjoy a zone or an expansion for at least a month before the new one comes out, you kind of question why even bother.&quot;  If you were near the front of the high end game, then you experience it for far long than &quot;a month&quot;, and if you aren't in the high end well thats not a problem with expansions.  Do you really expect the high end guilds to sit around waiting for expansions so that people a year behind the lead can get to the end before a new one comes out?  Nothing is stopping you from continuing the progression, you don't *have* to skip ahead.  If enjoying the progression means more to you than having the best loot then what is the proble if your gear is perceived to be out dated?<br />
<br />
Frankly the expansions have hardly been close together.  You are clearly talking about raiding expansions so:<br />
<br />
Old World (Released March 16, 1999) <br />
Ruins of Kunark (Released April 24, 2000) <br />
Scars of Velious (Released December 5, 2000) <br />
Shadows of Luclin (Released December 6, 2001) <br />
Planes of Power (Released October 21, 2002) <br />
Gates of Discord (Released February 10, 2004) <br />
Omens of War (Released September 14, 2004) <br />
<br />
Assuming your server opened day one, which most didn't, then the time between expansions is:<br />
<br />
13 months<br />
8 months<br />
12 months<br />
11 months<br />
16 months !!<br />
7 months<br />
<br />
That is hardly quick.  Farming Time for a year sucked, sucked almost as much as GoD.   I don't know how you think those expansions are so fast that you can't enjoy a zone for a month. The only one even close to being quick was OoW and it was badly needed to be quick because GoD sucked for both the raiders and the casuals.  Even the casuals had been waiting for a year for a release (since LDoN).<br />
<br />
I believe that EQ2 was released simply because you can't keep expanding content in current EQ. We now have 70 levels and gear with 200hp and mana. How much more expanding can you do? Where do you draw the line? Does it get retarded at some point? Yes, indeed it does on many levels.<br />
<br />
Why can't you?  And gear in OoW is 300 hp/mana.  Its all relative anyway.  We could be getting 1000 hp/mana gear, it wouldn't matter.  It's all perspective and relative to the current expansion.  Older expansions are trivialized anyway no matter what you do.  Its all part of a game like this.  Unless you release expansions that do nothing in terms of upgrading gear, levels, AA, or any form of progress at all prior content will be trivialized.   While a game like that with no mudflation at all would appeal to some, most would not want that type of game.  People play to advance themselves, a game without advancement wouldn't appeal to many people other than roleplayers or people that just want to log in to socialize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A big problem any new game will have is breaking tht EQ mentality of &quot;There is no road, only a destination&quot;. In EQ1, its all about getting to the 60's, THEN looking to &quot;play&quot; more.<br />
<br />
As much as I hate to agree with this, I do - for the most part. My disagreement though is with the idea that this is EQ's mentality. It isn't. It is the majority player view. The majority believe the game doesn't start until the &quot;end game.&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE has fed that viewpoint with the release of OoW. Think about it. GoD release resulting in a significant loss of high end players. Guilds that finally said, &quot;sorry, tired of outrageous content that is not finished, drops that are too rare, events that are too bugged, etc .. &quot; So they left. Follow that with the SOE belief that the majority player base is in the 35-55 range. (Yeah, I know, no one, except SOE - possibly - believes this.)<br />
<br />
The success of the formula for building expansions to cater to the high end guilds died with GoD. Pretty much this is natural. How long are folks willing to rinse and repeat the same template to stay high end? Apparently not forever.<br />
<br />
OoW is a radical response for SOE to the problem of lossing the cash flow from a tried, true and now outdated formula. Very nice, EP quality, items dropping from single groupable (and rare drops from soloable) mobs initially energized the remaining base of players. Smaller guilds, unguilded, unflagged folks have a way to get gear that is similar to drops from high end PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
Ironically folks are not maintaining the energized level about these possibilities of gear. Initially yes. But as the formula is the same they have had to deal with to get sub-par gear in the past - camp a spot, pull to spot, kill over and over and over - the enjoyment value is just not there. It is just BoT without giants. While the gear has clear value, the journey leaves no real sense of new, challenging content and so there is no acheivement. Just like folks use mains to get gear to twink alts ... OoW mobs are twinking mains. Minimum effort for maximum benefit.<br />
<br />
Just like BoT, folks camp and camp and camp and progressively get items and spell drops. Without challenge. No skill required.<br />
<br />
There is where EQ is failing. And it really isn't their fault so much as the fault of what they see from player &quot;wants.&quot; So we get back to the 'journey vs. destination.' EQ could easily be renewed and reinvented if SOE developed the game to focus on journey. Instead their design is responding to what they see the player base wanting. The paradox is the player base doesn't really want what they claim to want - they just don't know what the solution is that will give them what they actually do want.<br />
<br />
Challenges, real quests, real progression and a personally unique game flow path to the game would generate great new interest in the game. At least for the old, been playing since forever, base.<br />
<br />
For all the complaining and yelling and hours upon hours of frustration in the evolution of this game, as I look back, the majority of the good times and fond memories were the result of overcoming the frustration. Camping Raster for 2 weeks straight, 4-5 hours a night with a friend (monk) to progress was mind-numbingly repetitive at the time. In retrospec, we had fun. We found things to do to keep entertained between spawns. We chatted. We chatted with guildmates. Guildmates came and went, joining us for a few rounds of spawns. This was just one camp. <br />
<br />
The number of camps and raids and efforts to progress mine and other's epics or class quests or dungeon crawls for gear upgrades are way too many to count here. The memories of great times that often involved lengthy CRs - while a pain at the time - are many. Hell, as a noob I lost more levels trying to get my body back in Befallen than I will admit here. Damn that well!! <br />
<br />
Today that wouldn't happen, but if it did the player would likely quit. More likely they would log on a friend's high level necro to summon them, then a cleric to rez their level 12 toon so they didn't loose XP ... and also for a Temp buff. For me, at that time, there was no way I was going to lose the int ring I had camped Cuthbert for a week to get. Or the water crystal staff a friend had loaned me ... LOANED!!<br />
<br />
Jumping ahead to the first epics - finally getting it was a major sense of accomplishment. The progression was slow, irritating, frustrating at times ... and absolutely &quot;too cool&quot; to finally get to the end and get it. Now it is taking a couple of weeks of focused effort to get the 1.5 epic. And folks complain about the 'work' necessary to get there. Amazing.<br />
<br />
SOE has given in to the gotta-have-it-now players. These players yet complain about the slow pace ... because, for them (not SOE) the destinitation is the point, not the journey. Sadly, the destinations are limited, so once you are there what is left? Nothing. Especially if, in retrospect, you have no sense of journey. No fond memories. No sense of true effort leading to true accomplishment.<br />
<br />
SOE has given the players what they thought they wanted. The players are finding out the truth behind the adage: &quot;Be careful what you wish for. You may get it.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You forgot to add LoY Jaradis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;If you were near the front of the high end game, then you experience it for far long than &quot;a month&quot;, and if you aren't in the high end well thats not a problem with expansions. &quot;<br />
<br />
Um, what percentage of the people playing this game are on the brink of each expansion with people retiring and guilds folding?  Do you think its greater than 10 percent?  I highly doubt with the back flagging and such there are many guilds that aren't working through content for awhile.  People complain every day that they can't go back to old content for spells cause people don't raid there anymore.    <br />
You seem to be missing my point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really expect the high end guilds to sit around waiting for expansions so that people a year behind the lead can get to the end before a new one comes out? &quot;<br />
<br />
No <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing is stopping you from continuing the progression, you don't *have* to skip ahead. If enjoying the progression means more to you than having the best loot then what is the problem if your gear is perceived to be out dated?&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem is many fold and if you don't realize the problems then you obviously must be at the top.  One is that people just hitting time now are stuck with focus effects that they can't use with many of thier spells.  Another problem is most people don't have thier GoD spells if you want to dispute that why don't you make a poll on this topic.<br />
<br />
As far as skipping content well that is going to happen based on where the gear and spells are dropping. The game isn't fun in just the two zones that the gear is currently dropping.  They need to expand the progression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can't you? And gear in OoW is 300 hp/mana. Its all relative anyway. We could be getting 1000 hp/mana gear, it wouldn't matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is where you are wrong why do you think people are moving on? <br />
People don't want the same sh!t different day, especially if the stuff is trivialized in a month. You think all those guilds that flagged people to get the 140hps 140mana items are happy now they drop in unkeyed zones off trash mobs?  They spent months working thier ass off to get those items and now they are out of date.  That sure isn't my definition of fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all perspective and relative to the current expansion. Older expansions are trivialized anyway no matter what you do. Its all part of a game like this. Unless you release expansions that do nothing in terms of upgrading gear, levels, AA, or any form of progress at all prior content will be trivialized.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is a matter of perspective if you like simple minded linear progression than by all means this is the game for you.  I like working as a team and advancing my guild through content that delivers something more then gear and ego.  I like depth and challege in a game that lacks good content.  I like seeing a guildie upgrade a 50hp item to a good 150hp item cause of my hard work.  If our effort means nothing and the gear just gets better, you efforts yield nothing.  why would you work three months to get a 100hp item when in 30 days its not going to be a good item?   I am exaggerating the time frames of course, but that is to prove a point.  Guilds rebuild and loose people all the time this means progressing and then falling back in content.  Did you take that into consideration?<br />
<br />
&quot;While a game like that with no mudflation at all would appeal to some, most would not want that type of game. People play to advance themselves, a game without advancement wouldn't appeal to many people other than roleplayers or people that just want to log in to socialize.&quot;<br />
<br />
Depends on what you call advancement.  If you mean enhancing your virtual cockadoodledo so you can get on eqrankings, then I doubt you represent the majority of players.  I think most play this game to develop relationships and work toward a common goal. I believe the hardcore guild will become the minority and not the majority.  The expansions have made hardcore raiding guilds a thing of the past. The longevity of this game will be in the enhancements not new releases.  Casual guilds will be the main stay for this game.  People that don't want to move through things in 30 days and be bored waiting on the next new thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look at it this way (sex sells, exchange appropriate gender for your preference):  Everquest is a 45-year-old housewife who's not so easy on the eyes anymore.  WoW is a hot 18-year-old coed who's tight as a drum and ready to rumble. <br />
<br />
If hardcore raiders up and leave for WoW, then there's no one to &quot;beta&quot; test content anymore, and SoE won't know what complete and total crap their expansions are until the slowpokes get to end of the rainbow.  <br />
Name the last expansion without major bugs at the end-game.  Maybe Scars of Velious?  VT was bugged. PoP (mostly Rathe) was bugged. Most of GoD was a horrible debacle from entry raiding up into Tacvi.  Anguish is still &quot;under construction.&quot;  If the hardcore guilds leave, the &quot;family&quot; guilds will just replace them eventually and the cycle will begin again.<br />
<br />
Everquest now has a persistent pattern of broken content for about 3 years.  I doubt that will change in several expansions.  They never test anything.  It's always one extreme or the other, too easy or too hard.  <br />
<br />
And for the non-raider WoW offers much more than Everquest ever could.  I've done 5 quests in my Everquest career: Coldain shawl (from Velious), Blood of Nadox, Stoicism, epic 1 and epic 1.5.  Everquest made me HATE questing, because the rewards NEVER equalled the time and hassle of the quest itself, if it was even working.  When I did epic 1.0, it was broken and when I did the Stoicism quest, it was broken.  In my few days of playing WoW, I've probably done 30-40 quests whose rewards were equal to the time put in.  And none of the quests were broken.  <br />
<br />
I can't see how Everquest has any allure for non-raiders.  It's just killing xp mobs and getting spells and mediocre gear.  If I didn't raid in Everquest, I would have left the game 2 years ago.  I can't see how non-raiders defend the game so much, when it yields so little for them.<br />
<br />
The only way EQ can save face is by releasing two consecutive expansions that have no major bugs in the major quests, the quests actually have a proper time vs. reward balance, and the end game zone and raids in general are well tested and not constantly changing every other patch.</div></div><hr />

If you mean enhancing your virtual cockadoodledo so you can get on eqrankings, then I doubt you represent the majority of players.  I think most play this game to develop relationships and work toward a common goal. <br />
<br />
You think all those guilds that flagged people to get the 140hps 140mana items are happy now they drop in unkeyed zones off trash mobs? They spent months working thier ass off to get those items and now they are out of date. That sure isn't my definition of fun.<br />
<br />
You contradict yourself constantly.  In one sentence you talk about loot then the next you dismiss loot completely.  <br />
<br />
I like seeing a guildie upgrade a 50hp item to a good 150hp item cause of my hard work. If our effort means nothing and the gear just gets better, you efforts yield nothing. why would you work three months to get a 100hp item when in 30 days its not going to be a good item? I am exaggerating the time frames of course, but that is to prove a point.<br />
<br />
Again, completely contradicting yourself.  In one sentence you say how you like seeing people get better gear, then you turn around the very next sentence and say getting new gear is pointless, and only later to go on to completely villianize anyone that likes progression based on loot.<br />
<br />
Another problem with your arguement.  You can't exaggerate the time frame to prove a point, because the time frame is completely relavent to the entire discussion.  Items for most people, even in top end guilds, last for 3-6 months or more.  Hell I still wear a cloak that I looted almost 2 years ago.  Do you think the majority of people in this game would want to play if their gear remained the same forever?  Of course not.  They want to upgrade their gear at a reasonable pace.  Exaggerating the time frame that people upgrade their gear in doesn't prove your point, it just makes you look silly.<br />
<br />
I'd love to continue the debate but you can't even seem to come up with a clear stance on something.  Every other paragraph you flip flop to a completely different view.   Pick a stance on something and stick with it, because in one breath you are all for getting better gear over time, then the next breath you are against it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Speaking only for myself here, I like to follow the progression the way its designed. I look and jump-skipping to be similar to using &quot;cheat codes&quot; in single player or console games. The FF series has great stuff at the end, but you have to play through the minor, medium, decent, good stuff to get it. Thats how I look at EQ. Joining some CoA-Tactvi guild having not even done Time is kind of a joke. Putting on Qvic armor over Ornate is like typing in &quot;GODMODE&quot; to me. <br />
<br />
I did VT a solid 2 years after Luclin came out. Was EP flagged probably 18 months post-PoP. But you know what? I was there for my guilds 2nd Emp kill (didnt have key for first, grrr, stupid Comm 2). I was there for almost ALL my guilds PoP progression mobs. I was there for the 5 failed RZ attempts that make you want to pull your hair out. I was there the night we FIRST took down Aten ha Ra and you know what, IT FELT GREAT! I dindt care that it was 2 year old armor, it was an AWESOME feeling. <br />
<br />
Now we are in Time, working on the Ikkys. Did multiple EP gods, still do. Watched us learn the Zek brothers, the little T5 tricks. Sure we used some spoilers to help us with strats, but we DID the leg work ourselves. Reading &quot;this is how its done&quot; and executing that strat are very very different things. <br />
<br />
I am playing a game. If this was Baldurs Gate 3, I am sure I could look on the net and find some guy who finished it faster than me too see what gears and fights I will be doing next. I could probably find a cheat code to skip right to that +6 Dragon Sword of Uber Pepperoni. But thats takes SO much away from the overall satisfaction of PLAYING the game. Hell if you dont want to play, go hit Player Auctions and buy yourself a Qvic-Tactvi equiped character. You'll be all set then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Agree with Blazz.  We just downed Fenin Ro last week and I was stoked.  Kinda felt disappointed that he was so easy, but he is the easiest of the Ele gods and we farmed the living hell outa VT.  Wonder how the raid would have gone if more than 40% of the force wasn't level 68+ though...</div></div><hr />

This is sorta how I felt when we took Quarm with a large part of our people 68+. We had previously failed him twice pre-OoW, but this time, it was a cake walk. Still, though, got tremendous amount of satisfaction killing this 2 year-old end game boss. You cant replace that feeling with all the loots in the world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thats why I so hate when they add new levels.  It just tarnishes older content for people.  I really wish a game would stick to one max level and stay there.  That way older encounters are at least somewhat close.  Sure, they'll add in some AA and things that make it easier, but not nearly as easy as levels do.</div></div><hr />

&quot;You contradict yourself constantly. In one sentence you talk about loot then the next you dismiss loot completely. &quot;<br />
<br />
These statements are not contridictory in any fashion, they are two seperate ideas about the game.  They are not linked to any one point of view, just a broad statement for a wide general audience.  Notice the key phrase at the end of statement one that says &quot;I think most players&quot;. I made reference to a common goal, not &quot;MY&quot; goal.  Its not my personal feeling its a general consesus.  Again, I am not here to argue with anyone I am sharing my point of view and you would like to turn it into a personal vendetta.  Another reason I referred to a possible ego issue with you.  ;) <br />

Again, you are limiting my points and only pulling out content that fits your arguement.  Just read the post for what it is, a simple dislike of the linear progression.  I admire you defending the game, however it doesn't make you right.  I have put just as much time into the game as you and these are my current thoughts.  I said getting gear for others in the guild is wonderful because we work toward a common goal.  I like helping other people and that is the fun part of this game for me.  I scorned the implementation of how that goal is achieved.  You are not reading everything clearly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Another problem with your arguement. You can't exaggerate the time frame to prove a point, because the time frame is completely relavent to the entire discussion.

<br />
The beauty about this post is that I can exaggerate time and I did to make a clear point.  Not to win an arguement, but to exaggerate my thoughts on a topic.  If you want to evaluate my post just to pick a apart the details than more power to you.  I am posting to promote ideas and advancement in the game because I want it to last.  I am not debating the validity of your arguement because I don't see this as an arguement.  We are fighting the same battle, which is to enjoy a game that we have both put a good amount of time into.  You want to just play it a different way.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd love to continue the debate but you can't even seem to come up with a clear stance on something. Every other paragraph you flip flop to a completely different view.

<br />
This was never a debate, your flawed interpretation of my ideas have caused you some internal strife.   This is not my work, but the work of the debil!!  I hope you are picking up what I am laying down!!!</div></div><hr />
