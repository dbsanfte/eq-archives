<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for folks with some experience partnering a Shaman with a beastlord.  <br />
<br />
Whats the best way for this pair to work.  Slow mobs regen the pet and Beastlord and let them tank? Or is there a better tactic?  Will our dots pull the mob off the warder/Beastlord?  Do you find the pet is taking a share of xp?<br />
<br />
Inquiring shamans want to know:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pets only take xp from a group if they outdamage the entire group. If they do, they take a share of the xp as though they were a member of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It may, amazingly enough, be more efficient for you to melee alongside the BST and Warder. Seems there is a fun aggro control VI added, With just a pet and master in melee range the mob will ALWAYS target the master. Add a third into the melee, pet or player, and the normal aggro rules apply, and the usual damage/spell aggro controls who gets hit.<br />
<br />
The Warder procs upto the 53rd level one, except Spirit of Wind, are Taunt effects and will hold the mobs attention except against an actual Taunting player. The 54 and 56 procs are detaunts and try to keep the Warder lower on the hate list.<br />
<br />
 Yes DoTs can pull the Mob off the warder and depending on relative levels the pair may have a problem getting the mob off you. Not sure what level you are but stacking DoT's and Slows can pull off of almost anyone, especially if you try to..) Mobs really hate the disease counters the Slows add now, couple that with a DoT or 4 and the mob is all yours...<br />
<br />
 In general the BST's spells are just shaman spells so yours will overright most all of his buffs and slows. Only Spiritual Purity(+3 Mana/HP regen) at 58/59(?) is unique to the BST.  (some reports that Savagery, avatar like, stacks WITH Avatar have been heard, cannot confirm these)</div></div><hr />
