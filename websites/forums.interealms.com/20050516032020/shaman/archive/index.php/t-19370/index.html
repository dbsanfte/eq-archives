<br />
Anyway, there was a poll about a month ago concerning the rep system, and, after seeing that post counts were ganked on The Glade, do you think the same should be done here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no<br />
<br />
who cares how many posts you have.  I used to look at this board every day and only have recently started reading it frequently (mostly I stopped cause of the constant whining but picked up cause i've been bored a bit recently).  I don't post alot but I don't really care if I have 2k posts next to my name of 15.  It really doesn't mean anything in the long run.  So, on that note, I don't see why it should be taken out.  I wish that my guild had a post count, if only to see how much of a loser I am from posting so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We all know post count signifies intelligence!<br />
<br />
Why look at Litgruv! :P<br />
<br />
Edit: 420 baby! Boo-yah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Honestly, my &quot;Joined: December 1999&quot; is more important to me (even though I've actually been a member longer....dates didn't follow over from Max's place :))<br />
<br />
Post count &lt;&gt; knowledge<br />
Post count = affinity for reading one's own babble :)<br />
<br />
<br />
 For those non-coder/non-programmer types &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot; means &quot;does not equal&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Now that my ISP is behaving somewhat again, I can continue with my original message, heh.<br />
<br />
I pretty much feel the same way, Valsuvious.  A person's message should speak louder than his/her numbers.  One benefit post counts do bring, however, is the ability to better identify older/more prolific board members (of course there are always going to be post fluffers and senior trolls, but they are in the minority).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm just throwing the question out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like the total post count.  Although, for anyone to pay any attention to number of posts, as a basis for shaman knowledge could be a mistake.<br />
<br />
Slamdooley</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Post count is meaningless.  Keep it, toss it... Doesn't matter either way.<br />
<br />
If you're foolish enough to believe that post count=knowledge, then I pity you for all the bad advice you're going to take to heart. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think maybe folks do pay too much attention to post counts, but it is a way for a new reader to the board to see who has been around like the membership date Val mentions.  This is my second or third Crucible membership so the date and count don't always show who is new and who has been around.  I first registered with the site when Mung was the moderator.<br />
<br />
In a perfect world the reader should be able figure out if the post and the poster have merit by the content of the post, but even some thoughtful veterans of the board have off days. By and large a real jerk wont last on the board too long.  There have been folks in the past who were a real storehouse of information but they here just meaner than a snake and abused folks.  It always seems that these folks eventually run afoul of the Mods and get their loincloth in a bunch and are on their way.  My point is you can bet that folks with extemely high post counts and membership dates have more good points than bad or they would have gotten the cold shoulder and left by now.<br />
<br />
I kind of see the post count as a &quot;how long have these guys been tolerating this jerk&quot; gauge.</div></div><hr />
