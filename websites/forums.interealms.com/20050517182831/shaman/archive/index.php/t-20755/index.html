<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, here's the disclaimer.  I've had some requests to write this up.  Some will agree, some will disagree.  I figured I'd post it here and see what responses I get so I can do some editing before I post it to the SoE boards and let the flame fest begin.  If you don't want to see another rant/&quot;shaman need help!&quot; thread, don't read.  This one is really long, too.  It's also fairly blunt in terms of talking to the developers.  While I hate to take an adversarial position, they apparently ignore everything else.  The following post tends to be fairly blunt in places.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here it is:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, for whatever reason, I had a few people write emails to me to ask me to write something on the condition of the shaman class.  Keep in mind that I’m speaking for myself at the moment.  If you agree, feel free to post and say so.  If you disagree, likewise feel free to post and say so.  I will, however, make a caveat to the invitation to post: if you are not level 65, AND played in the elemental planes or through the mountain trials (vexd and tipt) in GoD or above, this post probably isn’t going to apply to you.  For the purposes of this summary, I intend to focus on the high(er)-end shaman.  So . . . here goes.<br />
<br />
Where do shaman currently stand?  For the most part, in a state of forlorn confusion.<br />
<br />
The developers made a brief review of our healing hell, and responded by making a few cosmetic changes.  Since the changes were made, SoE has, in usual fashion, gone radio silent and refused to answer any questions as to whether they are looking at shaman in any further capacity, or whether we are now ‘balanced.’  Hence the state of confusion.  The forlorn part will probably become more evident as I go on.  I’m going to break the following analysis down into several areas: healing, debuffing, buffing, mana regeneration, and DPS.<br />
<br />
HEALING:<br />
<br />
After weeks of shaman screaming, the devs finally analyzed healing for the shaman and seemed to come to the conclusion that we were lacking.  Some changes were enacted.  Our useless DoT in GoD was changed to a direct heal for 1550.  Our heal over time spells were upgraded.<br />
<br />
Rytan, the SoE guy in charge of spells, posted a couple of times on the shaman forum.  Apparently SoE had a vision in regards to healing percentages.  Briefly, he said:<br />
<br />
With the new Daluda:<br />
<br />
for the same comparative HP/second as the PoP heals:<br />
Supernal Light: 100%<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 64%<br />
Daluda's Mending: 47%<br />
<br />
[As an aside, the above is a little misleading.  I think Rytan misspoke in his post.  Daluda’s is 47% of the GoD cleric heal Holy Light, not 47% of Supernal light, so shaman are stuck back where they were in the beginning of PoP (pre-mitigation).]<br />
<br />
The result being, shaman and druids are pegged to a healing percentage of a cleric.  SoE declined to respond or comment to any questions regarding the base percentages.  Their ‘fix’ to healing was to increase shaman direct healing capacity to pre-GoD levels.  Nonetheless, I would think it should be pretty clear that underlying changes to the game make an occasional re-evaluation of the percentages necessary.<br />
<br />
So, due to underlying changes to the game, the shaman are trying to get the developers to question the percentage heals. Apparently we were pegged at 47% heals at least as far back as the inception of PoP. That was before (a) mitigation, and (b) the change to mob hp vs dps. <br />
<br />
The shaman have been arguing, so far unsuccessfully, that due to the widespread prevalence of slow mitigation the dev's need to examine the base percentage of heals for high level heals. More specifically, since a lot of mobs now mitigate our slow to probably 37.5% (formerly 75%!), that shaman heals need to be bumped up to compensate. Our initial estimate of a raw number was around 1800 hp base heal.  We got 1550.  On it’s face, the additional 250hp seems trivial, but when combined with focus effects and AAs, and chain healing, that 250hp starts to make a big difference after 2-3 casts.<br />
<br />
So anyway, mobs mitigate. Their dps does not go down as far, but our healing ability does not compensate. No other healing class is balanced against slow (I discount the minor heals that BLs get), so it only really affects shaman. Thus, while mitigation hits all slowing classes, it really double whacks the shaman since our heals remain unchanged. That problem goes back to PoP.<br />
<br />
Now enter GoD, where mobs hit much harder and mitigate, but have less hitpoints. Fights are over faster, so over the course of a fight, mitigated slows, or even bounced slows are of substantially less importance (except to shaman). The difference of 30% slows over the course of a 30 second fight is relatively trivial, especially since most cleric and druid heals contain an 'overheal' component--heals above and beyond the hp the tank has. GoD reduces that overheal component a lot, so much so that many cleric/druid heals hit for full efficiency. To some extent, that makes druids and clerics MORE efficient, though at the cost of some anxiety since you have larger spikes in hp! Pity the hapless tanks!<br />
<br />
Shaman heals, on the other hand, are effectively further hindered. We were already healing for full efficiency due to a lower raw hp healing amount per cast.  Now we have a situation where we are penalized for slow by having a lower percentage heal, then we're given a less efficient heal than the other classes in terms of mana cost, then we're trying to heal more damage with a heal that, because it almost always hits for full, can't get any more efficient, over the course of fights that further trivialize the impact of slow by being of such short duration. Slow saves us mana on healing over the course of a longer fight. Short duration fights, especially since we have to slow at the beginning just don't prevent as much damage.<br />
<br />
Shaman were designed as an endurance class, and that concept is no longer relevant in GoD. Slow makes healing more efficient over the course of long fights. Thus, by slow, shaman add endurance to the healers' mana. Over the short term, we don't really save them ANY mana--they still have to heal once or twice. Over the long term, we can save them a TON of heals.<br />
<br />
Our heal over time spells are nice.  I’m glad they got improved.  They allow shaman to help the main healers save mana during downtime.  However, HEAL OVER TIME SPELLS DO NOT ALLOW FOR BURST DPS MANAGEMENT.  I can’t stress that enough.  Heck, let me repeat it for emphasis.<br />
<br />
HEAL OVER TIME SPELLS DO NOT ALLOW FOR BURST DPS MANAGEMENT. <br />
HEAL OVER TIME SPELLS DO NOT ALLOW FOR BURST DPS MANAGEMENT.<br />
HEAL OVER TIME SPELLS DO NOT ALLOW FOR BURST DPS MANAGEMENT.<br />
HEAL OVER TIME SPELLS DO NOT ALLOW FOR BURST DPS MANAGEMENT.<br />
HEAL OVER TIME SPELLS DO NOT ALLOW FOR BURST DPS MANAGEMENT.<br />
<br />
It’s something that is apparently ignored by SoE devs.  You guys could give us a spell that does 500/tic for 10 minutes, and it won’t help with burst dps in a level of content like later GoD trials.  It’s NOT average healing power that rules in an engagement.  If we can’t heal a spike of mob dps, the tank is dead and so is the party.  If (when) my cleric gets heal agro, I don’t have 3 seconds to cast Breath, 2.2 recast time, 3.5 seconds to cast Daluda (if I had it!).  I have to chain cast tnargs/daluda and pray I can keep him alive long enough to get heal agro or long enough for the tank to pull agro.<br />
<br />
Druids are in better shape, but I think they need to be looked at, too.  Honestly, I think the game mechanics have changed sufficiently to REQUIRE developers to revisit the healing percentages that were implemented before GoD dps and before slow mitigation.  I think it needs to be addressed to something like 100%, 72% and 55%.  Some of the clerics may scream, but hopefully most of them will realize that the changes are mostly to keep THEM alive!  Note: these changes should ONLY be applied to GoD spells, not to prior content spells.  Obviously that won’t prevent people from going back and trivializing new content, but it will help.<br />
<br />
Help us keep our clerics alive!!!!<br />
<br />
DEBUFFING:<br />
<br />
This area has a lot of different opinions.  Shaman seems to have a lot of different view points about it.  Originally, I was pretty indignant about the new slow on test before GoD went live.  14 levels after we got Turgurs, we got a new spell that lasted 1.5 minutes and slowed for 15% LESS (raw) than our level 51 spell.  In short, Balance of the Nihil has a 1.5 second cast time (versus 3 sec on turgurs), -40 MR check (versus none on turgurs), lasts 1.5 minutes (versus 6.5 minutes on turgurs), and slows for 60% (versus 75% on turgurs).  The spells are similar in all other aspects.  Please note, I don’t have this spell so I’m shooting from the hip here.<br />
<br />
What I’m guessing is that Nihil was an attempt to balance the massive DPS of mobs, the need for shaman to resist debuff on inc, and the short life span of mobs.  Again, I haven’t run parses (since I don’t have the spell), but I suspect that the 15% less slow on Nihil is offset by the fact that it gets slowed faster and the mobs die faster.  The net result is probably a fairly close, given a comparison of relative time needed to land the slow averaged over a 30 second engagment window.  Thus, Malos/turgurs on a GoD encounter is probably equivalent to using Nihil on most yard-trash type encounters.  Perhaps someone can parse and confirm.  Still, if that was the intent of Nihil, I still think that the resist check on nihil should be equal to malos.<br />
<br />
[BTW, let me digress a moment.  I’ve mentioned that encounters are faster, and that mobs seem to have less hp, etc.  I don’t know about actual hp on mobs in GoD, but player DPS has gone up, and if mob hp has gone up, it has not gone up by the same percentage as player dps.  The net result is, outside of actual raw mob hp, that mobs die faster than in encounters in previous expansions.  So, if I say average mob hp is down, it’s a relative thing.  I happen to think that raw mob hp was reduced from PoP levels as well, though I may be mistaken.]<br />
<br />
Some shaman have offered opinions to the effect that they think we should get AAs or slow abilities that enhance our slows.  Some suggestions have included a passive AA that vastly increases a chance to slow, or increases a slow by a random percentage, or perhaps just reduces mitigation by one level.  In terms of a class-defining ability (which we currently lack—will be discussed more below), I think that an AA that reduces mitigation by a single level would be very nice without being totally overpowering.  Thus, if a mob were normally ‘slightly’ slowed, with the AA it would be ‘partially’ slowed.  I think that might make a shaman a more viable alternative to some of the other slowing classes.  As it stands there are a lot more reasons to invite an enchanter or BL over a shaman if a group needs a slower.  They bring a LOT more to the table than a shaman does.<br />
<br />
Some other shaman have advanced ideas regarding a melee debuff like Cripple (level 53 spell) that reduces damage in some fashion—ie, lowers max hit, further reduces rampage, etc.  While I think it’s a good idea in principle, I think it serves to further complicate a tough balancing situation.  Honestly, if shaman could reduce mob dps by 5% with a new spell line, then obviously the developers for end-game content would need to just up mob dps by 5%.  Essentially, it’s like a whole new slow line, with all the balance/mitigation problems therein.  It would also make shaman a required class for certain high damage raids—which is not necessarily a good thing.  Making classes REQUIRED for encounters is bad.<br />
<br />
I honestly think that most of the shaman view debuffing as a problem mostly because it was widely regarded as our class defining ability, around which we were balanced, and it was effectively nerfed with the implementation of mitigation.  When mitigation went live, the fact that shaman were completely ignored was disheartening, to say the least.<br />
<br />
BUFFING:<br />
<br />
Shaman buffs have become a joke.  Elemental level and above players often have ability stats maxxed.  Shaman have exactly 2 buffs that are of any use at the moment: focus and ferine avatar.  I’m going to guess that fully a third of shaman spells are stat buffs.  One third of our spell line is now useless.<br />
<br />
Beastlords, a class who also slows, does more dps than shaman, and has mana regen buffs and AAs, also has attack buffs in excess of our avatar—so avatar isn’t all that useful either.<br />
<br />
Our one spell that’s still useful is Focus of Souls, and it’s useful not for its stat buffs, but solely for its hit point component.<br />
<br />
I think I’m not amiss in saying that shaman used to be the kings of melee buffs (not hp—that’s the cleric province—but passive buffs to increase the dps of our melee).  We had the stat buffs and attack buffs (something only bards and shaman had at one point).  That has apparently fallen completely by the wayside. We basically don’t add ANY dps to the group passively.  Get an enchanter and/or a BL and a group will be in much better shape because they can add a great deal more raw dps (melee for BLs or a pet for the enchanter), and also bring a great deal more to the table in terms of mana regeneration, or other class-specific lines (ferocity, haste, crowd control, etc.)<br />
<br />
Some suggestions were advanced that I think make tremendous sense.  How about changing some of our useless stat buffs into something a little different?  For instance, one of the best suggestions I saw was to change the stat buffs into buffs that enhance effects like those on time level and above gear.  Give us a spell line that provides small increases to Strikethrough, combat effects, shielding and the like.  +5 or +10 to each of those wouldn’t be overpowering by any stretch of the imagination, but WOULD constitute a buff that melee would seek out.<br />
<br />
[Side note on buffs—why is it that, after years of shaman grumbling, the dev’s finally fixed our (now useless) stat buffs so that group spells did not buff for LESS than the single version spells, and yet they felt the need to reintroduce the same irritating-as-hell concept with our group haste?  SLTW (single) 60% haste.  Talisman of Alacrity (group) 50% haste.  Hello?]<br />
<br />
One other thing I’d like to note in passing.  Raising the stat cap is not the answer at this point.  Players are buff limited, and there just is not room for stat buffs anymore even if they did anything.  The return on stat buffs is marginal compared to the other buffs available.  A melee class is better off with another raw attack buff or hp buff, or resist buff than a stat buff.  It’s time for SoE to accept that stat spells are useless in end game, and move to a &lt;gasp&gt; new concept.<br />
<br />
MANA REGENERATION:<br />
<br />
This is actually a 2 part issue: mana regeneration and spell costs.  Shaman are viewed as a mana powerhouse, and, apparently as a consequence, all of our spells are extremely mana inefficient.  This exacerbates issues like healing where we are already very weak.<br />
<br />
Shaman are good at mana regen.  I challenge anyone to say differently (and mean it!).  Unfortunately, what everyone seems to ignore is that our mana regen comes at the cost of everything else.  We cannot cast, move, etc. while getting mana back. What does that mean, exactly?  It means we’re in trouble in GoD.<br />
<br />
Recall that fights are extremely short in GoD.  That means a very short engagement horizon.  Shaman DoTs are predicated on relatively low DPS mobs and long duration models (further discussed in the DPS section).  On mobs that die prior to the expiration of a single DoT, DoTs become a horribly mana inefficient means of damage.  So, heretofore, we could DoT and then cannibalize to recover mana.  With the shorter fights in GoD, now shaman have to move to our horribly inefficient nuke/DD type spells to land something before the mob dies.  While we are nuking, we do not have our DoT down-time to cannibalize . . . hence our mana regen goes to crap.  The short term nature of the fights have effectively neutralized the DoT as a viable method of dps.  Nukes do not have a passive component to allow us to use active mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
As with the other section analyses, the fundamental game changes in GoD, namely changing the game to a faster-paced, higher dps scenario, has crippled the shaman in particular.  Since our spells cost more mana to cost for the result on average, the reduction of time to cannibalize is doubly penalizing.<br />
<br />
The dev’s got the right idea on our new cannibalize spell, Chaotic Pain.  Unfortunately, by making it an ancient spell that no one has even seen, it does NOTHING to help balance the class.<br />
<br />
DPS:<br />
<br />
Wow.  Where to start.  I would argue that effective shaman dps is the lowest of any class out there, with clerics a close second.  Clerics may shoot me for saying this, but as the primary healing class in Norrath by a HUGE margin (see healing discussion), they shouldn’t be high dps classes anyway.  Their niche is healing.  Shaman don’t seem to have a niche.<br />
<br />
The reason I say that shaman have the lowest EFFECTIVE dps is that we actually look pretty good on paper.  Shaman have a very high potential DPS.  Someone can pull out a spreadsheet and plug in DoTs and nukes and get some insane dps numbers.  For instance, just assume you can stack Bane, Blood, Ultor, and then alternate Tears and Velium Strike.  I dunno what that would work out to in terms of average dps, but there would be tics of probably in excess of 400dps.  Looks pretty sweet, right?<br />
<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
It’s just not possible to sustain that level of damage for a shaman.  Forget mana concerns for a minute, and ignore the fact that our spells are designed to cost more to compensate for our active mana regen.  So far, I have found exactly ONE tank that, in very limited circumstances, can hold agro if I cast all that.  Want to know the circumstances?  Fighting an unslowable named that quads, and then only AFTER the tank in question has used the furious (reposte) discipline.  The tank also has heavily augmented agro weapons with anger procs, and horrifying visage by an enchanter.  So, they can only do it on named mobs every 45 minutes.  Not so useful.<br />
<br />
Why is it that a wizard can blow off 30% of a mobs hitpoints in a single crit of 6000+ damage, and yet I can pull agro off a taunting warrior with a spell that does 320 hp damage a TIC.  Agro on DoTs is REALLY messed up.  Hey, Mr Dragon, look!  Who should you attack?  The wizzie that just blew two of your limbs off, or the shaman that just gave you a very mild case of gas?<br />
<br />
Frankly, as bad as DoT agro is, the whole point is still kind of moot.  The more fundamental changes to the pace of the game make DoTs useless and obsolete anyway.  In a competent group (one that has a legitimate reason to be in GoD), mobs die in 35 seconds anyway.  Less if there is an enchanter pet in the group.  Ignoring slow and recast times, our DoTs don’t have time to run on a mob if we cast on inc.  They stink for mana efficiency in GoD.  DoTs are obsolete.  Without re-tuning them to run in 30 seconds, or 24 seconds, they are a waste of a spell slot.  Another factor completely ignored by the developers is a resist check.  Why is it that other classes get -100 and -200 resist checks on their DoTs, but, even if we malos/malosini we can't even get close to that.  None of our DoTs have resist modifiers, including Bane with a 30 second refresh if it bounces.<br />
<br />
Naturally some will immediately fall back to the argument that shaman can solo.  My response?  So what?  Why don’t you go solo in GoD?  Our DoTs are designed to be slow.  We can kill larger mobs, and tough ones, but we do it VERY slowly.  It’s not a viable substitute for grouping.  A decent (not even good) group will probably get at least 60% more exp than a soloing shaman.  This is doubly true after solo experience was nerfed.  Soloing is something people can do, but what’s the point?  I challenge anyone to tell me that the game is designed around soloing.<br />
<br />
So, accept for a moment that DoTs aren’t worth the mana to cast them.  We can’t close with a mob since they’ll beat the tar out of us (shaman melee discussed below), so what’s left?  Pets and nukes.<br />
<br />
A lot of time has been devoted to our pets.  They stink.  They stink like week old goat cheese left out in the hot sun.  The green-con 65 SK (same as the level 49 necro pet) pet will own our blue-con shaman pet before buffs.  If both pets are buffed (self buffs by both classes), the shaman pet sometimes gets the SK pet with enrage.  The shaman pet is essentially a speed bump.  Unbuffed it does 12 dps (blue con mob.  Your numbers will vary with types of mobs and AC of mobs).  If given 2 weapons and buffed (including Ferine Avatar every 6 minutes), it can do up to 37 dps.<br />
<br />
Why is it that the shaman pet, of all the pets out there, requires shaman to give our pets weapons to make it dual-wield?  Weapons are not stackable.  Nor are they light.  Our pets have all the stamina (BUFFED) to take about 2 seconds of beating from GoD or elemental or hard LDoN mobs.  They are going to die in a couple hour expedition.  Probably several times.  In an difficult group encounter, it’s not uncommon to go through 2 full backpacks of trash weapons.  Carrying resist gear, and other necessary stuff doesn’t leave much room.  There is NO reason for not making the shaman pet dual wield.  It will still do crap for dps, but at least it’s not an irritant.<br />
<br />
Shaman have been annoyed about that for years.  The pet is nothing new.  We have had to carry weapons for our stupid pet for 26 levels.  Why?!?  We’re not even a pet class.  Our pet is at best a low level DoT.  It isn’t even a significant factor in our dps.  Even SK pets get innate dual wield.  SKs are even less of a pet class than shaman!<br />
<br />
Okay, so DoTs aren’t viable anymore, our pets really suck, so what’s left for our dps?  Nukes, or direct damage spells.  Shaman have 3 spells for DD at higher levels.  Tears (a poison rain), Velium Strike (VS), and Spear of Torment (spear).<br />
<br />
Tears: 3 waves of 650<br />
VS: 925 base damage<br />
Spear: 675 base damage<br />
<br />
Tears is a rain spell.  That means if you have mezzed mobs, or rooted mobs, it can’t be used.  Rains are also coded differently.  Spear is a poison based nuke, like tears.  Neither has a resist modifier.  Comparisons between waves of Tears and a like number of casts of Spear show a marked increase in resists on Tears.  Current estimates are that rains are coded to have a 33% resist rate (as in 1 of your waves won’t hit the mob).  While we’re at it, why do rains spells still hit the caster?  A rain will ONLY hit four targets.  Thus, 4 targets once, 3 targets once and 1 target a second time, 2 targets twice, or 1 target 3 times (all ignoring resists, of course).  HOWEVER, even if I hit four mobs once, if I’m too close, I will still get hit by THREE waves that apparently don’t touch the mobs.  Nonetheless, tears is our most efficient nuke!!!<br />
<br />
VS takes (with refresh) just over TEN seconds to cast.  Chain nuking with our largest nuke, a shaman cannot even get up to 100dps.  (925/10=92.5 dps).  Spear, through faster, only hits for 675 and is even less mana efficient than VS.  None of tears, VS, or spear is what you would call mana efficient.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, shaman dps is poor.  Very poor.  Our DoTs are useless now.  Our melee and pets are a joke at high levels. That leaves only DD spells, and there isn’t a caster or priest class out there that can’t out nuke us.<br />
<br />
Melee has gotten silly.  It’s not worth it to get within melee range of a mob post Tier 2 in PoP, to say nothing of hard LDoNs or GoD.  Shaman, despite our original design as battle priests don’t melee.  Clerics, Norrath’s primary healing class, gets the bash skill up to 200, yet the ‘battle priests’ aka shaman max out at bash of (1) IF they are a large race.  Iksar, frogluks and vah shir don’t even get bash of (1).  Don’t misunderstand.  Bash would be very very nice for interrupts, since shaman have no active skill for interrupting casters (if we’re really lucky dog dog can do it for us), but it’s not going to balance our dps.  Shaman cannot afford to close in with a mob unless a real tank has got its attention.  Improving our melee is not the answer to dps.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
<br />
Some of the boards wonder why the shaman have been screaming bloody murder recently.  Hopefully the above will explain why.  Right now, our class might as well not exist.  The sum total of skills that we bring to the table include (a) malos (so someone else can do more dps to the mob since we can’t do any), and (b) focus (for 544 hp).  Note that mages can cast malosinia as well, so malos isn't all that important.<br />
<br />
Need a healer?  For god’s sake don’t get a shaman if it’s something even moderately difficult—you need a cleric or a druid.<br />
<br />
Need DPS?  Get a monk, wizard, rogue, ranger, shadowknight, or heck, ANY class over a shaman.  We can’t nuke, and we’ll suck the healers dry on mana if we DoT.  Even if the tank can hold agro, we’ll be OOM in next to no time trying to DoT mobs that last 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Need a slower?  Take an enchanter—they can mana regen, slow, charm pets, haste, and crowd control.  Or take a beastlord—they have ferocity, a heck of a lot more dps than shaman, have mana regen spells, and can also buff and slow.  With mitigation on almost every difficult mob, the differences between our respective slows is probably under 5%.<br />
<br />
Every problem I've noted is just as prevelant in raid situations, if not more so.  We can't even heal a group from an AE in GoD.  Raid mobs are almost all flagged immune to slow.  Our DoTs are so high agro that we can't afford to cast more than 1 because the consequences of turning a mob are disasterous.  Most raids, my main function is to focus rez'd folks.<br />
<br />
Right now, shaman have no purpose as a class.  We bring nothing to the table that another class can’t do better.  Usually much better when other skills are considered.  At the last fan fair (a couple of days ago), Rytan commented that shaman slow for 5% more and that was a huge difference in dps.  I’m guessing he must have been drunk.  5% isn’t a huge difference, especially mitigated.  Don’t believe me?  Ask a cleric if they notice a difference with a 5% slow when the mobs die in 30 seconds.  Now imagine the mob mitigates (hint: it makes even LESS of a difference).  If 5% is such a huge difference, why aren’t the healing percentages 100, 95, and 90% for clerics, druids and shaman respectively?  Since enchanters can haste for 70%, why can’t shaman haste for 65%?  Perhaps 5% isn’t such a huge difference after all when it comes to class balance.  Unless, of course, it requires a developer to actually re-examine something.  Then it’s huge.<br />
<br />
I do not exaggerate when I say that fully 30% of the end game shaman I know have already quit.  Don’t believe me?  Go to one of the shaman boards and start reading good-bye posts.  One third of my guild’s shaman have already left.  I know 4 others from other high-end guilds on my server that are considering it.  Most have left EQ entirely, but a couple have switched to different classes.  If SoE’s goal is to phase out the shaman class, they are doing a good job.<br />
<br />
In closing, I’d like to propose a challenge to the developers.  Take a party through Trials 7-9.  To keep things fair, make it an elemental plane level party—you can equip them with anything from the elemental planes (not time), so that they are completely decked out in elemental gear (no cheating and making an all-quarm team).  One member of your team must be a shaman.  I recommend doing it all the way through twice.  First, try it with no warrior (hint: you really hosed the knight classes in this expansion, too).  Second, try it with only one other healing class besides the shaman.<br />
<br />
Heck, while I’m at it, I’ll deliver a second challenge to the developers.  Try responding to one of our balance threads and open up a discussion.  [Hint: posting “Hi!” does not constitute a response or a discussion.]<br />
<br />
So . . . though delivered in jest, Brenlo’s question is right to the point.  What IS a shaman?  We’d certainly like to know, too.  Right now, a shaman is a waste of pixels in end-game EQ.<br />
<br />

<br />
P.S.  Caveat:  <br />
Let me stress something (though I'm sure most of the trolls will (deliberately) miss this).  SOME (NOT ALL) OF THESE FACTORS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO MAKE THE SHAMAN A VIABLE CLASS AGAIN.  THE FACTORS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED ARE DEPENDENT ON THE SoE VISION OF SHAMAN.  FIXING ALL OF THE HIGHLIGHTED PROBLEMS WOULD BE OVERPOWERING.  WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR EVERYTHING MENTIONED TO BE FIXED--PICK A COUPLE OF CATEGORIES.  Since we don't have a clue what the SoE vision of shaman is, we can't suggest fixes in line with the vision.  Thus, I tried to summarize most of our problems.<br />
<br />
It's time, and past time to come to a decision on shaman, SoE.  What is our class role?  If it's only to be carried by other classes, tell us now so I can cancel my subsciption with the hordes of other shaman already doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Druids are in better shape, but I think they need to be looked at, too. Honestly, I think the game mechanics have changed sufficiently to REQUIRE developers to revisit the healing percentages that were implemented before GoD dps and before heal mitigation. I think it needs to be addressed to something like 100%, 72% and 55%. Some of the clerics may scream, but hopefully most of them will realize that the changes are mostly to keep THEM alive! Note: these changes should ONLY be applied to GoD spells, not to prior content spells. Obviously that won’t prevent people from going back and trivializing new content, but it will help.<br />
<br />
 I think you meant slow mitigation here.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Won't commetn much on the actual content as I haven't gone past sewers yet, but sounds nice overall.  Since it does go in depth and analyze all our abilities someone is bound to come by and say we are asking to be the best at everything.   I just want to say that since we don't know WHAT area SoE thinks we belong to, we HAVE to analyze all areas that we exist in in order to show that we are lacking in all of them.<br />
<br />
  We don't want the BEST heals, and DPS, and debuffs.  We just want to be COMPETENT, at ONE of them.</div></div><hr />

1) The other DoT classes have several DoTs with an innate resist mod that is much higher than Malos provides<br />
<br />
2) Having to have to cast Malos in order to have the same chance at landing DoTs as a Necro/Druid has using an average DoT(their best have a -130, -200 respectively), is a joke.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One other thing I’d like to note in passing. Raising the stat cap is not the answer at this point. Players are buff limited, and there just is not room for stat buffs anymore even if they did anything. The return on stat buffs is marginal compared to the other buffs available. A melee class is better off with another raw attack buff or hp buff, or resist buff than a stat buff. It’s time for SoE to accept that stat spells are useless in end game, and move to a new concept.<br />
<br />
Raising stat caps is never the answer to the stat buff problem. Raise the cap, the buffs fill that gap for a short period of time. They only fill that gap UNTIL equipment with +stats brings players up to the new stat cap rendering the stat buffs completely useless once again. Stat buffs actual usefulness pre-cap is constantly in debate. However, reaching the cap rendering the buff useless is not. Raising stat caps is only a temporary &quot;fix&quot; to this problem and will continue to remain so. Players will continue to max their stats via gear so that they are not dependent on buffs for any possible performance stats may or may not provide. This will not change no matter how many times the cap is raised.<br />
<br />
Why is it that a wizard can blow off 30% of a mobs hitpoints in a single crit of 6000+ damage, and yet I can pull agro off a taunting warrior with a spell that does 320 hp damage a TIC. Agro on DoTs is REALLY messed up. Hey, Mr Dragon, look! Who should you attack? The wizzie that just blew two of your limbs off, or the shaman that just gave you a very mild case of gas?<br />
<br />
LOL. I quoted this just to let you know this made me laugh.<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, a decent letter that addresses the shaman situation accurately. Our spells have incredible aggro attached to them whether they are a debuff or a damage spell. Even worse is the aggro attached when a spell bounces. I find it funny that a mob is even angrier with me if I fail to debuff it than when I do...it is already PLENTY angry with me when I do debuff it. hehe. <br />
<br />
I've been in the unfortunate situtation where I accidently bounced a Cripple off Tallon Zek (it didn't land) very early on in engagement in a moment of complete idiocy on my part. I don't know what happened. I can't claim to have been drunk at the time.  :D  He turned around from his corner...and it wasn't pretty. Thankfully, after my swift death, the raid got him back in his corner and managed to pull it off, but I still felt horrible about it. However, had that poorly timed Cripple actually landed, chances are Tallon would have been peeved with me but remained on the tank. <br />
<br />
You'd THINK that for roleplaying reasons, Tallon Zek should be MORE irritated with me for actually Crippling him than not managing to do so. You'd think that his overinflated ego would merely mock me for TRYING to Cripple him and failing and punishment for such folly would be to force me to watch him kill my loved ones before destroying me...  :p  Instead, the moron ingores me for my successful debuffs but tries to smite me for not succeeding. Whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Shaman's biggest problem is perception. People still see us as we where in Kurnak. Powerful, effective and highly desired. Problem is due the situation we have been left behind. Our spells have all been made less effective (nukes, heals, dots are all smaller) and less efficient (hps to mana, dmg to mana) than other classes. Shaman get the double work over for game mechanics that no longer work that way.<br />
<br />
Slow is no longer a highly effective way of preventing dmg. Fights are too fast, Mobs mitigate too much and too often. HoT's are no longer even remotely enough to keep anyone up against current mobs dps. Most damaging here seems to be the perception that shaman are the &quot;slowing class&quot; even tho we only hold a small margin on other classes that seems to get even smaller with slow mitigations.<br />
<br />
Our mana regen is no longer far superior. Back in the day there was no FT, No 9, no SD, no ae bard song, no horses. The normal standing regen was c2. C2 + medding was ~40 mana a tick. Shaman regen while using cann 4, the same spell we're all still using today, was ~90 mana a tick or ~115 if you where willing to cann dance. Shaman were well over double that of other players, potentially almost tripple.  Buffs and gear has put the average players mana regen threw the roof compaired to back then. With raid buffs on a horse your now looking at ~100 mana a tick standing there. Shaman can still push that up a bit to ~175 a tick but your still dropping by a significant margin. More importantly tho shaman really don't have time anymore to cann. The same fast fights with little down time that make slows less useful mean less time to actually spend canning for mana.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately verant doesn't seem to recognize that the game has changed under us and still sees us with the same abilities and therefore we should be as the same power level.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Badasc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thank you Chutoi for summing up many shaman issues nicely.  <br />
<br />
The only big flaw I see in this letter is that it mostly applies to single group situations, and does not extend to its logical conclusion in raid settings.  In my opinion, these issues are all present if not exacerbated by raid settings in GoD.  It's getting to the point now that raiding, which is something I have loved ever since I started playing, is now becoming a chore because I honestly can't find useful things to do besides cast focus on the newly rezzed.<br />
<br />
I'm going to try to follow your format to discuss each of the individual issues:<br />
<br />
RAID HEALING<br />
<br />
Healing on raids suffers much the same issues as healing in single groups, except shamans are even worse off.  Mobs in kod'taz routinely hit for 1200+, and raid trash mobs routinely hit for 1800+.  In kod'taz groups we can barely heal a single hit with our base spell tnargs/daluda.  On raids, we can barely heal a single hit with full AA's and a healing focus item.  This means that if someone in our group manages to get aggro even briefly, we cannot keep them alive without a druid or cleric, or 2 other shamans spam healing them.<br />
<br />
So the question becomes, why rely on shaman healing at all?  The answer that I have seen thus far in my guild is that we don't.  Shaman heals are so insignificant that they must be supplemented by the better healers.  The better healers are so much stronger at healing than we are that whatever healing we did simply adds to the overheal component of what they cast.  Or, if our heal lands after their heal, we end up healing for little to no damage, as they have taken care of the brunt of the damage.<br />
<br />
It is disheartening to know that almost no matter how much I heal, I cannot make a difference in whether or not someone with aggro will live.<br />
<br />
Side note: I have not mentioned heals over time, since they have little to no role in raid settings.  In PoP, a shaman could help keep his group up during AE's by keeping heals over time on his group members, and patch healing them as needed.  In GoD, even AE's are far too intense for even 420/tick to make a difference, and we must instead rely solely on spam heals.  If we take the time to cast heals over time on othe people in our group, then they will have lost more HP during the casting time than we have bought them by casting a heal over time on them.<br />
<br />
<br />
RAID DEBUFFING<br />
<br />
Debuffing trash in raids suffers the same issues as debuffing in single groups, but all of the factors are exacerbated.  In a raid, mobs usually die faster than in a single group, so the time spent debuffing is even more in proportion to a mob's life span.  Therefore, even when we land slows, they often only take effect at 50% of a mob's health or lower, causing them to do very little good.  Add mitigation on top of this, and I start to wonder why I slow mobs at all.  The consequences of trying to slow early are even more deadly, since if we get aggro, we are unlikely to survive without major spam healing, fantastic gear, and lucky misses.<br />
<br />
What about boss mob debuffing?  Quite simply, it does not apply.  95% of all boss mobs in GoD that I have seen are immune to slow.  It only takes one shaman 10 seconds into the fight to cripple a mob (if an enchanter doesn't do it), and then we are forced to try to use our inadequate healing or laughable dps to contribute to the raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
RAID MANA REGENERATION<br />
<br />
Shaman mana regeneration has long been a great strength to us, and a great source of envy to other classes.  Because of this, we have been balanced around our mana regeneration.  Above though, Chutoi has shown quite eloquently that shaman mana regeneration is not what it used to be.  <br />
<br />
In a raid setting, the gap between shaman mana regeneration and other classes' mana regeneration decreases considerably, while the gap between the effectiveness of our spells and their spells remains the same.  Chutoi has shown that during combat, we cannot use our active mana regen (cann4), so the only real advantage we have over other casters is cann5 (which though active, requires very little time) and our downtime mana regen.  Downtime mana regen is irrelevant, because if your other casters are not ready with mana, then the raid generally simply waits for a bit until they regen their mana.  <br />
<br />
So cann5 is our only big mana regen booster, and if you work out the numbers including one cast of BoT to repair the damage from cann5, this equates out to about 30 extra mana regen per tick.  Comparing 30 to the 0 that most other casters get may seem very significant, but on a raid, everyone generally has bot9 (8), SD (9), VoQ (18), bard song (20+), horse, ft15, clicky effects, etc.  All of a sudden an extra 30 is much less significant.  It certainly doesn't cover the descrepency between the power of another caster's spells versus our own spells' power.<br />
<br />
A discussion of mana regen on raids is even somewhat moot, because raids in GoD are so fast that mana regen doesn't enter the equation in a big fight.  For trash mobs, you can take your time, so you don't need to worry about mana regen there either.  About the only time our mana regen becomes important is after we are rezzed.  Is quick recovery from dying supposed to be our class defining ability?<br />
<br />
<br />
RAID DPS<br />
<br />
The situation here is pretty much the same as the grouping situation, except on some rare named mobs we have enough time to land a dot.  Unfortunately, our dots are so high aggro, that it's not worth casting more than one dot, as you will inevitably be summoned.  I have cast blood of saryrn and bane on a mob at 80% that I had otherwise not touched and been summoned at around 40% even without the tank dying or anything else strange.  This is roughly 120 dps, which is outdone by pretty much every other player in the guild (save maybe clerics in a CH chain), yet I am the one that is summoned.  The situation is even worse with crit dots, which seem to cause even more aggro than normal dots.  So essentially, on raids, I can cast 1 dot, and then just nuke.  Chutoi has already shown why our nukes are awful, so this is not a particularly great situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I'd like to say that Chutoi's post is fantastic and shows very clearly what the shaman concerns are.  I just wanted to show that these concerns are, at least from my perspective, even worse in a raiding situation.  Please note that I am not asking for shamans to be able to do everything on raids.  I just want to be able to do something that helps the raid along.<br />
<br />
Raids SHOULD be hard, and they should require many different classes to work together to beat them.  They should allow each person on the raid to feel like he's contributing to the whole, and that it would be much tougher for the whole raid to succeed without his contribution.  At this point in the game, I'm having trouble justifying what my contribution is.</div></div><hr />

One thing I wonder is why everyone is so concerned that stat buffs are useless with everyone at the stat cap.  The truth of the matter is that stat buffs have NEVER been worthwhile.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Graal, raising the stat cap is one of the things that has been tossed around and leaked down to us as something to help balance us.<br />

Is quick recovery from dying supposed to be our class defining ability?<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to agree with the above statement. In all fairness, raid mana regeneration is not much of an issue for me as a RAIDING shaman. I have very little to cast that aids the raid, therefore, I don't have much need for mana regen. I ran on full mana an entire raid last night except for one encounter where I was at 40% mana for just a few seconds. I think I hit my canni4 hot key twice, maybe 3 times, and then just let the bard song + buffs do the rest. By the time the next pull was in camp, I was back to FM. (This was NOT a long time for the pull inc, either.)<br />
<br />
The fact is, there were only 2 shaman on the raid last night. My compadre admitted to napping due to boredom. She cast Malos, I cast slow, there was no time to cast a damage spell for either of us. Mob was dead before it landed anyway. So, in essence puller says, &quot;Inc %t&quot;, I hit /assist MT hotkey, cast slow...if there were more than one mob in camp, targetted the adds and slowed it and then had nothing else to do but hit my aggro checking hotkey to see if I could burst a lame heal occasionally...but most times, I had to duck to interrupt it because a druid or cleric heal landed in time to make mine a waste. Maybe I should have wasted the mana on the overheal so I would have had some cannibalizing to do to keep me busy. <br />
<br />
Halfway into the raid decided to do all my slowing with AE slow in hopes that it would bounce on several mobs and anger them before any mezzers could mezz or before the nukers could nuke. The potential for my death was more exciting than the lack of tasks I actually had. Sadly, I only got summoned once in all of that and I didn't die at all. Some of the wizards had some fun dying though. When they realized how &quot;controlled&quot; the whole raid was, they upped the ante and managed to get their mage counterparts to AE nuke the hell out of everything just for the sake of making it more exciting. It's nice that they had that option. I tried to join in the fun but my rain spells only landed on me, not the mobs I was aiming at. It was nice to see my health bar go down once in awhile. Almost made me feel like I was involved. Too bad I was injuring myself. C'est la vie.<br />

I disagree with this. First, I think slow is broken beyond repair in GoD.  Even with mitigation and immunity reduced, it just isn't worth it when mobs die so quickly. Second, stat buffs are now officially useful only as crap buffs to protect more important buffs.<br />

To make high end shaman viable in GoD would mean completely rethinking the class and revamping the way we interact with mobs and group/raid members.  Sorry to break the news, but I don't think the developers have the time.</div></div><hr />

I bet the developers wont touch it, because it's as long as it is.  Well, that and they don't have anyone assigned to &quot;vision of a shaman&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Sending this post to SOE as is would cause much more problems for Shaman in general.  While the basic content is sound (mostly), the demeaner and the snideness of many of the remarks is completely unacceptable.  And this is comming from someone who thinks SOE is off it's rocker on where it has taken the shaman class.<br />
<br />
I don't have enough time to go through this completely now, as I am at work, but I will print it out and try doing some rudimentary edits to it to post later when at home.  I know if I were a SOE employee, I wouldn't get much past the first couple paragraphs before I quite reading and threw the rest away.  The way to get your point across and make people understand and change their perception isn't to spew derrogatory comments at them.  <br />
<br />
Also, I notice quite a few &quot;possibly's&quot; and &quot;probably's&quot; thrown in there.  You need to replace ALL of these with hard factual numbers.  Conjecture is irrelevant, thus the reason it is ignored in court cases.  Only hard facts can be used to argue a point, anything less weakens your case and taints your argument.<br />
<br />
I will try to get what I can written up tonight.  As I said, please don't take offense, as I belive your goal and beginnings are strong.  But quite a bit of polish work is needed to make this shine.  It was quite obvious also by reading your post that you were getting more and more &quot;bend out of shape&quot; as you typed.  You must remember to always keep your calm, keep the conversation civil, and be on point, no matter how much the crap stirs deep inside.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">At the last fan fair (a couple of days ago), Rytan commented that shaman slow for 5% more and that was a huge difference in dps.  I’m guessing he must have been drunk.  5% isn’t a huge difference, especially mitigated.  Don’t believe me?  Ask a cleric if they notice a difference with a 5% slow when the mobs die in 30 seconds.  Now imagine the mob mitigates (hint: it makes even LESS of a difference).  If 5% is such a huge difference, why aren’t the healing percentages 100, 95, and 90% for clerics, druids and shaman respectively?  Since enchanters can haste for 70%, why can’t shaman haste for 65%?  Perhaps 5% isn’t such a huge difference after all when it comes to class balance.  Unless, of course, it requires a developer to actually re-examine something.  Then it’s huge.<br />
<br />
I do not exaggerate when I say that fully 30% of the end game shaman I know have already quit.  Don’t believe me?  Go to one of the shaman boards and start reading good-bye posts.  One third of my guild’s shaman have already left.  I know 4 others from other high-end guilds on my server that are considering it.  Most have left EQ entirely, but a couple have switched to different classes.  If SoE’s goal is to phase out the shaman class, they are doing a good job.<br />
<br />
Rytan was refering to mob dps, and the 5% difference between shaman and chanter slows translates into 20% dps. It's 40% when compared to BL slows. That is a significant difference. Those differences fade as you take mitigation into account, particularly if you factor in this 30% exempt idea that has been floating about. We do get Nihil though, which has the potential be much more effective than other class slows in certain situations. As far as haste is concerned, the 10% difference between shaman and chanter hastes works out to 6.25% dps if the melee has no worn haste. At high levels most melee have a 41% haste item, and under those circumstances there is zero difference between the two spells in terms of haste alone due to the haste cap. The primary advantage of the enc spell is the fact that it lasts a long time and has an ATK component, resulting in higher dps that way. Personally I'd welcome making tali 60% haste, since it is group and has twice the duration of SLTW, significantly reducing the PITA factor associated with that spell.<br />
<br />
Regarding dropout rates, most classes have seen significant drop out rates of late, its not something unique to shaman. I'm not so sure that it is anything specifically due to GoD, I get the general impression that many people are just tired of the game and this is a convienient point to fade away. The one thing about GoD though, it is hard challenging content, that has the effect of separating the good from the average players, those with social contacts from the loners. I had originally though that might happen in LDoN, but I was wrong, primarily because LDoN was so easy you could get by with poor play if your gear was good. GoD does seem to be that sort of expansion though. In the context of a guild, the people you see being left out are the ones without the skills, without the gear or without the contacts. You can get by even in the highest guilds like that on raids, but not in single groups.</div></div><hr />

As an FYI, conjecture isn't really ignored in court cases (at least in criminal law).  Nor, for that matter is it ignored in many civil cases.  Just about any case where intent is an element has conjecture.<br />

So far, except in cases where they're actually called to defend themselves from a complete lack of reaction, I have not seen a single response from SoE.  Well reasoned threads have done diddly-squat.  Go back and look at all the threads to which they have responded.  Almost all of them have contained implications of negligence, incompetance, or simply piss-poor customer service.

MOB does 100 DPS<br />
<br />
shaman slows by 75% reducing this to 25 DPS<br />
enchanter slows by 70% reducing this to 30 DPS<br />
beastlord slows by 65% reducing this to 35 DPS<br />
<br />
using the shaman as the baseline, enchanter slows for 5 less DPS; 5 into 25 is 20% less.<br />
<br />
beastlord then slows for 10 less DPS or 10 into 25 which is 40%.<br />
<br />
I still don't agree with this as being anything other than a tricky manipulation of the numbers since 5 or 10 DPS is hardly much difference in the grand scheme of things.  However, with larger numbers, the difference starts to get a little more noticeable (by how much i dont really know).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Tugela,<br />
<br />
You are wrong.  Dead wrong.  I know no other way to say it.<br />
<br />
That 5% difference, even on a mob that doesn't mitigate, doesn't turn into 20% difference in DPS.  I've done the math.  Here's mine:<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the lowdown on that 5% difference. You be the judge of just how &quot;huge&quot; it is. Please note that I am making NO concessions to mitigation. I am assuming that the mob in question is FULLY slowable, which I realize is NOT usually the case in GoD fights. But just to try to find out why we keep hearing about this huge 5%, I'm trying to put the best face possible on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, compute the DPS of a mob when slow lands.<br />
<br />
Mob DPS--&gt; <br />
Slow % 300 500 700 1000 1500<br />
=======================================<br />
75 75 125 175 250 375<br />
70 90 150 210 300 450<br />
65 105 175 245 350 525<br />
<br />
<br />
So, now we have to talk about the fight. Typically a GoD fight is over in 30 seconds. Of that, the first 10 seconds of the fight are needed for a Shaman to land Malos + Slow. So for the first 10 seconds, that mob is doing un-slowed DPS. The damage the mob causes is below.<br />
<br />
First 10 secs <br />
3000 5000 7000 10000 15000<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, after slow lands, damage is mitigated over the final 20 seconds of the fight, giving damage as follows.<br />
<br />
Last 20 secs <br />
75 1500 2500 3500 5000 7500<br />
70 1800 3000 4200 6000 9000<br />
65 2100 3500 4900 7000 10500<br />
<br />
<br />
And for the whole fight, mobs do the following damage<br />
<br />
Total Fight <br />
75 4500 7500 10500 15000 22500<br />
70 4800 8000 11200 16000 24000<br />
65 5100 8500 11900 17000 25500<br />
<br />
<br />
So, the 5% difference between a Shaman slow and a Chanter slow, with a mob doing 1500 DPS is a whopping 1500 HP's . . . basically one cast of Tnargs. Even the difference between a Shaman and his bastard child the BL is only 3000 HP's.<br />
<br />
<br />
That 5% turns into a whopping 6.25% difference in overall damage done.<br />
<br />
Please, I beg of you, share your math with us.  Explain how a 5% difference in slow turns into a 20% difference in DPS or even in overall damage.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">You are comparing slowed DPS . . . you can't do that.  You have to compare Raw DPS to slowed DPS.<br />
<br />
The difference is 5% in DPS . . . a tad more in overall damage done.<br />
<br />
Slice that up any way you want it . . . people still take Enchanters over Shaman any day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">MOB does 100 DPS<br />

<br />
thats not correct maths. as slow doesnt affect damage mobs does directly but amount of swings the mobs take (that inturn affect dps)<br />
this means that a 75% slow does not nessecarily decrease dps to 25%,  <br />
<br />
also it depends on mob delay and max hit, which will ,as max hit increases and delay stays the same, lower the effect slow has and the difference between slows.<br />
<br />
also what the poster above said , it raw dps  verus the slowed by 75% dpsand raw dps verus  slowed by 70% dps, this cant be found out except by  aparse, as slow does not affect dps directly in a 1% equal 1% dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Failbhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well, 5% difference in the enchanter and shaman slow does equate to approximately 20% additional DPS by the mob.<br />

Say a mob does 400dps unslowed.<br />
<br />
Shaman slowed that is 100dps.<br />
<br />
Enchanter slowed that is 120dps.<br />
<br />
Which is 20% more damage due to that 5% slow difference. 20% damage is alot, until the mob mitigates the slow and only lives for 30seconds anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">yep great, but i would say that if they gave us double attacks and offense skill at 225 2hb at 225 skill and the damage bonus we could pally sk mellee damage (though not tank as well). which might not be a bad thing, as we would only go in on stuff that we can handle, and not on longer fights where our dots would be better.?<br />
While something like that would ultimately result in a placebo effect, not unlike what clerics feel when they melee and bash, it would, in the end, simply be pretty eye candy, that very few people in game would be able to use to any affect.<br />
Instead of wasting coding time on something like this, how about a few real fixes instead?<br />
Back on topic, excellent job as always Chutoi, but, as many have said, its likely falling on deaf inboxes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">is there a parse that proves this somwhere Failbhe ? as slow again does not affect dps directly, it affect delay, which inturn affect dps. <br />
the misconception that 75% slow is a 75% decrease in dps is porbably what causes alot of problem for understanding shaman problems. i can tell you now is this was true, shaman could tank elemental and god mobs and our heal would be fine. as 600dps? would become  150 dps whci i think would be trival to heal?<br />
<br />
i am pretty sure that 100% slow would not stop a mob hitting in eq, just increase time between hits. <br />
<br />
the question is how to soe implement slow  does 50% slow double the delay? or add 1/2 the delay value? either way 100% would just double 50% effect but mob would still hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Sudedor: your numbers are suspect to me.<br />
<br />
You include 10 seconds for enc/bst/shm slow as if it takes each class that long before they can land their slow (hint: it doesn't).  I do like the general idea of what you are trying to show, but it contains a lot of bad data assumptions.  Work on this and you may be on to something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Rytan was refering to mob dps, and the 5% difference between shaman and chanter slows translates into 20% dps. It's 40% when compared to BL slows. That is a significant difference.<br />
If you can consistantly fully slow MOBs before they ever take the first swing, sure. And that 5% in slowage only translates into 20% of DPS difference when you are talking about 75% vs 70%. When you compare 50% to 47% (a partially mitigating MOB that gets slowed pretty fast) the difference is down to 6%. In very fast fights this figure goes down even more.<br />
<br />
Those differences fade as you take mitigation into account, particularly if you factor in this 30% exempt idea that has been floating about.<br />
Sadly this is not an idea. We do not know how exactly the formula works but shaman slows and/or higher % slows do get mitigated by a higher percentage.<br />
<br />
We do get Nihil though, which has the potential be much more effective than other class slows in certain situations.<br />
Would you mind listing these situations? The only ones I can think off offhand are those the very use of slow is already questionable in.<br />
<br />
Regarding dropout rates, most classes have seen significant drop out rates of late, its not something unique to shaman. I'm not so sure that it is anything specifically due to GoD, I get the general impression that many people are just tired of the game and this is a convienient point to fade away.<br />
I take it you have not heard of the numerous complaints not only from shaman but also from knights and to a lesser degree from the DPS classes about how useless they feel in GoD then?<br />
<br />
The one thing about GoD though, it is hard challenging content, that has the effect of separating the good from the average players, those with social contacts from the loners.<br />
That is a myth - if anyone gets separated it is clerics and warriors and enchanters from the rest of the classes. Sure, GoD is hard, but it is by no means unbeatable, especially if you are willing to drop the classes that are useless in GoD and get more clerics instead.<br />
<br />
I had originally though that might happen in LDoN, but I was wrong, primarily because LDoN was so easy you could get by with poor play if your gear was good. GoD does seem to be that sort of expansion though. In the context of a guild, the people you see being left out are the ones without the skills, without the gear or without the contacts. You can get by even in the highest guilds like that on raids, but not in single groups.<br />
I am curious - how do you define &quot;without the skills&quot;? Are you saying if a group fails with a knight tanking they do not have the skills needed? Are you saying that a group with a shaman and druid trying to replace a single cleric but failing means they are not skilled? Are you saying that a group that did not triple their DPS by bringing along an enchanter is unskilled?<br />
<br />
GoD as a whole is horribly onesided. How that equates to &quot;separating the skilled from the unskilled&quot; to you I do not know.</div></div><hr />

75% less swings per second results into (drumroll) 75% less damage done.  It doesnt matter if your delay between swings in 1 second or 1 hour, 75% less is 75% less.  Therefore, 75% less DPS would give the MOB in question a total output of 25% of the original DPS.</div></div><hr />

Barring procs, DSs, ripostes and the like a MOB slowed by 75% does indeed only do 25% of it's original damage.<br />

That 5% turns into a whopping 6.25% difference in overall damage done.<br />

<br />
Tugela's math is accurate, plain and simple.  Now, as they say, the numbers can be made to tell any story you like.  Granted, Sudedor, you've come up with 1 realistic scenario that shows the difference is much less in a specific case.  However, we can play that game all day long and show the opposite is true if we really wanted to.  Say, for example, the chanter has to cast tash to get slow to stick, or mez an add or two before slowing the first one, kinda blows his damage mitigation in the toilet on that first mob doesn't it.  Or the BST slow bounces because he can not debuff, and has to cast 3-4 times to get it to stick, gee, again, an unslowed mob doing a heck of a lot of damage.<br />
<br />
20% reduction in dps is an accurate statement, that is indisputable simple mathematics.  It is also true that it will probably be less than that in a realistic scenario.  I realize that the grass is always greener for the other class. But please, when you make up these scenerios, try to be objective and consider that the other classes also have their own issues to deal with.  It is not all gloom and doom for us and wine and roses for them.<br />

<br />
Everything I've seen says that haste and slows are both coded the exact same way. That is that the value that gets saved in game is literally the % decrease or increase in dmg dealt. IE 100% haste is twice as much dps and 75% slow is 1/4 dmg delt. So yes on a fully slowable mob they would be doing a quarter of thier unslowed dps. Thats why slow is so powerful. Also both 5% and 20% are 100% accurate numbers to quote you just need to include more information to fully explain what the number represents. An enchanter slowed mob will do 20% more damage than a shaman slowed one. It's all in how you look at it. If you want to make the numbers look bigger you use 20%. If you want to make them look smaller you use 5%. That the same argument that came out when they where letting turgurs scale up to 80% at 65. It would be 25% increase since the 100dps mob would do 20 dps instead of 25. Both are accurate just compairing different numbers.<br />

A 50% slow would half thier dps so would double thier delay. A 75% slow quarters thier dps so results in 4 times delay. It seems like an backwords way of doing things but it actually does make sense because it's much easier to see what the effect of a haste or slow is going to be when your setting values in the spells.<br />
<br />
As far as the mobs max hit goes it doesn't matter. The effect of the slow is going to be exactly the same, ignoring mitigation. A mob that hits for 100 or 1000 is going to get the same effect from being slowed. Obviously if everything else is the same the mob hitting for 1k is going to do 10 times the dps of the mob hitting for 100 both before and after slow but it's still going to be a 75% decrease on both of them.<br />
<br />
I know haste has been tested to death and the number obviously isn't the decrease in delay or 100% haste would be 0 delay. For slow you should easily be able to head out to a skelly in any newbie zone and easily tell the difference between 75% more delay and 75% less dps (ie 4 times delay). Probably don't even need to log it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">ok , before i say anymore , someone explain to me how slow actually works? what i know id that slow works on delay of weapons/mob, the question is how it works on that delay? just so i can clarify  how exactly does it work on that delay <br />
for instance if 50% doubles delay a 100% slow will just quadruple delay but wouldnt make dps 0. it would make it alot lower like in damage per mintue maybe but not 0<br />
to make slow % equal %dps you would need to work it so that 100% would mean the mob could not swing, same with haste it would make 100% haste basically no time between swings?<br />

I do not know how the actual formula works so I can not comment on whether it is possible to benefit from or be penalized by the game engine rounding delays up or down but apart from that:<br />
<br />
A 50% slow decreases swings per time by half. Delay gets doubled.<br />
A 50% haste increases swings per time by half. Delay gets multipled by .66.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said the number you'd look up in lucy is the % increase or decrease in damage delt not directly the effect on delay.<br />
<br />
Roughly you can consider that dps = dmg of hit / delay in seconds soo if you solve that for delay, delay = dmg / dps. If we assume that dmg is constant and just ignore that delay = 1/dps so if we want 75% slow, ie 25% dps it's delay = 1/.25 or 4 times the delay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok i finally figure out what bothered me about this. you assume slow and haste work the same way but opposite? <br />
<br />
soa  50% haste decrease for example a 16 sec delay to a 8 sec delay basically doubling your swings?<br />
<br />
but if slow works the same way a 16 sec delay will become a 24 sec delay, slower by 50% but not 1/2 the swings. it actually only decrease swings by a 1/3. (and to be honest this seem to reflect the dps reduction more accurrately to me cos 50% slow never seem to half the damage i took though it did reduce it a good bit)<br />
<br />
this is becuase you add to delay with slow but decrease delay it with haste? i think the confusing is because you expect haste to increase you dps and slow to decrease your dps, but are forgetting that is is delay they affect.<br />
<br />
If slow does work this way, which would seem to be most logical a 75% slow for 16 delay is 28delay, and 70% is 27.2 , which is avery small difference in a short fight. <br />
<br />
unless you know SoE do something very different/strange for slow? <br />
<br />
ps you cant ignore delay as this is what this spells affect, they do not effect atall you max hit or max mob can hit for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WRONG. A 100% haste would take a 16 second delay to 8 seconds. Since you'd be swinging twice as often it would double your dps. A 50% haste would  take your 16 delay to ~10.5 seconds. <br />
<br />
but if slow works the same way a 16 sec delay will become a 24 sec delay, slower by 50% but not 1/2 the swings. it actually only decrease swings by a 1/3.

<br />
Wrong again a 50% slow is going to double the delay. So 16 would become 32. So you end up swinging half as often and result in half the dps.<br />
<br />

Slow does effect delay. There's no question about that. The NUMBER coded in the spell database how ever isn't directly applied to delay. It's stored in a more user friendly number that then gets converted before it's applied to the delay.</div></div><hr />

ok i agree with this,<br />
the difference if dps for a 70% and 75% slow still feels wrong as the number of swings per minute wont be that different,and as fight tend to last less than a mintue probably no noticable different<br />
though from 50 to 75% would be 1/2 the number of swings than 50%, i think it works out as 1 more swing per minute between 70 and 75%, which over long fights makes more difference , but over short fights doesnt. to work out exactly need to know how long 16 delay is in seconds. which i not sure<br />
<br />
but the fact that the quicker the fight the less slow affects total dps done is still true. and the longer the more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I disagree with the fact you think this doesn't apply to the lower or mid range shaman. Just because im not in elemental or time gear or fighting in GoD expansion, doesn't mean i dont read up on the matter and feel he trickle back effects of the weakening of our class. Why in the hell should I progress anymore if the end game for my character is so trashed and abandoned. Yeah I might be able to continue on for another month or 2 but in the end knowing what lies ahead whats the point? <br />
<br />
Whats next groups of uber shaman being bored monopolizing some older zones? Wouldn't blame them for one minute, cant play in zones for your level might as well take over some old ones you could still fight in. Hehe would love to see herds of Giant Polar bears running all over BoT, yelling thats nacho's, gimme my giant back. I can imagine the younger other classes would be a tad upset with the prospect of loosing a exp/leveling zone to a bunch of you. Not sure what SOE would do about that.<br />
All in all liked and agree with the general idea expressed. Also dont think the mitigation of slow is even factored into the stealth nerf we have recieved from encounter changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Just read the previous posts, plenty of simple examples already given.  The 20% is the difference between a slowed mob's dps if slowed 75% vs. 70%.  5% of the remaining 25% dps is 20% of the total slowed dps.  That is the difference.  So if a mob was slowed 75% and doing 100 dps, the same mob slowed 70% would be doing 120 dps.  That simple.  If the same mob was only slowed 65% (ala BST) then its dps would be 140.  The 5-10% does make a difference, but only becomes noticable in longer fights.  Short fights, such as in LDoN and Gates make the difference almost negligable, but it still exists at the same %.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Frankly, Chutoi, I don't see ANY reason not to impliment all of the changes. We're too mired in the tought that we have to lag behind somewhere else, and even being good is borderline overpowered.<br />
<br />
People are clasping hands and going &quot;but I DO love my Shaman, really I DO...&quot; Wake up and smell the bacon here, folks, if we just get a nibble, just one or two band-aids, we're still dragging ass and contributing even less than a botted bard on most encounters. <br />
<br />
We NEED big upgrades. We NEED to catch up to the rest of the game, not in drippy increments, but all at once. It's not an option to just pick one little thing and go &quot;Please sir, may I have some more?&quot; like some Oliver Twist thing.<br />
<br />
The defeatest &quot;We don't deserve THAT much...&quot; is gonna just kill us harder in the end, folks. Aim for overpowered. Only when you don't get it, work your way down. it's how the druids did it, it's how we need to.<br />
<br />
And for god's sakes, stop with the Slow charts. What are we now, a reverse Thott? Yes, we have the &quot;Best slow&quot;, no, it doesn't count for much. But we have so much more than slow, you need to stick your heads out of the little box we've been crammed in since Velious that slow is the be-all end-all of the class. EVERY problem Shaman have had has been answered with two things. One is &quot;Yeah, but we have a 75% slow!&quot; and &quot;I'm a time geared level 65 shaman with 800 AA in a damned huge raiding guild doing stuff two years before you'll ever see it. It all looks good to me!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Specter Aldonova</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Chutoi, every time you make one of these posts, I get depressed.  Why?  Because I think back to the last few months of my time in EQ.  I remember lots of fun in PoP in general, running around doing REALLY stupid stuff (Anyone else try to duo Vindi yet? With a Monk?), and generally having a blast.<br />
<br />
That is, I was until GoD.  What a suck expansion that is.  I can see why people are leaving in droves.  It's hard.  Insanely hard.  And that's for those who have a chance in hell at it.  Only thing I see in my future is weeks of begging the biggest tanks and the best clerics and most uber dps to help push me through Trial 7 - 9.  I tell you, it fills me with the most wonderous sense........ of complete and utter futility.  Because after I get through Trial 7 - 9, I have the rest of GoD to look forward to.  What a pit.  You probably don't quite understand what my point is yet, but I'll get to it.<br />
<br />
For those of you who doubt the current state we are in, I have a question for you.  I want you to think back to the time before GoD.  Can you pick a spot where you can point to and say to yourself &quot;THAT is where I did the job.  THAT is where they needed me and I stepped up!&quot;  There are a quite a few places where I can do that.  A timely heal on the MT.  A critical heal on the Rampage Tank.  Helping root mobs so no adds would get in the healers.  Stuff like that I can remember.<br />
<br />
Now, can you think of one in GoD?  And, I don't mean for a group.  I mean for a raid.  A situation where you can say &quot;We would have wiped if I hadn't done that.&quot;  A spot you can point to and tell me that HERE is where your guild NEEDED you.  That you weren't just taking up a raid spot.  I can't.  To be honest, I feel like if every Shaman in the guild were to switch to a different class, not only would we not be missed (Beastlord buffs) but we would probably HELP more than we are now.  <br />
<br />
And that is my point.  We aren't needed.  We don't contribute anything meaningful.  We are just passengers in a flag-ride-along program.<br />
<br />
I refuse to quit though.  I'll keep trying to contribute.  If for no other reason than that I owe it to my guildmates.<br />
<br />
Plus, won't it be fun to stand on the top of the mountain that is the GoD expansion and give a big, heart-felt /rude to SoE?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Daimadoshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">just somethoing to add to help the shamans :) (I used to play a mage but quit playing on December), but my bro played a shaman 65) and I love the shamans, because it looks like shamans and mages are kinda having the same issues (but on different aspects).<br />
<br />
When you say: 5% slow is 20% more dmg let's see this:<br />
<br />
Imagine shaman's get 100% slow which lowers mob's dps to: 0 dps.<br />
Imagine now BL's (or chanter etc) get 99% slow which lowers mob's dps to: 10 dps.<br />
<br />
That's right, the mob is doing  infinitly more   dmg with BL than with shaman's one ^^. Go sell this point to groups <br />
 :p  :D <br />
<br />
You have to take in account the mana needed in terms of healing for both situations: with your slow at 75% and with a slow at 80%, to understand the difference in terms of percentage.<br />
<br />
In my precedent case, with natural regen + buffs, there is no need for heals, so ... even if the mob is doing infinitly more dmg, there is absolutly no difference.<br />
<br />
To be more realistic:<br />
<br />
get a mob with 100 dps:<br />
<br />
case 1: with 75% slow after 3000 seconds (50 minutes) the mob deals 25dps*3000=75000 dmg<br />
<br />
case 2: with 80% slow after 3000 seconds (50 minutes) the mob deals 20dps*3000=60000 dmg<br />
<br />
which is ... 2 CH from a cleric or one CH critical.<br />
<br />
I don't know for how much do they exactly heal ... but let's say on average a CH lands for 7.5k on average for 400 mana:<br />
<br />
case 1: 10 CH = 4k mana<br />
case 2: 12 CH = 4.8k mana<br />
<br />
&quot;here you have your 20% difference&quot; will you tell me. But over 50 minutes, the cleric will have gained: <br />
let's say 60mana /tick i.e 10 Mana/sec = 3000*10 = 30k mana<br />
<br />
so ... 800 mana/30000 = 2,6%. And it's constant fight.<br />
<br />
The calculations are not that easy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Other than Focus (which is situational - see below), Shaman bring nothing to a raid against a boss mob that is not duplicated or bettered by other classes abilities.  It is my contention that you would have a more effective raid if you included any class other than a Shaman in the place that the shaman occupies.  <br />
<br />
1) Slow Line:  Boss Mobs are IMMUNE TO SLOW - thus this line is worthless.  Highly mitigated slows against boss mob guards are so similar to Chanter slow effectiveness that I see little or no difference in the effectiveness of them.  <br />
<br />
2) Malo line:  Malos is overwritten by Malosinia - which Mages get as well as shaman, Mala can be used as an initial debuff to be used to land Malosinia.  Magician DPS is far greater than Shaman DPS from a combination of spells and pets, rods are excellent utility.  Thus for doing the Malo line I would say replacing a shaman with a Magician is an excellent choice.  <br />
<br />
3) Cripple Line:  Enchanters do Cripple.  It's clear that Enchanters through the Charm, Mezz, Hastes, Slow lines have excellent utility and can bring a wide range of abilities to the raid which can have far greater crowd control and damage (situationally).  <br />
<br />
4) Healing:  Clerics are always better healers that Shaman.  Druids are better healers that Shaman.  Paladins are similarish to Shaman.  Replacing Shaman with Druids or Clerics will always improve the healing of a raid.<br />
<br />
5) Buffs:  Stats are capped, thus buffs are irrelevent.  Even in uncapped the effect of most stats is marginal to say the least.  <br />
<br />
6) Damage:  Shaman are a low DPS class, adding other DPS classes in place of a shaman will increase the raid damage and thus improve the raid.  <br />
<br />
7) Ferine Avatar:  The beastlord similar buff is better.  Yes it does stack with FA, but if you had to choose one of the two the beastlord savegry line is a better choice.  Beastlords bring a range of useful buffs that duplicate most of what a shaman can do.  <br />
<br />
8) Focus:  Int Casters and Pure Melees (from Ornate Breastplates) have an incompatable buff that gives fewer hit points, but more Magic Resistance and Armour Class.  Thus Focus is fully of use to Priests and Hybrids only.  For all the others it is a situational upgrade.  <br />
<br />
Based on the above replacing Shaman with other classes strengthens a raid more than it weakens it.</div></div><hr />

A delay of 16 is 1.6 seconds, or 0.625 attack rounds per second.<br />
<br />
thank you:)<br />
<br />
think i went off the wrong way on my other posts. ok we agree that over a long figh it would be 20% difference, but i was pretty close with what i thought 16 delay was in seconds so over a 1 minute fight it would still be 1 or possible 2 swings more between 70 and 75% slow. and most fights are less than 1 minute. i pretty sure that wont work out at 20% difference.<br />
<br />
when you work it out for that i pretty sure it wont be 20% difference, 20% is the max you can get over a long fight, or a inifinate fight, like 20 mins or more. i would imagine it starts lower percentage in reality over 30 sec and 60 sec and get up to the 20% in the 10 to 20 mins.</div></div><hr />

I think his point is that the value of that 20% (or 5%, whatever) cannot really be measured by a &quot;%&quot; equation. However, what he is basically saying is that as the fights get longer, the value of that extra 5% increases dramatically, which is kinda obvious, if you think about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
because a mob fighting and when it dies are variable, for instance and this not a real eq example, but a mob has a delay of 30 sec? it dies in 35 sec? 50% slow will make it 60 sec delay and 70 and75% more but you wont notice that difference in any of them will you, the mob only hit you 1 time? now to a less extent you will get this happen with lower delays in that a it might be 20% in theory, but it doesnt actually work out that way when you fight.<br />
what i saying is in theory yes, but in practice no.<br />

and as the person above stated to faster the fight the less benefit from slowing</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, somewhere in here you have elected yourself class spokesman. So, a few people have urged you to write something to SoE. That's great, I guess. This, to my knowledge, is the first post you have solicited feedback from the crucible prior to posting. Normally you sweep in and announce what you have done.<br />
<br />
Well that is not representing Shaman, it's just announcing what you have done after you have done it.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of the issues you point out are valid, and I can identify with a lot of them. I just don't see how this kind of foaming at the mouth post can cause any kind of change.<br />
<br />
You are angry. A lot of people are angry. That much is obvious. Do you honestly think that abusing the people you want to have work with you is the correct path? Calling people names, deriding their knowledge of the game, being rude and offensive are not the &quot;classic&quot; negotiating methods. If we don't get responses, or action we need to collectively think of a different approach, not lower our standards. <br />
<br />
I sent you a PM after your last message suggesting you tone down your content if you wished to be taken seriously. You probably deleted it because you were swamped in fan mail or something. shrug.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that while there might be some valuable content in your posts I think you are doing more damage than good by posting in the manner you are currently.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't take this kind of message board seriously if I was SoE to be honest. Messages titled &quot;Do you hate SoE?&quot; don't really reflect a mature community.<br />
<br />
Flame me for this but you asked for feedback and while I may not be writing what you want to hear I am giving you feedback. And before all the heavyweights begin to disparage remember this: If you make a community frightened to speak out against the few vocal bullies, you don't end up with a united community.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I think Cuda is suggesting that in a game encounter the effect of slow on dps is not the percentage reduction, but the average of the dps during the time that the mob is unslowed and the average of dps for the time that the mob is slowed.  Thus the actual encounter the effective percentage of slow would increase the longer the fight lasts, but on 20 or 30 second fights, where half the time of the fight the mob is unslowed, the effective percentage of slow is less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Zatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">The real problem with DOT aggro is that the code has no way to add aggro each tick that the DOT adds damage. So the game adds ALL of the potential damage the DOT can possibly do at once. So if a DOT did 400/tick for 10 ticks you get 4000 aggro when you CAST it. Even if it is resisted or partially resisted. This is really just lazy programming on the developers part.<br />

<br />
I suspect, but don't know, that the nuke aggro of Wiz and others is reduced by making the aggro cap at a certain number and/or any crit on the nuke is not added in.</div></div><hr />

Giac,<br />
<br />
You've got half the point down..... You are paying SoE. But you aren't paying any more than the next person. The problem is that if you choose to tell them to F off, that's your decision.<br />
<br />
And you are correct, you don't need to negotiate, you don't need to do anything but make a simple decision to either pay and play, or don't pay and walk away.<br />
<br />
I'm not here to argue, but someone's got to point out that being annoyed is fine. It's your right and decision to be annoyed I suppose. But to feel that SoE owes you anything because you've played for a long time is incorrect. They don't make us pay them every month and we have the right to cancel at any time. Therefore they &quot;owe&quot; us nothing.</div></div><hr />

There was an overreaction to their flyby, granted. But, let's not forget that changes did arise from it. I return to my previous point here. Just because you don't happen to agree with the changes doesn't mean that changes weren't made. I don't think the changes were enough, but I don't think we'll get any more until things calm down around here to be honest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Deceidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Other than Focus (which is situational - see below), Shaman bring nothing to a raid against a boss mob that is not duplicated or bettered by other classes abilities. It is my contention that you would have a more effective raid if you included any class other than a Shaman in the place that the shaman occupies. <br />
<br />
1) Slow Line: Boss Mobs are IMMUNE TO SLOW - thus this line is worthless. Highly mitigated slows against boss mob guards are so similar to Chanter slow effectiveness that I see little or no difference in the effectiveness of them. <br />
<br />
2) Malo line: Malos is overwritten by Malosinia - which Mages get as well as shaman, Mala can be used as an initial debuff to be used to land Malosinia. Magician DPS is far greater than Shaman DPS from a combination of spells and pets, rods are excellent utility. Thus for doing the Malo line I would say replacing a shaman with a Magician is an excellent choice. <br />
<br />
3) Cripple Line: Enchanters do Cripple. It's clear that Enchanters through the Charm, Mezz, Hastes, Slow lines have excellent utility and can bring a wide range of abilities to the raid which can have far greater crowd control and damage (situationally). <br />
<br />
4) Healing: Clerics are always better healers that Shaman. Druids are better healers that Shaman. Paladins are similarish to Shaman. Replacing Shaman with Druids or Clerics will always improve the healing of a raid.<br />
<br />
5) Buffs: Stats are capped, thus buffs are irrelevent. Even in uncapped the effect of most stats is marginal to say the least. <br />
<br />
6) Damage: Shaman are a low DPS class, adding other DPS classes in place of a shaman will increase the raid damage and thus improve the raid. <br />
<br />
7) Ferine Avatar: The beastlord similar buff is better. Yes it does stack with FA, but if you had to choose one of the two the beastlord savegry line is a better choice. Beastlords bring a range of useful buffs that duplicate most of what a shaman can do. <br />
<br />
8) Focus: Int Casters and Pure Melees (from Ornate Breastplates) have an incompatable buff that gives fewer hit points, but more Magic Resistance and Armour Class. Thus Focus is fully of use to Priests and Hybrids only. For all the others it is a situational upgrade. <br />
<br />
Based on the above replacing Shaman with other classes strengthens a raid more than it weakens it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This can be said for any class.. Let's take mage for example:<br />
<br />
Slow Line: Don't have it.<br />
<br />
Malo Line: Mages  have this, but (gasp) so do shaman..mage are useless!<br />
<br />
Mage strengths--<br />
<br />
Pet: Cant hardly use one on a raid, but if you did, The beastlord pet is almost as good and the beastlord brings much more utility! Mage are teh suck!<br />
<br />
Nukes: Wizards and Druids both outnuke the mage, who wants a mage?<br />
<br />
Mana Regen- Hell, necros provide better mana regen to other characters than the mage, and beastlords and enchanters both provide mind candy. Mage is worthless!<br />
<br />
Damage shields- Druids have damage shields, better nukes, heals, buffs, and that nifty teleport spell. Down with mages!<br />
<br />
<br />
You see the point here? Shall we go into other classes? Every damn class in this game shares abilities with some other class. Every class here can do something better than someone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Karsh, I see where you are coming from. But please cut my buddy Giac a little slack, ok? He is extremely fustrated with not only SOE, but with a bunch of the people who come here and continuously post &quot;We are fine, move along, nothing to fix here&quot; crap. I used to be one, and eventualy, I saw the message through his abrasiveness. Actually, veeshanMurtak made me see it a BIT better, because he doesnt condescend as much as Giac, but thats neither here nor there. The point is I SEE the point. <br />
<br />
Chu isnt frothing like some, though. I think he is putting together the mass-concensus without coming off as a Looney ready for the Bin. I think his message is a bit long, but overall, he is right ojn the money. Personally, here is my take in shorter form from another thread:<br />
<br />
We are ALL Shaman. We know our strengths. We know our capabilities. We know we can easily be sole healer in LDoN Normal or a BoT XP group. Some of us can even be sole healer in EP XP groups, I have done it in Castle 1 in PoFire a couple times, not hard because I can Malos on inc, Slow when it gets there, and Quies-Tnargs-Quies the tank (who is always a guildie and has 9500+ hps) and even sneak in a Bane now and then. <br />
<br />
We know we are the envy of Wizards and Necros and Druids at the Tables in Fire, where one kill = 14% of an AA solo. We get to sit on our mounts and use VP and DOTs to our hearts content, laying out well over 200 dps. Those other classes have to run around in circles endlessly while we chuckle from the backs of our Lizards, canning our mana back near full after every mob. <br />
<br />
However, the writing is on the wall. The game is changing. EQ has become less about fight strategy and more about &quot;how fast can you kill&quot;. It has become less about STAT buffs and more about MANA buffs. It has been gradually turning into a game where the Shaman is relatively worthless as a member of ANY group. <br />
<br />
Of course we are still great in LDoN. Of course we can still get EP XP groups. Of course we can Solo the Ghoul Lord. These things are all great and wonderful. Ever been the 3rd Shaman on a big raid? Ever even TRIED to get Pick-up groups for Gates? How many times do you get asked &quot;Wanna do LDoN Hard as our PRIEST&quot;. I will tell you how many times, NEVER. <br />
<br />
Gonna go through the checklist one more time, for those of you who do not seem to be seeing the big picture here:<br />
<br />
1. Slow has been trivialized by mitigation and immunity. Add to that the fact that 3 other classes have a viable slow, and that the difference withours is a drop in the bucket in a 20-30 second fight, and we have a problem with our &quot;Defining Ability&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Stat buffs have been made worthless by caps and mudflation. Heck, every Tom, Dick and Harry Warrior playing has a few +STR and +STA common-drop augs. NO ONE NEEDS THESE SPELLS!! We may as well delete them completely, not kidding. Oh wait, CHA is still good for selling stuff to vendors, cause I am an ugly Troll. That leaves us with 2 respectable buffs. Focus (for the HPs, which is sucky compared to some others) and FA (for the +attack, which doesnt help casters much, eh?)<br />
<br />
3. Our healing is pathetic. Even if we manage to get copies of the new heal, its STILL so far below the other Priest classes that we may as well bring Paladins along if you need a back-up healer, cause they have BETTER buffs, and a sweet group heal, etc etc). In the words of Giac, &quot;Grats for being good at healing in trivial content&quot; or something. He may be abrasive, but hes right on the money. <br />
<br />
4. DPS is the king of all &quot;utility&quot; now. You need a Tank. You need a Healer. Then, you NEED DPS. Lets examine our DPS options. A really slow nuke (VS). A small fast nuke (SoT). A decent DOT that cannot be re-cast if resisted that mob, and STILL rarely runs its full course sespite being the shortest term of all DOTs (Bane). A Hasted, Rabid Beared, Sharkspine wielding, FoM3, FAed, Ranger Buffed Troll with a lot of Moxxy (me, well, I dont have RB). I SWEAR I do more damage with melee (and Sharkspine procs) than I can with ANY combo of the others. Our DPS is truly pathetic, and if you wish to even BEGIN to deny this, its time to start looking at buying those bridges in Brooklyn I keep hearing are for sale. <br />
<br />
What is a Shamans function? For myself, I see it as many things. Buffs, Debuffs, Heals and some DPS. Hybrids out-buff us across the board. Debuffing is a joke, with the mitigation of slow. Healing . . . well lets not even go there. We are great &quot;in between fight&quot; healers, eh. DPS? Yeah, I especially like dropping an SoT on a mob and not seeing his hps drop a BUDGE. <br />
<br />
Its been noted many times. We were AWESOME in Kunark and Velious. We were ROCK SOLID in Luclin. We started to feel a pinch in PoP, but were still valuable. LDoN Normal is trivial content (similar to Guk, honestly) and we arent so hot in LDoN Hard, but can still contribute. And now, Gates is here, and where are we. Even farther behind, with no upgrades in sight. Speed, DPS, and Mana. Thats the game today. Show me where we excell in ANY of those areas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blazz,<br />
<br />
I mean no offense to Giac. I have enjoyed reading many of his posts. I think he's overreacting to this though, which is amusing because my post was to Chutoi. It must have struck a nerve and with that came all of this.<br />
<br />
But, I'll cut some slack, as requested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I am not arguing anymore with anyone. I have not been posting to the status of the class for a while now as some may have noticed, because I am past that point.<br />
<br />
I must honestly say I used to &quot;enjoy&quot; arguing with people to some extent and my abrasiveness was just a result of hitting a brick wall, when people wouldn't understand, since I knew that it would just be a matter of time till the person would experience the same things(as Blazz admitted himself).<br />
<br />
The reason Shamans got Daluda's Mending is because some of us have been trying to open everyone's eyes. This led to more and more people seeing the problem and creating a noise, which made the Devs listen. <br />
<br />
Do whatever you like, but realize that there are a lot of issues in a game like EQ and no one cares or runs an indepth analysis to figure out what's wrong with this or that class. If they hear 3 Shamans whine, they give a ****, if they hear 3,000 Shamans whine, they will look into it.<br />
<br />
Speak your mind out loudly or you won't be getting the attention, no matter how valid your point is.<br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />

That is not what we are saying. We are saying 30% is 20% more then 25%.<br />
<br />
You have to take in account the mana needed in terms of healing for both situations: with your slow at 75% and with a slow at 80%, to understand the difference in terms of percentage.<br />
WHen you are talking about a 70% and a 75% slow the answer has been given already. 20% more. How many heals that amounts to depends on the total damage done but the 20% difference stays the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;here you have your 20% difference&quot; will you tell me. But over 50 minutes, the cleric will have gained: <br />
let's say 60mana /tick i.e 10 Mana/sec = 3000*10 = 30k mana<br />
<br />
so ... 800 mana/30000 = 2,6%. And it's constant fight.<br />
<br />
The calculations are not that easy :)<br />
What the heck are you dividing mana by time for when you are trying to arrive at a percentage? Why are you even dividing anything when you are already finished. In your example fight length is fixed - there is no need for comparison and certainly no need to compare mana to hectoticks.</div></div><hr />

Chutoi,<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what your issue with my post is. It's the same as my PM. You have sound information, you present it badly. That's my opinion. You asked specifically for feedback on this very thread and you got it. I'm NOT a fan of your presentation skills and that was my feedback.<br />
<br />
You didn't ask for feedback on the previous post you made, it was a presentation after the post had been made to SoE. After I read that post I sent you a PM. It was not solicited feedback and I figured you weren't interested in it considering I got no response and your posts didn't change in tone. Why would I be upset if you didn't respond to a PM? I didn't ask you to. I simply felt that you were undermining well thought out and parsed posts by posting rude and inappropriate ones.<br />
<br />
As for calling me an ass, that's your prerogative but don't try and add impact to the statement by claiming you don't say things like that very often. Like I said to Giac, Chutoi, you don't scare me. You specifically asked for feedback. If you only want fanmail be more specific in your request.<br />

Regarding sitting on the sidelines and nit-picking. I would offer concrete information if I had it. I have played the game up to the elementals, am not yet in time, and haven't seen much GoD. I can't either support or oppose your high high end data so I haven't tried. Where applicable I have voiced my opinion. In terms of getting off my butt and doing something, I tried that. I sent you a PM offering my advice regarding how I feel you might gain more respect from SoE if you lessen your negative posts. You chose to ignore that. That's your call, but I went out of my way to offer that thought.<br />
<br />
As for me being rude and offensive. Forgive me, I didn't mean to be. I simply stated what I see. You were not elected class spokesman. This is the first thread from you I have seen that you have asked for support PRIOR to emailing or contacting SoE. You do elect to ignore anyone without time access unless they agree with you, and you are offensive in tone to anyone you deem it appropriate. It's a shame, because you do have insight into the game, and given the correct manner of posting might have more of an ear from SoE. <br />
<br />
Who knows if that is true. No one is interested in trying it. All I know is that the kinds of tactics you are employing would never ever work in a real life business transaction and considering that SoE is a real life corporation I am bemused that you think they should respond to the kinds of posts I see here simply because it's regarding a game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">I must honestly say I used to &quot;enjoy&quot; arguing with people to some extent and my abrasiveness was just a result of hitting a brick wall, when people wouldn't understand, since I knew that it would just be a matter of time till the person would experience the same things(as Blazz admitted himself).<br />
<br />
Honestly man, I didnt hit that wall because I have yet to actively play in Gates and I rarely do LDoN Hard because Normal is a better time vs reward (points) option for me. I just thought about it more in the terms you presented. <br />
<br />
That even in semi-trivial content, we are NOT as awesome as we think we are. We are damn good, don't get me wrong, and I still FIRMLY belive that without Gates, the new heals would be 90% of enough to balance us (a better fast nuke being the other 10%, to hell with stat buffs, PITA anyway). But with Gates, and even LDoN, which started the whole &quot;HURRY HURRY KILL AS FAST AS YOU CAN&quot; philosophy, and with the mitigation of Slow in so many places in PoP, it becomes painfully obvious how truly neglected we have been. <br />
<br />
I appriciate what you have done here Giac, but honestly man, you DO come off as a raving looney sometimes, seriously. There is a big difference between argueing (debating, if you will) and spewing, and a LOT of your posts got beyond the spew point. I realize it was a result of fustration, and I even had some fun with it (sorry bout that, heh) but seriously, it makes your point get lost in the tone of the post. When your ranting, raving tone becomes the story, what you stand for and what you are trying to achieve gets ignored. I THINK that is the point that a LOT of the &quot;We are sorta ok, you dont have to call us worthless, there are lots of places we excell, etc etc etc&quot; type guys are trying to make. We cannot lose the content of the message by drawing attention to the fact that we are SO PISSED. <br />
<br />
Don't stop posting Giac. Don't stop trying to help fix this. We need guys like you in this fight. Heck, I am almost ready for a sit-in style event like the Warriors pulled when they felt so ignored in their contribution to the everyday game of EQ. When 1 Shaman is adequate for any raid, and our everyday abilities to contribute are slowly being de-materialized by the content, it may be time to make a bigger move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Daimadoshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">It's because you need to understand the impact of the slow over the time of the fight, for your group.<br />
<br />
I have said that the difference between a 99% slow and a 100% slow in terms of dmg output is INFINITE (melee only). If the slowed mob has an output of 10dps after being slowed for 99%, with regen lines, you don't need any heals at all. That means for a difference of infinite percentage in dmg output, there is 0, nada, niet difference for players. Give the shaman a 100% slow, and beastlord a 99% slow. Yes you will have a slow infinitly better than the 99% slow, but people would just see no difference, and would take the BL over the shaman's hands down, because of the added utilities.<br />
<br />
I have shown that for a 50 minutes constant fight between a 100dps slowed mob at 75% and 80% the difference in terms of mana used to heal, was 20% (yes 4800 mana instead of 4000, because yes there is 20% more dmg output), but if you look at the mana generated by the cleric during this time (30000), the real difference is 2.6%. Look at the big picture: the 30k bar, the 4k part and the 4.8k part.<br />
Even worse, since the 800 mana could have been used to nuke, the difference in dps brought by the cleric is:<br />
800/all dmg done .... which quickly tends to nothing.<br />
<br />
Now, it will be completly different if all the cleric's mana is used to heal, and he is going out of mana. Because if with a 75% slow, the cleric doesn't run out of mana, with 80% it will be even better, the cleric will just nuke a little more, but the effectiveness of the group won't be a 20% added.<br />
<br />
That's why I say don't look at the 20% ... try to build a true scenario with casting times and with a 80% slow, and a 75% slow. Try to look at the pessimistic way (that means which tends to show that the mere 5% is a huge difference), and round it in the way that doesn't support the shaman's cause, to be sure you won't be called cheaters.<br />
<br />
Once done you can say: &quot;here is the worst difference that can happen between a 75% and a 80% slow&quot;. And show how it impacts effectiveness for everybody in the group.<br />
<br />
Then run the same thing with a 65/70% slow to justify the differences between your slow and the other people slows.<br />
<br />
P.S: I would love running those scenarii but ...<br />
- I have stopped playing Eq before GoD came out, so I don't know the exact numbers.<br />
- I haven't played a shaman myself (even if watched my brother a lot, and talked a lot about strategy as a shaman), therefore, I wouldn't dare doing it myself for this community.<br />
<br />
Just to show you what I mean: (very simplistic scenario)<br />
30 second fight vs a 2000dps mob (pretty huge!!)<br />
<br />
75% slow:  15000 dmg taken from tank, that means 2 CH.<br />
<br />
80% slow:  12000 dmg taken from tank, that means 2 CH (the cleric will likely heal the tank with a CH before the next pull). <br />
<br />
difference: nothing.<br />
<br />
Now if the cleric heals with a HoT... there will be a difference for mana use between a CH and his/her HoT. Will it be 20% ? Now if it is a druid healing, what is the difference? Just yourself as main healer? If it is mitigated?<br />
<br />
I am just trying to help you there ^^ to show that you won't find a 20% in efficiency if you run through this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">This can be said for any class.. Let's take mage for example:<br />
<br />
Slow Line: Don't have it.<br />
<br />
Malo Line: Mages  have this, but (gasp) so do shaman..mage are useless!<br />
<br />
Mage strengths--<br />
<br />
Pet: Cant hardly use one on a raid, but if you did, The beastlord pet is almost as good and the beastlord brings much more utility! Mage are teh suck!<br />
<br />
Nukes: Wizards and Druids both outnuke the mage, who wants a mage?<br />
<br />
Mana Regen- Hell, necros provide better mana regen to other characters than the mage, and beastlords and enchanters both provide mind candy. Mage is worthless!<br />
<br />
Damage shields- Druids have damage shields, better nukes, heals, buffs, and that nifty teleport spell. Down with mages!<br />
<br />
<br />
You see the point here? Shall we go into other classes? Every damn class in this game shares abilities with some other class. Every class here can do something better than someone else.<br />
<br />
hmm least see slow not relavant they never had it.<br />
 2nd best at debuffing? mala and malosinia?  and not by much as it only mala that worse than malo.<br />
<br />
best pet in game they can use in most groups and only not in cetain raid. i admit they had problesm in god but that seems to have been look at and somin done, mages pets can tank the lower planes without slow.<br />
<br />
2nd= best nukes they very close to druid and the firebolt one is almost wizard nukage but nees line o sight that hardly bad.<br />
<br />
best ds there is with fire resist buff.<br />
<br />
with kei ft15 and new swlf mana regen using pet? but this is pointless as mana regain nowadays doesnt come into it.<br />
<br />
and you missed summon items, nice clicky rod for mana regain. some really nice pet gear.<br />
<br />
but a class that mainly 1st or 2nd in all the main bits , againt shaamn that are just 1st in 2 and not by much, and lowest in rest.... hmmm<br />

bad example, better would have been ranger i recon they have it bad.</div></div><hr />

What is your point here? That if the two classes were given utterly ridiculous spells weird things may happen? If we got a 100% slow and beastlords got a 99% one (that was not being mitigated) none of us would be looking for groups - clerics and druids would be.<br />

What real difference? 20% is 20%. It may not be all of that clerics mana but that does not matter at all for determining how much mana the cleric spent. If you mean to say 20% is insignificant if the cleric is casting only one heal per hour anyways that would be correct - and not matter at all in this discussion. Clerics do spend a lot of mana on heals. Debating over the differences in slow effectiveness on utterly trivial content does not matter for purposes of class balance discussions.<br />
<br />
Now, it will be completly different if all the cleric's mana is used to heal, and he is going out of mana. Because if with a 75% slow, the cleric doesn't run out of mana, with 80% it will be even better, the cleric will just nuke a little more, but the effectiveness of the group won't be a 20% added.<br />
Of course it would not - noone ever said reducing MOB DPS by 20% would make the group perform 20% better. All it does is reduce the need for healing by 20%<br />

<br />
Shaman needs different utilities to round them out, as many have suggested, such as aa's/spells that effect group melee damage output by raising not just attack but maximum and implied damage as well...this is a good general idea for shaman. Just asking to be able to nuke like a druid and heal like a cleric isn't going to get you anything as far as the devs are concerned, i can promise you that. What some of you fail to realize is that you present yourself poorly by overly harping on what a shaman can't do and failing to focus on what a shaman can do. The mage comparison above is a good example, because while all of what I said concerning a mage is true, they still bring a great deal with them to a group. They're not the best nukers, but they have the best pets. Still, someone else brings pets that aren't as good with more utility, etc.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, what shaman strengths?  Besides being able to slow by 5% more than any other class, what can a shaman do that you could consider as a strength?<br />
<br />
Your mage example isn't a good example--mages certainly aren't the best at anything other than probably pets.  However, mages aren't DRASTICALLY behind other classes in the other areas you mention, and they do bring some utility with summonable items (mostly just pet toys and mod rods).  In fact, many of the areas you mention mages are a close second or a very close third.  Shaman, however, are a distant third or dead last in almost everything they can do.<br />
<br />

I don't need to tell you what you can do. Either you haven't figured it out on  your own, or you're just blinded by your own hatred of what you percieve that your class has become. My only solution for you is to shelve the shaman and play something else. If you trot on over to the mage boards you can bury yourself in the mass of posts that say exactly the opposite of what you just posted. Mages feel that they, too, are dead last in a lot of those areas, whereas you're happy to point out that they're not. Roll up something else or move on, becuase I don't think there's much they can do to the shaman currently that will make you happy, if you fail to see any positives to the class as it stands.</div></div><hr />

You know, it's funny that in past debates over the years about class balancing, an opposing class such as a druid for example, will list everything we can do.  In return, we'll list what that druid can do.  In the end, it usually just becomes an angry fest.

Don't back out now, this is your BIG CHANCE to show everyone what shaman strengths are.  By the way, if you notice my signature, I've quit EQ (although my account was gifted to a friend); also, I did try another class (a beastlord) and they bring a lot more to the table than shaman do.

You think I'm attempting to intimidate you when I state that I think your first post made you seem like a real ass?  That was a concrete statement of opinion.  Not because you disagree, but via the tone, word choice, and statements made.  You disagree?  Go read it again.  It's pretty darn insulting in content and presentation.  Was that the intent?  I'd say clearly so, as an attempt to provoke a response.  (Hmmm, again, review the irony--it's exactly what you're deriding me for in the original post).<br />
<br />
If, however, that was not the intent of the post, then I quite sincerely apologize.<br />
<br />
As for this being 'offensive in tone to anyone you deem appropriate,' ummm. . . what other standard is there?  If I didn't deem it appropriate to be offensive to them, I wouldn't do it!!!  It's a tautalogical statement.  You're dead right if you think I'll be offensive to deliberate idiots, trolls, or people that refuse to engage their mind before opening their mouth.  I refer to those who refuse to admit obvious error, not those who make legitimate mistakes.  <br />
<br />
Further, I freely admit to having a tendency to discount the opinion of those who (a) disagree, AND (b) haven't encountered the problems that the rest of us have identified.  I feel that falls into the 'refusing to engage their mind' category.  There are those that, though not yet to the content about which we are discussing, nonetheless see the problem.  Those people who are progressing in lower tier/lower difficulty content and who are trying to tell us that we're wrong, there is no problem, honestly annoy the crap out of me.  The phrase, &quot;walk a mile in my shoes&quot; comes to mind.  (FYI, in case there is confusion, this doesn't apply to you--you've shown a complete willingness to look at evidence whether you disagree or not.  Your beef, so to speak, is with presentation).<br />
<br />
As for your comments in regards to the business arena and proper behavior, I beg to differ.  I've seen a lot of different negotiating tactics at this stage of my career.  The best people select the most appropriate one.  There are a number of tactics I may not care for personally, but, outside of compromising principles, you should always choose what works best.  To be fair, I AM annoyed at the SoE folks in charge of shaman, so the tone of my post does reflect my current state of mind.  That does not, however, necessarily invalidate the choice of presentation.  It merely means the form of presentation happens to be in sinc with my personal feelings (which doesn't always happen in the business world!).  Don't misunderstand.  I'd much prefer to have a rational discussion with a developer, or Brenlo.  One minor problem . . . they don't care.<br />
<br />
This is a group of people with other assignments.  It's additional work when people find something broken and they have to go back and fix it.  It's not just a question of is it broken, it's also a question of are enough people mad about it and is there enough support to require a fix so that it won't impact operations.  Sad, but true.<br />

The old bag O' shaman tricks that works for us so well outside of GoD suddenly becomes empty when we step into GoD.  For example, a Shaman is not going to slow a GoD add and root park it outside of the group.  Also, our &quot;over time&quot; spells that used to be enough are now barely a drop in the bucket.<br />
<br />
Deceidon, if you truly believe that Shamans (and any other class for that matter that doesn't fit into the theme of GoD) should just suck it up and move on because we aren't meant for the expansion, then perhaps Sony should have put a disclaimer on the box reading: &quot;Some class restrictions apply.  Shaman and Knights must be 800aa+time geared or accompanied by an adult Cleric+War&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">The real problem with DOT aggro is that the code has no way to add aggro each tick that the DOT adds damage. So the game adds ALL of the potential damage the DOT can possibly do at once. So if a DOT did 400/tick for 10 ticks you get 4000 aggro when you CAST it. Even if it is resisted or partially resisted. This is really just lazy programming on the developers part.<br />
<br />
<br />
I suspect, but don't know, that the nuke aggro of Wiz and others is reduced by making the aggro cap at a certain number and/or any crit on the nuke is not added in.<br />
<br />
Not correct. You get a whackload of agro when it lands (probably from the counter alone), after which you get hate increments per tick as damage is done (it appears to be roughly a 1:1 ratio for hate/damage). Its easy to see this by building up set amounts of hate on a non-meleeing warrior with incite, and then dropping DoTs on the mob. That is the reason that the epic DoT is agro friendly, most of the damage is done near the end of the DoT run, and it has no counter.</div></div><hr />

You're exactly right Ramhorn, with the exception that we are behind the time, not ahead of it, and that is worse.  It’s worse.  No matter how well reasoned an argument explaining what the problems of the current shaman is, someone who is still in Kunark will immediately claim that you're wrong, shamans are akin to gods on earth, and then refuse to head any argument to the contrary, because they saw a shaman solo a guardian wurm once.</div></div><hr />

We aren't asking them to change the model (please God no Luclin ever again), just for them to take a look at our usefulness in the new model.<br />
<br />
All our strengths were emphasized in long fights.  All our weaknesses are magnified in short ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
We know we are the envy of Wizards and Necros and Druids at the Tables in Fire, where one kill = 14% of an AA solo.<br />
<br />
I cannot imagine any necro being envious.  Comparing a necro at the fire tables to a shaman at the fire tables is like comparing Lennox Lewis to Pee Wee Herman.</div></div><hr />

I think you are understimating the utility of:<br />
Primal Essence (52)<br />
Infusion of Spirit (49) (don't look at 65 BST spells please)<br />
To casters begging near the PoK banks.<br />
<br />
Ohh and we have:<br />
Greater Remove Curse<br />
Abolish Disease.<br />
Tiny Terror<br />
Blood of Nadox<br />
<br />
Finally dont underestimate your ability to take a Deathtouch for the team (I think shaman are perfered now a days).<br />
<br />
But realistically I solved all my problems by botting my shaman.  I'd go nuts if my group contribution was based on what my shaman brings to the table.  Hope the developers listen to your post, as the many others seem to have failed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Okay, Karshak, now I'm really confused.  You think I'm attempting to intimidate you when I state that I think your first post made you seem like a real ass?  That was a concrete statement of opinion.  Not because you disagree, but via the tone, word choice, and statements made.  You disagree?  Go read it again.  It's pretty darn insulting in content and presentation.  Was that the intent?  I'd say clearly so, as an attempt to provoke a response.  (Hmmm, again, review the irony--it's exactly what you're deriding me for in the original post).<br />
<br />
If, however, that was not the intent of the post, then I quite sincerely apologize.<br />
<br />
As for this being 'offensive in tone to anyone you deem appropriate,' ummm. . . what other standard is there?  If I didn't deem it appropriate to be offensive to them, I wouldn't do it!!!  It's a tautalogical statement.  You're dead right if you think I'll be offensive to deliberate idiots, trolls, or people that refuse to engage their mind before opening their mouth.  I refer to those who refuse to admit obvious error, not those who make legitimate mistakes.  <br />
<br />
Further, I freely admit to having a tendency to discount the opinion of those who (a) disagree, AND (b) haven't encountered the problems that the rest of us have identified.  I feel that falls into the 'refusing to engage their mind' category.  There are those that, though not yet to the content about which we are discussing, nonetheless see the problem.  Those people who are progressing in lower tier/lower difficulty content and who are trying to tell us that we're wrong, there is no problem, honestly annoy the crap out of me.  The phrase, &quot;walk a mile in my shoes&quot; comes to mind.  (FYI, in case there is confusion, this doesn't apply to you--you've shown a complete willingness to look at evidence whether you disagree or not.  Your beef, so to speak, is with presentation).<br />
<br />
As for your comments in regards to the business arena and proper behavior, I beg to differ.  I've seen a lot of different negotiating tactics at this stage of my career.  The best people select the most appropriate one.  There are a number of tactics I may not care for personally, but, outside of compromising principles, you should always choose what works best.  To be fair, I AM annoyed at the SoE folks in charge of shaman, so the tone of my post does reflect my current state of mind.  That does not, however, necessarily invalidate the choice of presentation.  It merely means the form of presentation happens to be in sinc with my personal feelings (which doesn't always happen in the business world!).  Don't misunderstand.  I'd much prefer to have a rational discussion with a developer, or Brenlo.  One minor problem . . . they don't care.<br />
<br />
This is a group of people with other assignments.  It's additional work when people find something broken and they have to go back and fix it.  It's not just a question of is it broken, it's also a question of are enough people mad about it and is there enough support to require a fix so that it won't impact operations.  Sad, but true.<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
Chutoi,<br />
<br />
Tautology is repetition, or redundancy. If you took the words &quot;you deem appropriate&quot; out of that sentence it would open it up to a much larger set of people, well not larger, so lets agree on a little larger. I didn't say you are 'offensive in tone to anyone ' meaning anyone who speaks to you, I said you are 'offensive in tone to anyone you deem it appropriate'. <br />
<br />
As for the irony of all this you keep trying to point out, I'm just not seeing it. You see, I'm not putting myself out there as Shaman Spokesman for SoE to reach out and meet with, to find common ground, and to right the wrongs of the oppressed brothers and sisters. I'm just giving feedback to you. I figured you would like it in the tone you write. I guess I picked incorrectly. It would be ironic if I cared about what you thought and was trying to delicately get into a conversation that would have some kind of positive outcome.<br />
<br />
The true irony here is that I am seeing what impact the mitigated slows and gulf in healing vs damage are having to the Shaman class. I am seeing that myself. You have my support theoretically, I'm just on the defensive now and not really interested in sorting this out. So, discount my input, disregard my posts and do your thing. I guess I made your ignore list, which is pretty much where I was before today happened anyway. :P<br />
<br />
For the record, I would have PM'd you, but it would have just got posted anyway so I saved you the bother.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
Feel free to PM me if you have anything you want to say. I'll read any response here but I don't think I'll post again on this thread. I feel it's gone a little far. I can also be reached in game, but prefer cyber to abuse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Thank you Chutoi for summing up many shaman issues nicely.  <br />
<br />
RAID MANA REGENERATION<br />
<br />
So cann5 is our only big mana regen booster, and if you work out the numbers including one cast of BoT to repair the damage from cann5, this equates out to about 30 extra mana regen per tick.  Comparing 30 to the 0 that most other casters get may seem very significant, but on a raid, everyone generally has bot9 (8), SD (9), VoQ (18), bard song (20+), horse, ft15, clicky effects, etc.  All of a sudden an extra 30 is much less significant.  It certainly doesn't cover the descrepency between the power of another caster's spells versus our own spells' power.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every hybrid and pure caster has their own means of regenning mana at 65. Most have self buffs that provide a mana regen of some sort, or taps etc. Necro's regen mana way better than a shaman (I have a 61 necro that blows my mana away due to regena nd spell efficiency) and theres is relatively inactive, except they have to provide DPS by lifetapping when they heal themselves. Shaman get unfairly penalized simply because we got our mana regen at level 24, although chanters and necros both get thiers earlier and thiers is passive.</div></div><hr />

I simply meant that we dont have to run backwards like mishapen roosters while some spectre hits the thing in the back, heh. I sit on my Lizard, and move MAYBE a total of 10 steps per mob. Of course, thats the only way I can keep up with the Necro mana-wise. His is passive, and mine is active. Still, even with the pet and better DOTs, a necro is only getting 2 or 3 more an hour than I am, usually. I never have to break for mana, either (of course, neither do Necros, they just stay in Lich and tap). <br />

I will take that in exchange for not having to kite :)</div></div><hr />

Only if there is a Chanter present though, because I MUST be turned to a Gnome before I will even CONSIDER this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">Thing is, the necro is a pretty welcome kiter at POF tables, where they'll be doing 3 or 4 mobs at once.  Shamans can fit in there, but they're not nearly as welcome as another pure caster.  Shamans with bane aren't suffering at tables(though the time to kill the mobs triples without LDON dots) when they solo, but ... neither are necros or druids or wizards or mages.  I don't feel terribly sorry for either them or us(if we have those LDON dots) at tables.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:)  I'm still pretty steamed that Ancient Chaotic Pain is an ancient spell.  If that one spell were more easily attainable it would make the entire expansion worthwhile to me, grrr.  However, I digress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">So am I.  This thing should be on a vendor.  The amount of a mana pool that canni 4 gives you these days compared to when the spell first came out is very different.  There's no particular reason that our canni ability has to scale up only if you get a rare drop in, oh, say the toughest zone in the game.  (Except that we're shamans?)  <br />
<br />
The entire game has scaled up quite a bit since canni 4 was first introduced.  There is no reason that a spell as fundamental to the definition of what a shaman is and does as canni should scale up to keep pace with the content.  <br />
<br />
I remember when I first got canni 4 and canni 5.  They did a LOT.  They were meant to.  Now, canni 5 replaces only a bubble and a quarter of my mana, and canni 4's rate of replacement of my mana has become a lot less spectacular, to say the least.  For better-equipped shamans -- and I'm only in full ornate with an elemental cloak, mask, and belt -- canni 4 and 5 are more trivial still.  <br />
<br />
Upgrading at least canni 4 is long overdue; it would hardly be a special new thing that shamans have never had.  It would just be putting us a little more toward where we were. <br />
<br />
I think Sony is just completely at a loss as to what they can possibly do with the shaman class.  I think they are just bewildered and stumped -- and not trying too hard.  Simple issues like this should be obvious for anyone who has played the class much.  Unfortunately, Brenlo only played to 50...quite a while ago too, I bet.  Their best bet for internal advice really doesn't understand the class at all.</div></div><hr />

If you're chain casting Tnargs/Daludas and the PC on the other end is still getting killed in 10 seconds then it doesn't matter if you can regain that mana in 30 or 40 seconds.  <br />

Upping our mana regen is like putting a bandaid on the scrape on your elbow while ignoring your sucking chest wound.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree though, at least our healing has to somewhat keep up with the short term capabilities of other classes.</div></div><hr />

How many times must it be said that Ancient Chaotic Pain is not a &quot;mana regen upgrade&quot; it is a &quot;oww my freaking wrists hurt like a bards because I have to twist canni4 into every other cast, please help&quot; upgrade.  Yes, it would be possible to abuse ACP a bit by sacraficing another spell gem to have both memmed but as has been said, mana regen isn't really a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">Sciek, I never proposed scaling up our canni spell as any kind of alternative to getting better healing or more DPS or anything else, nor do I think it has any bearing on whether we would ever get any better DPS or healing or anything else.  <br />
<br />
I simply pointed out a clear and true fact:  canni 4 and canni 5 both do far less for shamans now than they did when they came out, and thus have declined in value.  This much is unassailable, regardless of your or my concerns about anything else.  Just because you like dogs doesn't mean you don't like cats, if you follow.  It's not a good assumption.  <br />
<br />
I do think this needs to be addressed, and it's very obvious that this should not be addressed with an ancient spell.  It makes no sense to argue that only SOME of our abilities should scale up with new expansions, and that core abilities should scale up only by getting a rare spell in a zone virtually nobody in the game will ever get to, if you think about the numbers.<br />
<br />
Canni is incredibly tedious and aggravating and even physically not that great for you.  I'm not going to say it's anything but, and it's fair to point out how far our canni ability has fallen behind.  That IS a problem.  It doesn't become NOT a problem just because we have other problems too.  When I got canni 5, the first shaman on my server to have it, I had 1940 hitpoints, as I recall.  Both canni 4 and 5 were far more powerful then.<br />
<br />
Please don't confuse your desire to address other shaman weaknesses with a lack of my own desire to address them.  Personally, I'm tired of the &quot;never mention it!&quot; school of looking at shamans and their needs.  If I want to mention something that looks like it needs work -- and it's as completely true as canni's greatly diminished power over the years -- I'm darn well going to mention it.<br />
<br />
So there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">Well written Chut.  I didn't read alot of the replies (the post wore me out a bit), but everyone here knows that Shaman and GoD do not mix.  I think you covered many of the relevant points where GoD has taken us out of the equasion.  As far as the 5%, it is somewhat moot since nobody added in the cast times for Malos/Turgur.  It could be 50% for all I care, but if the mob is down to 60% health before the slow lands, you still haven't save the Cleric a heal, therefore you wasted mana.  <br />
<br />
I think the most important thing that you stressed was that we need a role.  Something that makes groupleaders think about us when putting a trial group together.  Not many people care what gems they need to load for encounters, they care about making it to the encounter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">The % difference between Shaman slows to others is directly proportional to the amount of time the slow is running against the entire duration of the fight. There is a 20% difference in damage between Shaman and Enchanters slows but only once slows have landed. You have to include the damage mobs do whilst unslowed into the equation then take total damage difference for the full duration of the fight to calculate the effective difference.<br />
<br />
 Hypothetical situation :<br />
<br />
Say your GoD mob with low HP and high DPS mob gets slowed at 50% health for a fight lasting 30 seconds.  This means they do full damage for 50% of the fight and are 75% slowed for 50% with Shaman slow or 70% slowed with Enchanter slow.<br />
<br />
In a case of a mob that does 1000 DPS for a fight that lasts 30 seconds then you have 1000 DPS for 15 seconds (15000 damage) and 250DPS over 15 seconds (3750 damage) the rest of the time for Shaman.<br />
<br />
In a case of a mob that does 1000DPS for a fight that lasts 30 seconds then you have 1000 DPS for 15 seconds (15000 damage) and 300DPS over 15 seconds (4500 damage) the rest of the time for Enchanter.<br />
<br />
The net result % difference in damage taken is 3.8%. The 20% argument requires a mob to be slowed 100% of the fight.<br />
<br />
End of Hypothetical situation:<br />
<br />
<br />
Including MR debuff an Enchanter can land slow faster than a Shaman so the % difference gets closer and closer to 0% damage dealt between Shaman slowing and Enchanter slowing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i couldn`t be bother to work it out but i knew that somin wasnt right with the 20% theory, and practice, of course a good way to sort this is to make balance 75% with a higher resist modifier so that i lands most of the time, not sure but i assume 55 to 60 would do that?  and remove the 6 sec  recast. personally in god or anywhere else i dont think that would be really overpowering as slow would land just 10 sec before it would have or less as alot of mobs below god hard lodn slow lands without malo anyway, though it would help alot in god and hard lodn</div></div><hr />
