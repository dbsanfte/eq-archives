<br />
if our slow are  only partially landed,we will be less and less in demand in xp groups.<br />
<br />
partially slowed mean we will have a hard time to solo, as well when xp groups would choose other class because they can add well more dps.<br />

shaman need a fix IMO, they could give us better heal at least,to compensate :mad:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So far, in my admittedly limited experience in OoW, I think it works well for shamans.  Mobs seem to me to do their dps by hitting softer than GoD mobs, but faster, and once slowed (even partially) a shaman can keep up with healing no problem.  I find that Bane can usually run full course as well, so we can actually do a modicum of DPS while we're at it.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Other slowing classes are frustrated by resists also, and I think that gives us a slight advantage. Some of the mobs in Muramite Proving Grounds have crazy resists, and without malos, can take 4 or 5 casts to land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm having a blast in OoW so far. The mitigation sucks, but it does give us more fuel for us to argue against the 47% Heal crap.<br />
<br />
Before it was mostly high end gamers that were encountering mobs all the time that mitigate. Most other Shaman would only see it in certain zones from time to time or from mob to mob. Now that there's an expansion where every mob mitigates all Shaman have more of a reason to complain about the illogic of Rytan's healing formula.<br />
<br />
Even then, we can keep up as Healers in some of the content despite mitigated slows. Mobs don't hit insanely as hard as GoD and last longer allowing us to be more useful. Our slows actually make a difference. <br />
<br />
One thing I've noticed so far and liking a lot is that a lot of the mobs I've encountered seem to have low disease resist. Virulent Paralysis rarely gets resisted and so far it's been a real great tool for playing the ghetto crowd controller. :)</div></div><hr />

The real problem is that Slow isn't as powerful as it used to be due to mitigation(like it or dislike it, I am not starting a debate in this thread), and that our other abilities, namely DPS and healing, are way too weak compared to others.<br />
<br />
You seriously need to check out the DPS a DPS class does in PG. Seriously, DPS is as screwed as healing in terms of balance(healing is a critical function, though, and deserves way more attention). <br />
Yesterday I parsed my tank, a warrior, at 250 DPS(including procs) constantly for 8 hours straight, while I was sitting at 130 on average.</div></div><hr />

Chanters get groups for CC AND slowing, bsts for DPS AND slowing. Groups really get Shaman for DPS.<br />
<br />
Our DPS is negligible in OOW, and what Giac said is true. Especially with levels people are doing 200+ DPS constantly, and a 70 rogue in my guild told me he was doing like 450+ with the new crit AA. I was in PoF C1 with him and we were killing mobs in 25 seconds. Without our spells we can't even compare as in keep up like 1/3 of that constantly.<br />
<br />
Mid-level OOW content is also difficult enough that most groups feel safer with a cleric to heal. However,  likely the cleric won't need any help so we can't heal. No I don't consider WoS mid-level content when we can solo the mobs there with tanking.</div></div><hr />

Well aside for my character's rugged good looks (dodges the rotten fruit thrown at him), I used to get invited as a healer as well.  Mostly because I could mix and match a group together with a role in mind for myself.  Now, granted, that's not always effective as there was content you'd NEED a cleric, or some other class to make it all work.  Still, our diversity means we could often do a job and try to make ourselves usefull at it.  I will say that the class does not look to be balanced and is lacking, but to say we were only really viable as a slower isn't honest or true.  If SoE gave us some burst DPS, fixxed DOT aggro, and/or made some very minor positive adjustments to healing and DoTs, the class would be fine.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Mitigation is good.  Imagine all these mitigating mobs were immune to slow.  We'd be completely hosed.  That said, they applied something that was suppossed to be limited to bosses, minis and other named to even trash mobs on a WAY too large a scale.  Stupid move on their part.</div></div><hr />

Giac,<br />
<br />
I agree that slow is our most important contribution in most cases.  However, Suddail stated it was our only contribution, that is Horse Crap.<br />
<br />
And please answer me this;<br />
<br />
What would the War's dps be without your buffs, haste, and heals.  How long would he be able to sustain 250dps without those things?  Sure, his dps is pretty good, because he is focused on one thing, doing dps to hold aggro, and you are helping him do it.  Yet your 130dps is just you and your own buffs.  Not bad dps at all considering you are helping the War and the rest of the group at the same time.  <br />
<br />
Let me see a War sustain 250dps for 8 hrs straight self-buffed and self-healed.  Or let the War do something that helps boost my dps, or any other ability.  Then we have a fair comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Heh, if thats horsecrap... when was the last time you were invited to a group for another reason than to be the slower?

<br />
More Horse Crap.  <br />
<br />
Giac already stated he was contributing 130dps, not negligible by any stretch, especially considering that he was also slowing, buffing, debuffing, spot healing, etc.  All the War was doing was holding aggro, by doing as much damage as he could.  That's 52% of the damage being done by the War, who is only focused on doing one thing, and who is benefitting from the buffs and haste, etc. provided by the shaman.  Not too damn bad for a support character. <br />
<br />
For some unknown reason you think you have to compare shaman to rogues for dps, clerics for healing, etc.  Man, pull your head out.  In your world, we should only have War's for tanks, Clerics for healers and Rogues for dps, only the best, the rest are sub-par and not worth grouping with.    <br />
<br />
Well sorry buddy, but the game is not designed around that model.  It is the few narrow-minded players that feel that way that attempt to ruin it for the rest.  A good group is any group that can kill the mobs without getting killed at a reasonable rate.  Period.  Class does not matter.  In some zones or with some mobs, you may have more success with a specific skill or class being a part of the group, but in very rare situations do you have to have a specific class.<br />
<br />
I get groups because I slow, I heal, I buff, I debuff, I do dps, and most importantly, I'm fun to play with.  I help my group any way I can, and they usually both notice and appreciate it.  I get groups because I'm a good player that contributes to making the group better.  I make a difference.  Maybe you don't, that would truly suck.  <br />
<br />
Try playing with folks that are good players and are fun to play with, not just the ones the are going to give you the most dps, or best of anything.  Hell, don't even parse and track the dps, etc.  Don't worry about dps, who's slow landed first, whether your stat buffs are really helping, does the debuff really help?  Just play and make the most of the it.  You may be surprised and actually have fun.<br />
<br />
THIS IS A GAME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Not a high end player anymore....but I dual box with my warrior or hunt with my smallish guild, and I dont have any problem healing or slowing.

<br />
It would be nice to have a 'chance' to land a full slow since it is a main shaman job, but I wont cry w/o fulls.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">That's 52% of the damage being done by the War, who is only focused on doing one thing, and who is benefitting from the buffs and haste, etc. provided by the shaman.

Actually, your analysis is faulty.<br />
1) the total DPS you're adding to a warrior through haste and other buffs isn't really all that great.  Haste adds more than any other buff we have and even so, there are other 2 other classes I'd rather get haste from than a shaman.  If those classes are not around then shaman haste will bridge the gap between item haste and the cap (in most cases some of this is wasted).  The buffs on the other hand are at best, minor helps.<br />
2) If the shaman is MH than yes, his contribution is vital, but easily replacable with a cleric or druid.  Meanwhile, the warrior as MA isn't suppossed to be primarly a DPS class, their main role is holding aggro.  If they don't do that then you become a smear on the wall.  The MA is arguably one of the most important roles in any group and I feel like you have attempted to trivialise that with your statement.<br />
3) Really, most of what you two are saying can be broken depending on group make up.  In some groups a shaman is vital, in others the shaman is occupying a spot.  It used to be different when slow meant something and before a mitigated slow was not appreciably more noticable when cast by a shaman rather than a BL.  LAstly, slow meant something when every trash mob in a dungeon wasn't mitigating slow.  SoE went mitigation crazy.<br />
<br />
It is the few narrow-minded players that feel that way that attempt to ruin it for the rest.  A good group is any group that can kill the mobs without getting killed at a reasonable rate.  Period.  Class does not matter.  In some zones or with some mobs, you may have more success with a specific skill or class being a part of the group, but in very rare situations do you have to have a specific class.<br />
The class does not matter bit was actually funny.  A good cookiecutter group in GoD will still be a good cookiecutter group in OoW and will still outperform non-standard groups.  Shaman are not key parts in cookie cutter groups.<br />
<br />
Lastly, every class brings something to the table, but shaman had their biggest contribution nuked without any compensation or even without any official definition of what role SoE thinks we should be playing.  It doesn't take a genius to figure out we are in a skill deficit based on this very obvious fact.<br />
<br />
I really don't see how a few people are ruining the game for you unless they are KSing or griefing you.  If a few people complaining about balance ruins the game for you then you should really take a break and take it easy.  I mean, it's not like SoE is making negaitve changes due to their input.  If anything, the class is actually getting some minor improvements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Tarthug,<br />
<br />
Please re-read my posts, somehow you managed to miss all of my points.  I'll make it simple.<br />
<br />
First of all, how the hell is my analysis faulty, the numbers don't lie.  It actually happens to be dead on.  52% of the War's dps is pretty darn good.  Now parse the War without buffs and haste and tell me what his dps is.  Add the difference to the shamans dps, x4 for each of the other melees, and that's how much dps the shaman has contributed to the group.  So dps plus our heals, debuffs, and other contributions will equal our value to the group.<br />
<br />
Yes, the MA is extremely important, I never said he was not.  Not sure what you read to give you this impression, please re-read.  But I stand by my statement that he is focused on 1 thing, holding aggro.  The way to do that is to damage the mob and taunt.  The shaman on the other hand is doing a number of things, including helping the other members of the group do their jobs better.<br />
<br />
The War is not helping me slow better, or heal better or anything else.  Yeah, he is keeping me alive.  Good that's his job.  But gee, I'm not only keeping him alive, with my heals, I'm also helping him do his job better.<br />
<br />
My other points, in simple to read format:<br />
<br />
1.  You don't need a cookie-cutter group that maximizes dps or exp to have fun.<br />
<br />
I don't worry about dps, or having the very best of anything.  I find guys that I like to play with, make sure we can do everything we need to, and go find a place to play.  I've had BST MA, shammys (besides me, yeah, 2 shaman in one group, what a sin) MH, and just about any class provide dps.  My so-called &quot;non-standard&quot; groups may not grind exp as fast as your cookie-cutter group, but we have a hell of a lot of fun playing.  My regular guild group has a pally MA and she usually pulls.  We're just a bunch of fun loving underachievers.<br />
<br />
2.  A shaman can contribute to just about any group in just about any situation.  <br />
<br />
Our versatility guarantees this.  IMHO we are good enough at enough things to always make the group better.<br />
<br />
3.  Other classes may be better at one thing or another, but the group is as good as the sum of the parts.  <br />
<br />
I don't care what classes are in the group, yup, you read that right.  As long as we can pull without getting overrun, tank well enough to keep everyone alive, and kill the mob before it kills any of us, then we've been successful.  I don't have to have a cleric, or a war, or 4 rogues.  I'll play with anyone that knows their class, contributes to the group, and is not a total jackass.<br />
<br />
The folks that ruin the game for me are the ones that parse every encounter, try to maximize dps or whatever for themselves and every member of the group, and complain when they get .001% less dps or exp because they don't have the perfect group.  That is the attitude that I detest, those are the folks I will not play with.<br />
<br />
I play to have fun.  It's that simple.  If everyone shared this view, we'd all be better off, and much happier.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I'm having a blast in EQ right now, Omens included.  If I wasn't, I wouldn't be paying for it.  And I avoid the people with the &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; mentality like the plague that they are.  That mentality may be good for a competitive sporting event, but not for a game.<br />
<br />
I am not arguing that shaman are just perfect.  We badly needed some tweaking, and we got some.  We could probably stand a bit more.  But, even in our current condition, I can and do contribute to my group, and we enjoy playing together and accomplishing our goals.  I certainly won't turn-down a better heal, or less slow mitigation, etc.  But I also won't sit here on the boards crying the blues and making statements like, &quot;slow is all that a shaman brings to a group.&quot;  That is Horse Crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>meepsthewizzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">From a wizard perspective I find shammys to be very usefull in OOW. The day Omens opened my group headed to Walls of Slaughter &amp; took the caves camp thats past the castle area in the far top left hand of the zone. Our group consisted of a warrior, enchanter, cleric, bard &amp; 2 wizzys. Mobs were dying slow &amp; both myself &amp; the other wizzy were having VERY bad resist problems. At least half my nukes were fully resisted. The next day I went back to the same camp with a sk, cleric, bard, BL, shammy &amp; myself ( wizzy ).  With the shammy Maloing on INC my nukes were landing for full at least 95% of time, I'd estimate my DPS at least doubled &amp; probably tripled as a result of malo. OOW mobs seem to hit for less but hit faster, slow is definately needed on the harder camps. <br />
In the Proving Grounds trash mobs ( at least deeper in ) hit pretty damn hard &amp; most rampage. A shammy to slow, back up heal &amp; rampage heal takes alot of strain off the cleric imo. I cant think of a single reason to take a BL or Chanter over a shammy in this zone. Almost all mobs are single pulled there is almost no need for CC. The ideal group in this zone is cleric, warrior ( to tank named ), shammy &amp; 3 top DPS classes. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">ok all the mobs i tried to slow (green con up to red ) all  were partially slowed in OOW.<br />

if our slow are  only partially landed,we will be less and less in demand in xp groups.<br />
<br />
partially slowed mean we will have a hard time to solo, as well when xp groups would choose other class because they can add well more dps.<br />
<br />
shaman need a fix IMO, they could give us better heal at least,to compensate :mad:<br />
<br />
Yep shocked me when in Draniks Scar looking round i got jumped by a couple of  greens and they both mitigated slow.<br />
<br />
Shaman have to face it though we will never get back to Kunark times in regards to our power.<br />
Sony also have to face it though that we are still left behind by too much in new content.<br />
Im having great fun in OoW at the moment but there again after GoDs  tweaking Shaman were still sought after there till people sussed out a lot of the content and could work out the optimal way to do trials etc was without a shaman.<br />
Cast Bane on a mob in Wall of Slaughter yesterday after slowing it and was totally shocked to see it run its course and still have time to use a couple of ticks of the recast.<br />
BUT just because we're happy with OoW at the moment does that mean we should forgive and forget our previously bad showing in GoD ?.<br />

A) your a crap shammy<br />
B) you have a crap group.<br />
<br />
I get invited in to groups for many reason<br />
<br />
Dots<br />
Slows<br />
Buffs<br />
Backup heals<br />
and if im bored I dont do any of them and I tank instead thats always fun.<br />
<br />
Flame me all you like I could not care less, but a shammy has alot more in them than just slows. Ok our DPS are not the best, and neither our heals.<br />
<br />
But we have the extra dps in Dots, we can help clerics/druids healing, and the best bit is, we can get our mana back a hell of a lot faster than the above classes</div></div><hr />

What would the War's dps be without your buffs, haste, and heals.  How long would he be able to sustain 250dps without those things?  <br />
<br />
1.Depends if you were the MH then as stated we are brought to the group for that.<br />
2.What buffs ? Keep reading on here the only buff that will affect a hight end warrior is FA and they say that only  adds 1 dps.<br />
3.I would think (though i dont know and too lazy to work it out) that Enchanter haste would increase a warriors dps far more than all our buffs and haste.<br />
<br />
The good thing about OoW content that ive done so far is that a group doesnt NEED a back up healer.Therefore most groups will pick a shaman over a drood.<br />

Try getting through Vxed/ Tipt as a wizard..chanter charmed pet is such sick dps that literally NO dps classes are needed ( wizard least of all ). The problem with Vxed/Tipt is the rediculasly overpowered charmed pet. In a non charm group I think shammys do very well here, tank cleric, shammy, puller &amp; 2 DPS classes is ideal. The classes that should really be complaining about Vxed/Tipt are knights, wizards &amp; mages. I dunno if its just me but when I have a GOOD shammy in my group the group always runs very smoothly, although I do agree if your a gimp shammy who just slows your pretty much dead weight.</div></div><hr />

I guess you only cast FA on your groupmates?  OK, maybe haste too?  No Fo7?  What, they don't want the extra 544 hps?  Or the extra 680 hp in Wunshi?  And I'm sure every single member of your group has max stats, not just the tank, so all the other group stat buffs aren't worth casting either?  Guess they don't want the 5-10% damage modifier, or the 7% melee avoidance modifier?  According to you all this stuff is useless junk, not worth casting.  I guess I'm not uber enough to feel your pain.  Also, remind me not to group with you.<br />
<br />
hehehe, man, some of you guys really make me laugh.  The same people that state how worthless our buffs are, since they only add x number of hp, or only result in &quot;very little&quot; additional dps, are the same ones that will run over their own grandmothers to loot a piece of gear with +5 increase to hp or AC on it.

The problem isn't the mitigation.   It's that everything in this expansion migates.   This is the first expansion that SoE rolled migation across the board 100% on NPC's - trash to raid targets (by most reports).    <br />
<br />
Another item of note ... I noticed that some mobs were fluxing (mitigating?) DoT damage.   In the midst of a DoT (Blood) running on a green, light blue , and DB mobs - hit for full once, twice, then half damage, full, third damage, full, etc.   This was after Malos as well with focus IV.   It's been awhile since I've seen a DB mob not take full if not extra damage of DoT's once it stuck.</div></div><hr />

I gotta admit, I have been one of the biggest supporters of the &quot;Shaman are broken&quot; movement, but OoW has me leaning back toward the &quot;we are actually OK, not fantastic, but OK&quot; side of the fence. <br />
<br />
I was in a WoS group the other night. Was me, Paladin tank (not great geared, either, not even 9K hps buffed, still needs STA to max her stats, but she has a Hopebringer), Enchanter, Wizard, Wizard, and I was main-healing and Malos-slowing just fine. In fact, we pulled 3 nameds (not all at once), and while the Chanter was chain-runing the pally to help mitigate the DPS, I think I could have held her up easily and STILL ran a couple DOTs. I was running BoS and bane on most pulls, and they were going full duration, even with Wiz + Wiz in group. My mana was constantly around 50%, but I managed. I even pulled most of the time, to get Malos down early, since I didnt have the Gates slow at the time. Even on add pulls, VP was extremely useful, and root.<br />
<br />
OoW is GREAT for shamans, folks. I am backing off. They upped the damage on our Nukes and DOTs a bit (a bone, yes, but its better than a sharp stick in the eye), and the AAs are damn solid for us. About the ONLY thing I can see worth bitching about is the Ancient heal should be made into a Lvl 70 regular spell, but thats it. I am satisfied. <br />
<br />
Of course we still have issues. Every class in this game has issues. But my personal issues with my class got WAY WAY lower-priority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That pretty much sums it up for me also.  Yeah, there are more tweaks required, no doubt about it.  DoT aggro still makes no sense.  And in some areas we are still marginal healers.  But, overall, SoE has taken some steps in the right direction.  Longer fights (slow (even mitigated) and dots mean something), less mob dps (don't need very high burst healing which we don't have, HoTs are effective), stat buffs over cap, avoidance and damage modifier buffs, and almost all areas are open, without trials or flags.  Lots of the things we asked for.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not saying we stop asking for the other adjustments, not at all.  Lets just be civil about it and continue the dialog using &quot;real&quot; examples of the issues, not these absurd statements like &quot;all shaman bring to a group is slow.&quot;  Silly statements like this destroy all of our credibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Have you been main healer in Proving Grounds?<br />
<br />
While it is possible, the risk is abosuletely unacceptable, because it requires Slow to land on inc. And even then I am taking a few rounds of damage. All this while I am supposed to heal myself and the group.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't dislike challenging content, and while Omens has been the better expansion of the two(GoD is definitely worse), our issues aren't as content related as you might hope. <br />
Wait a few days before cheering up and you will see that the inherent problems of our class haven't changed at all and you are doing us all a disservice.<br />
<br />
Classes are balanced by balancing them among them in the different areas and by giving them a touch of uniqueness, then create the content. They are not balanced by somehow adjusting the content for X class.<br />
<br />
The gap between a few classes who share the same &quot;jobs&quot; and are recruited to fill a certain role is way too big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Have you been main healer in Proving Grounds?<br />
To be honest Giac, at some point we are going to have to bite the bullet and accept the fact that SOE has decided that Shaman should NOT play a role as &quot;main healers&quot; in the TOP TOP content of the game, period. And frankly, its not that big a deal to me. I never was big on the &quot;I wanna main heal&quot; thing, if you remember correctly. We got bumps in our nukes and DOTs. We got some buffs that matter. We still have de-bufs that show usefullness, the new Cripple will be nice in places where mobs flurry and proc a ton, the new Slow is turning out to be a godsend, etc etc. I think its time to give SOE some credit, where credit is due. <br />
<br />
The entire healing system needs to be examined and overhauled for there to be any real improvement in the situation. Shaman have a HIGH desirability for groups in PG. I spent 5 hours in there the other night and I was EXTREMELY useful. I tried different spells like Cripple, various combinations of nukes and DOTs to check aggro, and I was happy with my contribution. The cleric and I worked out a healing plan that was VERY effecive. I was a full, 100% member of that group, something I havent felt for a while in Gates and upper PoP. <br />
<br />
As I said, we arent perfect. Far from it. I think the ancient heal should be a straight up lvl 70 spell. THAT would give us a nice shot at main-healing even harder stuff, like 2nd Field WoS (doable, but difficult). But SOE has a spot in the game for us, and to be honest, I dont mind where they stuck us, for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand your point, and agree, it can be a real challenge.  But in your example you are talking about a shaman who is debuffing, slowing and healing an entire group.  Sounds like it was a challenge, but doable, and that's what I love about shaman.  No other class in the game can do what you did.  None.  <br />
<br />
Maybe the risk is too great in PG, but in many other zones and LDoN a good shaman can fill 2 critical roles, slower and healer, at the same time.  Is there another class that can do this as well as a shaman?<br />
<br />
Now, if you really want to know how well we heal, then go back to PG with another shaman.  Let him malos and slow, you MH.  Then come back and let us know how you did.  I'm not sure that a shaman is a great healer in that zone, have not tried.  But, I'd be interested in knowing how you did in that scenario.</div></div><hr />

In poe I tried to convince everyone to let me malos/nuke/dot instead of slow, so we could get more out of the druids ds, they wouldn't have it..<br />
<br />
Clerics can tell when they're healing more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I guess we have a different opinion on what is a full contributing member then. I know that I can't main heal savely and that I can't be more than 50% of a tanking warrior's DPS. <br />
I am there to partially slow the mobs, get a beating, because I want to do it fast or I'll feel useless and then nuke and DoT(which are resisted a ****load), which sometimes gets me another nice beating due to the broken aggro.<br />

<br />
Sorry brother bear, but this is what YOU think you get groups for. The reality is that OTHER people invite us for slow. Thats a fact.<br />
<br />
Obviously every group doesnt fall into that, i mean your buddies dont invite you on slow alone and maybe a LDoN easy will invite you for the reasons you listed, but when you move to higher content then LDoN easy and hit up GoD and higher PoP, you just the slower. Sure you can heal if the cleric goes LD or something and act as a saftey net. But when the group is being put together it goes just like this....<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot; ok we need a slower &quot;<br />
&quot; Any Shaman looking for group ? &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Not<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey we need some DPS&quot;<br />
&quot; Invite that shaman, he can DoT and slow and heal if we need it&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Somebody tell me, if your experiences especially in PG are different. Hell, maybe I am just wrong, tell me!<br />
I spent 5 hours the other night in PG. Group was Warrior, Cleric, Rogue, Necro, Chanter, Shaman (me). It was a relatively simple matter to Malos on inc, Slow upon engauge, maybe get smacked, maybe not, then drop a DOT, an HoT on the tank, maybe Cripple the mob, FA the rogue, and drop at least one nuke. Bane running full duration and at least one VS each fight. If the chanter got aggro from Tash, the cleric didnt have to worry about healing her. If the Rogue dindt evade, same thing, I was there with a BoT. I didnt have Nihil at the time, but even if I did, I still would have malosed, because of Bane and VS resists. <br />
<br />
I dunno, is seems like I did exactly what I was designed to do. Mitigate some damage with a slow (albeit partial, its STILL mitigated damage and these fights were in that &quot;1 minute&quot; range where it becomes more useful). I was there to back-up heal the group so the cleric could focus on the MA. I kept FA up on the rogue and warrior. I kept regen, focus and billy up on the group. My role was respectable. Could a Druid have filled my slot better? Probably. Chanter could have slowed, etc etc. But my DPS wasnt trivial, Bane ran full duration on nearly every single mob, and thats with a BIG warrior, a rogue, and a necro, all Time + Ikky geared, contributing DPS. FA is pretty good DPS for us, honestly, the +attck makes a HUGE difference on red con mobs. <br />
<br />
I am not saying we are fixed, I am saying that we are MUCH better than we were. I am saying I dont feel like I am the bottom of the barrel anymore. We arent the best class in EQ, but so what. I am not unhappy with where I am. Sure, I will take more, and continue to ask for the tweaks and adjustments I think we need, but its simply not &quot;do or die&quot; for me anymore, not even close.</div></div><hr />

You aren't listening. That's the problem with most people who don't understand the issue(not saying who agree with, but understand the issue).<br />
I wasn't filling two critical roles. Who cares if the mob gets slowed or not as long as you can heal the tank and keep your group up?<br />
<br />
If you break it down, all I did, was Healing. Slowing just made it possible to heal for me. You just broke down 1 function into 3, because Shamans have to work 3 tiems as hard to fill 1 simple role.<br />
<br />
And to add another thing. I did all that and it was risky, but there's like 20 Shamans on all servers who would have been able to do that.<br />
&quot;The Shaman&quot; can not.</div></div><hr />

Guess they don't want the 5-10% damage modifier, or the 7% melee avoidance modifier?  <br />

Nope im one of these cast every buff going shaman its up to people to click off what they dont want.<br />
Stat buffs are useless at the higher end (so we're constantly told) so buff wise all youre contributing is 680hp or in my case 544hp (which a BST can buff for more).<br />

Man, I thought I was done with this thread, but I have to correct this misinformation.  You are doing a disservice to anyone who comes to the boards looking for information if you claim that the role of &quot;slower&quot; is not a part of the standard game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Most groups see the value of lowering the mobs dps, not only because it reduces the need for healing, but because it also lowers the overall risk of the battle.  Healing generates aggro for the healer, more healing generates more aggro for the healer.  Slow lowers mob dps, and thereby lowers need to heal.  Less healing means less aggro for healer.  Results in tank maintaing aggro easier, and likelyhood of an oh sh1t if you get an add goes down.  Slowing the mob makes the combat more manageable, in many respects.<br />
<br />
You said you're realistic, kk, then lets be real, the standard group template of roles is tank, healer, slower, puller, dps.  Most players would say those are the roles required.  You may not excel at one or more of these, but someone usually performs each of these functions.  True, of the list, slower is the only optional one.  However, in game, most groups see this as a vital function, not just a nice to have.<br />
<br />
Now, telling me that there are only three roles, tank, healer, dps, is accurate.  However, that's like saying you don't need food and water to live, because you can get all the water you need from certain foods.  Technically you'd be right, but in real life, for the vast majority, that's just not how it works.<br />
<br />
Same here, you can say, oh just take multiple healers, same difference.  Yeah, sounds good, but is rarely done that way.  Why take 2 clerics when I can take a cleric and a shammy, and with the combination of damage mitigation (from slow) and healing (from both the cleric and shaman), I can keep the tank alive and take advantage of the other benefits that a shammy provides.<br />
<br />
Granted, there are a very few instances where 2 clerics are required, perhaps some of the GoD trials.  But 99% of the time, for an exp group, you will see a healer and a slower in the group.  How many groups do you see with a cleric, druid and no slower?  Pretty damn rare if you ask me.  Can it be done this way, maybe.  Would most players want that type of group, probably not.<br />
<br />
Please don't trivialize the role of slow (damage mitigation).  It is a very important part of the current mechanics of the game.  You can say there is no &quot;slower&quot; in the game.  But that would be a false statement.  The way the game is actually played DEFINITELY includes a slower in most situations.  The common definition of the EQ trinity is tank, healer, slower.<br />
<br />

True, my bad, but I think you understood my meaning (and thank you for pointing it out so cordially, did you have anything else of value to contribute?).  When was the last time you saw a raid with no slowers?  I guess shaman are recruited by guilds because of their great healing.  :)<br />
<br />
Come on, in all honesty, saying slow is not required is a true statement.  But saying that it is not a very important part of how 99% of the player base views and plays the game is not.  Hell, a lot of things are possible, but lets talk about how most people actually play the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Slow is required.<br />
<br />
We all know this. It is the safety net for good xp.<br />
<br />
It decreases the risk and stress for the healers. That we can heal is a bonus. (A pretty big one)<br />
<br />
But. If the cleric can heal enough for the whole group. (Which pretty much they can) then the added benifit from a shaman becomes pretty much unimportant.<br />
<br />
To fix the shaman/ cleric problem is a simple one. Make shaman HoTs Stack with clerics. And keep Shaman Hot's Lower in hitpoints per tick but make them tick longer. (6 tick base on all of em would be about right) Make our contrubution be that if we have a HoT on the tank then the cleric has one less thing to worry about but the option is still there. Just like it is right now for Shaman Druid healing combos. And the other change should be Also a simple one. With the call of the wild ability. Once a shaman resses the body and the spirit back together then the druid should be able to restore the lost exp. (Or the other way around) If both the shaman and druid are working in conjunction then the cleric's help should not be required at all. <br />
<br />
That would give us balance. A cleric and a druid workign together certainly dont need a shaman They can DS and cause a mob to drop quite fast. (Stackable DS with the cleric line and druid line. And yes Virginia it adds up to considerable damage) They might take a slower for ease of mind but in kill time that actually hurts them but makes it more comfortable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ahh well lets see how long the Till omens is shipped excuse holds up from SoE. MAybe we can get an awnser a month after it is live. (Yeah Right)</div></div><hr />

Sir, you have a major chip on your shoulders.   The starting point of this thread was that seemingly all OOW NPC's migate slow.   This includes not only migate slow but are highly resistant for all mobs for every OOW mob. This is not debateable issue, it has become a fact.<br />

Anyone that has been exping in Omens and can tell me right to the face that a group needs slow, please do so. <br />
Clerics in Omens rediscovered CH, which is so stupidly efficient still(and again), that a partial slow hardly matters or makes a difference. <br />
<br />
On top of the rediscovered efficiency for long fights they still kept their absymal advanatage in the healing per second department and, thanks to us Shamans(fighting the HoT battle for them), are actually starting to enjoy their 1170/tick elixier and use it from time to time *for the first time ever*.<br />
<br />
But enough with the healing issue. It's a known issue, and Sony won't be able to get rid of it without a revamp of the healing paradigm. While slow experienced a reduced affectivness due to ultra short fights during GoD, it's now the exaggerated slow mitigation put on every stupid mob that is restricting it's power(a power that you seem to be claiming is our main function).<br />
For the love of god, these mobs should hit harder and be fully slowable and you'd have the same stupid result in mob DPS.<br />

I think you are missing his point Giac. While it is technically possible to do certain things without slow, pretty much all groups will take a slower because at some point things are going to go wrong, you are going to get an add, the cleric is going to agro and die, whatever. And when that happens if you have a problem if mobs are not slowed. Most groups form and try to achieve some objective, whether it's completing a trial, killing a named, or just xping, whatever. Not having a slower makes achieving those that much more difficult than it needs to be. It's a practical issue, not a theoretical one.<br />
<br />
But, lets put your money where your mouth is. Go and ask people in your guild how frequently they go to places like PG or KT without a slower.

<br />
Kaeth, I would be interested in knowing more about your experience.  I have asked a couple of the BST in my guild how well their slow lands in places like NC and WoS, both said they get a lot of resists.  I can understand this, since in NC last night I got resisted on the first cast on each of the first 3 mobs we pulled, so I started casting Malos on inc. on every mob after that.<br />
<br />
This is contrary to some of the other posts I've read about mobs having low MR.  Just wanted to check, are the murkgliders in NC an exception and have high MR, was I unlucky, or is high MR standard fare for omens mobs?  <br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Maybe a 20 percent resist rate tops without malos in WoS. Having 2 resists in a row was pretty rare. Haven't fought in NC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Good loot that is relatively easy to obtain.<br />
-Spells are dropping!  AHH!<br />
-I'm getting invites to groups again.<br />
-Scenery is pretty amazing.<br />
<br />
I'm having lots of fun so far.  Been in a few WoS/PG groups and I feel that I can contribute a pretty decent amount to the encounters.<br />
<br />
I'm liking our buffs, most of them are actually worth casting now (new Focus does leave a bit to be desired.)  We've got a nice, new HoT; AND from what i've heard...our epic is going to be schwheat (except for the fact that, err, we've all seen the rendition by Ceno.)<br />

In the field I got maybe 1 slow resist in 10 after malos.  In the murkglider cave 1 in 3.<br />
Overall I think OoW is a rather shaman friendly expansion so far.  We got spells we asked for for a long time (improved invis being my favorite), buffs are suddenly requested again even with high end equipment since they are direct mitigation/above cap, and at least in WoS we can perform as main healer without great risk.  Has it hand over foot over GoD.</div></div><hr />

Tugela, using people's perception (who don't play a shaman) over actual data isn't really a good basis for your argument.  Just because some people choose a shaman when any rooting class and either a bard or chanter to debuff resists, or better still mezz (where available), will do doesn't imply that the shaman heals factored on mitigating mobs are up to snuff.  Practically, it's riskier to have a shaman heal than a cleric and it's riding coat tails if you're only really effective if the cleric dies or goes AFK.  I'd hope people aspire to be more than an insurance policy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enchanters in my guild have been asked not to bother slowing. <br />
<br />
If I slow on incoming, I am told to wait, because the mobs don't need to be slowed fast, since the difference in damage output between a slowed mob and a unslowed mob is just marginal and I'd risk to draw unwanted aggro.<br />
<br />
I have been in group with a Warrior and his cleric bot as the main healer(these are all guildgroups). We camped nameds for 8 hours straight and sometimes I was slowing, others I wouldn't. <br />
Do you think the warrior ever wondered if those were slowed or if we ever had *any* trouble?<br />
<br />
I don't know your experiences, but in mine, groups look for a slower for places like PG, because they are used to fill that slot, but even the most stupid have realized that a bard is just as good and if you don't slow at all or slow at 60% health, it won't make a **** for difference.</div></div><hr />

Maybe your at a much higher level than me, perhaps your tanks have major equipment advantages over Yella, but, my warrior is one of the better equiped tanks on my server, and if I can tell the difference when the slower is doing their job and when they are not, I'm pretty sure that all those other folk less well geared are going to feel it a lot more.</div></div><hr />

GoD slow lands 90%+ of the time as the mob is inc... A good tank can taunt the mob off after one round of hits on me... Then I cast Malos, which seems to give the tank a taunt or two for added agros.. Then I layer on PR dot followed by Bane... and THEN I start swinging with a HoH (time drop)... A few procs (some 750, some 1500) and mob is close to dead by time slow and dots wear off... I can burst heal/HoTT as needed during fight... Melees all have FA, including me....<br />
<br />
I'm a time/GoD shaman with over 450AAs.. so gear, spells, and AAs make up the difference... I'm not just a slowing, asst healing player.. I'm an all around battle priest with DPS and it's noticable....<br />

The clickie haste from ornate gloves will bring him to to pretty much the haste cap. Any Warrior doing 250dps is likely going to have the 46% haste item from Ikki if not they are pretty surely going to have 41% and 30% from the ornate gloves. He needs our haste why?<br />
<br />
Without Wunshi his str will be capped from gear so no dps gain there.<br />
<br />
The only thing you can do to add to his DPS is FA and Billy.<br />
I believe if you parse that extra attack its going to be a fairly negligable portion of that 250dps.<br />
<br />
If you want to argue our slows are helping do that DPS or our heals etc... Fine you can. Still wont be right. But you can argue it.<br />
Cleric or Druid is a better choice if you want heals and Chanter or BL is a better choice is you want slows. You want DPS? We are a poor choice for that period even when some of us can put out some decent DPS at times we are not a DPS class.<br />
<br />
We are simply the 3rd best choice or worse for any role in a group with a nice sized gap between 2nd and 3rd.<br />
<br />
We mainly get grouped by those that remember what we used to be (an almost over powered class) not by what we can do now or by the lack of other classes available, friendships, etc.<br />
<br />
The best I can offer my groups at 69 with my whole 1 spell I won so far is Talisman of Sense. <br />
There are some more benefits to our class from OoW but the majority of us dont have access to that at this time.<br />
I think we did gain back some ground with OoW in some ways lost some in other area a bit. In the end though I think we might see a net gain.</div></div><hr />

OK, so now we are going to condemn the entire class because the tanks you play with are so uber that they self buff to max everything, so who needs shaman buffs.  And since we are not the best healers, and you would argue not the best slowers (which I say is total bull crap), then we add no value.  I guess shaman just suck at everything.  :(<br />
<br />
Man, it must suck to be you.  I guess I'm with the guys that, even at your level, with 600+ aa's, manage to find a way to contribute to their groups.  There are so many things that a good shaman does well, that it just boggles my mind when our supposed &quot;best&quot; representatives claim we are useless.  Maybe you are, I know I'm not.  I know many other shaman in Time and God, and now Omens, that are not useless either.  No one is grouping with them out of &quot;pity&quot;.  They are actually valuable contributing members of their groups, imagine that.  Must be an attitude thing.<br />

Man, Giac, thanks for the laugh.  I think I pissed my pants while I was ROFLMAO.  So, your guild does not let chanters slow?  Since you already said there is some benefit to slow, no matter how small, then I must assume the risk outweighs the benefit.  So, 1 of 3 things must be true:<br />
<br />
1.  Your chanters suck and can't slow without pulling aggro and getting killed.  Gee, seems like someone who has played their class for several years and has gotten to 65+ with several hundred aa's would be able to perform this basic task?<br />
<br />
2.  Your tanks suck because they can't keep aggro off of the chanters who are simply slowing.<br />
<br />
3.  Your healers suck because they can't keep the chanters alive long enough for the tanks to get aggro back.<br />
<br />
Somebody obviously can't play, if your chanters can't do what they were designed to do.<br />
<br />

Is there anyway you can possibly be more sarcastic in your dealings with other shaman?  You obviously have no problem with the way the Shaman class is being handled.  Fine but other people are.   Maybe they are overreacting or overstating the case but is there point that invalid and do you have to ridicule everyone that isn't in agreement with your opinion?   <br />
<br />
You started out bad, you started to get better about it, now you're just getting worse...  <br />

Enough is enough, everyone has their own opinions, try to respect each other for them and come to some common ground.   Saying &quot;You suck, your friends suck, and your guild sucks, I'm right and you're wrong&quot; is just arrogant, plain and simple.   It doesn't help the shaman's that are trying to get class balance restored.  <br />

We can do an entire Tipt in 28 minutes including time to get the instance, buffing and killing every single mob in the zone on the way up.<br />
Mobs simply die too fast to really bother but I slow every mob I can.<br />
And I have lost groups in OoW to a 2nd Cleric when the group had no slower.<br />
Lots of raids the yard trash really dies too fast to bother slowing as well (usually still do though) and the bosses are all immune.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Ok, maybe I was a little sarcastic in my last couple of replies. :)  But come on, Warren, honestly, can you swallow all of the stuff these guys are saying?  Sorry, but I find it hard to stay silent when I see such misinformation.  But you are right, I should remember to take the high road and not join the rabid pack.  My apologies.<br />
<br />
<br />
I swallow it because people like you and everyone else is entitled to an opinion and to gripe about it.  It reduces stress, gets problems out in the open.   <br />
<br />
Yes, to a large extent, I'm a little tired of all the complaining, but some of it is valid...  and I personally refuse to complain about other people complaining.    &lt;shrugs&gt;<br />
<br />
On one hand, it looks like Omens of War has drastically improved the shaman situation.  Personally my gripe is with SOE and how they handled GoD and OoW, and how they expected people to shell out money for class balance... but if you're willing to accept this, then great...<br />
<br />
On the other hand, there's sufficient evidence to conclude that the Shaman situation isn't 100% fixed... but it also appears that people have formed the wrong conclusions.<br />
<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to get the facts straight so it can be submitted to SoE and worked on.  If people are going to get annoyed, at least channel it into something positive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember that even though with OOW, shaman have it easier, the pendulum can easily shift and we can end up screwed again.   Work with each other, not against, share your experiences, negative and positive or otherwise<br />
<br />
BUT FOR GODS' SAKE, BE CIVIL.<br />
<br />

Regards to all,<br />

<br />
With the new healing modifiers and damage modifiers in the AA's, we heal fine and add considerable dps.  With kei and sitting on my horse, I was in a PoFire Castle 1 grp, with constant pulls: 4 dots (bane, blood, anath, pox (from pants)).  Sometimes I was doing over 2k per tick with crits! Was doing at least 1k per tic.  Our MA kept aggro fine.  I even was able to toss a few heals to help out the druid.  Oh, and the heals critted for 4000+.  Thats more than enough for a back up healer.<br />
<br />
Stop whining, and go play.<br />

What i would say is it right that we should have to spend AA to &quot;fix&quot; us whereas other classes seem to get AA to &quot;improve&quot; them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">What world are you living in that a mob that is only partially affected by Slow does 1/3 of it's damage?<br />
<br />
And for future reference I have played and still play a Cleric. Granted I haven't played a Warrior since GoD release, but I pretty much felt the same way as our warriors when I saw slowers die unnecessarily.<br />
<br />
Guess there is no point in arguing with you then. The other 99% of people who play the game are clearly wrong ;)</div></div><hr />

Interesting stat ... oh forgot the smiley ;) ... where'd you pull that from?<br />
<br />
Depending on group composition and the content you're facing, it's quite possible for a group not to notice slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>GheffGutterbrains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">I find it humorous that people focus on &quot;slow&quot; as being the class definition.. as if it what being a shaman is all about.. <br />
<br />
.. ok... suppose they give you back your slow..... and you are???  well if you believe that to be the answer, then you are nothing but a one deminisional player that can *drumroll* SLOW!! Still can't DPS, heal, or otherwise add some value to the group.....<br />
<br />
*rolls eyes*<br />
<br />
I love the GoD slow.. fast cast and low resists.. last about as long as it takes to kill the mob... for CC.. well.. thats the trade-off.. I have to watch when slow wears and make sure its reslowed (sometimes right away.. sometimes right before we kill it.. *situational*)<br />
<br />
I love that we can heal in burst when needed... I can heal a tank after the cleric dies.. ie mob is slowed... I can heal that same tank as mob is being pulled.. I slow it and then heal.. (like we wanna wait for cleric with mana) Switch between HoTTs and Deludas.. again *situational* to the mob.. ok ok.. I'll conceed.. can't heal a slow immune or boss situation.. Small % of the time.. next....<br />
<br />
I think its great that I have to tweak my DPS depending on the tank.. Sometimes a GoD Slow, Malos, BoN, Bane, and HammahTime is perfect.. sometimes I have to pause a sec in between slow and malos to give the tank a proc or two to build agro.... Sometimes I'll insert a spear DD between malos and a dot or between dots... On rare occasions I'll toss a EB for ****s and watch the tank spam taunt *grins* Again... dun dun dun.. *situational*<br />
<br />
I think the key that alot of people forget is that a shaman is not a &quot;SLOWER&quot;, but rather a well versitle battle priest.. No other class comes close to your tools when incorporating spells and clicky gear..<br />
We are the swiss army knife.. You can play your class to the MAX, pushing DPS... pretty much busy as hell.. OR you can do as little as /malos /slow /sic dog... We are the *situational*...<br />
<br />
With all that said, I do realize that shamans do need some tweakage at times...  some times I see them as improvements, sometimes I see them as &quot;wants&quot;... <br />
<br />
*insert shameless plug of wants* /hint /hint AE malos and nuke!! oh oh.. and my FREAKING Animal Charm PLEASE!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">The shaman community has been screaming for a fix eversince PoP. Thats part of the reason I quit. So it's been more than a year and still they are doing nothing to fix us. Maybe they're trying to drive us away from EQ1 so we'll play EQ2. It doesn't work that way though. If we're having problems with them giving us what we want with EQ1 it'll be the same with EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">ok all the mobs i tried to slow (green con up to red ) all  were partially slowed in OOW.<br />
<br />
Dunno. Spent four hours in Walls of Slaughter tonight, and saw only &quot;mostly slowed&quot; ... Unless I missed it in the battle spam somewhere, I didn't see any &quot;partially&quot; slowed. It should be noted that WOS is the only zone I've fought in thus far (heh, had OOW for only one day! Give me time).<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">He meant everything mitigated. <br />
<br />
Hopefully we'll get something to compensate for that, but I'm not counting on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">just spent several hours in WoS after patch and slow landed for full on almost everything we pulled, including the mini named. :)<br />
<br />
only exception was some really hard mob the puller pulled by mistake. which proceeded to own us after being &quot;partially&quot; slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">OMG they nerfed our mitigation  :D .<br />
<br />
(seriously: good news)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Can confirm they definitely made most WoS mobs fully slowabley:) And as mentioned some the minor named are slowable too now. Nobles causeway same most fully slowable, can't remeber much about MPG but think no changes their.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Can confirm WoS.  Was in M. Proving Grounds last night, and only one type of mob was fully slowable (cant remember the name), rest was partial.<br />
<br />
  Love that PG exp compared to WoS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Was in The instanced zone Dranik's Hollow last night. Bats and Rats still mitigate. Murks are fully slowable now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Well this is good news concerning removal of migation on 'ALL' OOW mobs.   This appears to have been a mistake which in part this post may have helped.  <br />
<br />
Folks - it is NOT whining to seek understanding and background information from SoE Dev team.   And it is also NOT whining to complain.  <br />
<br />
It is whining to continue to moan about something over and over again while waiting for a response.   When a child whines it isn't because the issue isn't important to both child and parent.   It's whining because the child doesn't understand why they aren't getting what they want - when they want it.  <br />
<br />
SoE does things in their own way for both coding and communication.  Bottom line - you should post your ideas, concerns, and comments.<br />
<br />
SoE does read this board so let opportunity take it's own course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">I have noticed though since patch are slows are sticking fully on a lot more mobs now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">i'm gettin' full slows in the ruined city of dranik on all mobs but named.</div></div><hr />
