<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone out there have their actual, physical key to Veeshan's Peak stowed away?  I'm wondering exactly what it's called.<br />
<br />
Most sources list the item &quot;Key of Veeshan&quot; as the name of the key to Veeshan's Peak.  I think they're right.  But many sources also list this as the name of the key to the quest room in the Plane of Sky.  The thing is Lucy and Magelo both have only one key by this name.<br />
<br />
They both also have an item called &quot;Key to Veeshan's Peak&quot;, with the lore of &quot;Small Stone Key&quot;.  (When I wrote the guide to getting the VP key that's currently on the Crucible, this is what I linked to in Lucy as the final item.  But I think that might be wrong.)<br />
<br />
It seems unlikely that the &quot;Key of Veeshan&quot; is both the key to VP as well as the quest room in PoSky.  Maybe the name of the key was changed at some point after most of the writeups were made?  <br />
<br />
Thus, I'm wondering if anyone has the actual key to VP on them to check the name.  Names of keys on the keyring are sometimes a little different than the item names, or else I'd go by what's on my keyring.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's actually been a very long time since they did a /keyring wipe.  It had some problems for a few weeks when they first put it in, but it's been very very reliable.  That doesn't mean I'm going to destroy my VP or ST or VT or time keys, but the smaller stuff like seb and the hole I don't feel a need to keep around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Key to Veeshan's Peak (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=23022) exists in Allakhazam's database, but I think it's just a made-up item. Their VP key quest description used to point to it as the reward; it got corrected recently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The Veeshan's Peak key is called Key of Veeshan. The key for the Plane of Sky is called Veeshan's Key.<br />
From what I can find, &quot;Veeshan's Key&quot; is to the last island with the Eye of Veeshan.  What is the key to get to the quest room in PoSky then?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think both of those are called Veeshan's Key. There are two identical-looking Veeshan's Key (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=veeshan%27s+key) entries in Lucy, and a post on this page (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2610) suggests that they are two different keys in Sky with the same damn name. The one to get to the quest room is bought from the Key Master, and the one to get to the last island is given by Sirran the Lunatic during the island progression.</div></div><hr />
