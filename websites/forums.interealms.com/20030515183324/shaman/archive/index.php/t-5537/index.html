<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sevenkilts mentioned Shiknar in another thread.  Rather than hijack, I thought I would ask here.<br />
<br />
Are the Shiknar good hunting?  and if so, at what level?  Is Torpor required?  (I have epic/fungi/JBB/horse/ODS but only 920 ac at level 56)<br />
<br />
I know that Shiknar are pretty social, and I have never seen anyone hunting them.<br />
<br />
Your comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guess is that this is a group thing, and you'd need CC.  Basing that on what's been said so far.  If you need to be 60 to single pull shrooms, and the shiknar are higher level, you probably can't single em naturally, and I always see them in clumps.<br />
<br />
If I'm wrong, that'd be great, because I've been wanting to try these guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solo'd a few of the soldiers at level 60 with no torpor. Had KEI, and a fungi. It was pretty much a pain, be alot better to duo them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the lowest Shiknar(forgot name, those near TL zone or at border of Shiknar hill) only give 1% exp per kill, have tons of hp(need 2 pox per kill), same or little better exp than shroom<br />
<br />
I havn't try the mine yes since mob there are higher level, those bug have way too much hp and hit fast, not worth the exp, you need kill lvl55+ mob for better exp, those Shiknar at hill is only level 53</div></div><hr />
