<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys.  Had a question was hoping I could get some help with.<br />
<br />
I left EQ a while ago...just before Luclin went live.<br />
<br />
Have things gotten better or worse for the shaman community?<br />
<br />
Just curious, I was considering coming back but wasn't sure if it would be worth it.  I miss playing a troll shaman..hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shamans got better due to AA skills and some handy new spells, but overall I wouldn't say Luclin is any better than Velious. Unless you thought the VP key quest was incredibly exciting, then you may love Luclin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Using my psychic powers, I have determined what you like to do in the game, what level and guild situation you have and I have come up with the following conclusion:   <br />
<br />
You may rely on it.<br />
<br />
PS - I had some assistance from the following site:<br />

you can try readin the patch message archive if you are interested in what has happened since you left.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They added few new encounters to Luclin that aren't tuned for you and 80 of your closest friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wolvenborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">personally I like the Luclin expansion.  The good things overshadow the bad IMHO.  Great new models (except for female iskar....ACK!!!), AA exp is a great idea, tons of new weapons and quests, etc.  <br />
<br />
Sure the zones can get a bit laggy and such, but heck, I benefit from the expansion every single day and I don't spend but about 1% of my time on the moon (so far).  <br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">one of the worst features about luclin is the new models.<br />
sure ogres and barbs look better, but there is no personality to the new models. i loved the way ogres and trolls sat with there legs straight out and the iksar squat and the fluid motions from all the animations. the new animations are just too jerky for my liking. i play with old models on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Unless you were in one of hte top two guilds on your server the game is not worth coming back for let alone even playing.  You run out VERy quickly of fun things to do with a smaller well balanced guild and start requiring 30-50 level 60 players to do about anything worth doing in luclin.<br />
<br />
Just have to face it most of EQ is tuned for uber guilds once you break 50.  That and the luclin models SUCK overall.  The animation on them is TERRIBLE and the variance now in equipment is laughable.  If you've seen one shaman you've seen them all pretty much as now all the graphics are the same.  Shaman got nothing really worth coming back for from luclin cept maybe 1 AA skill that you have to be 60 for and get like a ton of other AA skills first before you can get the one good one.<br />
<br />
Being a caster still sucks as it's a melee game.  I'm hanging up my hat now as i really don't have the desire to go and level up a melee character just so i can be useful.  Sure supposedly they are working on caster balance, but i'd almost guarantee this wont' affect shaman in any meaningful way.<br />
<br />
Find another game to occupy your time till star wars or whatever other game gets your rocks off, EQ sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Boss type mobs in Umbral Plains don't require raid force. Va'Dynn, Servitor of Luclin, Rhag-1 aren't raidforce encounters. Caller quests, FG named bugs, Acryllia wurm, Lcea Katta (maybe now cuz it got upgraded), Nathius, and probably a few more aren't really raid force encounters. Also with AA you can do older content much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wouldnt bother coming back, Luclin has NOTHING new worth coming back for.<br />
<br />
New ogre graphics are sweet, apart from that its the same old crap over and over again.<br />
<br />
Verant think that just by adding new zones full of more uber equipment people will still play the game and be entertained forever.<br />
<br />
Not me, im sick to death of doing the same crap over and over and over again just to get a few AA points that really dont even do anything exciting.<br />
<br />
Its like playing AD&amp;D with a bad GM, players lose interest and the GM gives them loads of top notch loot to play with to get em interested again, the adventures are all the same thing every week-run in kill some skeletons gain loot...you get the idea?<br />
<br />
For me EQ has died of death almost, sitting in Fungi grove week after week pressing one button all night to kill and gain exp just doesnt do it for me nomore.  My guild is just starting to go places-killing gods and stuff and altho its a little exciting, it still &quot;ho-hum its dead&quot; when it finally dies.</div></div><hr />
