First they saw the neat place you made in guk and they took it over and made it their home. Then over crowding kicked in and they needed another neat troll dwelling to live in so they chose grobb.<br />

Build big nasty ogre cave dwellings and froggies would leave you alone.<br />

If you receive your spells from your god: Tunare, Cazic, Inno, X-Marr...well then who in the world is giving the cats theirs?<br />
<br />
Tribunal: I believe in Justice<br />
Cazic: I believe in Fear<br />
Inno: I believe in Hate<br />
Mith-Marr: I believe in Light, Truth and the Lawful Good way<br />

Vah Shir worship the primal forces of nature, not one deity per se.  Therefore, they are considered agnostic for gameplay purposes.</div></div><hr />

Actually - I think they did help themselves to the Trolls' City.<br />
<br />
Soon they will help themselves to Palludal too.  I can almost see the overwhelming horde of n00b frogs invading now.  Next week it will be just like Greater Fay on release day way back when.</div></div><hr />

I always found the idea that players could kill the actual dieties they worship... using the actual spells/powers given to them by that diety to do so... with no repurcussions a little difficult to believe myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">LICK THE TOADS!!!!!<br />

*stares at hands melting away*<br />

Ooooooooh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Zaspacer good point. From a RP perspective, once a Priest / worshipper of Cazic zones into fear they should feel &quot;swollen&quot; with power. I mean you are in the near presence of your god.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, the second you turn on a minion, or worse, the god himself - all bets are off. Clerics worshipping Inno (for example) are stripped of all spells while in a group / raid attacking him or again, his minions.<br />
<br />
And erm, well Hate forbid Inno dies - no spells for you until he is respawned by higher powers. <br />
<br />
Too much roleplaying. And not enough benefit FROM worshipping a god to enact a penalty TO killing a god. (Sorta strange that each god grants their clerics the exact same spells. Tunare and Cazic with the same spellbook? Go figure)<br />
<br />
Besides, apparently the gods hate everybody, even their own worshippers. Anybody with a clean faction slate ever con Inny or Cazic? I'm * betting * (albeit not the farm) you're KOS to start with.<br />
<br />
How odd is that - I want to kill you - but I'll grant you power(s)?  Maybe the gods hate everybody and are just using us for their own nefarious means.  <br />
<br />
Sorta lends credence to a story by Harlan Ellison called 'The Deathbird' in which the christian god is insane, but was given earth to play with by beings whose judgement can never be questioned. In the end, dira (snake figure) leads man to destroy god to save the earth from suffering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Me's heard dat Cazic himself ain't kos ta Cazic trolls or Iksar (tho da rest of Fear's mobs are).  Mah guild duzna raid Fear no more and me never managed ta get on one wen da big guy woz up.  Uddawise, me'd hav a screenshot of me comparin scars wif da Faceless.<br />
<br />
Unlike most peeps, me canna wait ta meet me maker. ;)<br />
<br />
As fer da frogs... GET IN MAH BELLY!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Sure, we'll have em over for dinner. As dinner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sure let the frogs in, so long as we kick the trolls out :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Me dunno why da Trolls randed all da way to Inky town, when<br />
dem could habe taken refuge in Oggok. We likes Trolls. Me used<br />
to bank in Grobb, and buy me herbes dere. We has Warriors,<br />
and Shadow Knights, and Shamans too. Trollys is be welcome<br />
in Oggok. <br />
<br />
As for killen da &quot;Gods&quot; dem is be as imortal as we is be. Nobody<br />
really dies for eber. Me don't gets me spells from &quot;Gods&quot;, me<br />
gets dem from Shaman spell vendors. Learned me craft from<br />
dem and da Shaman trainers. Me tinks dese &quot;Gods&quot; is be just<br />
really high lebel peoples, wid lots ob esperience killen. No &quot;God&quot;<br />
abbilities, just good AA skills and adwanced spells. <br />
<br />
If da &quot;Gods&quot; is be da source ob our spells, den dem should drop<br />
copies ob Malo and Torpor and stuff when we kills dem. Many<br />
many copies!<br />
<br />
Froggsies on de odder hand, dem is be uncibilized. Dem should<br />
be wipeded out for attacksin our Troll friends!</div></div><hr />
