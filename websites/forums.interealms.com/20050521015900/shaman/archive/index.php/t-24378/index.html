<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In the couple days since I have been apointed class corraspondent I have put forth community feedback on two Issues here is the current status on those Issues as best as I can provide it .<br />
<br />
Issue # 1  ... 67 pet spell STILL dosent Inaitely DW . I have spoken with kyth and compiled a post worth of feedback concerning this issue and submited it through the channels that I have been given acess to . I have been told that our unhappiness with this has been passed along to the proper developer's .<br />
<br />
Issue # 2 ... Ancestral Aid stacking Issues , This AA dosent &quot;stack&quot; with many of our own buffs &quot;Diaku confirmed , possibly FA , Rabid bear confirmed&quot; . I have made a post regarding this and this information was also passed along to the dev team around midday friday &quot;10/15&quot; .<br />
<br />
This is how I have spent the bulk of my time thus far .<br />
<br />
Also I have attempted to investigate a potential BUG with Canny . Some feel that they are not always getting the proper amount of mana from a use of canny type spells . I have NOT been able to duplicate this bug personaly . Untill i have more Iron clad information I do not feel ready to pass this along .<br />
I am still VERY open to any feedback on this issue . Just becase I cannot duplicate it does NOT mean it dosent exist . Please continue to test this Issue when/If you have time . You can post in a thred regarding it or PM me with any relivent info . At such a time as I have solid info I will presue this Issue .</div></div><hr />

Nice to see you passing along things rather than waiting for Sony to come to you.<br />
But if the devs dont yet realise that the non innate dual wielding pet makes every shaman unhappy then they have a serious lack of brains.<br />
Sorry but this has been posted on here,on sonys own forums so to me this means sony must know about it and not having mentioned it that to me means they dont give a **** or its &quot;working as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for Ancestral Aid well probably another &quot;working as intented&quot; issue.<br />
<br />
Anyway good luck in your new post (boy are you going to need it :)).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raknath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can you also check into might, sense, and champion not stacking with or even getting overwriten by some melee disciplines?  It is inappropriate that our buffs aught to decrease the usefulness of their disciplines.  If they lose our 5% or 10% damage mods, it affects the total usefulness of their discs.  (IE if their disc is a 20% Mod but they lose our 10% mod, their effective gain is only 10% instead of 20%.)  Although I am unable to check,  it would be highly annoying to rebuff sense just because the tank hits evasive or a rogue hits duelist.</div></div><hr />

Yes this Issue is on my radar . Ill be looking into it soon . Noone works on weekends but next week ill compile the info here regarding this and submit it .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good job Grim, way to start out of the gate fast.  Just out of curiosity I wonder what your thoughts are about three issues that have been on my radar screen a long time.  First is having talisman of alacrity only 50% haste, and second the insane casting times on our ice nukes.  The third is having no resist modifier on VP.<br />
<br />
Personally, if you can jam thru innate duel wield for puppy and these three above mentioned items I think we are pretty much GTG and I can't imagine they can be viewed as &quot;overpowering&quot;.<br />
<br />
Purdypog<br />
<br />
PS: Will this balance us? Probably not, but my expectations are so low that if we get a retroactive fix on these items I am happy. Period.</div></div><hr />

I've got a funny story about this.  Last night I was hunting in a group and the mage gave me 4 pet weapons.  I gave 2 to my pet and held on to the others for later, just in case.  Well, my pet survived the entire night in PoV, so I wanted to make sure the spare 2 summoned weapons didn't go to waste.  I was at the bank in the Plane of Knowledge and saw a shaman standing near me, so I did a who on him and found that he was a level 69 shaman on my server in one of what I would consider our top 10 guilds.  I asked him if he was going to be on for a while, and if he would like a couple of weapons for his pet.  I was stunned when he replied &quot;shm pets don't use weapons&quot;.  I started to tell him about how our pets do much better with weapons, because it gives them dual wield and the ability to proc depending on what weapons you give him.  He ignored those tells, and didn't respond from that point.  I ended up just dropping the weapons on the ground and /oocing where they were for anyone that wanted them.  They were snatched up almost instantly by a gnome (Ench or Necro I am guessing), and he thanked me.  <br />
<br />
Am I the only one that would have been so amazed to find that a 69 shaman didn't know that our pet could wield weapons?  And even more so that he hadn't even bothered to discover this in 69 levels?? Maybe I am overreacting, but I just found this unbelievable.</div></div><hr />

    There could be the reason that this shaman lvled so fast, or doesnt solo(tanking wise that is )<br />
Could be a shaman that only raids and does not see the benefit in it, and if I were him/her thinking on his/her thought pattern I would also fail to see the benifet from something I have never even thought twice about.....guess its their fault they don't study the class.</div></div><hr />

its always nice when the enchanter doesnt know what the **** theyre doing</div></div><hr />

<br />
first rule of project alpha, don't talk about project alpha ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Great story Tobyus, and great work Grimbear. I like your attitude ! Don't let the barstewards grind you down man!!!<br />
<br />
btw please please please....<br />
<br />
<br />
what is project alpha and what are alpha pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">nice, though one my own hates that might want to add for the pet is that it is about 1 pet level behind after level 49 it went from ever 5 levels to ever 6 levels  for no real reason, no other pet class gets pets later then they did (and yes we are a pet class, i count sk as a pet class you get  pet regular and controllable you are a pet class, so druid dont count:)). i would like to see our pet dw/sow etc and be about 1 pet level higher especially with what mobs hit for, so maybe 4k hp hitting for 75 or 80 odd. (possible about the same as chanter animation? even with slow our pet isnt going to be more than a minor speed bump:) though i would like a more dps pet we could summon, maybe with only 1 or 2k hp?)<br />
<br />
other things dots! they still need retuning for faster game. and our dd are abysmal. i recon ice age should be 1600 and the vemon one 1200.  buff fine  generally but need some combined maybe? heals still slightly too weak, recon maybe 1800 for the yoppa and possible 2200 for ancient:) hot ok rain spell ok, though i would like it over 900 a wave.<br />
<br />
only other thing would a a general look at mana cost and casting times , specially for debuffs, i really thing they should be faster.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">That's a good one KurthMcdonough!<br />
I remember my first time in pop(about 4-5 months after the release), I brought out doggy, and asked if anyone had any spare junk weapons for my pet, the warrior said they fixed it and pet doesn't need weapons anymore :-/ . Not untill I parsed it a few weeks later I realized he was full of BS.<br />
Anyways, glad to see your on top of things Mr. Grim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;WHAT IS PROJECT ALPHA?&quot; We're talking about equipping our dogs with weapons.  So to answer your question as to what a project alpha pet is, well heres a hint:<br />
<br />
Normal pet is weaponless and hits 2 times a round normally<br />
Alpha pet is equipped with __________  !</div></div><hr />

I've seen worse.  After getting killed in Tipt due to an AFK tank who didn't tell the group anything, I send a message to the group saying that the 65 enchanter needs to slow until I get rezzed.  She comes back and says that she can't slow mobs that are over level 52.  Talk about W-T-F?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Another hint on project Alpha: if you barter with the barbarian fisherman guy by the pool in PoK, or the human/half-elf/whatever standing next to him, you may be able to discover a steady supply of project alpha resources, without having to go all the way to the bazaar and blow upwards of 5-20 plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just wanted to ask for you to talk to the developers about the drop rates for the augment tradeskills.  Discordant scoriae is not just rare, but has dropped 1 time (that I can confirm, and I talk a lot with tradeskillers) on my server.  This is just a bit too rare.  I understand the need to not have everyone and their twink having the focus effects, but come on, this type of drop rate is stupid.  Drop rates on slugworms could be upped somewhat too (to the trean flies level).</div></div><hr />
