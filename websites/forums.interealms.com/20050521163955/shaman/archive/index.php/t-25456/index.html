<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, just something interesting, earlier today (1-9-05), I was addressing a problem with a family member's computer and ability to log on to EQ.<br />
<br />
anyway, I stopped by the official website to check the knowledge base on the specific problem, and when I logged onto Everquest's Homepage, I saw a small banner, &quot;Dragons of Norrath&quot; beta sign-ups...<br />
<br />
I was kinda busy to check it out, so I thought I'd come back to it, after solving the problem, I came back to the webpage, the banner wasn't there anymore, just the usual knowledge base banner....<br />
<br />
but I still had what was in my cache:<br />

<br />
apparently I wasn't the only one to see it, there are a couple of posts in the community forums on SOE's website...</div></div><hr />

We can't even be sure this is what its going to end up being, since this looks like an unintentional leak, things could change really fast...I'm just giving the rock a little push...starting something...and I thought everyone should know :)</div></div><hr />

I seriously hope this sucker is not due for release till July or later.  I realize all of ~16 guilds are grinding around Anguish, but all I see from another rapidly released expansion is a shrinking guild roster. =/<br />

I'm all for more content, but somewhat recent additions like LDoN are completely unused now and it might be better to focus creative energies elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

Wondering the same thing.  It looks like an EQ(1) expansion [seems to be sectioned off into the EQ1 area of the station], but it makes me wonder if SOE finally decided to &quot;sell&quot; loot.... It is really too vague to determine right now.... but we can already buy/sell items through the bazaar....<br />

<br />
I read this as a barter system working the opposite way of the bazaar, i.e. I could set up my trader with &quot;Buying Lesser Muramite Rune - paying 25K&quot;.<br />
Does this sound correct or did I misread it? If yes, I could definitely use this - first of all for trade skill stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">well, I think I can see what I'm getting for my birthday...Feb. 15th....and reading the overview, it looks like they are really bringing attention back to older zones...lucky guess....<br />
<br />
I read a reference the &quot;The Nest&quot; in the overview, I remember seeing this on some of the old-world EQ maps, being just east of everfrost, but north of blackburrow...<br />
<br />
the screenshots do look beautiful...may bring a problem for those who have lower-end systems...I wonder if they will keep mobs the same (I.E. Drops/level/general difficulty) with new models or just revamp all of the remaining old-world zones and mobs...<br />
<br />
while I see this as being an intriguing expansion, though I see that they are again catering a little more to the raiding crowd with the &quot;Mass summon corpse altar&quot;...I'm all for raiding content...but it shouldn't be the driving force of the game...also, it completely removes the challenge of a CR, which can be fun....nothing like sitting for hours on end trying to CR, telling ranger jokes...and learning new ranger jokes....occasionally inventing a ranger joke...<br />
<br />
the map option looks interesting, and has alot of potential, but they need to do the &quot;fog of war&quot; type thing so that you have map of what you've personally explored, and no manual cartography...(hated that about current mapping....you now have maps! now you not only have to explore, but you have to run all the way around every inch of the zone, just to realize that you didn't turn off the line tool, ruined your map, and you have to do it all over again!) being able to download maps helped...if only they came in any logical color....<br />
<br />
SOE has complained about how much plat is in circulation, perhaps this barter system will be the next step to taking some plat out of the systems (bazaar taxes? /shudder)...but in truth, I can see where this will probably be similar to a cross between bazaar and the casino...<br />
<br />
I can say I will miss the way the old zones look now, if they do revamp all of the old ones...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Several of you have mentioned rewamps of old zones in this expansion.<br />
I don't think you should expect too much of that - simply because there are no money for Sony in a rewamp. They can not rewamp an old zone without making it available for all players - also the players that have not bought the expansion, so the rewamp is more likely just a refresh of the old models in the old zones.<br />

<br />
I am of the oppinion that NEW content should be just that. NEW. How much of the current re-vamped content is being utilized? CT? Droga? VP? Anyone go there much, except to farm 2nd rate loots? Is there ever anyone there when you go? I want NE</div></div><hr />

<br />
no, not really, the idea of &quot;Dragon&quot; is pretty prevalent in all cultures, though they vary in appearance between cultures: oriental dragons having elongated bodies with bearded faces (most oriental dragons have no wings, though some of the greater ones in their lore do); european dragons having more body mass, large wings, and horns (as typical interpretation, in some stories, i.e. Beowulf, dragons were shape-shifters); eastern native american tribes had a great horned serpent, and south american tribes has their own versions as well...<br />
<br />
personally I enjoy oriental looks, and it puts an interesting but unusual spin on the fantasy of EQ, I'm not sure if I'll like how it works, but I'm the kind of person that will try anything...<br />
<br />
sushi and sake anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Ah I see, I never claimed to be an expert, heh. I think this expansion sounds really cool. It would be a big boost to game lore seeing as firiona is back as a main character for this one. I enjoyed raiding dragons alot more than the crap that was GoD or OoW. They just have a certain charm to them. Hopefully it'll bring back some of the fun from kunark/velious days but sony would have to put out one kickass expansion to achieve that. And they shouldn't make all of the raids top end, they should throw some plain ol fun raids in there too. Maybe something that only people 50 and below are allowed to raid, or 60 and below. Would give me a chance to play my alts more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess.  They look a little odd.  One of the biggest complaints at the guild summit was that there were no more dragons in the game and the storyline strayed too far from its origin.  More guild functionality was requested too, but they explained that in the game code guilds were no more than just a chat channel.  I guess they're working on changing that now.  So they did listen at the guild summit, too bad their execution of the ideas was slow.  <br />
<br />
Also, they forgot to add to the features &quot;More endless, live beta testing for end-game guilds that will surely drive them to play WoW!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you tried WoW?<br />
<br />
I am really not all that bitter about EQ. I loved it. Hell I still love it. It just was not as much fun as people fell by the road and the new people didnt quite have that same feel. I wouldnt play a game for almost 6 years if I didnt love it. I certainly would not still lurk on boards detailing the same game I have retired from if I didn't still love the old gal. <br />
<br />
In some ways I feel WoW is EQ starting over. But without much of the suck. The feeling of potential is there. Of wonder, of anticipation. That feeling has left EQ (to me at least) back when Luclin was so darned screwed up. The route they take will determine it's future, just like EQ chose. <br />
<br />
Seriously, try WoW, you won't lose anything in trying even if you don't like it, the emotes alone are worth the 50 bucks. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I too still think of EQ fondly.  I just don't play anymore.  I bought GoD and I bought OoW and was disappointed with both.  I may have had the expansions, but I didn't really have them.  Too casual a player I guess.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Well, looks good to me so far.  I like the idea of popping out a couple expansions really quickly since it will allow players a choice of directions to work in.  It's better than having people get to the end of the expansion and farm it forever while bellyaching about wanting the next one sooner (as long as it is still done with some quality to it).<br />
<br />
  Gonna have to split my time between here and WoW though since I found out a LOT of old friends play that on the same server/guild... too bad it is PvP server and they are alliance :(  (wanted shammie sooooooo bad.. or undead).<br />
<br />
  And yeah /train is the coolest emote ever.  That's even their guild name cause they all do it so much.  WoW will be nice eye-candy at the least, but I doubt I can ever actually leave EQ... Caanus is essentially a God now, how can I turn from such power? :P</div></div><hr />

I'm not gonna say &quot;this game is better than that game&quot;, because it's an unfair comparison, there is only one EQ, sure there are other MMORPGs out there, but you won't get EQ from anyone else unless SOE sells production rights to another company. When you compare EQ to WoW, its like comparing a tomato to an apple, both are fruits, both are red, but they aren't the same thing. EQ and WoW, both are MMORPGs, both are set in a fantasy environment, but they aren't the same thing.<br />
<br />
As long as you are going to play a fantasy game created by someone other than yourself, you'll always find things you won't like. Sure SOE may have done things I don't care for, or extremely dislike. I expect there will be more things in the future I don't care for, but you have to take the good with the bad, whether you like it or not, thats the way its going to be unless the creator of the fantasy world changes its mind.<br />
<br />
but I play for only one reason: I like it. When it ceases to be a source of enjoyment for me, I will have no problem moving on to another game, or going back to my gaming lifestyle before EQ, which was strictly console and live RPG.<br />
<br />
/sigh wasn't my intention to hijack my own thread. I hope everyone is happy with where they've chosen to be.<br />
<br />
but on to Beta news, it looks fantastic. I do agree they are pushing this one out a little fast, (i.e. Feb 15th) considering most people didn't know about it until just the other day.<br />
<br />
This being a my first EQ1 Expansion beta (previously I had only beta'd EQ2 and smaller games), I'm enjoying it. There is a lot to see. Zones are beautiful and large. It has a strange feel to it, but, I expect that may change with the regular beta patches.<br />
<br />
I didn't bring over my main from Drinal given the duration of the beta, and the typical (as I understand from others' experiences) wait-time for character copies to beta server. so Theodr /betabuff shaman 65.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to say too much, NDA obviously, and some of the things I really can't describe, yet. but I'll keep you all updated on what I see.<br />
<br />
anyone else make beta for DoN?</div></div><hr />

Can't wait for it.  I think it's great that high end guilds have so many options now...Time, GoD, OOW, and hopefully some more content in this one...we're not all killing the same mobs which is kinda neat imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually Samanna, they did.... the idea was that mobs would resist slow less the higher level you were..... there are countless threads stating that levels&gt;aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">From the bits of available information so far it looks promising, but hey it's called advertising for a reason  ;) .<br />
<br />
As a shaman i like the idea of a potion belt for easier access to potions, food and (hopefully aswell) small tool-like items.<br />
<br />
The various guild-tools sound interesting, but it should be made sure they provide benefits for large or small and family or hardcore guilds alike.<br />
<br />
The storyline seems ok, though it is certainly to early to say something definately. I liked the OoW-storyline with the struggling dragorns by the way. GoD with their Trxudtu-Vuxru names and their (imo) absolute confusing background-story and PoP with its lame so-called planar progression and its boring zone-design were far worse in that regard.<br />
<br />
One negative point: world view and continent view?? I usually know on what continent or planet i am actually, thank you very much (except once, but that is another story :D). So can we say 'useless fluff'? I would like a self-learning zone map though with fog of war, where you actually memorize the zone layout once you visited and explored it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Tarelinu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Well, I have VERY little desire to go into Sol B ever again, no matter what mobs or loots drop there. <br />
<br />
I totally agree with you here, spent way to much time in the old world before any expansions came out. Scarey part is how many have no clue of the old world. So many that are in the game today were born around luclin, heck some as fresh as planes. <br />
<br />
Adding a few mobs and loot gives many a reason to go back to the old world and its mostly entirely new content.<br />
<br />
Hey maybe we'll get to take down a Naggy on steroids! Been so long since i was in that zone, i'd likely get lost like the ones that never stepped foot in that zone, the nightmares are emerging already back in the day takin a wrong turn, getting totally lost and having the nox spider instantly eat u. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">well, I've gotten to see a bit since beta started, and there are some things I'd like to say that I just have to keep zipped..lol<br />

but I'll be able to say in due time..<br />

and you'll be able to see for yourselves before too long..<br />
<br />
Feb. 15th is listed release...VERY close...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Actually Samanna, they did.... the idea was that mobs would resist slow less the higher level you were..... there are countless threads stating that levels&gt;aa.<br />
<br />
I think we're having a semantic miscommunication. :)<br />
<br />
Many, myself included, said that levels&gt;aas - but in the context of experienced tangible return (increased character potency) for time invested.<br />
<br />
I don't think I (or anyone) ever said it was wrong to stray from that golden formula - but we did say that you would kick yourself later if you didn't get Can5 at the earliest opportunity. If I stated or implied otherwise, I was in error.<br />
<br />
Additionally, level/aa arguments when 60 was the cap needed reevaluation when 65 became the cap; likewise, now that 70 is the cap, they may need revisiting once again, and, like all dated advice, should be only part of the information considered when making a decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">On the level-aa thing, my experience is that there are plateaus at which you should stop and get a necessary few aa skills. Like at 60 get canni 5, spell casting master 3. At 65 a few more things etc. A level 70 who has 20 aa points is going to be embarassed a lot in group not being able to keep up.<br />
<br />
Anyway back to the xpack talk -- this looks like a better expansion than GoD or WoW to me, nicer looking, more high fantasy and some cool toys. I hope the in game email thing is not just for inviting new guild members but is usuable in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">So for all these years the levels&gt;aa thought has been the wrong way...... doh! lol<br />
ACCCK!<br />
<br />
OK...shoulda said...right way IMHO! (thought that was obvious) I personally dont wanna be lvl 70 with no lvl 67-68-69 spells and few AA....IMHO thats just an empty level, and tantamount to Pling.<br />
<br />
My hubby and i dont get the kind of time to play that we used to, so it will be a long haul to 70 for us, a fun one, and were enjoying the trip...immensley=)<br />

edit- forgot to add my prediction that sony will be in no way shape or form ready to release this on feb. 15th. i would say march or april max...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sony being ready to release it has nothing to do with it being ready to be released.  Don't forget, Sony delivery dates are set by Marketing, not Development. *sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">&quot;ready for release&quot;? let us not forget GoD.<br />
<br />
my system was running it fine, however, I'm a bit high on the RAM side (1.5 GB), processor is pretty average for today (2.0 Ghz), and my video is average as well (128 MB Radeon)...<br />
<br />
I could do alot better on my system, but I'm not gonna spend money for things I'm not &quot;needing&quot;. my current system is capable of everything I currently use it for.<br />
<br />
I don't forsee many people needing upgrades for these zones, as I believe they stated they were working on graphics processing to be a little easier on systems...(not sure if that is slated for this expansion or not, just something I read before this expansion came to anyone's knowledge).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>The Judge, Alchem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Well just wanted to turn your heads onto something I think is directly involved with the new expansion.  As many of you have probably seen there has been disturbances in Iceclad ocean at Tower of Frozen Shadow.  Friends and wanderers a like have been working at the save FV quest.  According to lore this would be in direct line with the new expansion, Tsserina and evil pour out of Norrath, Tunare is ignited to help the cause.  She gets trapped in the tower, blah blah . . you can read up on it on Alla's.<br />
<br />
Anyways we wake up today get the new text for Iceclad.  We go, kill many mobs, do many turn ins, watch a NPC Paladin with Redemption epic in hand beat the crap out of the Guardian infront of ToFS.  This was all after we had killed The Forgotten and looted a Lock of Tunares Hair.<br />

<br />
Old world boss mobs: Naggy and Vox<br />
Kunark boss mobs: Trakanon, Phara Dar, Severilleous, Xygoz, Nexona, and Druushk. The others were clones. VS was a unique model.<br />
Velious boss mobs: Zland, Kland, Sont, Yelinak, Vulak, Jaled, Vyemm, and Kerafrym. The rest are clones of Kunark and prior. Dain had a unique model.<br />
Luclin boss mobs: No Dragons. Emp, Seru, and Takashi looked unique.<br />
Planes boss mobs: Every god had a unique graphic, Riz , Aerin and Rydda recycled velious. Xanamech counts!<br />
Ykesha boss mobs: Badder looking troll pirates than trash.<br />
LDoN boss mobs: Technically no unique bosses, but they were rarely used models (like the wisp in Miraguls)<br />
GoD boss mobs: Tunat is the only unique model. Zun would be a candidate except omens ruined it.<br />
OoW boss mobs: 2-3 mobs use the Battlemaster Rhiorous model. Overlord Mata Muram is basically it. He has wings but I wouldn't go so far as to call it a dragon.<br />
<br />
For Kunark you should definitely include Gorenaire, Venril Sathir, and Chardok Royals imo!<br />
<br />
Luclin you left out all of Vex Thal =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
He did list Venril Sathir (VS) as a unique model.  Gorenaire and the Chardok royals are just carbon copies of common trash mobs....  <br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, most of Vex Thal was carbon copies of Luclin models (4-arms, slimes, etc.)</div></div><hr />
