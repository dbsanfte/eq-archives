<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Need some suggestions on a good duo that could be ran by one person easily on 2 boxes, ie no necro/rogue where you have to be running 2 at once to make it worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Main requirement is that they are reasonably fast leveling combo and that neither of them is a shaman perferably as i'm sick and tired of shaman at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">iksar monk/shaman =)<br />
<br />
any warrior/cleric duo is easy, just fight with the warrior and have hotkeys for /target warrior, /stand /cast heal /sit on the cleric.  Refresh buffs as needed.  could probably use any melee (paladin, sk, ranger maybe) just as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">shaman monk is awesome duo not how easy it would be to make one mainly hotkeys, depends on how you do it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to go with Shaman/Warrior.  With regen/chloro/slow I rarely have to really heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah bahimiron, tough choice, barb shaman or a halfling druid.....Decisions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">cleric ranger</div></div><hr />

<br />
No wonder why he's been spewing out his trolling BS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A guildmate of mine does this - enchanter and cleric. A friend does cleric and paladin.<br />
<br />
The basic is, you need a way to do damage. And, preferably, a way to heal (To cut down the med time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">enchanter/paladin would make a pretty efficient duo.  however, your enchanter is going to be doing the exact same thing a shaman would in an exp duo.  all you would be doing is substituting clarity for healing.  <br />
cleric and beastlord might work reasonably well also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gothakmithan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Shaman/Monk is pretty insane, duoing I know two people in my guild (both Iksars) who got to 50 in 6 or 7 days playing, and they did a few quests in that time too =p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've seen several polls on the best 2 class duo, and the highest recommendation is almost always shaman/monk. If you are set on not being a shaman, then maybe cleric/warrior is best. But I doubt it comes close to the efficiency of shaman/monk or shaman/rogue or shaman/warrior.<br />
<br />
I duo with my 59 rogue quite often. I tank for him while he backstabs and it works out great. With casting reinforcement 3, I can even keep primal avatar on him without too much hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i like the druid/necro combo. snare, fear, dots, pets. later on, you might even appreciate having a personal taxi to move your necro for that especially bad CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">rog/nec is fun, specially once rog has epic...but shm/monk is great, with bard/monk bein most efficient, but bard is hard to 2box efficiently, so go with shm/monk :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I personally love my shaman / warrior combo. We do alright xping, and can take down some good targets easily: Lodizal, Gantru Dralkenr, Corrupted Elysian, Thought Stealer etc.<br />
Monk might be a little better for straight up xp, but my wife already has a big monk on the 2nd account so it would be silly to have another. <br />
<br />
I dont know why you are burnt out on shaman but I love mine and wouldnt be interested in any other main. Adding a melee on a second box can really be fun to twink and levels fast. Once you get them big where both get xp, you basically have a much better pet who can tank for you and dish out good damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Yuuki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Necro/SK would probably be a decent combo, both can heal themselves, snare, decent damage output and can avoid taking damage in outdoor areas with fear. Warrior/Cleric would probably be the best non-Shaman combo for dungeons. Unfortunately it is going to be tough to beat a Shaman/melee combo for all around versatility though I think. That's why I'm leveing up a Monk on my second account at least :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hullk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">An interesting combo that no one has mentioned is a monk/enchanter combo.<br />
<br />
Give your monk a fungi tunic, a descent weapon, and let him go crazy while your enchanter mezzes the adds and farts around.  I've found it to be a nice change of pace.<br />
<br />
There's always the option of going complete caster, and duoing a wizzie/enchanter, which shouldn't be too difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Pick any melee you'd have fun playing (bar rogue &amp; bard). Then make a cleric. This makes 'best' combination for the reason that you can consentrate 99% to that melee char and enjoy playing it. (for eg.  the so forever popular shaman&amp;monk combo means that you're all the time twisting back and forth (if not all the time atleast 2-3 times per every fight) the boxes. For me I have noticed that this way it's kindof hard to enjoy either char, cause you get a bit of hasle, even if not much of a hassle, still spoils some the ability for you to enjoy and dig into char...<br />
<br />
So, get a melee char you'd like to play, dig in to that char, love it experience it and have cleric one in full moon cast 3 buffs on you and heal you full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I did druid/monk for a while and it was a decent combo (not quite as nice as shaman/monk).  <br />
<br />
The druid sits (in tree form if outdoors- so you dont get jumped)   and hits 2-3 keys per battle - assist snare, assist damage-shield and optional assist nuke/dot if so inclined.   Assist-heal as needed which is probably not that often.<br />
<br />
Eventually you'll get ports which is a huge benefit for getting around.   Until then you still get to use self ports to let the druid be a town/bank mule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I 2-box a 60 shaman and a 54 warrior.  This is a GREAT combo, but a ton of work.  To play either one well, you need one hand on each keyboard.  This gets fairly stressful.<br />
<br />
Hotkeys don't help much, either.  The basic stuff you can hotkey (assist, targeting, healing, following, etc.), but during combat you need to be doing stuff on the warrior (taunt, kick/bash, positioning, disarming, etc.), and you need to be doing stuff on the shaman (debuffing, epic dotting, canni'ing, JBB'ing, etc.).<br />
<br />
If you can handle all that work, you can do very well with this combo.  Even at 54, my warrior tanks a ton better than my shaman, even tho my shaman has much better AC (1140 vs. 1000).  Since hitting 54, my warrior can easily pull agro, even after slowing and crippling.  DPS is decent, especially if you can get good weapons and a haste item.  Basically, the warrior becomes a very efficient DoT (mana cost being buffs).<br />
<br />
If I were to pick a 2-boxing combo to start from scratch, I'd probably go monk/cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>PabstScrapple</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My fav. Combo's.<br />
<br />
Shaman/Monk (Slow and regrowth, Epic/JBB)<br />
Shaman/Ranger (Slow mob, Buff Ranger, watch him kick ass, and fall asleep at the keys)<br />
Shaman/Necro (Slow, engulfing darkness, Stack dots)<br />
Shaman/Rogue (Slow mob, Root Agro and tank it, BS to death)<br />
Shaman/Warrior (Slow Mob, Buff Warrior, Torpor)<br />
<br />
If you think about it... Shaman and any class is great, we really bring out the best in people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Souldreamer Bearspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I was thinking of a monk/enchanter too.  The only problem with that is healing downtime.  <br />
<br />
Its really hard to beat the shaman/monk duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">To dual box, you need a snare of some sort on one of the duo. Since you dont want to use a shaman, the best combo may be a druid/monk. You've got snare, heals, ports, excellent melee damage, the ability to fear kite if needed (monk has ID, druid can scare animal types) and harmony when outdoors.<br />
<br />
There are many  possible combos for a dual boxer, but from my own experiences with it you HAVE to have a snare of some type (darkness spells will do also); the ability to fear a mob makes many fights easier. A puller who can FD will also make things much easier.<br />
<br />
You've ruled out a combo with a shaman, but you may wish to reconsider this. A shaman with a ranger or SK is a great combo.<br />
<br />
If youre looking for the quickest combo to lvl, then a halfling druid with a halfling warrior/paladin/ranger would work (or a halfling cleric with a halfling ranger).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Refob Proudftoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I would highly suggest NOT two boxing a monk and druid if you want to level them past 35.  Druid and monk sounds really really nice in theory, until you realize that it's not possible to kill nonstop with this combo.  Druid heals simply are not mana effecient enough in the 50s range to heal a monk and keep them fighting nonstop.  <br />
<br />
Warrior and cleric is something else to avoid, if you want to level to 60 at a reasonable pace.  Yes, it is nice to be able to be self suffecient on heals and keep yourself alive when you're exping.  The flip side of this is that warriors once you get to 50+ kill blue mobs alone incredibly slow without haste.  You can generally fight non stop with cleric + warrior combo, but even at 60 fighting level 45 mobs, the exp is terrible because you kill so incredibly slow without haste and other melee.  <br />
<br />
The whole purpose of two box duoing is to be able to get exp faster than having to rely on other people, IMO at least.  Downtime or incredibly slow killing = not good exp.<br />
<br />
Shaman + warrior, on the other hand, is a great combo because you fight non stop, keep haste on the warrior AND contribute alot of damage on the shaman at the same time (thx clickies ^^).  <br />
<br />
Honestly, nothing I've seen or tried comes close to shaman + monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>ShadoWynd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I currently dualbox with my shammy/cleric. Shammy slows/DoT's/tanks, and cleric heals/buffs when necessary and heals shammy to full after I canni down to 1 bub HP's. My question is, I've been toying around with a SK on the second account (one with the cleric). How are Shammy/SK's? Any tricks or tactics that make this a good combo? or am I better sticking with the shammy/cleric?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">SK/Rogue is good for fear kiting.<br />
Cleric/Warrior for anything that doesn't require a monk to split.<br />
Enchanter/Druid for fear kiting as well, just using spells this time.<br />
Cleric/SK is good, great heals and buffs.  Plus nice melee damage, and life taps, can also FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">How about a shaman/BL combo?  Have not heard anything on that yet.  It seems like it would work well since the pet is pretty powerful and the BL can dish out a fair amount of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have a guildmate who's a levelling fiend, and he and his wife recently started a monk/necro pair. They were in their teens when I started my monk. My monk recently hit 48 (been PLing him solo for the most part) and the monk/necro are both up to 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">&quot;Why's everyone mentioning shaman when I said i was sick of em entirely? ;p &quot;<br />
<br />
Probably because this is a shaman board.... :D<br />
<br />
Non-shaman I would go SK + Cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well, you may be sick of shamans because you only play one at a time.<br />
<br />
How about playing TWO shamans?  That would take a lot of talent and perhaps be just the kind of excitement you're looking for.  And if shamans can solo most anything, TWO shamans must be able to duo even more!  Or you could just solo two mobs, side by side.<br />
<br />
just kidding by the way -- had to say it ;)</div></div><hr />
