<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, it's about that time... time for the accruing of marginal AA!  I've got pretty much all I want from the new AA and so now I must decide what to get next (can see my magelo in sig if you want to see the other AA I have).<br />
<br />
So, my shaman friends, tell me of your experiences with Persistent Casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dunno if you saw the threads on this shortly after GoD opened, Henora, but the general consensus at the time was that it was a waste of AA.  I believe the (parsed) determination was that you:<br />
<br />
(a) had to be casting<br />
(b) get stunned<br />
(c) pass a check against persistent casting<br />
<br />
then you could possibly channel through the stun.  Thus, the AA adds no benefit to channelling, merely a chance to cast through a stun.<br />
<br />
All in all, that seems a pretty low chance.  Probably a 15% chance of casting through a stun if you are already mid-cast and get stunned.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's been changed somewhat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do a lot of stupid soloing - not for XP, per se, but for the challenge of trying to kill stuff that &quot;shaman shouldn't kill solo&quot;.  As a result, I got PC early (haha, the joke's on me...) and have had a lot of time to test it.<br />
<br />
In literally hours worth of &quot;challenge mode&quot; parsing (attempts to solo things like PoW mephits, unrootable mobs in Barindu, summoning mites in Vxed, etc.) I have had ONE Persistant Casting trigger that I can detect in the logs.  ONE.  Admittedly, I also saw it when it happened, so it looked impressive.  An unrootable noc in Barindu was beating me around, and caught me in a spin-stun as I tried to Tnarg up; I channeled through.  It saved me a death, and helped me get the win (they aren't actually all that hard).  But is it worth the AA?  Um...imo, I'd even think about stuff like Quickened Curing and resists before PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To be honest, its a throw away AA.  One you get when most everything is used up (kinda like how rabid bear and alchemy mastery are, imo).<br />
<br />
<br />
After looking at your current AA's, depending on how much/what you raid, I'd say go with and cap out the innate resists and pump up that STA so its capped w/o buffs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looking at your magelo, I'd work on Quickened Curing and Resists before Persistant Casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19827&amp;highlight=Persistant+Casting<br />
<br />
Pretty much everything I said in that thread is still valid with exception that I can say that I HAVE regained spells when PC has kicked in. <br />
It still is totally stupid that this AA will allow you to cast through a stun, but a simple bash or kick that doesn't result in a stun will still interrupt your casting without any chance of regaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hastened rabidity all the way!<br />
<br />
ok, to be more serious, I have persistant casting 3, have had it for a couple weeks now, and I have never channelled through a stun.. that's not counting the time I had persistant casting 1/2, and I never channelled thru a stun with those either.<br />
Quickened curing would be more of an advantage, or aa resists if you are real bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm.. can't remember how far into the game you are raiding wise Henora, but it wouldn't hurt to go with resists next.  I personally might get the advanced spirit call first just cause it is a lot more dmg, although it's not exactly for the push (if that's what you used them for).  I never really used them much before either, but I'm starting to more now just cause they are cool.  Hmm, I found it personally hard in my equipment to keep my MR up so I have alot of MR augments plus maxed that resist out, and I'll start on DR/PR next cause that is in the same boat.  If you are going towards time next, I would def work on those two first because I know all of two mobs that use some type of fire or cold resist (rallos zek and quarm) while the greater percentage of them checks against your magic, poison or disease.<br />
<br />
oh, yeah, I do have 2 ranks of PC and although I'm not totally sure about it, I know that I've managed to channel through one stun.  That was the only one that I've noticed though.  I do bot alot and even with something like 17% stun resist I still get stunned alot, but with the constant switching between characters I don't notice if I channeled through a stun, or just channeled the normal way sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Giac - thanks for the link, dunno how i missed your post in my search.<br />
<br />
Valsuvious - yeah, I'm not elemental flagged (but have been Kodtaz flagged since the second week of GoD).    I was thinking about spirit call but are they still bugged?  I don't use them much, except for speedbumps in large pull situations.  I use them to pull with too sometimes.  5 dogs that can enrage &gt; 2 dogs that can enrage.   Resists are probably what I am going to go with, nonetheless.  They are so...not exciting heh.  I just wanted to make sure PC was as bad as I seemed to recall reading.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use the dogs for pushing and for rage-tanking. Either way spirit call II is a downgrade, even if it is now fixed. The dogs need to proc stuns like mad or the likes before I considering buying that AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I posted about ASC2 the day they fixed it.<br />
<br />
ASC2 is working and I strongly advice getting it. The game is fast and ASC 2 will provide a good 100 DPS burst damage for the minute it's active.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify. The dogs now hit for 135, proc a poison based lure DD for 640(I have been using it a lot and the average seems 3 procs per minute) and they enrage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">but how many hp do they have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">they have prob around 2500 hps or so.  I've never gotten to actually test them out tanking the mob, but they provide enough dmg to get a mob down to 30% on their own (did it against Ra'tuk in Riwwi when I had three others in camp and wasn't paying attention to that mob).  But, I know from the times that i've seen them get hit, that 2500 hps seems about right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">oh wow.. looks like I may have found my next AA skill!<br />
<br />
Can anyone else confirm that the pets have that many hp? the last I heard, they still had around 200, which is the only reason i have not purchased these puppies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can confirm that the swarm pets now have more than 200hp.  Very worth getting IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WOW, you must have been extremely lucky, since your result is about 20x better than mine. I've had the AA for over a week, and as bard pulling and offtanking have had way way more stuns than you and it's only gone off once.<br />
<br />
For the typical shaman, I'd say about once every 18 days it will go off.</div></div><hr />
