<br />
I’ve sifted through the lists of new AAs coming out and there’re some good ones in there. Once again the care and attention to detail that makes SOE a benchmark of quality is clearly spelled out in their vision of our characters’ evolution. I won’t fill this post up with all of them but I’d like to draw attention to some of the highlights. <br />
<br />
All Classes <br />
Cohesion of the Lost <br />
This ability enhances the entertainment you get from scrolling through an Adventure Merchant’s wares, enabling you to wait longer for that 6th person to log in and put up LFG. <br />
<br />
Comprehension of the Lost <br />
This ability allows you to understand how a person can say OMW or BRT, then take forty-seven minutes to get from PoK to Ruj camp in EC. The highest rank of this creates a detailed log of their movements to the bank, then KEI hunting, then tribute master, then a few minutes in Paineel for no easily acceptable reason before finally getting to EC by way of Western Wastes because “that’s where their bind was.” <br />
<br />
Vengeance of the Lost <br />
This ability allows you to damage the Adventure Recruiter. The second rank of this ability allows you to be very specific about the location of the damage. <br />
<br />
ENC/MAG/NEC/WIZ <br />
<br />
True Perspective <br />
This ability alters the angle of the first person point of view on the monitor so that you’re always looking down your nose at the baser classes that are too stupid to master the art of magic. <br />
<br />
Post Graduate Intern <br />
This ability summons a pet that will do all your research for you, while you take all the credit. <br />
<br />
CLR/DRU/SHM <br />
<br />
Cult of Personality <br />
This ability surrounds you in an aura of divinity. Weak-willed players who pass within range will realize you are their true conduit to the EQ god. People thus affected will log in every night with no other purpose then to sing your praises and bring you converts. They will lvl grind only when you are in a zone they cannot reach, and will loot only wax flowers to sell in the Nexus. <br />
<br />
NEC/SK/BRD <br />
<br />
Cult of the Dead <br />
Similar to Cult of Personality, Cult of the Dead supplies followers with drugs, banners and a tour bus. <br />
<br />
DRU/SHM <br />
<br />
Stupid Pet Tricks <br />
This ability allows pets to be summoned with jokes written on their sides. <br />
<br />
MAG <br />
<br />
Reality Check <br />
This ability, when activated, allows you to remember, with crystal clarity what you went through to get your first epic, thereby protecting you from going after the second one. <br />
<br />
MNK/BRD/SK <br />
<br />
Right of Refusal <br />
This ability, when activated, will make it impossible for anybody to heal you. Higher ranks of this ability will prevent healing even when they really really really want to. <br />
<br />
Right of Way <br />
This ability, when activated, increases the chance that an aggroed mob will path in a logical manner. <br />
<br />
Riiiigggghhttt <br />
This ability will allow you to believe that the Right of Way AA would actually work. <br />
<br />
ROG <br />
<br />
Professionalism <br />
This ability allows rogues to not only drag corpses but dispose of them as well. <br />
<br />
RNG <br />
<br />
Daily Affirmation <br />
This ability provides you with a reminder every time you log in that people will invite a ranger before they’ll invite a berserker. <br />
<br />
BRD <br />
<br />
Illusion: Road Runner <br />
We know you want it. You’ll wear it all the time. Forget dyes. Nobody’s ever going to see your armor again. Second rank allows you to make the “Meep Meep” sound. <br />
<br />
BST <br />
<br />
Warder’s Ardor <br />
This ability allows you to direct your warder to visibly hump another player’s leg. The second rank of this ability allows the pet to continue to do this after you’ve logged off. The third rank gives the pet a money shot. <br />
<br />
Group/Raid Leadership AAs <br />
<br />
GRP/RD <br />
<br />
Helpful Reminder <br />
This ability allows you to send a tell to a targeted player that appears on their screen like the Microsoft Paperclip holding a memo explaining exactly why they keep getting summoned. <br />
<br />
RD <br />
<br />
Fluffy’s Armageddon <br />
This ability, when activated, instantly kills every single pet controlled by a raid member. The second rank of this ability leaves one pet alive to spread the word. <br />
<br />
Illuminate Interface <br />
This is a greatly enhanced version of the raid building tool. In addition to locking and unlocking a raid, moving people from group to group, playing with your guildies like they’re tiles in a turn-based-strategy game, the Illuminate Interface allows you to lock and unlock their doors, control their household appliances, and change their stereo presets. Higher ranks of this ability gives access to bank accounts, credit information, and allows you to create or delete files in the CIA database. After a short learning curve, you will have trained your guild members when to log in and log off. You can have them deported or extradited if the time zone in which they live is inconvenient. The final rank of this ability gives you complete and autonomous control of all world military operations, eliminating the possibility of key raiders being AFK for something as trivial as a war. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">False Hope<br />
This ability, when activated, increases the chance that a competant dev will fix the shaman class <br />
<br />
Riiiigggghhttt <br />
This ability will allow you to believe that the False Hope AA would actually work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, do all raid leaders, everywhere, get a sort of management-induced glee from doing this?  I know ours do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">due to some complaints about raid leaders who make the mistake of directing and positioning everyone, i have decided to completely do away with the practice while leading open PoP flag raids on my server (Ayonae Ro). instead, i will now simply form up a raid, move everone around so that each group resembles an xp group, making exceptions only for groups of people who feel it would be more efficient for me to let them remain grouped with their four boxed toons in addition to their main, etc. i will then use the raid window tools to give someone else the lead--preferably someone who has never done the raid before--will give someone else in my group the group lead, and will then go on auto follow once we are in the appropriate zone, opting to try for the win on the raid by simply letting everyone do what they want after that point, without messing around with the overrated process and practice of actually *leading* the raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
people don't need direction, they need positive reinforcement.<br />
<br />
wooot! RZ, here we come!</div></div><hr />
