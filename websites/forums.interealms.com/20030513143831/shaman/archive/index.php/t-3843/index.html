<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started this quest, but I'm max KoS to the coldain.  I invised to the bar and waited for a scripted sequence I had read about that causes everyone to clear out except the npc I need and the barkeep.<br />
<br />
When that I happened, I tried to hand him the acid and my invis dropped.  He attacks, while politely handing my acid back saying he cannot use this.   Then the regulars came running back in and I had to gate.<br />
<br />
I don't really want to create a mule to do this.  Has anyone done this quest with bad coldain faction?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I still think there is a way to do this purely in Keal, but you should just mule it out.  It is super easy if you get a friend or two to help and really does not take much more time using a mule.</div></div><hr />

The Bazaar most likely.   Seen 5 Blood Wolf Harnesses for sale up there in E'Ci.  From around 50-200p.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">yea thats the way i did and the route to get to Broodmother w/ a little more detail is from the north entrance the closeest to thurg head south make the 1st left than make the next left again and head stright w/ invis up their should be 2 guards or something to that name on your left and right of the room and Broodmother should be stright ahead in a like cave all by her self who will not attack if u drop invis if she is not their just do what the other guide suggest and sit and check from time to time and korf took me 1 plague and 3 e-bolts and a little from the dog dog and did vanish when Broodmother came so just make sure tobe on your toes and GL =)</div></div><hr />
