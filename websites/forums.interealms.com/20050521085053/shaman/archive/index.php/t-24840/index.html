<br />
Next Steps <br />
<br />
I would like to start the vote on Friday. Each volunteer will have the opportunity to submit their report or a summary of what they will write about to the Crucible. The voting period will run for one week. At the end of the week, the report with the highest number of votes will be sent to Casters Realm to be posted as a special &quot;State of the Shaman Report.&quot; Please see here (http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=6493) for an example of the Mage State of the Class Report which was posted to Casters Realm a couple of weeks ago.<br />
<br />
If enough people feel strongly enough, I will forward the non winning entries to Gemdiver as well, he might be interested in seeing all of them.<br />
<br />
I thank all the volunteers in advance for their time, passion and expertise. Please check your PMs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry for the delay, one poster asked for an extension until Monday to finish writing their report. Considering the short notice to produce a document while balancing real life and game, I said okay. I will hopefully be able to post all the reports and enable voting later today!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey Glori and the rest of the gang.<br />
<br />
I got busy. <br />
<br />
Please take me out of the running. Sorry. When I get some free time I will try and make up a post about how I feel about the state of the shaman in EQ.<br />
<br />
Sorry again. Lame excuse I know but I can't even get my head on straight at the moment. Let alone work on Eq stuff. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's a shame, Snoww, I was really looking forward to your post. I completely understand though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm in the same boat as Snoww unfortunately, and judging by some of the other &quot;previews&quot; I think the other folks have it covered just fine.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've got a really rough draft ready, but it needs serious polishing.  :(  You caught me at a bad week.  Super busy at work, and throwing a surprise 40th anniversary party for the parents with about 50 guests.  Talk about an insane time sink!<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just whipped mine out in one-take. I got into a flow, and when I re-read it, it was reasonable so I sent it along.<br />
<br />
I wish Snoww and Bart were gonna have time to write as well. Regardless of who's gets chosen, I KNOW I would have enjoyed reading their opinions and ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did the same Blazz, though I hope Glori likes me enough to fix that really ridiculous typo of mine ... note to self: never try to write anything while your rottweiler wants you to play tug-of-war with his brand new rope. Still, I wish Snoww and Bart would've written a quick something ... that'd have been good reading.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I sent off a copy to glorr, but I'm not real happy with it.  I have a tendency to polish things up a lot by re-reading a few times, but I didn't have time to do it on this one.  I think I managed to read it over all of once.  It's discombobulated, choppy, and lacks a proper flow--which, of course, lessens the impact and detracts from the read.<br />
<br />
I hate rush jobs!  (Yes, I'm a perfectionist, and this ain't perfect by any stretch of the imagination!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am gonna write something up. Once I have some time. I just have not have any decent blocks of time to get into a groove. I actually wrote up about 2 pages worth at work back last week. and the boss came in and suprised me and I closed it without saving. Grrr.<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to reading yalls though. Also I have noticed that with the guild members off playing other things I have zero desire to log on, it is a scary feeling. So instead in my littel free time I got back on CoH and have been playing and finished Warhammer Dawn of war. <br />
<br />
Have a good one folks.<br />

<br />
The State of the Shaman<br />
<br />
An old bear looks up from the cold tundra wastes. Looking across the ice and snow to the past and the present. Looking towards the future. <br />
<br />
Many know my name. Many have heard my words over the years. I am as old as recorded history on this world of norrath. I have walked the lands as a leader of friends and alone with only my spirit wolf beside me. <br />
<br />
I sit today with the chill finally seeping into my bones. The winter of the ages are layed before me. Never in all of my days has the cold touched my spirit like it does these days.<br />
<br />
A shaman in this day and age is much different than when I first picked up the hammer. In the olden days when adventure ruled the day a shaman was a glorious sight to behold. The rage spewing out from blood flecked lips. Weapons brandished in a fury the likes of which had only been seen in the drawings of the god of war himself. <br />
<br />
In the olden days a shaman was a warrior of spirit. Clothed in chainmail and the spirits of brother bear and sister wolf enveloping him in a warm embrace. The shaman could walk into a battle secure in the knowledge that the spirits would aid any that walked by. Making them stroger, faster, more able to withstand the rigors of combat. In the days long past a shaman would slow the attack of the enemy to a pitiful crawl. Watching with hidden laughter as the monster swung pitifully at the stinging insects of togor and his clan.  <br />
<br />
When the world was new and the fabled ice comets of the wizards were but myth and legend Shaman walked the land with poisen and disease spread before them.  A monster died with every casting, and hammer in hand shaman strode into the heart of battles. Healing when needed but primarily crippling the enemys ability to damage our strengthened comrades, while our poisens rotted them from within.<br />
<br />
Now I look at a battle in a different manner. I look not with the eyes of a youthful battle hungry wolf, but instead with the tired gaze of one bear who has seen too many winters. Too many friends long dead and gone.  <br />
<br />
Instead of standing tall at the front of a battlefeild. I now walk with a nervous care. The monsters of chaos and taleosia would kill poor old Vox as fast as I used to kill a splitpaw gnoll. Instead of walking as a warrior of spirit and justice I instead walk as a dog who has been beaten one to many times for raising it's voice in a joyous howl.  <br />
<br />
I am ashamed to say I walk slightly scared, instead of carrying the fight to the monsters, instead of wading into the battle lines proud and unstoppable, I first cast a spell of malos to insure my once dibilitating insects will have a chance at affecting the monsters. <br />
<br />
Then I notice that the effects of my spells are ineffective to say the least. Thier attacks are still fast coming and powerful as before. If they do resist the lure of the insects and are angry with me for my gall, I now have to hold my breath and hope the skills of another will save me, I have to hope a cleric or warrior will step in to help me handle the monsters attacks.<br />
<br />
As I speak of this I feel the anger of days long past surface. I long once again to feel the bloodlust rise, but I am an old bear now and with the continual suprise of the old; I look down and realise the mind is willing but the body, is tired so very tired of the beatings, the abuse, the neglect, the uncaring ways of the world. <br />
<br />
A shaman has a job that is simple to describe but complex in nature. Our job is to make every else better able to compete with the challanges of the world around us. In this with the new spells of chaos we are once again useful to call into battle. Just not as useful as another more suited to the narrow tasks laid before us.<br />
<br />
With the spirits of wunshi at our call the sword swingers and knights of renown once again want a shaman close at hand, but it is different than the olden days. The luster of a newly polished sword held in the hands of a warrior does not sing the way it used to. <br />
<br />
The warriors know thier craft better than ever before, they weigh and measure all that stand or fall before them, and instead of being eager to test thier strength against a foe, they wait for a cleric to ensure thier heals will be strong and plentiful. A shaman is nice to have around, Like the old faithful dog that makes the hunt brighter. But in comparasion the cleric is the daylight. <br />
<br />
A shaman can make the sword arm sing, chanting out a cadence of swish swish swish. It is a steady beat, even soothing in it's measure and timeing. An enchanter, however,  is an addition of the war horns, the drums of doom punding upon the backs of the dead. We are nice to have around but to get the blood truly pumping you require an enchanters majiks.<br />
<br />
Shaman are a sum of many things. We do control the ebb and flow of a groups heartbeat, but we are generalists in a specialist age. We can make a group better in almost any aspect, but there are specialists who will do better still at any one thing. <br />
<br />
Perhaps another should speak of the state of the shaman, a younger wolf, one who travels in the pack still. For I feel as the old and tired bear that shaman, and all of norrath are weakened. <br />
<br />
The shaman of old are gone. An in it's place is a spirit caller who is content with the stories and history of power. But the present of mitagated circumstances, and spirits who while strong seeming are in effect the gauzy whisps of the meek who have comprimised away all glory or valor.<br />
<br />
We no longer walk in the days of legend, we walk in the days of celebrated mediocrity and the shaman class seems to now be it's champion.  <br />
<br />
I no longer feel the power of the spirit talker. Of the ghost walker. I am no longer a rock upon which the tides will break.  I am just an old bear looking across the cold tundra, remembering when there was hope in the world for the days ahead. I wander the lands looking for purpose for a story, for charecter. And instead I only see the headstones of the mighty now falling to the wayside. And the lords of the world walking past uncaring, as the color itself drains out of the land before me. <br />
<br />
Snoww Silverhammer Old tired bear  E marr<br />
<br />
P.s. Depressing I know. Sorry. There is fun left in the game. But look to yourselves and see if the fun is with the people or the land around you. I used to have fun just playing the game. It didnt matter if my friends were around or not.  Now the only goal is the accumilation of loot and power. And it is a hollow path to walk.</div></div><hr />
