<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TeodorLuath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I understand it, most people calculated damage per second as the amount of damage down by a player through melee, dots, and nukes (and sometimes pets are included in the calculation)<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever done a calculation on the amount of dps a shaman improves a group by with their buffs?<br />
<br />
I'm curious what the difference in DPS for a bazaar-geared group of level 60 melees with the following buffs:<br />
<br />
Avatar<br />
Celerity<br />
Maniacal Strength/Talisman of the Rhino<br />
Mortal Deftness/Talisman of the Raptor<br />
IoS<br />
<br />
assuming those are all the buffs available to a level 60 shaman that would improve potential for damage.<br />
<br />
Am I misunderstanding the impact these have?<br />
<br />
Do mobs drop faster if everyone has these buffs than they do without?  And isn't that an increase in damage output over time?<br />
<br />
Are we getting short-changed by the way dps is calculated?<br />
<br />
I'm probably all wrong about this, but I'm curious if anyone has the answers...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont understand why this is brought up.  No Shaman said they have a problem at level 60.  We are still very usefull at that level.  Too bad though everyone progresses past that eventually, and then sees how usefull Shaman really are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">warbear did you even read the posters question at all? Or ya just feel like complaining for the heck of it lol.<br />

Not really, with exception of Avatar, a number of classes can buff the area's you stated with that lineup to similar effectiveness prolly.  So trying to abstractly calculate indirect dps gain of party members and attributing that to the shamans total dps isn't realistic I don't think.<br />
<br />
So the real question is since you &quot;could&quot; sub a shaman w/ &lt;insert class here&gt; it's what does the shaman themself bring in terms of DPS would really only boil down to DD, Dot, Pet for the most part.<br />
<br />
Anyway just my 2cp...I'm going to return to my caffeine instilled delirium again thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Funny, Warbear, I started feeling useless starting at 55. Maybe my guild was just ahead of the times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you feel so useless perhaps its time you play a class that you deam usefull.  I still think shamans rock and love playing mine every time I log on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Avatar, strength, dex (helps procs), and haste are our DPS improving buffs. Bi Lih also adds to attack.<br />
<br />
Agil and sta do not help dps<br />
<br />
I usually only use IoS on clerics that wanna do some melee but are self buffed so focus won't stick.</div></div><hr />
