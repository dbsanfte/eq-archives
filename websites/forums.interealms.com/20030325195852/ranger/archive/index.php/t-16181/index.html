<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if anyone has recently done the 6th ring on Tunare.  I waited a bout 4 hours for Emissary last night and nothing.  No Emissary.  No Rodrick.  Just wondering if it is broken or how long I should expect to wait.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shemazar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I suggest you do the sequence with the ghost and Icefang first and follow Icefang to the demise of Poxbreath.<br />
<br />
Once the orc is dead, Rodrick should spawn around 1 - 5 PM game time.  Note that the ghost only spawns at night-time, so you may have to wait a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Once the orc is dead, Rodrick should spawn around 1 - 5 PM game time.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm that Poxbreath and Rodrick timers are related?  This is the first I had heard of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've never heard of it either.  I've always thought the Ry'gorr Emissary was on a fixed timer.  <br />
<br />
Your problem might be that people at the fort are killing the Emissary before he walks to the hut to spawn Rodrick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is the first I've heard about Pox and Rod being related also.  I killed Pox rested and medded up then went immediately to the fort so I'm not to sure they are related.  As far as people killing the emissary before he gets to fort, I give a shout to please let him live.  Also had tracksort by spawn time so I don't think anyone killed him.  BTW, Emissary spawns at the &quot;tower&quot; inside the fort, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shemazar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I didn't mention that he would spawn immediately.  I said he would spawn after some time around 1-5 PM game time.  The ghost only spawns at night-time, so you're looking at a good wait for Rodrick to spawn.<br />
<br />
A guildmate of mine killed him this way.  He did mention another way was for the Emissary to spawn him, but supposedly the script with the ghost does force Rodrick to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I already have the note from Pox.  Another 4 hours last night and nothing.  Anyone else got any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">an EQ day is 72 minutes, so if Rodrick was going to spawn in the afternoon (EQ time) that the ghost/wolf sequence was activated, it would be only RL half an hour or so later.  Also, I've seen Rodrick spawn multiple times within a few hours (long time ago) so unless something changed, it's not linked to ghost/wolf because there was no one else doing those other steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shemazar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry for the misinformation then.  I'll try it out tonight again soon and see what the results are.  Yes, Rodrick can be up multiple times from the Emissary also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ladas Sindarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There used to be a bug in the spawns where after about a week of no server/zone downtime, Rodrick would stop spawning.  Was this fixed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just found out Ladas is right.  It breaks after a while.  Someone told me the same after I /ooc to leave Emissary alone.  Anyone know when the next patch is scheduled so I can get this done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Seems to me that this bug begins to occur fairly soon after server reset, not one week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Myrdale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Rodrick is just weird on Druzzil Ro. I had no problem finding him at all. Only time i go to CC is when i need silks or velium and he has been up probably 4 out of 15 or so times that i have left there. Becareful fighting him though, he is nearly 100% magic resistant if i remember correctly, which means no snares, roots, or nukes. And he backstabs like a &amp;^$#*$ so be careful.</div></div><hr />
