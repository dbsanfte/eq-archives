These are dots off luclin and tier 1 planes mobs.   <br />
<br />
Now b4 dots were just annoyances when mobs casted them.. but now they are pretty harsh. These dots completely stop melee from engaging mobs other then the tanks. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why is it that our dots did not get upgraded like this? Why do ours still take 1 min or 2 min to do damage ? <br />

Changes like this will makes dots useful and more on the line with other peoples damage abilities.  With the coming of pop dots must burn fast.  VI did this for mobs.. but not for  PC's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why do we need to do damage to pop bosses? heal some of the huge AE damage they do, solo with dots, problem solved</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You want fast damage?<br />
<br />
Chain cast the Tears of Saryn (1950-ish damage) and Torrent of Poison (1550-ish damage).<br />
<br />
Or invest some AA's in spell casting fury, get a mage focus bracelet and cast the 925 DD Ice nuke.<br />
<br />
(Depends on mobs resists of course - shame we have no lure based nukes).<br />
<br />
Most likely casting too many of those in a row will get you summoned and killed.<br />
<br />
Likewise even casting Blood of Saryn + Bane of Nife too soon will get you summoned and owned brutally.<br />
Having even stronger dots would get you killed faster and you'd need a really good shadowknight to keep aggro off you....<br />
<br />
Stacking Ulthor + Pox + Plague + epic however WON'T get you killed and over a long fight (15 to 20 mins+) it all adds up.<br />
Especially if you have 2 or 3 shaman doing that (same dots from multiple shaman have stacked for awhile now).<br />
<br />
I don't think there is much wrong with out DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Interesting idea. <br />
<br />
I do not forsee that SOE will make such a change, however.   I have to say though, very good idea.<br />
<br />
That would bring our DoT's into the realm of &quot;useable&quot; when you are not soloing.  As it is now, I never cast a single DoT in an experience group.  Instead, I cast Tears Of Saryn.  It is fast, effective, and benefits from my AA (scf1, scf2, scf3, fom1).  It would be nice to see DoTs be more useful.  Granted, the &quot;over time&quot; part of the name should still apply, but perhaps make our poison DoTs operate over 5 ticks instead of 7.  Or, even better, 4.<br />
<br />
In fact, if necessary, cut the duration (and thus the damage) in half and the mana cost in half.  That doens't seem very unreasonable either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nmok Soulblighter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Those DoT's he posted all came from the Behemoth too.  Not exactly your typical AE'ing  mob......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think the main point of there being problems with our DoT's is how it pertains to groups. For groups, we are really at a bit of a loss for damage because of the way our power is structured. Long casting inefficient DD spells, DoT's that cause major aggro and do not go through till completion, making your DoT spells more inefficient depending on the gear and AA of the others in your group, and rain spells that CAN be good damage, but suffer from the limitations of being AE, high resist rate, and unuseable in the last 10% of life of any monster. <br />
<br />
Due to these factors, our DoT's really only have any use in this day and age for soloing. My personal opinion would be to get rid of the DoT's for us, or rather just change them to DD spells capped at 2200 base damage (aa/crits/focus would still affect them, but highest DD would be 2200). So like Blood of Saryn would be 2200 poison based DD. Breath of Ultor would be a 2200 disease based DD. If having these DD spells would interfere in some way with wizards being the master of damage, then there could be some sort of added recast time or extra mana cost associated with them or something to balance them out. I dunno, it is just a suggestion. I just know that it sucks for damage dealing in group environments. And although disease is great for some boss mobs that have long lasting fights, it sucks that a big part of our damage dealing spells are useless to us most of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DoTs are fine? What kind of crack are you on? I casted 5, that's right FIVE goddamn DoTs on Aten Ha Ra before I was summoned and decapitated. I didn't slow her, nothing. FIVE DoTs all it took. But yeah, they are fine, and the same time wizards are chain nuking with Strike of Solusek for the 20%+ chance to do an insane crit in the 6.2k range and they never get summoned. <br />
<br />
Then there are slows. Hmmm ...<br />
Tactics: crapload of mobs mitigate it, hell I think the whole zone but arena pit does mitigate it.<br />
Torment: many mobs immune, bosses heavily mitigate.<br />
Storms: Bosses immune, every giant mitigates it.<br />
HoHB: Most bosses heavily mitigate slow, yardtrash near MM is 99% MR. Neat.<br />
BoT: many bosses mitigate it, yardtrash too.<br />
Again, our slow is fine. Sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the devs think dots suck, then there is a real problem. What the need to do to fix the aggro thing is cut down on the poison counters. It isn't the damage that is the problem, it is the insane number of poison counters.<br />
<br />
Our dots have actually become LESS efficient since Ebolt. Every other damage class has become more efficient (even other dotting classes), but for god-only-knows what reason, shaman dots, while improving in overall damage, have fallen significantly by the wayside as far as efficiency goes. It needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The fact that you are putting on  30+ counters on a mob is what is getting you summoned not the  1000 damage a tick you are doin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh? Am I not reading this right?<br />
<br />
Ebolt: 1132dmg for 320mana 3.54 ratio<br />
BoN: 1648dmg for 425mana 3.88 ratio<br />
Pox: 2090dmg for 430mana 4.86 ratio<br />
Ultor: 3354dmg for 550mana 6.09 ratio<br />
<br />
Looks like they get more effecient to me.<br />
<br />
I really don't see a problem with our dots aside from the rarity of obtaining them post BoN. We have a nice mixture of fast acting and slow acting ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually, our damage output is an issue with DoT's. I mentioned it in my other post, but will restate it here. Our dot's have damage that scales depending on the others in our group. What I mean by this is that if you group with people that are using epics or worse (and that class of gear) then your DoT's will generally be just fine, and you will likely get full duration off of at least the first DoT. If you are grouping with people using NToV type gear (speaking of melee type stuff) then mobs die faster, which will mean less damage that your DoTs do because mob is dying faster already. This affects not only your damage output overall, but the efficiency of your dot's. Put yourself in groups with people using Ssra or better weaponry, and your efficiency goes down even further. Put yourself in groups with the best equipped people on the server, and you will see even less efficiency. I don't think that any other class faces the same issue of your damage output from your main lines of damage being lessened according to what gear you groupmates are using, except for maybe Necromancers. DoT's just are useless for groups. Great for soloing, but useless for groups. Are there other things that we do? Yeah, of course there is. But we aren't talking about the other stuff that we do at this point. We are talking about our method of putting out damage. Disease has always been useless for most groupsf as we all know, but again, poison becomes more and more of a waste the better the equipment your groupmates have. I don't have all the answers, but I sure would like to see something change to make our damage more appealing than it is atm.</div></div><hr />

With SCFM + Fury of Magic: 30% critical, 200% dmg<br />
3288 *1.3 / 640 = 6.67 avarage ratio<br />
<br />
Shaman Dot is useless in a good exp group, but Shaman still get many group buff and slower job to do.  Shaman dot is useful on long term fight. <br />
<br />
Wizard dds are powerful, but they need control their agro in group.   Their mana limited in a short term fight.   They need work on AA to reach 200% critical dmg.<br />
<br />
While wizard depend on 30% chance to critical 6k+ and random 1~20% dmg increase from focus item, and pray their spell get a full dmg.  <br />
<br />
Extend Affliction works on every dot that shaman casted.  <br />
Since Verant remove dot limit,  Dot will get full dmg if no resist.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman could solo a 100k hp mob(no summon, can root) in 1 hour easily by use root and dot.<br />
<br />
For Wizard, it is very very hard to kite 100k hp mob down without mana reg buff + horse + click item.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What we need is an AA that would give each dot tick a chance to crit the same way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I never use DOTs except when soloing and I rarely solo any more because it's just not worth it any more over a group. I actually have been working on critical nukes with AA so I can do damage without gaining aggro for half the fight. For example: Last night we did the hedge for some people that still needed the flag and we we got to the last mob I did 20k of damage to him. All from nukes. And I slowed. I did not gain aggro once, and this was with a warrior tanking, not a SK or a Paladin. I just chain nuked. If I attempted to do 20k of damage with DOTs I can guarentee you that long before I dropped the 10th Blood of Sarynn on him I would have been summoned and beat down. Why should I use Blood of Sarynn which takes 42 seconds to work and will most likely gain me unwanted aggro when I can just cast two nukes for the same damage in only 16 seconds?  Then maybe throw a couple more nukes in there in the same time period, do  twice the damage and none of the aggro. And our nukes are the worst of the casting classes. Hell Rangers rival us for nukes. And you think our DOTs are fine? Okay sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think the ideal is: Do we get same aggro from mob when shm dot same amount of damage as wiz nuke it?<br />
Ebolt is about solist's spear damage; BoN is about Sunstrike damage;Blood of Saryrn is about the same as Agnarr's Thunder.<br />
Have anyone run aggro test on them giving the same taunt or not?<br />
From &quot;what I observe&quot;, wizard has slightly less aggro even cast the same damage spell unless they crit.<br />
If so then our Dot is NOT FINE.<br />
<br />
VI claim Affliction focus item should be improve dot only, thats fine I am getting used to slow casting SLOW/Malos/Debuff anyway but if whenever we cast a poison type dot and get instant summon is not.<br />
Shorten duration can fix the problem shm want to stack all dot in a given time (heck, how many 42sec we got in a fight actually?)<br />
Most wiz dont chain nuke unless needed, same should we not chain dot, but long duration to take full effect is not what we should get AFTER PoP come out.<br />
<br />
nuker with max Fury of magic way outdamage a shm and I think we deserve some AA that helps dot at least, not some gimp focus item that give you 1tick longer; 25% less mana cost sound cool BUT if u dont use often in a fight sorry you dont save much than a wiz with mana preserve item does.<br />
<br />
I dont think VI ever consider this will be a problem they just did shm the old way they have done, give single/group str/dex/agi/sta and a focus type buff, ONE but not two dot from 61 to 65 from each dot line while other class gotten more new spells that define their class (chanter got 2charm, 2mana regen, 3 mez; cleric got 3 heals; necro got 3 pets 3 dot 3 nuke (1 life tap)with resist adjustment(on dot part), says Lucy while we have to go thru malo debuff and yet still get resisted left and right)<br />

I did this last night for some guildies as well, I did 15k with just epic ultor and pox, I slowed him as well, no aggro.  I'm sure I coulda tossed a bane or two on there and still been okay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">And why didn't you use Bane Drinnar? Mana issues? Efficiency? Or was it because you knew you would draw aggro? Throw in 4 Banes to match my damage on top of your other stuff and I bet you get aggro. And it's a slow DPS group where Pox or Ultor are worth casting. The problem is Disease DOTs are too slow and Poison DOTs are too much aggro and not terribly damaging when compared to our pitiful nukes. My point is our nukes suck and our DOTs are supposed to be top of the line yet I can outdamage our DOTs with our low damage nukes and get less aggro on top of that. I guess my solution would be to lower aggro from DOTs, poison in particular, and give us AA to increase the damage the DOTs do like suggested above. A crit DOT perhaps.</div></div><hr />

Heck I would never EVER trade my dots for druid's nukes. I like to solo once in a while; how many wizards and druids you know soloed dragons in WW at 60? we can heal ourselfs, watch for adds and all that fun stuff while our dots are ripping the dragons apart!<br />

Why should our DOTs be relegated to soloing only? They are supposed to be a Shaman's strength yet they are only used for soloing the majority of the time. And I am not asking to trade them for Druid nukes, I would ask that they be worthwhile to cast them in an exp group and making them last even LONGER or more efficiently through focus effects is not the answer, obviously. Our DOTs are not fine. But obviously there will be no consensus from the Shaman community on this so I expect they will remain unchanged. Whatever, I am working on crit nuke 3 at the moment so I can bring the most I possibly can to my groups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Way back when, our dots were worth casting. Now I spear and nuke for damage. Why the hell should an ability that we were good at, and had a purpose when eq was invented become useless as we advance in levels? Stat buffing is already worthless in high end, so throw that out. Leaving us with slow (which many others do well enough, especially on mitigating mobs), nukes that are worse than a chanters, utility spells anyone with a few k can scrounge, and mediocre healing. DOTS should be worth casting, as it stands, they are LESS mana efficient in an exp gorup than a nuke, due to aggro, and loss of hp (which basically equals mana). I hate that all I do is dispense worthless buffs that melee whine for because they like the pretty numbers, toss out slow, and deal crap damage. A dot should draw a LOT less aggro than a nuke of a comparable amount, and thats not the case. They should be a lot more mana efficient than a nuke, again, barely the case. They should benefit from damage increasing foci, like a nuke. Again, not the case. <br />
<br />
If there was a focus that improved damage by 30% per tick, then yes, we might get some use out of them. But despite the devs admitting they suck, nothing will be done, because some foolish shaman will always claim we are the king of buffs, and have mana regen, despite the fasct that our spells are lasting less time, giving less comparable benefit than they did in the past, and other classes mana regen has increased. We may regen more mana in a given amount of time, but we need to, since our spells are mana inefficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Graz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I just think back to when I memmed ebolt for the first time.  I damn near wet myself when I saw the damage it did against a mino in Guk.  As a percentage of the mobs hit points, my dot was what? A third?   <br />
<br />
Kunark.... the slide started... BoN was still pretty strong on Seb/Chardy &amp; HS mobs.  You could do respectable damage with just ebolt &amp; BoN.  Two dots... no biggie, agro wasn't that bad. If the mob did turn on me for a few rounds, we could take it.<br />
<br />
Even if they didn't run full course, they still meant I could hold my own offensively against mobs.  <br />
<br />
Velius/Kunark/PoP.. Mob hitpoints are way up there now.  2k off a normal tier 2 xp mob is almost insignificant.  The stakes are much higher now as well.  I can't take agro off the warrior or I'm dead.   Stack up a bunch of dots?  Yah, next time he checks his poison counter's he's going to find the offending shaman and turn him into paste.   <br />
<br />
Simply put, our dots have been steadly in decline as a percentage of mob hitpoints since Kunark came out.  I can accept the fact that they are slower to cast, higher agro if they can do enough damage to a mob to make it worth that 550 mana.<br />
<br />
(And don't look at boss mob comparissons, it will make you cry, lol)</div></div><hr />

Except for Taunt.  With just one BoN cast after slow + malo and in time to finish before the mop dies - a warrior can't hold taunt, and a Pally or SK will go OOM trying to hold it.  You actually lose efficiency while the warrior plays pong with the mob, or the group waits for the SK or Pally to med.<br />
<br />
Aggro and mana cost for these spells are way overboard while damage per tick is too low.  What needs to happen is significantly lower mana cost, casting time, and aggro of our DoTs.  If the DoT doesn't run to completion on a relatively cheap spell to cast - it's not as big of a problem.</div></div><hr />

I love it when people talk about using rains to deal damage.  Try playing on a pvp server and you will rarely if ever mem any of our crappy rain spells.   Unless you like wiping your raid. <br />
<br />
90% of us play on blue servers and do not give a crap about your gimmick server and its screwed up rules.  Do not come here acting like PvP is the true way to play everquest.  It is not.  You might like it but most of us don't so stay out of this conversation if you have nothing useful to add.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the efficiency of our dots is fine.  They do as much damage as they should, in my opinion.  It is true that we do not come close to matching a wizard in damage, but so what?  We are not a damage dealing class.  We were never meant to be and we never will be.  If you want to do damage on raids then play a DD class, there are plenty of them to choose from.<br />
<br />
However, the aggro on our dots is messed up.  There is entirely too much of it.  It is fine if our dots don't do as much damage as a wizard's nukes, but I would like to be able to actually use my dots without getting summoned.  In raids and exp group, I use my rains and nukes to deal damage.  I only pull out my grummus shield and dots when I am soloing.</div></div><hr />

This isn't true.  A warrior without EB proc weapons DOES have a hard time getting aggro back from a BoN, but SK's and pallys have no trouble at all and it generally only takes one spell and a taunt.</div></div><hr />

Last I looked - PvP servers are part of the EQ family.  I may not play pvp but that doesn't mean I have to be the hind end of a troll about it.<br />
<br />
but SK's and pallys have no trouble at all and it generally only takes one spell and a taunt.<br />
Until the next tick.<br />
A non-uber SK or Pally has to continuously do something besides swing a weapon and taunt to keep a mobs attention after a malo, slow, and BoN - usually expending mana in the process.  These few extra hits on the shaman can really hurt on a pop mob, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I have a good friend that plays a warrior in the top (north american) guild on our server.  He is wielding two enraging blow weapons.  He is wearing gear that is all PoP and Vex Thal, breaking 8k hp, max stats less agi unbuffed, yadda yadda yadda.  I told him that I could easily pull taunt from him, he laughed at me.<br />
<br />
Plane of Valor, pulling those annoying spiders and golems that never seem to drop the metallic liquid, I'm not slowing.  He's fully buffed, he pulls a mob.  Without ever casting a dot before the first one wears off, using Bane of Nife, Torrent of Poison, epic, and Pox of Bertox, I drew agro despite his taunt (which worked every time) and 8 procs of Enraging Blow.  The mob turned to him only for a second after each successful taunt, at which point it returned to me.<br />
<br />
At most, I did 120 DPS.  Usually, BoN finished once and I got maybe one tick into second before the mob was dead.  He is probably pumping out more DPS than I, and certainly more DPS in the beginning of the fight.  There is no conceivable reason for me to gain agro from him.<br />
<br />
You can argue that you don't like using our dots, and I won't care.  But to say that there is nothing wrong with the agro that our dots cause is assinine.  There is no other class that can draw the agro we do with the same amount of damage output, at least not that I've seen.  And once agro is pulled, our dots make it exceedingly difficult for the tank to pull it back consistently.<br />
<br />
Low level shaman = the suck.  Mid-level shaman rule.  High level shaman = marginalized.  Thx Thott (and yes, I believe that the developers were swayed by the fancy pictures and bull**** theories).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">off topic somewhat...<br />
<br />
So I am guessing that 2 different dots of same type (eg. poison) will stack from this conversation (from the one caster)? ie. BoN and ebolt? I never realised this if so...I thought only different types eg. disease and poison would stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Well, I have to agree about the agro.  Its a sad day when the Shaman does a VERY good job of being SA.  In the casting time of a single dot, I can pull agro off of ANY nuker (short of a Manaburn).  <br />
