<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My friend Miochan was going through Sanctus Seru the other day.  He came upon a building with no doors around it.  He proceeded to grav flux himself onto the top.  He found a hole at the top- this was extremely high.  He looked down the hole, and casted sight (enchanter of course) onto something in the room to get a very close look at this incredible guy!  Conned red to a level 55- just look at the sword!<br />

<br />
(By the way.  I want to use this time to apologize to all who went on the Vindi raid and especially Rizz.  My guildmates were very foolish and I was ashamed to see what they did.  They had NO right to tell you guys to be quiet)<br />
I don't usually post here much- but look at this !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nice sword :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hammerstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Now that is a sword worthy of a CLERIC if I ever saw one !! OMG<br />
<br />
Yalidu did your friend say what he conned as in amiable, threatening etc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Miochan Kawaii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok Yadilu sent me the URL and told me he posted my screenshot.<br />
In this city as a high elf I conned indifferent to guards and dubious to many of the other NPCs. <br />
<br />
When I conned this guy, he was threateningly (and red con).  <br />
<br />
By the way, levitation spells don't work in this city (including air elemental), so I could not go down there to explore..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, threatening :)<br />
We went there again tonight.  We found out a lot about him.  Evidentally he attacks with a FLURRY of attacks.  Also there are several guards in the temple that hit for 200-300dmg.  Ouch.<br />
Some more cool screenshots :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You guys couldn't even pick it up let alone swing it *giggle*.<br />
Surely you can see that a Barbarian is meant to wield that weapon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vhela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You go Bashy :D  That looks like a Barbarian weapon to me!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">A wood elf warrior like myself would look mighty fine carrying this weapon.   Yes mighty fine and effective too.  <br />
<br />
Lord Inquisitor Seru... hmmmm.  Well of course with a weapon such as this would have to come a title like that.  Lord Windigo Anthesteria, Protector of Kelethin, Ruiner of Other People's Lands But Not His Own.  Yes, I quite like that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have to agree with Abash that a smallish wood elf could only dream of hefting such a blade. Now a manly half-elf is another story.<br />
<br />
Baracus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmmm, looks like a pally sword *coughs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">heh <br />
<br />
knowing VI that sword is part of the model and won't drop muhahahaha<br />
<br />
now think of how cool wynnie the tankchantress would look wielding that thing.  It definatly looks castery to me, dontcha thinkg? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sorry to tell you all but that is a Scimitar class sword and is Druid only....MAWAHAHAHAHA:D <br />
<br />
But really I am going to guess with a name like Lord Inquisitor that this item will be Paly and SK only...more then likely Pally only...that is if it is not part of the model and does droop to begin with.<br />
<br />
Another side note did anyone notice the fact that his off hand is always covered in flame.....once again if not just part of the model could be something nice.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Miochan Kawaii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes, the offhand has a nice particle effect itself.<br />
<br />
Also there are 4 other NPCs in the room which cast Paladin offensive spells on Yadilu's eye (when they didnt slash it for 390 damage).<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's about time Enchanter's get a 1HS weapon with a nice look, can't wait till I get mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My guess is you guys are dead on... looks to me like a paly 2H slash.<br />
<br />
Probably crappy stats heh.<br />
<br />
I am looking forward to getting a title like that:<br />
<br />
Lord Inquisitor Kilrain :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tannin Steelblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">at the front of this place is a large door looking thing that if you click on it or run into it kicks you back a good 10 feet or so.. wondering if ya had any info on that .. ... it must be the way in somehow<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm plagiarizing a friend here:<br />
<br />
If the next zone over is levitation castable, maybe we can grav flux a mage up there, and pull coth of previously levitated raid forces, then float down and set up.<br />
<br />
Variations on the theme of course.  Like the mage falls to his death and is rezzed by a cleric from atop the building who can see the corpse and cast on it (range?)<br />
<br />
<br />
If this mob is &quot;not supposed to have been found&quot; - it's possible that VI isn't done with it, and it might end up having over a billion hps, like the sleeper did when foh found him right off the bat.  Won't know til we try, of course - and coffins aren't all that expensive ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Miochan Kawaii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">That's a good idea, to CoH levitated people up there. Just be ready to fight when you go down there, he sees through invis.  And I think he is by default threatening to every race (according to my illusions).<br />
<br />
<br />
Or maybe after the next few patches the door will actually open, who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Maybe the door can be picked by a rogue in sneak/hide mode? Also the door may be a trap in itself? So when you sent the eye in this thing didn't aggro you at all? I know he killed the eye but did he even cast or try to come after you? And wondering are you sure there is only him and 4 others in there? did you see any corradors or doors (besides the front door)? Also the clear well around that guy. Does it look like a clear floor or could it be a trap also? Sorry my mind is clicking with questions and ideas hehe <br />
<br />
I have a feeling this guy and his friend will take alot of people to kill. He is one mean looking dude. &lt;shiver&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Sheesh Meia, it's just a paladin.<br />
<br />
I mean, how hard can he be?  ;)<br />
<br />
-Q</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">/duel Quinnell :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Heheh, nah, my eye almost soloed him<br />
Nah, I was very surprised to find that he didn't summon me or try to cast on me.  I was very scared the first time I let my eye down there and I gated right after it was killed.  The next time I waited and nothing happened, so I kept sending eyes down...  I don't think the door can be picked, because shouldn't it say that it's locked but I don't have the key?  It doesn't say anything like that..  There is one long hallway all the way around his room that have more guards in there.  They might aggro.  I'm not sure about the clear well, my eye did nothing on it and it seemed to have no effect...<br />
On an interesting note, I figured out something else.  When you open 2 doors in the room, across the hall are clear vertical blocks with a symbol on them.  I've found that these are porting blocks in Sanctus.. So there are 2 porting blocks inside the building.  I clicked on one of them and when my vision returned my character was moved to the Dawn zone.  I dunno  *shrug  =\</div></div><hr />
