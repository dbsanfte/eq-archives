<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fearkiting and questing in Stonebrunt has been handled very well by Tyrolene, but he seems to have an unnatural aversion to the kobolds, so I thought I’d step in to help out.  <br />
<br />
Soloing:<br />
<br />
All you need to solo kobods efficiently in Stonebrunt is harmony, so level 22 is a good time to come visit.  Traveling through the Warrens at 22 is tricky, but once you get to know the zone, you’ll be able to minimize the size of the train you leave at the Stonebrunt zone line when camo drops early.<br />
<br />
To get through the Warrens, just go left, swim, past the grate, right, left, left, a little left, right, left, through the door into the throne room, follow left wall out the other door, right, right, straight past the Cave Bat Lord, right, straight out to zone.  In other words, get a map.<br />
<br />
There are several different kobold camps throughout the zone.  They represent different level ranges, and are delineated by the kobold names.  <br />
<br />
(Please note that the level ranges are my own estimates, derived from /considering each camp with a level 18 or 19 character, and from my own experience leveling there.)<br />
<br />
The lowest level camp is just to the left of the entrance as you leave the tunnel from the warrens.  This contains savage kobolds (13-16), and lesser kobold shamans (15-17).  By the time you get harmony, these kobolds will be a little low for you.<br />
<br />
The best camp for soloing without adds at 22 is on the south wall of the zone not too far from where the wall ends and the ocean begins.  Here you will find lesser shamans (15-17) and ferocious kobolds (16-18).  Stay on the stone-colored ground when not pulling, and you’ll get zero adds.  Harmony pull, you need only harmony the target, because their assist radius is small (This is true of all of the kobold camps).  Keep in mind that there is one spawn off to the side, and two in tents on either end of camp.  Make sure you pull far enough away to prevent the shamans from healing what you’re fighting, too.<br />
<br />
The next highest camp is also easy to pull without adds.  The large camp just to the right of the zone entrance (when facing out from the tunnel) is easily pulled right out in front of the camp.  It contains burly kobolds (17-19) and greater shamans (21-24).  <br />
<br />
The next two camps in level range are the river camp at -500, 2800 and the coastal camp at -4400, -3300.  Raging kobolds (19-22) and greater shamans (21-24) inhabit these camps.  These two camps are a little bit difficult due to animals which path close to or through the camp.  <br />
<br />
The five camps above have loot drops of cloth/leather armor and bronze weapons, and the loot is pretty good for the experience gain.<br />
<br />
The final kobold camps are almost due north of the Kejek town at 3700,-1000 and in the NW corner of the zone at 3700, 3000.  TheNE camp contains highland kobolds (23-26) and highland shamans (25-28), and the NW camp contains highland shamans (25-28) and raging highland kobolds (27-31?).  <br />
<br />
The north camp is considerably easier to pull.  Facing the camp from the front, the best spot to pull to is the area behind and to the right of the camp.  I use the tree that’s right there as my mark.  When pulling, I run alongside the camp to the first tree, and then straight back (north) to the second tree.  That gets them clear of each other, and usually gets me singles.<br />
<br />
Animals do path in front of this camp, so keep an eye out while harmonying/pulling.  SOW (and therefore level 30) is a must for this camp, as it’s a long way to safety, and most of the roaming mobs here are high 20’s/low 30’s.<br />
<br />
The loot from this camp is very good: coin, fine steel, chain (bamboo splint), and plate (etched iron).  It’s a six-spawn, four of which are inside tents.  The respawn time on these mobs is about six minutes or so, and the average mob in this camp has 4-5 pp of cash and merchandise, so if you're a high enough level to pull and kill one per minute, you can max this camp out, approaching 250-300 pp/hour.  You  better have a lot of empty bags, though.<br />
<br />
The NW camp is difficult to pull because it doesn't seem to have a &quot;front&quot;.  It has four tents in a circle, and one spawn in the center.  There are at least two animal paths near the camp as well, so overall it can be pretty tricky to pull.  Of course you can always fear the animals away while you dispatch your kobold.  This camp appears to be a better xp camp, with the same loot, and one fewer spawn point, when compared to the north camp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grouping:<br />
<br />
Grouping is much the same as soloing, except you can do each camp while there are still yellows and reds, if your group is strong enough.  A group in the high teens can do the Warrens “back door” for insane dungeon experience using the zone line to Stonebrunt as an escape route.  Light blues in the Warrens give similar experience to dark blues in Stonebrunt because of all the dungeon bonuses.  (Of course that would be a Warrens guide, I guess.)<br />
<br />
Also you can do the highlands much sooner, if you have a means of evac, or provider of SOW.<br />
<br />
Selling and Banking:<br />
<br />
There are vendors in the Kejek town, just camo up and make the run.  Stonebrunt is pretty spread out, so you shouldn’t have problems with agro if you catch camo dropping in time to find an empty space to recast.  Stonebrunt seems really big pre-sow when you’re encumbered with an agility of 30.  <br />
<br />
The first two buildings on the right when you enter the Kejek town contain vendors.  The first building has smithing vendors, and the second has a baking vendor.<br />
A sidelight to selling: Kobold meat drops fairly well off all the kobolds, and can be baked with a jug of sauces and spices (both available from the baking vendor) in an oven (right next to the vendor) to make Kobold Steaks +1 Sta, +1 Str.<br />
<br />
There is no bank in the kejek town, but you can convert you smaller coin into plat for a slight fee, if you have good charisma.  The best way to get good charisma is to get a couple of opal encrusted steins.  Once you get to 105 or so, you’re all set.  Go to the smithing vendor who sells the molds, and buy a mold that will use up all your copper, silver, and most of your gold.  (You may need to do this multiple times depending on how much you’re converting.)  Sell back the mold to the vendor.  You’ll get about 85-90% of your money back, converted to platinum.  Sure beats a long trip to the bank, or destroying coin. Just don’t overdo it, or you’ll start wasting platinum.<br />
<br />
<br />
Comments and criticism welcome; I especially could use verification/corrections on the kobold names and level ranges, as I know alla's is off on that.<br />
<br />
Big Edit:  Changed a lot of info on kobold camps after visiting them with my bard alt, and added my &quot;loot parsing&quot; information to the highland section.<br />
<br />
Smaller Edit:  Visited the NW camp.</div></div><hr />

Wooof!<br />
<br />
(Nice write up of the kobolds.  I realized, after I read your response, that I'd ignored them completely.   I spent a lot of time soloing the NW kobolds for their salable goods, and have danced with the NE ones several times trying to drop the Elder pandas that seem to like to wander around there.<br />
<br />
7 Kobold camps in zone.<br />
<br />
Listed in, I think, order of difficulty (lvl / situation &amp; numbers)<br />
<br />
One to the left of the entrance<br />
<br />
One to the right, and another further along that wall.<br />
<br />
One at the far end of the shoreline to the East.<br />
<br />
One to the SE of the Kejek City<br />
<br />
One to the NE by the Waterfall<br />
<br />
One in the NW corner.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Next time I'm out that way, I'll check each camp for names and levels.  Actually, my 18 bard is in Stonebrunt, and I might be able to confirm some levels on the lower camps.<br />
<br />
As far as camps go, the only one I haven't visited is the NW one.  I thought the one to the  SE (along the river) of the kejek town was low level and low spawns,  (although I don't recommend it because animals path through there.)  Pathing was also a problem at the one by the water in the SE corner, so I didn't spend much time there.<br />
<br />
Also the  one further along the right wall is both lower level and fewer spawns than the one immediately to your right as you zone in.  I switched from the former to the latter when it went light blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xyrauth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did the Kolbold camp SE of the city way back when. I think  it is a step up from the camp west most of the zone tunnel. <br />
<br />
I'd med on a small rise on the east side of the stream. I'd make sure I was successfully hiding and then press F9 and get in the chase view that let me see all around. I'd check for wanderers before I engaged anything.  After a gorilla or a cat passed by, I'd snag my next Kolbold. Good hunting indeed. I'd combine any skins I came across and fish while medding. <br />
<br />
I must say, out of all my solo melee camps ever, all three of the Stoneburnt Kolbolds were my favorites. It's so peaceful and the exp and loot rocks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tyrolene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Right.  Level of the kobolds wasn't the only thing I was noting in the difficulty.  Number of kobolds, number of animals nearby and pathing, distance to safety and the terrain you have to run through to get there, etc.<br />
<br />
*shrug*  YMMV <br />
<br />
They still smell funny<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the info guys.  I took my bard alt out there last night, and updated the guide based on the cons.  Hopefully this is rounding out into something that will help the younger players.  I came to Stonebrunt based on Glade recommendations, and I hope I can convince others to do the same!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wonder if there is a name for the psychological condition indicated by continually posting replies to your own thread :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, i visited the NW corner camp, which is cool, but a bear (or perhaps panda) to pull.  All I can tell at 33 is that all of the ragings are dark blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tyrolene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its not so bad if you pull down the slope to the north, but don't go all the way to the bottom.  The flat area is in agro range to 50% of the wandering animals, but the triangular slope area is only 20 or so%.<br />
<br />
I pulled all with my bow from about lvl 35 up with adds only when I got ****y (the meaning of that blanked out word is &quot;over confident&quot; :D  I love badword filters)  and wandered in too close.   Pulled the ones in the open first,  then I worked my way around the tree to the NW and pull the single from the far south tent, then around to the left for both in the west tent, back around for the ones in the east tent... and by then repops are normally occuring so I don't quite get to the north tent ever.  Heh.<br />
<br />
You just have to pay attention.  Panic animal will give you plenty of time to drop whatever kobold you're fighting and get ready for the panda/monkey/tiger/bunny that wants a word with you.<br />
<br />
The top of the small ridge by the NW corner of the camp has fairly straight pathing for panic'd animals, and its far enough away from any other traffic that you should be able to finish that animal unmolested.<br />
