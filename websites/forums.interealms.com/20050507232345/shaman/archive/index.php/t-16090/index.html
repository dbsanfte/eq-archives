<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just thinking about this from someone post in the new zone messages thread. <br />
<br />
I remember i was level 6-10 with my first char, a warrior (can't quite remember) and I was grouped at Orc 1 in EC. All of a sudden the after an apprentice was pulled my screen went completely black. I don't think i used sound back then for EQ (I don't now either) and i supposed my moniter or EQ was phucked. Anyway after smacking the moniter a bit and turning it on off the picture came back, w00t.<br />
<br />
Evenetually I learnt these 'blackouts' were due to mobs casting blind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've always felt like it should black out your viewing area only, it's a blind not something that takes away your &quot;hearing&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the screen should go black - and there should be text saying 'YOU ARE BLIND! DON'T RESET YOUR PC DUMMY!'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yesterday I was dueling in the arena and this paladin cast blind on me.  I don't know how a 64 paladin blinded a 65 shaman w/ 261 MR, but he did it.  Startled the crap out of me heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thought my already shaky video card had bitten it, and rebooted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">First time i got blinded was in a arena vs a cleric. he kept me blind the whole time till he killed me.  I was so furious my face was hot hehe.<br />
<br />
Needless to say i learned to play dirty too that day :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wish that they would leave the lag bar up when you get blinded or leave up chat windows ... after all, chat is what is being heard not seen.  They have done SOOOO much other stuff to make newb lives easier (including turning off the &quot;confusing&quot; lag bar when they start the game).  Heh and with this games @$$tasticly, craptacular programing, you begin to wonder if your machine really did freeze  :rolleyes:   Sure is funny getting blinded for the first time though, as I recall I sent my palidin, Subas, off a cliff.  My friends laughed about that for weeks  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The lag o meter stays up when blinded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The lag o meter stays up when blinded.<br />
<br />
I am waiting for a rezz right now and reading boards, so I decided to test this.  I blinded myself, and my lag bar was not visible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First time I thought I'd crashed and rebooted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I frecked when I was first blinded in pvp. No arena, just doing mobs in Everfrost Peaks. Darn pks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">First time it happened I swore loudly, smacked my monitor hard, then tried plugging it into another machine.  Worked fine so plugged it back into my main machine thinking what a crap time for my graphics card to break just as I was in the middle of a fight.  Whadda ya know, it worked again when plugged back in :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The first time I got blinded, was actually when i first got the spell.  My roommate told me it was a helpful spell, and told me i could get it in Qeynos.  I ran all the way to qeynos cleric guild, bought it, and cast it on myself thinking it was some type of buff, and then my screen froze up, and I just kinda froze there, because it was only my first real day of playing, and I thought i had crashed.  I ran into the other room to ask my roommate, and he just kinda laughed at me and sent me back in.  When I came back, everything was fine.<br />
<br />
With the old UI, it did Show the lag o meter, which was the only thing that kept me from restarting the computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My first use of it was traveling the tunnel from EF to BB... i was thinking, &quot;Hmmm, flash of light, maybe it'll help me see where the hell I'm going in this dark&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn't.<br />
<br />
Ah, back in those days, when I would snuff my lantern when a nasty mob walked past so I wouldn't get its attention...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think the first time I got blinded was playing my ranger in CoM on a Reaver raid. We were all told to set up a &quot;I'm blind&quot; hotkey, so I was expecting it. It was still unnerving to see the screen go blank though.<br />
<br />
The first time I fought Trakanon was the scary one though. It was the bard triggered version, so it just popped when we killed the trigger. I didn't know he blinded, and I was blinded from the start of that fight to just before the finish. I didn't know whether I was alive, dying, or in shrooms, or how things were going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hehe blindness is one of those things that's MUCH easier when you and your spouse are playing in the same room.  She'd get blinded, I'd cast Assiduous Vision on her and she could just look at MY screen.</div></div><hr />
