<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I recently upgraded my computer from Windows 2000 to Win XP Pro.  And everything works fine, EXCEPT - my chat channels do not work.<br />
<br />
I /join a channel, sometimes I see a few seconds' worth of traffic, but I can never /list the channel and I can never post anything.  After 5-60 seconds I get a message &quot;your connection with the chat channel server has been broken.  Try zoning to reestablish the connection.&quot;  Zoning doesn't work, though.<br />
<br />
Other factoids:<br />
1. Win XP Pro, 1 gig mem, 3.2 Mhz P4, plenty of HD space, recently defragged.  ATI 9600 Pro, Turtle Beach Santa Cruz, latest drivers on both.  All Windows Update patches applied, including DX9.0b.  XP Pro was installed to a clean, formatted C: drive; my EQ data was on the D: drive.<br />
<br />
2. Using Linksys BEFSR41 4-port Cable/DSL router with a cable modem.  No firewall, just NAT.  I have set port forwarding up for ports 1023-65535 as recommended by SOE on their website.<br />
<br />
2. My Win2k configuration worked fine.  My wife's XP Pro machine works fine.  My Win2k laptop works fine.  It's just MY XP Pro machine that doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I'm about to wipe EQ and reinstall from scratch, but if anyone has any other suggestions for something quick and easy to try, I'm all ears.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you have a dialup account you can test with? I have a friend that has a similar problem on cable modem, but it'll work with dialup. He's also using windows xp, not sure about router or computer stats. Note: this is from his college.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, I don't have a dialup account.  But remember chat channels are working fine on other computers on my home network, so I would find it hard to believe that it's the network connection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's probably not very likely, but maybe you could try turning off port forwarding on your router.  Assuming you have it going to your main machine, that's one thing that's different between it and the rest.  I have a linksys router, and EQ works fine behind it with no forwarding set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ahhh, I misspoke.  It's not port FORWARDING I have set up, it's port TRIGGERING.  It's the setup recommended by SOE, and I did need to set that up a year or so ago because I'd go LD every 15 minutes otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Still happening.  I have completely wiped EQ, including a registry wipe, and reinstalled clean, no joy.  There are a few others on the tech support forums at eqlive reporting the same kind of behavior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Still happening.

Big ditto from my two accounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think its something that started along with other strange errors and linkdeaths since the last small patch 2 weeks or so ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Starting to wonder if this isn't an account-based bug.  Friend of mine who uses only dialup always has this problem, but I see it very rarely - whether I'm on cablemodem or dialup - same account, two different PC's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's not account-based.  My account works fine on another computer.<br />
<br />
It's probably not related to my cable modem or LAN, since those are the same since my upgrade and other computers on the LAN work fine.<br />
<br />
My guess is it's something about my XP Pro networking config or software I am running - but I ain't running much.  I do plan to disable Norton Antivirus (not just the task bar icon, but kill the service) and try that.  If that doesn't work, I am going to break out the packet sniffer and see what I can find.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks to Pressto-Rathe on the EQ tech support forums.  He said that the Linksys firmware version 1.44.2 is the ONLY version known to work well with EQ, firmware versions higher than that drop chat channels.  I downgraded my firmware from 1.45 to 1.44.2z (available on http://www.linksys.com) and the problem went away.</div></div><hr />
