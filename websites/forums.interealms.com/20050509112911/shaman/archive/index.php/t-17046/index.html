<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've got a level 65 frog shammy with about 38 aa or so.  I'm trying to figure out where some good places to solo for xp would be.  Unfortunately every time I solo it seems like the mobs just take FOREVER to kill.  Especially the PoP ones.  I've got most of my spells as my magelo shows.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  Do I need to upgrade my gear more?<br />
<br />
I suppose part of my problem is I get a bit jealous of the folks who say they can get an aa in a group in the elemental planes in less than an hour while it takes me a few hours in a group typically to get one aa.  My playtime lately has been limited to 2 hours or less most days.  Then there's those nasty bards who can AE kite and get an aa solo in 20 minutes :P<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm not in a guild so I don't have access to anything higher than the plane of tactics.<br />

It's fairly safe, especially if you get Virtue or the like, and keep SoW up by zoning out when it wears to refresh it between fights.<br />
<br />
I did ok there and even pulled the stuff for a Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement.<br />
<br />
However, the Golems out in the PoValor wastelands are just as good XP (they're 62) drop stuff for the VroG, and are much safer as long as you watch for spiders, so I'd suggest there instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The only time I've zoned into Tactics I saw the mobs conned red and quickly zoned back out.  I'm assuming I can invis past the red mobs or something?<br />

What is a VroG?  How long should I expect it to take me to kill a mob?  With my bard I could do it in 4-5 minutes but that was with about 60aa.</div></div><hr />

Well, the stormriders summon (IIRC) and the golems do not so maybe a mixture of both?</div></div><hr />

From the magelo you offered in your origional post, yes.<br />
<br />
Not sure how you're going to mix and match mobs in different zones, but if you're talking about alternating on different nights, why not.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the Stormrider info, I'll look into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Try PoV inner.  Grab a Virtue first and you should be fine there.  Bunch of single pullable mobs, zero trains, and I think it's the best xp a non-elemental flagged shaman can solo for.<br />
<br />
You can invis to there, theres only (usually) 1 see-invis mob, the razorfiend on the right at the end of the second tunnel.  He can be dealt with either by dragging him with you to the right wall safe spot, or by running invis past him really fast.  In any event he and most of the other razorfiends in inner can be singled fine.<br />
<br />
Plus you sound badass when people ask where you solo and you say 'PoV inner'.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
LMAO.<br />
<br />
That sounds like fun too :)  I know I can do it because our tank went afk when I was with friends the other day in PoV Inner so I pulled one of the fiends to see if I could solo him.  I had 4 dots loaded at the time.  Took a ton of mana but I did it :)  Would be interesting to see if I could keep it up mob after mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Leave PoP. Believe it or not there are lots of places with blue mobs and easy exp. Try exploring old deserted kunark and Luclin dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like where?  Everywhere I&quot;ve tried so far the xp hasn't been nearly as good as PoP xp.  That's not to say I've been in every zone tho....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Droga is great, haven't tried any of the other new old world zones yet though. My experience is not that of the solo Shaman though, I duo-box a 65sk. Speaking of which if you can I'd recommend duo'ing any day over soloing. Especially with the solo-exp nerfage (no solo bonus vs. grouping bonus).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tactics solo Guide,<br />
note this assumes you have run3, disroot, kei and BoU/BoS, epic is handy in here as well.<br />
<br />
buff up, invis and head up the stairs, go straight at first intersection, turn left when  you arrive at the &quot;pit&quot; (pit is impossible to miss, its a giagantic gaping hole) head into the room thats now infront of you, this is your pull spot unless there are kiters in here,<br />
<br />
fresh replenishment is a good plan, as is lev if you are worried, there is a click out in the bottom ne corner of pit, with lev you can run there and get out easily.<br />
spells<br />
canni<br />
gate (I play pvp server, gate is always up)<br />
decay<br />
malos<br />
BoU<br />
Bos<br />
root<br />
fast heal<br />
there is a spawn just outside each door, move to max spell range and pull with decay, follow imediatly with disease root, then BoU, charge to close range and malos, epic, Bos.<br />
back out canni up and load a spell set with BoN and Pox in place of malos/decay. reapply BoS and check timer on VP, root at about 15secs or less on Vp timer, cast pox, if root doesnt break cast BoN and then reapply VP. rinse and repeat. <br />
guardians are cake but are also .5blue aa each, warriors and Death Knights are 2blue aa each. the death knights are the only ones who ever give me trouble, RC will cure blood of hate, they tap and some times it breaks root, they are the only ones who will resist VP after decay, I use Dogs of Zerg to get rid of HT, <br />
the wall is your friend, just run around that sucker to gain ground and root as you need to, if there are kite groups Do NOT root inside the room, use the hall outside and just stay near the wall and you are safe from wanderers. rooted Diaku will happily gank anyone who comes close. takes 8-10 min per mob and if you grab pot9 you can finish most fights at 70% mana. <br />
<br />
note I have ft2, standing hp regen of 42, mana pres4 and AE4. no can5 and I just grabbed mc2.<br />
<br />
I also have little time to spare, I make up the pois/dis awareness pots and use those as well. log in, gank a few fatties and camp. its solid, safe (haha) exp. if you dont mind mobs that can kill you in seconds, not useing a pet, and fighting w/o snare or sow you can yank some damn nice exp in here in your short play times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Are we talking root rot here or solo in teh face? (for BoT mobs and PoV golems).<br />
<br />
Root rot, they hit in the 500's but don't summon and it's just not worth the mana to tank 'em.<br />
<br />
Pull with Malo/s, run like hell, root and apply Turgur's, Malosinia (to keep root from breaking), and load it up with DOTs.  I pretty much stick to Blood of Saryrn and Breath of Ultor these days but at 63 I was doing this with Bane of Nife and Pox of Bertoxx, healing up with Torpor afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've actually started pulling in Tactics when I go there with Malosinia.  It's just not resisted all that much, and on the offchance it is, the clicky-62 root usually lands with its -30 check in plenty of time to get Malosinia on after that anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GMan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So I've been soloing in PoV in inner whenever I get the chance since I read this.  It's taking me about 6 minutes per mob.  Occasionally slow will wear off but that's usually only when I get a lot of root breaks and/or I'm talking a lot.<br />
<br />
Does that sound about right?  At this rate it works out to 1% aa per minute for an aa every 2 hours.<br />
<br />
I'm using BoU and BoS along with epic for damage.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">CoD can be lots of fun if you catch it when it isn't crowded.  The exp is about as good as Tactics solo, but the fighting is much tighter and pulls can be tricky.</div></div><hr />

I haven't ever fought in inner (permacamped) but this sounds pretty comparable to the Crystalline Golems near the lever area.  At 63 I was having Turgur's wear off on about half the mobs, often while the mob was fleeing.  At 65 with Blood and Breath it basically never happens as long as I keep the dots up continually.<br />
<br />
And yes, about 1% per minute is about right.  I was getting 6-7% AA a few levels ago, it's down to 5-6% now but I kill faster, so it all evens out.<br />
<br />
It makes me very happy to find a nice quiet solo spot that I KNOW will be good for the rest of my EQ career, hehe.  After a raid when I've died 4-5 times, I can pop over to PoV, set my XP to non-AA, and kill 2 mobs in 10 minutes to more than make up for all the XP I lost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">stormriders is very good place for tanking solo, mind a bit hard without buff; PoN maze is easier and can done with self buff; PoV take too much downtime for find mob/train by add; tactic pit is good with higher risk and have to zone out from time to time; PoFire is best if you have flag<br />
<br />
btw, stormrider don't summon, caster stormrider do about 30-40dps, melee do 50-60dps to me in my old parse</div></div><hr />
