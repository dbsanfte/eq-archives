<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I would have put this in the Off Topic forum, but I doubt anybody reads that;<br />
<br />
Can anyone recommend a free program similiar to Dreamweaver? <br />
<br />
I know some basic html, but not enough to do anything worth looking at. I've used FrontPage and a trial version of Dreamweaver MX, and really liked the latter. I've checked download.com, but didnt really find much there to my liking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use Dreamweaver myself, great program. I don't know of any good free ones. They even charge money for Frontpage somehow, and people buy it! I don't know how much Dreamweaver costs. I use a copy my boss had.<br />
<br />
I think many programs like Edit Plus have free trials which last a few weeks or so. Search Google for &quot;html editors&quot; and look around for trial version downloads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know its not what you want, but my advice would be to use textpad, vim or notepad and develop your html / javascript / php skills</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use Notepad, or Visual Slick Editor. As Koraden said it, better learn and use HTML skills than have a WYSIWYG editor or anything similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have to agree... Notepad/plain text editor &gt; all<br />
HTML is easy to learn, and there are free tutorials for just about anything you need to do.  The best way to learn is just experiment around with it while looking at pages that do what you want to do.  (Hint: You can click View, Source to see the HTML code for the page you're viewing.  STEALING CODE IS BAD!  LOOK AND REWRITE IT YOURSELF!  It's more rewarding that way)<br />
Good luck on your webpage!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Textpad is good... you never really &lt;i&gt;have&lt;/i&gt; to register it and like the others said it will allow you to develop your coding skills and with it you develop the cleanest code.  I use Textpad or an old version of Homesite when it was free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use Dreamweaver, but I still type all the code in myself. I learned HTML with *shudder* notepad. Anything with syntax colored code is an enormous help. <br />
<br />
I hate the way Dreamweaver adds code if you try to short cut it. It adds all sorts of FONT, P, &amp; nbsp; tags all over. It's insane. I took over my current job from someone who didn't know HTML, but used Dreamweaver. All the pages were full of unnecessary tags with no text in them. A FONT tag with nothing between the start and close tags, thousands of them. Was a nightmare cleaning that up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">notepad and DW together</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I highly doubt that it was Dreamweaver adding in all the extra Font tags as I've used it for almost 2 years now and it has been flawless for me.  I learned on Notepad myself, but it took too long and spelling mistakes will kill you.  Dreamweaver is the cleanest coding WYSIWYG editor out there that I've used.  I always go back over the code after I layout a site, and rarely if ever has Dreamweaver added in extraneous stuff on it's own.<br />
<br />
BTW, costs around $300 or so and well worth it if you plan on doing websites for yourself, friends, or for a living.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Inqubus, I'm talking about someone that doesn't know any HTML at all using Dreamweaver. Trust me, it puts in all sorts of wierd unnecessary code if someone who doesn't know what they're doing it uses it. For example, there was a lot of code like this:<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp; nbsp;<br />
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp; nbsp;<br />
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp; nbsp;<br />
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp; nbsp;<br />
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp; nbsp;<br />
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; &amp; nbsp;<br />
<br />
Dreamweaver throws that in for line breaks instead of &amp;lt;br&amp;gt; all the time. I don't know how this person achieved all the empty &amp;lt;FONT&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/FONT&amp;gt; tags, but they were all over the place. Lots of empty &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; tags, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks for the input, guys. I really like the trial version of Dreamweaver I've been using, so I guess I'll have to think about investing in the software.<br />
<br />
Maybe that guy was just doing a lot of editting, Jing, and not removing the tags fully? My page codes probably look pretty crappy too..heh. Although, there is a handy clean-up function to remove empty tag codes, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">oh yeah, I do remember those guys now. I always changed em to &lt; br &gt; tags afterwards, had forgotten about those hehe. My bad :D</div></div><hr />

I use it for HTML, SQL, datafiles, practically everthing.</div></div><hr />
