<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K, don't have all the technical info on this, but I know what is showing up in.  The problem we've been seeing is people having troubles opening up MS Word, gives an error message of, &quot;Insufficient System Resources, unable to load this application&quot;.  This only happens with MS Word, everything else works fine.  The new spin off Nimbda and at least 100 other Word targetted viruses infect the normal.dot file ( this is the template file that Word is opening when you see it's title screen ).  By infecting the normal.dot file it makes it too big and keeps Word from opening.  Delete the normal.dot file and restart Windows and reopen a blank Word doc and it should be fixed, if not uninstall/reinstall Word.  When I find out more about this new spin off I'll post it, its spreading fast again just like the original version ( I had 65 calls on it over the past week and a half ).  Just FYI, be cautious with e-mail and keep virus scanners up to date.</div></div><hr />

The virus is basically the same as previous variants with different names on the exe and dll's so that existing virus update will miss it...officially discovered yesterday 10/29 so update that antivirus software cats and kittens...no telling how much more of the code has been re-written just yet...No known payload, but one day someone will get the code to format the harddrive sequenced right and a lot of folks will lose a lot of info...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And just in case you were nervous about deleting normal.dot -- that is a template file that word will actually recreate as soon as you open the program.<br />
<br />
It's safe to delete.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mydain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just a heads up for a rare case.<br />
<br />
Normal.dot can also store information placed there by programs you may need to use(possibly at work)<br />
<br />
One example of this is GoldMine and it's document merge function with Word.<br />
<br />
When you install this goldmine link it modifies your normal.dot to create the linked fields for your merge forms.<br />
<br />
So... if you have any programs that do this sort of thing, make sure to re-install that function from the program after deleting the template.<br />
<br />
In Goldmine it is as easy as opening a word document and clicking a button to re-install it.<br />
