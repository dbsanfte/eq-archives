<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fathum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello! Does anyone know of any good spots for a 59 shaman to either duo with a 59 monk in Kael for good exp?  I have an alterior motive for this as well. I recently got the leggings from kael for the thurg armor quest so I need some more faction for the dwarves.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Reason being, they dont give coldain hits for the most part, but they do give nice CoV hits.  So that will pretty much limit you to giants that are mostly Lt Blue I think, but not sure.  You could try the bank area possibly.  I believe they give coldain hits, but you will probably need the monk for singles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">XP is always a bonus and Kael is the best faction for the coldain that I can think of, but you can also kill giants and wolves in GD for coldain faction and kill rather quickly. You can also do the first two prayer shawl steps, frost giant heads and toes turn ins to get some faction boosts rather quickly.</div></div><hr />
