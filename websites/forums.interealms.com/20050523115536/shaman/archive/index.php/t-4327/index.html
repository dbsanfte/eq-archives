<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone confirm/deny this affects:<br />
DoTs<br />
Snare<br />
Root<br />
Charm<br />
Mez<br />
Fear<br />
Mez<br />
Stat debuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">DOTS, SLOW, MALO, ROOT - confirm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">According to Allakhazam's (which in turn I believe is getting its data from EQCaster), it applies only to HP-affecting debuffs that last at least 36 seconds. So while there might be some weird Necromancer spell or something that this also affects, I think it's pretty much restricted to spells with DoT components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Allakhazam's sucks, they regularly have false info that never gets fixed.   EA DOES work on Slows, Malx, and Root spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If we can infer by the casting time being shortened by affliction haste, then I can confirm root, charm, mez, slow and fear are affected by it on my enchanter (faster casting times), didnt look to see about the dots but I would guess the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Intended effect vs actual effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's supposed to work only on DoTs.  It originally worked for a lot more spells than just that, then was changed to affect only DoTs.<br />
Then in one of the myriad patches it was 'broke' again so it works with more spells.<br />
<br />
So what's correct today might not be after the next patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's supposed to work only on DoTs<br />
<br />
Says who?  I don't remember Verant ever publishing any list of what the effects are supposed to do.  If they did please link me to it.<br />
<br />
As it is now, and has been for a good bit, it effects almost any non-direct damage harmful spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It was posted in a patch message that Affliction was only ment to effect damage over time spells, will try to dig it up for ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If it was in a patch post, I believe you.  Just wanted to verify this isn't the common case of someone taking the word of a 3rd party site like Allakhazam's or Caster's Realm.  I still see druids insisting Winged Courier is in game because Caster's Realm says it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Says who?<br />
Says me.  That should be good enough for you, but if it's not, you can also hear it from the devs:<br />
<br />
<br />
From the June 6th Patch:<br />
<br />
** Focus Items **<br />
<br />
- Spell casting time foci should report their new casting time properly.<br />
<br />
- Spell duration foci designed to affect DoTs (the Affliction line) should now work reliably.<br />
<br />
- Spell duration foci affecting beneficial spells are no longer random. They now always extend the affected buffs for their maximum. (We never wanted to make it harder to time your buffs.)<br />
<br />
- The Affliction focus line should now only be affecting spells that do damage.<br />
<br />
- Bards should no longer get focus item messages that weren't actually affecting them.<br />
<br />
- We've re-assigned quite a few of the focus items to have their originally intended effect. <br />
<br />
All of the same items have focus effects. However, as many people noticed, quite a few effects were mis-assigned due to a tools error. (Common, mid level items were frequently being assigned high level effects, and vice versa.) <br />
<br />
This situation has been fixed, and the items now have the effects that we originally planned for them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please don't let your jihad against Allakhazam's spill over onto me.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hope they leave it as it is now instead of just working with DOTs, I am really enjoying my belt of magnificence. If they change it to only DOTs, affliction haste is back to being a bleh effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree. Debuffs afflict the target, and they should continue too.<br />
Otherwise why should debuffs be specifically left out from any focus effects? There's specific effects for damage, healing,buffs, why not debuffs.<br />
<br />
If they change it back to just DoT's then it's pretty worthless line of effects. And all our debuffs would be back to relying on only Haste 3 for any benefits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's a known bug. Going to be nerfed back 2nd time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Confirm : Dot, SLow, malo's line, cripple, root<br />
also confirm : SK's difference type of debuff spell<br />
<br />
basical, Affliction focus will work on any spells you can cast on mob that last longer than 36 second</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The info on Lucy, the best spell parsing site atm:<br />
<br />
Affliction Efficiency III<br />
<br />
1:  Decrease Spell Mana Cost by 25% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(60) <br />
3:  Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
4:  Limit: Min Duration(36.0 sec) <br />
5:  Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) <br />
<br />
Extended Affliction III<br />
<br />
1:  Increase Spell Duration by 20% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(60) <br />
3:  Limit: Spell Type(Detrimental only) <br />
4:  Limit: Min Duration(36.0 sec) <br />
5:  Limit: Effect(Hitpoints allowed) <br />
<br />
<br />
So it seems only DoT's should be affected but as Viscerator said the only spell line that wouldn't be affected by any focus would be debuffs, and that's silly, even for VI (one has to hope). In fact, all spells you cast on a mob which last 36 sec at least are affected by Affliction foci, even root and the likes.<br />
<br />
I have an Extended Affliction III and Affliction Efficiency focus item, increasing Bane of Nife from 150 dd, 214 dot over 7 ticks for 425 mana to 150dd, 214 dot over 9 ticks (parsed a few times) for about 320 mana, increasing the efficiency of Bane of Nife from roughly 3.88 damage/mana to about 6.49 damage/mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">unfortunately, i can see this being switched back only because it effects mez.  The change this makes to exp grinding is rather dramatic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">what items have this effect?<br />

Only one I know of is the Coldain Wristguard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mullzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've searched but haven't been able to find the answer to this:<br />
<br />
Does Extended Affliction III work with the Epic Dot?  I'm back from a couple month break and can't find this info anywhere.  Everyone just mentions Poxx and Nife so I get the feeling it doesn't... but please confirm.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">okay, as far as I know - none of the &quot;Affliction&quot; focus effects work on our epic.<br />
<br />
From what I read, the majority of item clicks are not affected by focus items, including the JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">One of the main requirements for any focus item to effect a right click, is that the peson *MUST* be able to cast that spell, without having the click item.<br />
<br />
Extended enhancement items work on sow boots, or the circlet of shadows (for necros/SKs), but since nobody can cast &quot;curse of the spirits&quot;, no focus effect will work on it.<br />
<br />
Also, right click DD items (such as velious wizard robes, or the JBB) seem to not function with foci either.</div></div><hr />
