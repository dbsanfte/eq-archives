It seems they are...<br />
-fixing Talisman of Alacrity<br />
-lowering mana cost of Disinfecting Aura to 100<br />
-lowering cast time of Disinfecting Aura to 2.5 sec<br />
-removing shaman class from Pure Blood<br />
<br />
Now can we stop complaining?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am VERY happy with these changes!<br />

But I know there are still people out there who will complain because DA costs 100mana, &quot;it should be 20.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i'm still ticked that the &quot;new&quot; spells are level 64. whup dee do.</div></div><hr />

While it might be nice in theory to do that to our DoTs , that would HUGELY affect the aggro managment we have now. Sure i would like to add some serious DPS to my group , but the fact is its not our role , its not who a shaman is. I think we need to really sit bck and think about what a shaman is when we ask for things like this.<br />
<br />
http://www.crystalinks.com/shaman.jpg<br />
<br />
sha·man    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (shämn, sh-)<br />
n. <br />
A member of certain tribal societies who acts as a medium between the visible world and an invisible spirit world and who practices magic or sorcery for purposes of healing, divination, and control over natural events.<br />
<br />
Shaman have never been a huge offensive power in any game or any mythology/religion/history. They are medicine men , spirit talkers , healers. Obviously powerful in their own right , but in their own way , which is 100% true of us right now. I personaly think its important to remain true to what a shaman is , even if it means i dont get to pump out 180 dps in  20 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">180 dps in 20 seconds?  I don't get it. <br />
<br />
My personal beef with the shaman right now is we take up a group spot and dont speed up the killin, and the thing we do provide thats very usefull (slow) can also be provided nearly as well by a chanter.<br />
<br />
If I wasn't a shaman, I rarely would look for a shaman to fill a group spot.  I want someone who can bring more to a group than slow.  I would much rather have a chanter along who can mez, slow, haste, kei, and charm.  <br />
<br />
I hate exping, and since I'm required to do it, I would much rather get the most out of my time.  Making 3 AA's an hour beats the heck out of 3 hours for an AA.  <br />
<br />
As far as shaman taking a beating better than a chanter, This argument is lame.  On any mob that worth killing for exp,  If I get aggro for more than a few seconds, I'm going to die.  If a chanter gets aggro more than a few seconds, they are going to die.  My gear and superior defensive abilites might save me once in a blue moon, but 99% of the time, if the mob would have killed an enchanter, it would have killed me also.<br />
<br />
All the utilites that shaman bring to a group are great.  We can do a lot of different roles, and we can save a group from a disaster better than any other class.  None of this matters to me though,  I'd still rather die once or twice an hour, while cranking out 3 aa's, than spend 2 or 3 hours getting 1 aa, in a more versatile group with a shaman in it.<br />
<br />
Even in a group with a wicked SK taunting their butts off, where I can stack dots, and nuke like a banshee without drawing aggro, I still put out what seems like a miniscule amount of damage.  Not to mention I am runing my hands by canning so much.  <br />
<br />
I'm not calling for shamans to have dot upgrades, and nuke upgrades, and AA upgrades.  I am not asking for any of that.  As a matter of fact, I'm not asking for any changes at all, I like my shaman.<br />
<br />
I do feel that we have the rest of the game duped into thinking we provide something usefull though, and because of that, I don't seem to have any problems finding groups, and this keeps me happy for now.  <br />
<br />
I would however like a confirmation box on shrink.  Or give the raid leader the ability to auto swap group members between different groups.</div></div><hr />

Go do tactics and try to slow some Gindan Flayers and laugh at yourself as you begin to slam your head against your desk. Our role has changed we are not &quot;The Slower&quot; anymore. <br />
<br />
Dot aggro is broken and  dot damage sucks, vi has admitted it.  Aggro can be fixed ezily. Just have it the dots lower aggro every tick while simultaneously doing damage.<br />

BST has the same resists that we do , dont get caught up in false perseptions. They have the same resist checks and ive seen more then one die from spaming slows. They are just like us , sometimes get lucky and land a slow first shot , sometimes require a debuff to land anything.<br />
<br />
I think we are the slower still , we are not the only slower , but its very rare i see a group with someone slowing other then a enchanter or a shaman , on raids we are the go to guy without question.<br />
<br />
As far as DoT aggro  , again , i dont see a problem , ive learn to use it to my advantage adn frankly i would be crippled in my ability to CC as well as i do if the aggro was changed at this point.<br />
<br />
Thats just my perspective though , not saying its the only ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a 65 Shaman and a 65 Chanter, both over 3 years old and both played from level 1 with no PLing.<br />
<br />
Both chars are Tier 3 flagged for pop and XP in the normal zones you would expect, the Shammy can and does take a much bigger beating and live than the chanter in almost any given situation.<br />
<br />
Granted the chanter rune and AA eldritch do provide some help and the level 65 charm is an absolute blast allowing the chanter to do stuff solo that the Shaman couldnt even dream of, but to say that in any XP situation that if the chanter dies the shaman would have died as well is well frankly, horse****.<br />

Have a Nice Day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jyphant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As far as a shaman not adding nothing to a group or not speeding up kills is just bologna.  I am a 64 shaman and as long as i have a good warrior or tank holding aggro, which means any in my guild, I use ancient scourge of knife which is 2000 dmg in 42 sec.  I cast that after malo after slow and while that works I cast jbb at least get 1000 dmg out of that.  A group in tactics and we will kill just as fast if not faster as any exp group would kill and I gain zero aggro.  I think the problem with some shaman is they have no good tanks trying to keep aggro and it makes them think we get to much aggro.  I can slow aten ha ra right off the bat and then start to dot and jbb while I gain no aggro from ahr.  Shaman need to look at good tanks instead of us gaining aggro.  On a usual mob in vt I can do 30,000 dmg no problem with just ancient scourge of knife and jbb and gain no aggro. Maybe that dmg isnt comparable with other classes but I think its pretty good and I could get more then that if needed. Shaman class is not broken and Is the number one slower and always will be.

<br />
Its not 90 DPS you arnt keeping it on them for the duration of the mobs life. you recast it.  Dog dps varies. It is dependent on alot of stuff mob lvl, mob ac stuff like that. Pop encounters call for faster dps not low sustained. At the moment dropping  BoS and BON on a mob at the beginning of the fight along with slowing it and malo'ing it will get you aggro. That is wrong. Doing 89 dps (its not 90 its 89) should not give you aggro, dot aggro is messed up. <br />
<br />
If you reduce the time it takes for DoTs to work then they cease being DoTs (Damage over Time spells) and are just really mean Poison/Disease DDs. Something that SoE is not going to give us.<br />
<br />
Wow you mean stuff like Caustic mist, Biomelt, and maybe curse of the dead  are not Dots? ohh wait they are.. They are the new dots, not the old world ones.  Lets see what breath of ultor and blood of saryn are,, ohh they are the new dots? ohh wait they still suck. <br />
<br />
Ohh yeah and you realize  Blood of saryn is an extra 110 mana for an extra 285 damage? .. who would pay 110 mana for a 285 damage nuke? <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Jyphant<br />
And *** are you killing in tactics that you can malo slow cast scourge and jbb nuke ??  Try doin that to any mob with gindan or diaku in the name.  What do you call a good tank? I can pull aggro off a warrior with 2 EB weapons by just malo'ing and slowing it on some occasions?  <br />
<br />
Also Mitigation really distorts the #1 slower Title.<br />
 with no mitigation you got  the m= 70, with sd = 4.08 basically this is based on the population of slowings being n = 3 <br />
<br />
that puts shaman at  z = 1.22, chanters are z = 0 and beastlords at  z= -1.22<br />
<br />
now with mitigation (standard deviation stays the same)<br />
<br />
at 75  percent effectiveness:<br />
<br />
m = 52.5   now the z scores for each are now<br />
shaman: z = .92, enchanter: z = 0 and beastlord z = -.92<br />
<br />
(mitigation to 75 percent lowers the effectiveness of shaman slow by 30 points and raises the effectiveness of beastlord slow by 30 points.)<br />
<br />
at 50 percent effectiveness:<br />
<br />
m = 35,  the z scores for each are now<br />
shaman: z = .61, enchanter: z = 0, beastlord: z = -.61 <br />
<br />
(mitigation to 50 percent lowers the effectivness of shaman slow by 61 points and raises the effectsness of beastlord slow by 61 points.)<br />
<br />
at 25 percent effectiveness:<br />
<br />
m = 17.5   the z scores for each are now<br />
shaman: z = .30  enchanter: z = 0  beastlord: z = -.30<br />
<br />
(mitigation to 25 percent lowers the effectiveness of shaman slow by 92 points and increases the effectiveness of beastlord slow by 92 points.) <br />
<br />
Mitigation changes the gap between beastlord chanter and shaman slows which used to be 122 points apart to only 30 points apart. Mitigation greatly diminishes the power of our slow and raises the power of the beastlord slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ohh yeah and you realize Blood of saryn is an extra 110 mana for an extra 285 damage? .. who would pay 110 mana for a 285 damage nuke?We don't all have ancient scourge. Most shamans are going from Bane to Blood, which is a nice upgrade, doing 500ish more damage for 110 more mana.<br />
<br />
Then you go over a lot of stupid math which doesn't mean anything.  With high mitigation on a mob, a shaman becomes important due to the ability to slow it sooner. A chanter is gonna have to wait to tash (to avoid agro) then wait more to slow, and their slow takes longer to cast. We can Malo the mob while it's incoming and get almost NO agro, then slow it most of the time in another 3 seconds. In the case of a resist, the chanter is also more likely to die than we are :p Chanters don't scare me.<br />
<br />
Beastlords and bards? They can slow nicely as well, but most groups don't look for one to be a primary slower ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Last I saw Gindan don't normally venture into the pit, which is where I presume he was talking about.<br />

<br />
Now can we stop complaining?  :D<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm confused....i thought they changed DA so that it was now mainly DR counters and only a few PR counters, which then means we should have access to Pure Blood, or they should change DA back to pre-stupid-new-spell-patch. Could someone explain that to me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">They changed DA back to its pre-LoY form, and now they're changing its cast time and mana cost to be equal to that of Pure Blood.</div></div><hr />

           Do you really think we're a prime healer ? We should be a defensive class but with slow mitigation and our crappy heal upgrade ,we're not.<br />
<br />
hmm, how much DPS do you guys want? Just BoS and BoN add up to 90 DPS, plus time to canni back most of the mana before you have to recast (or add a number of bracers if you have can5).

<br />
        resist ,resist.....and aggro.Sure that work on some mob and we with some excellent tank.<br />
<br />
We can Malo the mob while it's incoming and get almost NO agro, then slow it most of the time in another 3 seconds. In the case of a resist, the chanter is also more likely to die than we are  Chanters don't scare me.<br />
 <br />
<br />
           Chanter have aa ,spell and focus reduction aggro.They don't aggro as much as us on slowing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You know, when I saw the topic of this thread I thought it was about more corrections of mispelled words on test...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This is kinda funny. If as a Shaman you wouldn't look for a Shm for a group spot, you're playing wrong. Our dots are fine, our DPS is fine. Any Shaman who can't out-tank a Chanter either went for +Wis and +Mana gear or has no idea how to play his class.<br />
<br />
We can do everything. Tank, slow, damage, pull, solo, buff.... you get the picture. There is one thing we can't do very well, and that's heal. As long as someone doesn't get beat down too quickly though, you can still heal. Quiescence with QB3 and SCRM is a 3 second cast 1800-point heal for 200 mana. If the Shm is pulling (and I usually do) the mob will either arrived slowed or be slowed very soon after arriving, meaning whoever the tank is won't drop too quickly for a Quiesence to do the healing job.<br />
<br />
At the moment, I do a lot of duoing/trioing in Tactics with a Necro and Cleric. The pet the Necro has is pumping out over 500 DPS, and usually a Q after Turgur's lands is all I need to do to keep the pet breaking even HP-wise at the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
I did 21,706 damage against Tallon last night, how is it we're lacking in damage? You guys know what a DD is right? Why would you use a Blood/Bane in an exp group unless the group takes forever to kill each mob? If the mobs are dying too quickly for a dot to run full duration, don't use them... it's not the fault of the spell for taking too long.<br />
<br />
You folks need to stop complaining, we can already do way too much too well.</div></div><hr />
