Your subject line sucks by the way. :( Be more descriptive. I feel like a sucker for even clicking on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nobody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok...can we solo all our life?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After using the JBB to fly through the last 8 levels, I don't think I could ever play an ikky shaman.  It would just be too painful to solo without it.  Iksars have to *gasp* use mana to kill things /boggle :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You'll be relatively weak until ya hit 34.  You'll be able to solo up to that point of course, just not as well.  I believe we become the best solo'ers in the game (just my opinion) at level 51.  Turgurs just makes all the difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't mean to sound confrontational here, but why does everyone always say Turgurs is such an improvement?  From all of the descriptions I've seen, it's tougher to land, costs more mana, and provides a 5% improvement over Togors.  It casts quicker and lasts longer, but that doesn't seem like enough of an improvement to justify to hype.  <br />
<br />
Heck, I still have a hard time justifying Togors over Tagars, so it could just be me.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fight a mob hitting in the hundreds and that 5% soon comes into its own.<br />
<br />
The reason people say Turgurs is tough to land isnt because of the spell - it is the mobs they are casting it on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In my opinion, the biggest plus with Turgur's is the duration. I used to have a lot of problems with slow running out, and needing to be reapplied, but with Turgur's this only happens if 4+ MOBs have been pulled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">ACK!!  No more Leezards lookin sad because they were not born with a jaundiced bone!!!  It has absolutely NOTHING to do with shoe size, soloing, or the end-game!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">turgurs owns because of the duration.  fights get longer the higher level you get, esp during high end enounters like dragons and such.</div></div><hr />
