I know Halls of Honor spectral drop rates have been greatly reduced, but I was curious how they are nowadays.  Had a few questions for the soloing Glade Rangers out there..<br />
<br />
--What mobs are flagged immune to snare/root?  So far I have only been able to clear the Guardians of Mar at the front, and am not daring enough to venture deep into HoH alone, and try to snare a Human or Wrulan mob and pray I live.<br />
<br />
--What mobs summon in this zone?<br />
<br />
--What mobs cast in this zone?  Read something about Rabid Wrulans have a mana sink AE, but I was curious if it just takes mana, or is it like Thunderblast from HoT (takes all mana, and then starts taking HPs)<br />
<br />
--What mobs have spectral parchments on their loot tables?  Again read that Valorian Guards can drop (human mobs), but can Guardians of Mar drop them also?<br />
<br />
--Any mobs flagged immune to harmony?  So far every mob I have tested has worked perfectly.<br />
<br />
--Any mobs see invis?  So far NO mobs at all have saw thru invis, and I have ran all around this zone.<br />
<br />
--Any better spot to pull mobs other than the zone in?  Taking a look camoed, I have seen some open areas inside, but the roaming guards (and changing of the guards bell ringing has me a little nervous).<br />
<br />
Quite aware some Rangers might say that I should find out for myself, so sorry for asking to them.  But I do not have any cleric/rez backup as I explore this zone, and any help would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xaem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Valorian Sentries only mobs immune to snare/root, can solo them and other Valorians pretty efficiently, only things immune to harmony are those in the SW crypt, the Rabid Wrulans and stuff, cant really solo them, they summon and everything.  Just do some experimentation, not like it will kill you (no pun intended).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taluvan Winterscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some of the Armor dudes summon too so watch out. Generally just solo the Guardians/Guards (human type). Sentry are immune to snare/root but can be done if you can run alot and shoot while running... :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Negil Wintersfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From zone in, invis up, follow the path right till you reach the first &quot;T&quot; intersection, turn right.  Follow the path till it ends and turn left.  Enter that building, you will see a collection of armors inside.<br />
<br />
Black armors are non-aggro mobs, immune to snare and do NOT summon.<br />
<br />
White armors CAN SOMETIMES see invis and are aggro.  They are snareable and DO summon.<br />
<br />
In the back of the first floor, you will find stairs down, the first room you come to has six armor spawns.  Pass through that and the next room has 6 human spawns.<br />
<br />
Valorian Guards and Guardians do NOT summon ARE snareable.<br />
<br />
Valorian Sentries are NOT snareable.<br />
<br />
Use harmony to split them, kite them along the wall in the long open area.  About 9mins per kill with no KEI, 7mins or so with KEI.  6% aa exp per kill solo.  Use greater wolf form and swiftwind (if no primal bow) and go to town!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poorboy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just after you turn right at the first intersection, on the left there is a small courtyard with 3 dudes sitting and 2 named standing.  I harmonied the 3 sitting just fine, when I harmonied the named on the left he resisted and brought his other named buddy with him...only the 3rd time my harmony has ever been resisted.  <br />
<br />
Rabid Wrulan has an AE mana drain and is tough as hell.  A Recuso Degenerate has an AE that ate about half my attack rating and 400 AC or so.  The attack debuff is a huge pain, it makes you hit like a little schoolgirl...of course I found this out after firing off TS =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">on a side note, Innate Camo is priceless in here.<br />
<br />
Fight going awry, hit it and dash to the zone without getting slaughtered.<br />
Wanna explore, hit it and move, not mucho sees invis. If something sees invis, run away, hit innate again and youre clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Muvandog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I thought I recalled some of the armors being immune to snare/root also, maybe Protectors of Marr, whatever the ones are in the first room at the base of the ramp in the NW trial area.  They also mitigate slow.  I would guess spectrals have a chance to drop off anything in the zone.  Valorian Guardians are your best bet for safest XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>fountheranger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">once i get to the first set of long stairs down , right when i get to the bottom one of the guards see's me and agro's.  I cant see him tho since he is behind the wall guarding the door i will be coming out of.  Ive tryed just using sow vs wolf form, but both times with camo up he see's me.. i got lucky and ran far enough away to camo up and run to zone hehe.  Cant wait til innate camo...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ruvane Hammerfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Be careful especially of the Undead, the Recuso's and the Rabid Wrulon's.  All of them are nasty beasts with nasty spells.  They are mostly yellow cons anyway.<br />
<br />
Put in about 10 hours total there the last few days in a rather low key xp group.  I think we ended up with about 4 Ethereals and 1 Spectral.  The drops were all from the Valorian Guards.  As a side note I was amazed at what some of the drops sell to vendors for, ranging around 100plat per drop.  These items don't drop everytime, but enough to keep you in lunch money for the week.<br />
<br />
Innate Camo and Harmony are made for this zone.  There are a few spots in this zone that with Innate Camo and Harmony are complete no brainer's to pull...look around, pretty easy to find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>minvardar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Spectral drops can vary widely in HOH.  3 days ago 4 dropped within 90 minutes.  2 days ago 1 dropped in 2 hours.  Just the luck of the draw really.<br />
<br />
And btw I am curious what in hoh drops the windblade?  Is it just off common mobs?  And if so what is the drop rate now?<br />
<br />
Minvardar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Poorboy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Had a Windblade drop off one of the guards (Valorian Guard I think) in the NE temple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cujoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok there are 2 crypts in here that are my personal playgrounds, The NE crypt is the easiest nothing see's invisi around it and in the room right before the trials guy you can harmony pull snare and root and play target practice all day long, only things Not Snareable are the Valorian Sentry and Valiant Spirits ( 2 colors some white some black ) at least these are the two I've ran across, also anything that cons lvl 65 or above just assume it summons.  <br />
About the Spec drops, when I got flagged about 2 months ago, a spec dropped almost every 3 hours, never once did I ever see a etherel drop. After the patch last week I noticed you're lucky to get a spec in 12 hours but every 4 hours a etheral seems to drop still ( I mean this for me not zone wide ) =)</div></div><hr />
