<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was hoping for Malo, but got Disintegrate and the cleric gauntlets. :( Where, oh where, can my Malo be?<br />
<br />
Edit: Oops, meant to put this in Spells forum, but HEY, I can post and reply to posts again. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, well..<br />
<br />
Vibrating Gauntlets of Infuse are quite rare, at least.  Or they used to be, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Killed Overking 5 times in last 4 weeks, twice last night.<br />
<br />
Dropped squat for shaman spells each time.. *bangs head on wall*<br />
<br />
Why the hell can't the kunark spells be as easily obtained as the SoV/SoL spells....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got crapatar from the overking.<br />
<br />
If you want Malo, drag your guild down to Jumpy and the Protector until they revolt.<br />
<br />
I happen to think the traks lair encounter is one of the best designed encounters in Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Qualm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rath, the best place to get it is Kunark dragons,  Gorenaire/Talendor/Severillous.  Ashorty raids them when we (or the Recon manaburn squad) don't beat him to it.<br />
<br />
Chardok and Sebilis have VERY low drops rates on Malo, approaching zero.   The last Jumpalot we killed had Mala, Mala, and a robe.  /RUDE Verant.<br />
<br />
p.s. do you have Torpor yet?  Bane, Torpor, and Pox *are* dropping from juggs and jumpy/protector.  Last juggs raid we got 3 Banes ... and 7 Mala.<br />
<br />
Qualm, Barbarian Shaman, E'ci</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Holy cats. You got Vibrating Gaunts?<br />
<br />
Those things used to be incredibly uber. Even now, I recently joked and did an auction wanting to sell them in ToV when three of my server's top four guilds were there. I got /tels for clerics in all three guilds begging me to sell 'em to them.<br />
<br />
They're not so good now in a world of GoDS, Keeper gloves and Onyx chain, but they're still damn nice. I was convinced they didn't drop anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>OrangespiderO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Drag everyone to VP for some cool spell drops there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, Qualm, I have Torpor. Malo is the only 60 spell I'm missing, except Primal Avatar which I'm not too concerned about. Still missing Pox though so may have to take a group down to juggs again.<br />
<br />
Yep, the gauntlets were very nice. I'm sure our cleric that is wearing them is happy. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We killed Overking last night and I'm happy to say he finally had my Malo.</div></div><hr />
