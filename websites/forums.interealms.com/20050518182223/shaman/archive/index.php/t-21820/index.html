<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">*sigh* blood of obkin = the nerfed :\ the sad thing is, where it was before is really where it should have been all along. I was excited about the spell, and now it's panning out to be a piece of crap. Behold:<br />
<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spellhistory.html?id=5414&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
Here's a link to the best wiz nuke: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5463&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
yeah I know it's an ancient, but for chrissakes, can we get at least some parity between nukes and DoTs? back when the game was young, we had two &quot;impressive&quot; damage spells. Ice Comet, and Envenomed Bolt. Ice comet did 1120 for 400 mana. Ebolt did a bit more, around  1150, but took a long time to work. For this drawback, it was more efficient.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to today, when not only are DoTs not more efficient than nukes, when you factor in crits, focii (availability), and the general short fights where a wizard can blow through all their mana before the mob dies, the tendency to get higher resist rates, and DoTs have absurd agro making them almost unusable without some method of agro reduction... <br />
<br />
Can someone please rekindle my faith that Damage over time spells can even be considered a viable and effective method of dealing damage? I don't want to outdamage or even come close to a wizard, but I'd like to be able to do warrior level DPS without getting my ass dead.<br />
<br />
Edit: For fairness, here's the nonancient equivalent: http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5462&amp;source=Test</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hybrids still outbuff us. Avatar is still a joke. Our new past-the-cap buffs will suffer from dimishing returns (what are the effects of stats past 305? 1/8th?) and will liekly not be worth the buff slot.<br />
<br />
Hybrids still outnuke us. DoTs are not going to be more useful. Again shaman will be the least damaging class in the game.<br />
<br />
Our healing is being upgraded to less then what we would have needed to be secondary healers in GoD. Or in other words: &quot;Shaman can't heal.&quot;<br />
<br />
That leaves debuffs - on 10 to 20 second encounters. For some odd reason I also doubt slow mitigation is going to be less widespread then before.<br />
<br />
That basically leaves me casting focus and desperately trying to do something useful but being worse at that then everyone else. But hey, I can be full mana after I die faster then everyone else!<br />
<br />
At this point I can not believe I ever thought we were being listened to. Not only are we going to have the exact same problems in Omens that we had in GoD (or even worse), they actually felt it would be necessary to dangle +damage buffs in front of our faces and then take them away.<br />
<br />
By the way - a 33 point regeneration is not a useful spell anymore. Up this to 100 if you want it to be a useful spell or drop it so it does not take up a slot in the drop list.</div></div><hr />

'But you could stack all your 5 best dots on a mob, all running same time, doing lots and lots of damage. You are balanced.'<br />
<br />
Sorry, but dots are 99% useless these days (except for the random solo act). Mana inefficient compared to nukes, crazy aggro (especially if you crit, but even without this insane on poison dots), stupid recast times (for the Bane line) and useless runtimes (even BoS doesnt run out in XP groups for me, even when not slowing and casting it right away, tanking the mob half of the times).<br />

Basically I ignore that I have dot spells in my spellbook .... sad days.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It still shocks me that our dot crit is so gimp.  It should have been a check at cast time so that the dot crits every tic not just a random tic here and there.  At least we could get close to the damage mana ratio that other classes are enjoying.  But we would still have to sit back and wonder why a 6k blast doesn't bother a mob but a dot tic enrages them?  It doesn't really matter though after you have malos  a mob and slowed them your only supposed to have 10 seconds left in the fight anyway. &lt;--- (See the summit update)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is ofcourse a silly argument, mainly because, when we put our 3rd dot on stack the mob is usually dead. However, for soloing/raid purposes stacking is an option. Even more so if mobs end up with more buff slots.<br />
<br />
I too think we should get something beefier -  i mean its ANCIENT after all. Those persistent enough to ever see one drop should be rewarded.</div></div><hr />

A chance to crit per tick or a chance to crit the whole DoT does exactly the same on average.<br />
<br />

Uuuh, how can you not stack nukes? Do you ever see wizards waiting for their nukes to wear off before casting their next nuke?</div></div><hr />

Heh wasnt being all to serious about nuke stacking ;)<br />
<br />
But i think our strength in dots come from using old ones in conjunction with new ones when we really want to fill someone with poison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Youre absolutely right.<br />
<br />
Stacking is mana consuming, aggro generating and slot consuming both on targets and spell-bar. If you want to stack dots as a shaman youre faced with several problems coming from the above issues.<br />
<br />
No-one would be happier than me with beeifer dots, but the in all likelyness thats not going to happen.<br />
<br />
Though, comparing raw damage with a wizard might be a good measuring tool, but we can never compete on even terms with a class designed nuking the living daylights out of their target.<br />
<br />
I would like to know how a necro compares to a wizard though, as necros are the preferred DPS dotters of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">DoT's stack.  So what.  Old, new, who cares.<br />
<br />
We can't do it, no one can pull aggro from us if we drop more than 2 DoT's on a mob.<br />
<br />
If the mob lived long enough that is.<br />
<br />
Which it doesn't.<br />
<br />
So we suck again.</div></div><hr />

I know a few paladins who never has problem taking back aggro from me if they put their heart into it. That would ofcourse involve them 'stacking' stuns ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
obviusoly they really only want it so that cleric , druis, wiz, war are the real classes, with enc/bards alittle behind the rest can go die a slow death it seems.<br />
<br />
oh and btw they know fine well about stacking dots problem , it is intentional, because they never meant us to be able to stack old version with new,this was a mistake that the easiest solution was to make stacking too many dots death. this gave us a good dps which they didnt want, or least the currect spell people dont in the short sightedness.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dreamx2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yes were considered a Priest class. If we were healers the heal ratio to clerics druids and shamans wouldnt be 100:67:46. 46 being the shaman. <br />
2) If we werent meant to do dmg we wouldnt of been given dots comparebale to that of a dmg dealing class a necro. So yes we do do dmg.<br />
3) I personally wasent looking forward to any new dots because all dots are junk as is for a high end raiding shaman If u can get 1 tick out of a dot in a raid i will applaud u, mobs die so incredibly fast.<br />
4) I dont play a shaman because of 2 aspects of my class Sony is slamming the shaman hard because they realize they made a mistake when turgurs came out. <br />
5) If you gonna take our main purpose away from us in a raid setting its only viable to replace it with something else with jsut as much value.<br />
6) Sony has accomplished 1 thign for the high end raiding shaman they made them out live there uses with a quickness all my versatilily was taken away and now as shameful as it is to say in a raid situation all i am is a medicore spot healer or a druid that heals for half the hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">this one time, in Kd, when there were a couple shaman on the raid, I cast decay on the statue, loaded up a FULL load of dots (5?) this was a ways back, I think it was plague/pox/BoS/Ebolt/epic<br />
<br />
<br />
yes I wound up tanking him from about my 3rd dot to land. while it was entertaining and nice to see the clerics could keep a 5k fully buffed shaman alive it was still stupid that I could out agro the entire raid with the shocking dps of my craptacularly stacked dots. <br />
<br />
dot stacking is for those who dont want to take the faction hit or who are all alone on the agro list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'll never forget the VT raid where I dropped 2 dots on an Aten blob, AFTER seeing multiple crit nukes for 6k, and I got summoned and squished.  <br />
<br />
First cast of Ancient:Scourge of Nife and I got aggro and died.  <br />
<br />
Now, aggro off dots isn't all bad, but the power of dots is pitiful to what the power of Ebolt once represented.  <br />
<br />
That's when shaman rocked, and it wasn't because of crapass stat buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Siroro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Our dps is Supposed to be from our STAT increasing buffs not damage spells. The problem with this is stats are pointless in the game at MOST levels. Most players click our buffs off and only have them for tradeskilling or for HP. I rarely have dogdog up because he sucks, trying to cast dots on every mob is just not possible with their long cast times and large mana use with very minimal noticability. (exception being in kiting group in fire)<br />
<br />
DPS is not our primary concern though, but crippling the enemys DPS is. Slow normally mitgated in most encounters i face, Cripple just is not worth my time anymore it has its use for helping a level one kill Dvinn and thats about it and enchanters get this so its not exactly unique i think beastlords do also (?).<br />
(Rtan tells himself: Cripple overpowered INC NERFS)<br />
We need more crippling effects! What these do I just aint sure but their are people paid to make these up @SOE GET TO WORK SLACKERS!!<br />
