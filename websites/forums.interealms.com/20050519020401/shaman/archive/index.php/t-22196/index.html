<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been labeled a quest whore by my friends and guildmates in game...and today thanks to the efforts of many friends and open raid attendees, I proved them right ( again ) :p<br />

Successfully completed the ring war in GD and I'm now the new proud owner of a Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV on the Karana server.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grats, that and the shawl are two of the best quests in the game story wise that can be solo'd for most of them.<br />

I've done the first 8 rings solo, and I think I'll try for number 9 once the level cap is upped to 70. How many people do you need now for the 10 ring?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">2 groups of level 65s would be sufficient, but to make sure I would use 3 so that less dorfs are killed and Narandi drops some decent loot :).</div></div><hr />

Thanks Haleice.  I solo'd almost all of the first 8, couple times had friends keep me company.  ;)<br />
<br />
For the war itself, I went for major overkill, ended up having around 50 - 60 people show, but considering how fast we killed the waves and the amount of down time we had between waves, I'd guess one could probably go as few as 4 - 5 groups if well skilled/equipped and reacted fast on roots/snares for the runners.<br />
<br />
Loved both the shawl and ring quests from Velious, lots of lore and story to go with them, just like the skyiron cudgel of the ancients but a little less painful on the faction work.</div></div><hr />
