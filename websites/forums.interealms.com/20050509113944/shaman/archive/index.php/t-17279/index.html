<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mandrake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think the old rules was a world without an economy.  Since then travel has become faster so people can farm 'exotic' tradeskill supplies, this is a great source of money, probably coupling with the money you can make from the tradeskills itself.  Also i would be willing to bet most of the people who play have been playing for a little while at least. And while the old rules seemed extremely fun, the new convienences has kept the game from mondane.  ITs faster pased now.<br />
<br />
As for the higher level cap.  It may be true that 50+ gets boring.  However, some people get really attached to characters and just want to keep going.  I think they have made it so 50+ don't get too unbalanced by increasing the level of monsters and areas.  As for pvp I havent played that so i am not sure how the higher levels effect that.<br />
<br />
However, this is just what i have gathered as honestly i just started playing.  I figured posting what i think about all this talk will be the best way to learn.<br />

peace and anarchy<br />
