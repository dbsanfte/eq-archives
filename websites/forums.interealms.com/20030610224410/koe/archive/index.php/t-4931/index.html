<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, finally, it's done (for now).  The first edition of CyberVic's EverQuest Survial Manual.  It's 337 pages and includes information on every class, every map, most skills, some quest armours.  It's all done in Adobe FrameMaker and is fully interactive.  I've broken each chapter into different PDF's, though I do have 1 giant copy of the book all 337 pages in 1 document with Table of Contents, but it's 14.7 MB and I don't want to host that on my DSL.  So until I can figure out a place to host it, I'm just hosting the indivual chapters seperately.  Keep in mind it also has bookmarks within each document to quick jump to what you are looking for.<br />
<br />
NOTE:  Though there are some luclin spell info, it's not fully updated, a lot of the info is pre-release luclin info.  Also in reguards to Necro's and Shadowknights, I will update both documents soon with better info.  Also I will be updating the Luclin document in the next couple of minutes, because I just found more luclin info on EQatlas.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

Just click on the title in his sig box, takes ya right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Updated Beastlord Doc, Luclin Map doc, Necromancer Doc, Shadowknight doc, also brand new High Level Advancement doc and a brand new Epic weapon doc (even though it's just a start, no info within).<br />
<br />
Please check it out.  My next goal is to finish doing a couple of luclin spell updates on all the other classes other than the 3 listed above.  After that, I plan on completing the epic weapon and quest armour docs.<br />
<br />
As a reminder, even if you don't have a fast connection, you can get the seperate chapters of the book in different files via my website.  The full 15MB book file is hosted online because of MY bandwidth/hosting limitations.<br />

As a reminder, you will find the link to the website on my signature.  If you like what you find,  PRETTY PLEASE, sign the guestbook!</div></div><hr />
