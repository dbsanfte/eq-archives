The funny part is that my other computer can access magelo with no problems.<br />

Sorry, I haven't had this particular problem before, but some things you can try:<br />
-Make sure you're going to www.magelo.com.  Just magelo.com doesn't appear to resolve correctly.<br />
-Make sure your security settings are not High (for IE, not sure what NN uses).  Magelo appears to use scripting pretty extensively, and if scripting is blocked, the site does not appear.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

Then I think you need to restart IE or reboot, can't remember which.  That usually takes care of it.</div></div><hr />
