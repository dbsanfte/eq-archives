<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I logged on this morning and downloaded the patches which didn't take long since I'm on a cable modem.  Anyways, I decided to play a new alt and was amazed at the changes.  In Gfay the trees and newbie mobs look a lot more realistic i.e. the decaying skels and wolves.  I also noticed an annoying thing went away.  Sometimes looking at a different view of something things would be a bit pixelated or tiled funny(square pieces missing from walls or small items).  Only thing I didn't like was the very noticeable lag when the portal would activate for SoL.  Anybody else notice this?</div></div><hr />
