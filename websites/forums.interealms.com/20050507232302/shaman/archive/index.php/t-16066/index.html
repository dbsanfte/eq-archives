<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Veranon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looted a Ring of Evasion (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=26994) the other day and decided to check out if it made any difference.<br />
I found a level 62 mob that I can keep up with Q on, and let it beat on me for a couple hours with and without the avoidance mod using the same AC (1600 in this case, and the mob was not killed in between, so it was the exactly same mob).<br />
<br />
With Avoidance:<br />
Hit %: 60.37%<br />
Dodge%: 3.48%<br />
<br />
Without Avoidance:<br />
Hit %: 61.67%<br />
Dodge%: 3.50%<br />
<br />
The sample was done with 12500 swings of without and with the ring, had all physical stats at 305, my ac was the same in both setups of gear, the only difference should have been the avoidance mod.<br />
<br />
The damage distribution was pretty much the same as you can see here (http://www.silentredemption.org/img/tmp/avoidance.gif) <br />
<br />
The curves twist around eachother a bit, but I'm sure they'd smooth out with 100000 samples or so.<br />
<br />
It's possible the the ATK of the mob and my AC wasn't tuned to make this work, but in this case there was no difference whatsoever.<br />
<br />
The thing that makes me doubt this test is valid is that the hits in the low range outweighs the one in the high ranks, roughly every 12th hit was the minimum hit, but I do think that the avoidance factor should still count in the hit/miss%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hard to test with lighting reflexes, it can be so streaky.  But the sample size ya did looked big enuff to compensate for that.  Alot of the mods are still flakey and sadly doubt they will be altered.<br />
I have not resisted a &quot;stunning blow&quot; yet either</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It would seem to me that the 1.3% difference in the hit frequency can't be disregarded as statistical fluff in a sample that large.</div></div><hr />
