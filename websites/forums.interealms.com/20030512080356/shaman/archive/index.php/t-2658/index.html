<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally dinged 40!!! Weapon proc!!!  Now, I want to upgrade my equipment.  Everyone has been so helpful and patient giving excellent advise.  Currently have AC around 700 and Wis of 195 and still wearing &lt;blush&gt; a Bloodstained Tunic.  I would like to quest/obtain equipment rather than buying.  Now looking for ideas.  I am now looking to upgrade ac and sacrifice some wisdom.  I was also thinking about the Twilight Mail quest with my friendly, ever present lvl 51 Mage leading the way.. any thought would be helpful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe a sebilite scale BP would be nice for you. Or an Iksar ceremonial Bp (just got one myself woot!). Depends on your funds. <br />
I don't know what's your current gear so its hard to get a good view.<br />
I might think of some more later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have the funds, an Iksar Ceremonial BP would rock! I would recommend it over a 'wis' bp. Regen is always useful. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Me SHM uses the Cere. IKS Chestplate. Wouldn't use anything else, unless he gets the Fungi Tunic or Fungi Vest ( from FG ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brelkeryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Progression so far has been:<br />
<br />
Banded Mail<br />
Foreman's Tunic (Totemic BP would have been nice if Grizzleknot was ever up.)<br />
Iksar Regen Breastplate<br />
Rune Crafter's Breastplate<br />
Wicked Mail<br />
<br />
I still carry around my Iksar Regen BP in a Rallic Pack for regen when soloing or shunted to a group without a Cleric, and the Rune Crafter's Breastplate for the clickable Riotous Health effect when stragglers miss Talisman of the Brute and still want a Stamina buff.  The Wicked Mail is my main Breastplate when grouped with a healer.<br />
<br />
Future upgrade path:<br />
<br />
Iksar Regen BP -&gt; Fungus Patch Vest or Fungi Tunic<br />
Wicked Mail -&gt; Chestplate of Vindication<br />
<br />
*EDIT* To address the confusion created below.  *GRIN*<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps you plan your progression.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
Iksar Regen BP if you have the cash.<br />
Use that while saving for JBB fund.  Once JBB is acquired, create your Fungi fund.  Devote a percentage of ALL your profits to that fund, and don't touch it until you will buy.<br />
<br />
If you hit 50 and still don't have a fungi, the FG fungus patch vest should also be high on your chest piece priority list.<br />
<br />
Cheap alternatives NOW if you can't afford the Iksar Regen...<br />
(You MUST dump the Bloodstained tunic into a wis gear tradeskill gear backpack, or sell it if you don't do alchemy or tradeskills.)<br />
<br />
Rygorr Battle Mail ~400pp<br />
Imbued Northman Mail (if you are a Tribunal Barb) ~180-300pp<br />
<br />
Hope that helps...<br />
Take care,<br />
<br />
PS:  Start dumping some of that wis gear friend for AC/HP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Iksar Regen BP &gt; Fungus Patch Vest or Fungi Tunic <br />
<br />
hum, why? IKS bp is +5 pnt Regen. Fungi Tunic and Vest are +15 pnt Regen, and they have more AC.<br />
<br />
Fungi &gt; IKS Regen bp, all the way.<br />
<br />
But, a Cere. IKS Chestplate will work, if you can't get a Fungi just yet.<br />
<br />
*Edit*<br />
Okay, I've looked at that again. I think I see what you mean. -&gt; vs &gt; ( greater than. :) ).<br />
<br />
Sorry, coming from the monk forums, we always use &gt; as greater than, not as an arrow for upgrad paths.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought the same thing when I read that post.<br />
<br />
Brel forget to add the - to his &gt; :)<br />
<br />
Iksar -&gt; Fungi (as in Iksar then fungi)<br />
<br />
<br />
Fungi &gt; Iksar (as in Fungi greater than Iksar)</div></div><hr />
