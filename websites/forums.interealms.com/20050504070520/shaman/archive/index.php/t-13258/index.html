<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mulsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know how firmiliar people here are with HoH, so I'll explain it.  A group of friends and I did the key quest for HoH so that we can xp there.  Right now, we are targeting two types of mobs there.  First is named a Regruso something or other.  They have a proc ae curse that reduces ac by 180 and attack by 500.  The second are Rabid Wrulons.  We can take the first mob, but not the second.  And they share spawn points, so that makes it tough.  Their proc is a bit nastier.  It overwrites any type of clarity, reduces mana pool by 500, and decreases mana by 300/tick.  Checks against cold at a -300 adjustment, so reisting it is kind of tough.  It adds a total of 18 curse counters, and goes off about every minute.<br />
<br />
For the group we have <br />
65 shaman (me)<br />
65 warrior<br />
65 monk<br />
65 cle<br />
62 pally<br />
65 druid<br />
<br />
Both the cleric and I have RC1.  The cleric and pally have remove curse, but no one has remove greater curse.  My question is, how do curse counters work.  If I cast RC1, that should take it down to 9 curse counters, so does that half its duration?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gotta take all curse counters off or else the curse will last for full duration.  Its all or nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably the loot they can drop ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We did a night in HoH killing those, 1 in 5 dropped a rune or ornate, tried it the next night and we got stuff all, drops were nerfed. We dont bother with it anymore.<br />
<br />
Wrulans, you need to keep casters out of AE its a short range, and use fast heals on MT. I dont think CH has the range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, we have only killed a few of the human ones, but one dropped a rune that defaulted to me, and I got malos :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Curse counters seem to work like disease/poison counters. The comment that it's all or nothing is not entirely correct. You can chain cast and remove the offending spell once the total has been met.<br />
<br />
Aka remove 9 counters, cast again remove another 9 counters, if that is more then the offending spell, it will be removed. So although having to cast more then one time is time consuming, it will cure whatever ails you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think what he meant by &quot;all or nothing&quot; was in answer to the first guy's question, whether removing half the counters would halve the duration of the curse.  Meaning the curse stays at full strength until you remove the last counter, not that you have to cure it totally in one go.</div></div><hr />
