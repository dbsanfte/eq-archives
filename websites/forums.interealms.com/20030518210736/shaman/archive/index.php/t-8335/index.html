I snagged one on Innoruuk for 28k.  Had been saving for a Fungi but with me mostly soloing outdoors on a horse I haven't been cannidancing much at all so I went for it.  Thought I got a deal but wasn't really sure.  I certainly could have gotten hosed.  Comments appreciated.<br />
<br />
PS.  Happy belated Thanksgiving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like a great buy to me.  <br />
<br />
Using the fungi depends on your level.  If you have torpor it's not that helpful, but obviously still helpful.  But fungi costs a ton on our server.  <br />
<br />
Seems to me you did fine.  Waiting for a chain bp in Kael or SS can take foooorreeeevvvveerrrrrr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like a really good deal.  I would have paid 40k for it if I really needed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You did really well.  +50hp, +6sta, +45mana, +26 points of resists, a nice chunk of AC, and enough Wis to give you flexibility with some other slots even.  That would have gone for much more on Xeg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll have to keep my eye out for this one.<br />
<br />
What's the graphic look like?<br />
<br />
I just upgraded to a tin shirt after dropping my barbed ringmail, but I could use the extra 22 hp and ac and resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The wood elf ranger that sold it to me put it on first and it looked kind of light blue/aqua on him.  Definitely unique.  On me (barbarian) it looks just like normal chain.  8(<br />
<br />
I have a twink half elf rogue, I might have to try it on him just to see what it looks like.  I will let you know if I get around to it.  Dunno why it is a standard graphic on us handsome barbarians.  I have no feline friends who could model it for me so I dunno what it would look like on you.  There is a chance it could be really smooth or really boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">very nice BP, better then thurgadin quest and about the level of a JBBP with effect applied. Great buy, I think this would easily go for 40 or my server.</div></div><hr />
