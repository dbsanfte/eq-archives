<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can do the taskmaster or get alot of fish scales in the grey hunting those snake things.  But you will need to get alot of fishscales to keep EB up while you hunt in the grey.  once you collect 3 shissar organs you can trade them in Katta for an EB neck item.  Probably will be faster than hunting the Taskmaster in echo caverns.</div></div><hr />

Um, read my question again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have the good clickies (JBB &amp; Epic) you should be able to solo snakes with your faithful dogdog, even if they're highly resistant or immune to poison and disease dots.  They're really not very tough.  They're VERY easy with a melee partner.<br />
<br />
Or you could farm some platinum and camp the bazaar. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe I was unlucky, but the TM would take forever I think. I hunted in that cave for an entire lvl and only saw one organ in that time. Granted, the level went pretty fast, but still.<br />
<br />
/Merry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Accounts here are correct that the Taskmaster in echo drops the organs very rarely, but they do drop.   Of course as an iksar I just let them all rot since I'm kos in katta.   I just bought a rebreather for about 1.5k in bazaar.  <br />
<br />
You can also hunt that guy in qeynos hills for a fishbone earring, but good luck.  Would probably be faster camping TM for organs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got two from hunting the Taskmaster for 2 levels. Then someone mq'd the third one for me. :) So Tasky gave me my eb item at level 49, so to speak. Perfect for doing my test of patience.<br />
<br />
If you have druid friends who like the grey, they often have extra organs to spare. All you need is one to mq it correctly, and I hear the snakes are perfect for quadding. Just get them to get 2, take your one, and pay a visit to Katta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
Well, a Lodizal Shield would work. ;)<br />
Fishbone earrings are usually for sale in the Bazaar, or you could camp one yourself.<br />
<br />
Siren's Grotto shell EB items are another choice.  The perma EB shell is less common than the charged varieties, but they do drop there.  One raid for a few hours netted my guild a half dozen of these.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can get a partner or group in the grey to hunt the shissar.  Unless you are KOS in Katta, its the easiest way to get an EB item aside from buying one in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All your cold nukes will work fine on the snakes in the grey and it's an awsome exp spot especially if you have JBB.  If you don't want to kill there you can always do what every FD enabled monk in the game did when goranga clubs were discovered.  The organs are NO-DROP and the only thing they're good for is the EB quest which most everyone that hunts there has already completed, so just bring some fish scales and loot any snakes you see lying on the ground.<br />
<br />
JUST KEEP INVIS UP!!!  I can not emphasize this enough if you are not familiar with the zone!  VI got pissed with people doing PBAOE groups here so they've got these annoying level 51 rockfiends that have like 15khp and a HUGE aggro range.  They also added xitro something or other (worms) that hide under the ground and when you get too close they jump out and attack you, they're also level 51 and spit rocks at you at an incredible rate, they're immune to root / snare.<br />
<br />
Who know's while you're getting the organs for the EB necklace you may get some nice items from some of the named level 55 mobs that spawn at the temple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On my server, the back of the pyramid is permanently camped by folks. Usually solo-ing shadowknights or paladins. I was allowed to loot the needed organs and got them rather quickly. It was a measurable amount of exp at 53. I tried soloing in the grey and the golems are easy, the rockfiends are impossible, the wurms and skeletons are medium. I have no exp soloing the snakes, so I cannot advise what dots will or will not land: they are undead so you should expect NO disease or poison dots to land as on any other undead in the game. Too many places infested with rockfiends, so I won't be back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BowenBathory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well I sold my Lodi Shild (since the cloak i use now was 20-29k less) and I took 4k out of that Gain and bought the Everlasting breath spell in Bazzar, on prexus its rare to see them (in my experiance) and the 4k one was the first I saw, i herd it was sold for 1k a week befor but I dont mind.<br />
<br />
I would sujest just geting the spell. but there is a Turtal bone ring (or somthing like that, it has an EB effect, and the stats arnt to shapy, it costs about 3-4k on prexus) take care</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Bowen, if I had 4k this obviously wouldn't be an issue.</div></div><hr />
