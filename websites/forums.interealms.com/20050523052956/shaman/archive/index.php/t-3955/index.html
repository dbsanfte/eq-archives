<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cidisius Skyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Much to my surprise I met a very nice player who is going to sell me his Rune Etched Icewurm Fang for 4k when he gets his epic. Now this still goes for about 7 to 8k on Brell and since he got it from a shaman who was getting his epic for half price he said he would show me the same kindness. I'm glad that some people are still kind to their fellow Norrathians.</div></div><hr />

Tried to make acomeback to EQ, sheer greed just amazes me, people are, in general, iceholes.<br />
<br />
When the game first started, I remember people actually passing on stuff they outgrew, for free, EQ is for socially inept greedy bastards. This is why spells cost so much, people are just jerks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A large number of items I do give away, other items I spent so much time &amp;/or money aqquiring for myself that I've got to recoup some of that expense.   It's a relational issue, based on how much work went in.   While I was going down a dungeon to get something for my alts, I picked up a number of various items, I either passed them out to true newbies who didn't think it was junk or put them on my mule in the bazaar for 1pp more than what the vendors offered me.  There's something to be said for making people work for their gear, they can build up 9pp to buy some blackened iron stuff.<br />

Tear MQ being auctioned the other day on Bristlebane for 40k.  And &quot;Test of Wisdom Kit&quot; (Woe, Envy, Marr's Promise) for 2k.</div></div><hr />

Sigh.  It was badly phrased.  Read the parenthesized version that Athame posted:<br />

A better way:<br />
<br />
...Now this still goes for about 7 to 8k on Brell, and a shaman who was getting his epic said he'd sell it to me for half price because someone had done the same for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My epic cost me about 500pp.  Damn those greedy druids I paid to port me all over the dang place.<br />
<br />
I could see why someone might pay for a tear MQ, but the RM stuff?  Jeez, you can solo that stuff around lvl 34 and it's not exactly hard to find up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I used to give away stuff to true newbies all the time ! Back in the day I use to make full suits of banded for fellow Iksar for free while I worked on my smithing skill. I also like to hook up newbie Iksar Shaman with all my leftover crap I'll never wear again. Or give them money to buy spells. Or make cured silk for Ikky monks while working on brewing, I used to do stuff like that all the time with my SK, as he was/is my tradesmith. <br />
I still give stuff away, because I know how it felt when someone was kind enough to give me something they weren't using. I never beg or respond to begging either...begging will get your a$$ kicked !! It is disgraceful for any self-respecting Iksar to beg for anything !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">25000pp to MQ tear is what I charge.<br />
<br />
(I'm kidding lol)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just bought a Spiritstone of Everfrost.  <br />
<br />
Then I spent a few minutes gathering up nice newb stuff under 5 pp at the bazaar (banded pieces, cured timzak, some surprisingly nice weapons, etc.) - right click the Spiritstone, buff/handout to newbs (a bloodstained fang or drachnid leg tip is great when you're using a splintering club!!), have a little fun (killed Redwind, tanked a few mammoths, gave a short tactics lesson to a couple 20'ish shadroods at the mammoth hill, Ice Giants camped- bah!)   <br />
<br />
Gate back to Nexus... back in trader mode in two minutes (and off to bed) - nice !!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Was assisting a level 30 the other day with glaron and tabion, and they were perma camped.  <br />
<br />
Kinda sad really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I am starting to lose faith in the high-level EQ community.  Very few people are nice and generous, but I think I understand why.<br />
<br />
My whole career, I have always been as nice and giving as I possibly can.  If I have something that I will never use, I either give it to someone else that is nice and can use it, or sell it for very cheap.  60 levels of giving crap away for free or dirt cheap, and guess what?  I have 2k in my bank account.  I need spells.  People want 60k each for them.  Do you think I still give stuff away for free?  nope.  I want every damn pp I can get for them.  Maybe once I have my spells I'll be a nice guy again, but I doubt it.  I am permanently scarred and bitter.<br />
<br />
Ah, well.  I made a wizard the other day and started leveling him up (my first alt :)) and I have met some really nice people.  People will be running by and just stop and sow me, heal me, buff me, help me kill my mob, or whatever :).  I just say &quot;Thanks&quot; and they say &quot;np&quot; and run off.  It's really nice :)  No one ever does that when I am soloing somewhere.  They usually look for a way to steal my pulls.  Whenever I am bored and fm and I see a melee soloing something, I slow it and give them a regen.  Usually gets a smile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cidisius Skyblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok guys sorry for the confusion. The guy bought the REIF for 8k when it was going for 16k from a shaman who was getting his epic. So in the same sense he is selling it to me for half price the same way he got it. I don't mind him not giving it to me for free because I do not ever expect to be given something for free. I tryto be a nice guy and give away whatever equipment I outgrow to the newbie shamans, but just because I'm nice doesn't mean everyone is. On Brell there are quite a few people who care about themselves more than anything especially the guild leaders I've been associated with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tantobourne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm on both sides of the fence about being 'nice' these days.  There was a lot more generosity and bringing folks up w/you early in EQ's release.  I still remember some day when some gnome barb on Karana twinked out my lvl 10 barb warrior with a bunch of bronze stuff.  Later on I heard that in RL the person was sickly and eventually died.  Kind of made the gift all the much more special to think that someone in RL with some life threatening disease had a big enough heart to make people feel good in a game, of all places, when their own life was wracked with their own pain and life-sapping dilemmas.  The only stipulation put on me when I took the bronzegear  was to not sell it but pass it on to the next needy person, that &quot;pay it back concept&quot;.  Wish I could've done that but after coming back to my account 6+ months later the person that used it had stripped Tant and my little barb warrior of any valuable goods and made off w/them.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, those people are hard to find in the game these days.  I can't say I'm one to jump out and help every person with a need.  Especially when their tone doesn't justify it.  Ok, I'm definately selective about whom I help.  What was the little saying?  &quot;A giver in a sea of takers&quot;  Boy, my respect to those people that still find it in their heart to go out of  their way to help someone out.</div></div><hr />
