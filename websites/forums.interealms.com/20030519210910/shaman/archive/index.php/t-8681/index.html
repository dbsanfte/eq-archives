<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shmuel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so far I have a Skull marked shield (sp?) and a good 1hb.  What 1hp and armor is good to twink with.<br />
<br />
I have a 61st druid and ranger to camp anything.</div></div><hr />

I'd go to the Ry'Gorr fort in EW for Ry'Gorr chain.  Should be able to get a full set in fairly short order, it drops pretty frequently.<br />
<br />
The UBER 1hp is the Rune Etched Icewurm Fang, drops in Kael.  If you don't want to lose giant faction or just want an easier camp, the Chancellor in Lake of Ill Omen drops a Jaded Chokidai Prod, which is so-so but very easy to get.</div></div><hr />

along with the above mentioned fang are all good spears around the 200 to 300 plat range in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Ikky chestplates run about 5K to 6K but the AC is poor. Your best bet on armor is to go into the bazaar and buy what's there.  In my opinion, AC &gt; mana &gt; hitpoints &gt; WIS.  This will change some as you level up and nothing is ever carved in stone but it is a good rule to get the best use out of the least amount of cash through the low levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">AC is a great thing to build in the lower levels, as you'll want to melee to get that defense up.  HP helps a lot with this obviously, but if you are OOM a lot, you'll have to med more.  More mana will allow you to fight more critters in a set amount of time.  Cannibalize converts 50hp into 20mana, so keep that ratio in mind when you gear up.  If an item will give you 50hp, consider it 20mana, and a small buffer to get hit with.  It's a good idea, IMO, to get WIS to 200 once you get into your 30s.  The reason for this is each WIS point will start to yield 10 mana per.  After 200 WIS, it gives nowhere near tha same bang for the buck.  So keep that ratio in mind as well.  Regen items will help immensely.<br />
<br />
And remember, C3 is only 50pp in the Nexus, hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMHO you can wait till your late 50s when you can get AC, wis, hp and mana on items and not have to sacrifice high ac for wis.  But this is coming from an old crusty grouping and soloing shammy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">doh, i can't believe no one said this.<br />
<br />
go get him a full set of totemic.  you have two tracking characters and can find grizzleknot in SK for the BP and the great bear in the EF cave for Helm.  you do not have to be a shaman do get the armor and give to him, just the items in the quest, pre turn in, are no drop.  (both those mobs are rare)<br />
<br />
totemic will AC him up until lvl 35+.<br />
<br />
pick up a set of chipped bone bracelets from the ogres in WK.  incase grouped and you want 10 extra wis and focus item.<br />
<br />
pick him up a sentry maul for a 2blunt, and either a spine chill or beetle stinger for piercer (check proc levels).  the ebon war spear is for ranged slot, and you can camp that in oot.<br />
<br />
if you want to really spend the plat, pay for Northmen Imbued chain.  most barb smiths will also really cut down on the price if you have the essense of winter (FG's in EF, or Yetis) and the ivory (evil eyes in Gorge)  (ivory has to be shaman imbued) if you get the tempers made (brewing skill) previous, then there is another discount.  then you can do the runs to HHKeep for the ore faster than any shaman, because you can port to NK/EK for the runs.<br />
<br />
you just have to find a barb smith with about 150skill for the low end cultural stuff.<br />
<br />
pop into Perma and get him the mammoth hide cloak.<br />
<br />
get some ivory imbued jewelry, for the ears at least.  good till almost planar.<br />
<br />
go camp a grimling chieftain in Hollowshade for the skull shaped sac hammer (does not proc till 25) and a ceremonial smudging stick for range slot.<br />
<br />
get to lvl 25 and then check back</div></div><hr />
