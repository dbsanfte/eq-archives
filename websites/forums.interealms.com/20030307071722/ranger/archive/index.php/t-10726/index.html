<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xyrauth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a note to those of you like me who don't know about enrage. When a MoB who has the abiltiy goes ENRAGED, it is in auto-riposte mode. You will get smacked down very quickly if you are dual wielding with low delay weapons. I got &quot;a talking to&quot; by one of the 60s in the group about going crazy on an enraged MoB. <br />
<br />
I guess you just hope the casters can nuke him down from this point, but I think you are supposed to switch to slow delay or maybe 2HS/2HB. Not sure though exactly what to do, but I switched out to 2HS when the &quot;a pool of slime&quot; enraged.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>StarGazeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Usually just turning off attack until enrage is over (couple secs) is the best route.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Attack from the back of the mob. If your on a raid, most of the time the main tank wil have build up enough aggro so the mob doesn't turn on anyone else. They usually switch off to a 2 hander during enrage so they don't completely lose aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xyrauth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For what reason does Enrage happen? How many times will it happen during a fight? When/ why does it end?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Telloran Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Enrage will happen when a mob gets low on health (usually at about 3/4 of a yellow bubble). I'm not sure if there's a level limit where this starts happening. It only happens once during a fight and lasts about 10 seconds. If your anywhere in the front arc of the mob he/she will riposte every one of your attacks. If you know the mob is one that enrages beforehand just take the necessary precautions (i.e.; don't be in the frontal arc, or turn attack off).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xyrauth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sweet. Thanks  Telloran.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A mob will always enrage at 10% health if it is going to enrage.  As long as you are behind the mob it is safe to keep beating on it if the MA is able to hold agro.  If you get caught in enrage i.e see yourself taking hits then start moving away from the mob and turn off attack.  I find it is quicker to move away then to turn off attack and on some mobs you will have only a couple of seconds of enrage before you are dead if you have fast weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xyrauth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Boy I'd say you die fast. Those &quot;a pool of slime&quot; were enraging on me for 180-200. I got shredded big time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hehe yes those pools of slime are nasty.  I tanked the sewers at 58 (the group must have been desperate for a tank )  I died 4 times and truely learned the way of Enrage :D .  Xp was so good that I still finished well up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Try a revultant whip, level 60, over the haste cap with bard song.<br />
4900ish hitpoints, dead in less then 4 seconds when someone turned the mob during enraged. I showed up at my bind point with my weapons twirling deftly bah hehe.<br />
<br />
Enrage is a good time to turn off attack and nuke/bow if you can't be behind the mob.</div></div><hr />

Wait till you see AoW turn on your raid and munch everyone who went afk. He hits for around 1100. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barogio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Something's wrong if the first time your seeing enrage it's at an exp group in CT, I'm sorry no offense meant but it's a sad state of affairs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xyrauth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">None taken Barogio, but why do you say that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kevaras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you are getting hit by enrage, just duck, quickest way to turn off attack IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lauranthalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What everyone else said :)<br />

Usually, you're not the MT, so you should be behind the mob anyway if you're meleeing because you will connect better from behind. Most of the time when the mob enrages, it doesn't affect me at all. And the MT has enough agro to keep it until the enrage drops.<br />
<br />
Also as a bizarre note, if you're flanking(facing either left or right side of) an enraged mob, you'll get auto riposted but none of them will hit you. At least, they don't hit me. :)<br />
<br />
I still remember the bloody smear that I left on the ground one night when I ran out of arrows while fighting a PoZ and decided to go into melee to finish him off. I wasn't thinking about enrage coming up and vaguely saw the enrage message right as I hit auto attack. I opened with a double attack from both weapons and kicked simultaneously. I was killed instantly as I was wounded already and had less than 2K at the time. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">First time i saw an enraged mob was in Velks in upper dogs... tents... <br />
<br />
i thought i had agro and stoped attacking at 3% hp and was amazed my jolt beat the low HP agro and that i lived... lol</div></div><hr />
