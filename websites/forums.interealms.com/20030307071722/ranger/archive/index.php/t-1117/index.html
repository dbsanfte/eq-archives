<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wyldrose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It's been a while since our guild has been Planar, due to a massive departure for yet another RPG... including our raid leaders.  We're finally back up to power and are going to head to fear this weekend.  I think before we had always done north wall break, directly behind the firewall.  Looking at the map, that seems rather ... well, risky and dumb.  Where is the best place to break into in fear?  With the west wall, aren't you risking being trained by other breakers-in a lot more?  or does the benefit of not having to run clear up the zone outweigh that chance?  Thanks in advance for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Roydal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">West Wall break is really the only way.<br />
<br />
I helped in a CR once of an alliance that did a Fear break running north.. when we went in, there were over 100 corpses scattered.. everywhere.. with monks running around screwing up aggro even more.<br />
<br />
The key to a clean break is control.  Pick the strongest 18, evacer in each group, zone in, turn left 90, run straight down to west camp and start fighting - if anyone aggros on the way - bring it.  Keep fighting until clerics or encs either run out of mana or just start drawing too much aggro - when the adds arrive, and they will heh, they will be no use to you.  At this point, evac out, and port back to Feerrott to try again.  This can be achieved with 1 group, but I will guess your level range is 46-54ish.. so 18 is a good figure to start with.<br />
<br />
Keep going at it until your group can run down to west wall, not be aggroed, and finally sit safely - at this point, bring the whole raid in a group at a time, and proceed as normal.<br />
<br />
A little brief, but there are my ideas for you hehe.<br />
<br />
Must say, a Plane break is always a lot of fun no matter how many times you do it, especially when your swarmed in mobs ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kuvu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is how we break fear, and it works like a charm...  2 groups break team, first team will have a monk and a 55+ mage in it.  Monk zones in first gets lots of aggro and runs north with it, after 15-20 seconds, other 2 groups zone in, go west to wall then south, there is a little ledge there on the top of the wall.  Then simply CoH your monk back and have him relog.  We have even had a couple breaks using this method with 0 mobs after zoning.  good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dlaritan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, the only fun way is to send in 2 groups and have a bard pull everything that isnt a golem or CT himself.... AEs are your friend!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lilucia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">See if anyone who's raiding it knows where the &quot;VU Tree&quot; is. It's directly to the west of the zone in, on the west wall. I don't remember what VU stands for specifically, but it's the initials of the first guild to ever break Fear effectively, who used that tree as the break point. <br />
<br />
So I'm told, anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kahla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you want to do it the REALLY easy way, you wait for some night that someone is in clearing up fear then take a guild Mage in and camp him at the SS then just CoTH your guild in works like a charm lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tylon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe, I think its only called VU tree on Fennin Ro.<br />

If you have 3 groups and a chanter that is 55+ then you can try a West Wall break.  Basically you zone your groups in about 15 seconds apart after an FD class inside gives the all clear.   Make sure everyone is invis before zoning in.  Then have them make a 90 degree left turn and head to the wall.   Everyone stay in a tight group.  <br />
<br />
If you got lucky and noone aggroed on zonein then eventually your gonna get a Scarling, Spider, or Ape in camp....most likely several once one aggros.  Assign one ranger/sk/pally to keep your enchanter alive by keeping aggro off em.   Make sure everything that enters camp is ensnared.  Once fighting start people will not be able to sit for a good 20 minutes or more.  You need a couple good shamans too.  When a mob enters camp it needs to be slowed immediately cause if you lose your enchanter you are gonna be in for a long CR.<br />
<br />
The best setup for mid 50s is 3 groups with at least 2 enchanters 54+,  two mid 50s shaman and a bunch of melee.  The trick to a WW break is fast kills and keeping your enchanters alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1 group all 60 shaman, chanter, cleric...3 high damage melee.<br />
<br />
or 3 groups all 55+ no exceptions to the level NONE!!<br />
<br />
I have never had a clean break when anyone under 55 comes in...they just get agro from too far out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I've heard from a few people that several servers know it as the VU tree, since they were the first guild on any server to break it. Just happened to be Fennin... <br />
<br />
I can't confirm or deny this of course, just going on what I'm told..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bandaur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">on Tunare, we call it the Tree of Woe....analagous to the Tree of Woe in Arthurian legend i guess, where the Knights in search of the Grail were hung by Morgana...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toof</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just a note i suggest leaving scarelings till last during the initial 20-30 minutes.  getting ported around only invites more to the party.<br />
<br />
innate camo OWNS for pulling fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Borzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We always break with 18 people. We send in 2 FD people (monks usually) one to sit at portal and one to sit at the west wall site.<br />
<br />
With a little communication you send 1 group at a time in pretty close together and just run to the west wall with no aggro and then you start pulling/killing...</div></div><hr />
