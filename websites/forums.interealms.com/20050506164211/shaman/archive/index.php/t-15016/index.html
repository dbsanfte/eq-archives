<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone. Currently I have a 56 Bard (my main) and plan to make a Troll Shaman. I love my Bard mainly cause I can kill just about anything I can land a song on. I pride myself in killing mobs most others wouldn't think about. At 52 I tried to solo Lady Vox twice but was unsuccessful both time. I think if I had better gear I might have taken her down.<br />
<br />
Anyways since LDoN is coming out I want to make a Troll Shaman to do a little dungeon crawling. I've always like the Shaman class (slow but effective killers like the Bard). Since I want to dungeon crawl (solo 90% of the time) I'm planning on getting the Troll snare necklase.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any recommendations for gear? With the Bard I can either farm plat (1k to 1.5k an hour killing HG's) or just go after the gear myself.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help and I look forward to posting more here.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice choice, chose my troll shaman for similar reasons, I like to solo when Im playing an alt, and the snare necklace is seriously handy.<br />
<br />
My first recommendation would be a decent weapon, and maybe a haste item of some kind (SCHW?).  I used a Granite Facegrinder in my early levels and it kicks some ass, 29/36 ish 2hb.  Rune etched icewurm fang is another nice choice if you prefer to use a shield.  Remember the shamys primary form of damage until about 24 is melee, and they dont do badly at all compared to similar level melee classes.  :)<br />
<br />
I can also highly recommend the Coldain Military Wristguard quest, should be easily soloable by your bard using a faction mule for hand-ins, then you can just log on your shaman to loot his new bracer.<br />
<br />
Once I got my shamy to 30ish I took him to GD and levelled up on the dire wolves until around 35.  This had the added bonus of coldain and CoV faction, and with some more work got him ally with both for some armour MQs (Thurg MQ armour is pretty cheap these days, and SS shouldnt be all that expensive).<br />
<br />
Ceremonial iksar chestplate (5 hp a tick regen) is very useful for the early levels, even more so when you get Cani at 24.  These run about 4-5k on my server.<br />
<br />
Just a few tips there from a fellow twinker, hope they helped a bit.  :)</div></div><hr />
