<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelshir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well today I went and purchased the 3 pack EQ and Luclin today to start my Shaman on. I wanted him on a seperate account and to do this I knew I needed a new key code. I got home and opened the 3 pack up and low and behold NO key code. I looked under and on the disks just incase it might not have been put on all the way and no luck. I went ahead and called VI and explained to the guy what happened. He asked me to check again because he knows its there. I guess you would have laughed if you were here watching me because I actually took the phone away from my face and looked at the phone for a minute. I then repeated to the guy that it wasnt there. He then let me know there was nothing they could do for me and I needed to take it back were I bought it. :(<br />
<br />
So I did what any EQ player would do.....I jumped in my car and went back to the store. I explained to the guy at the store what happened and after going back and forth with him on his no return policy on opened electronics. Finally after 15-20 minutes of this he agreed to trade it out with another copy for me he just had to get his manager to override the register on it. I would say after about 10 minutes the manager came up to me and said he couldnt let me trade it in for another copy because the key code is missing. I then told the manager that was the reason why I brought it back and I told him I called the VI and this is what they told me to do. He then told me he was sorry but he couldnt help me out. At this point I guess you can say I was seeing nothin but RED. :mad:<br />
<br />
When I got back home I called VI back and explained to them what happened again and all I got was a sorry I cant help you out. :mad: <br />
<br />
So what did I get today.....30 dollars worth of coasters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Don't worry man, 30 bucks ain't a big loss to you, you're planning to pay (almost) that much per every single month to VI for two accounts anyways aren't you? ;)<br />
<br />
I wonder where VI got the idea that Hey maybe we can make premium server called Stormhammer which folks will pay more to get better service? /wave million duoboxers<br />
<br />
Ok ok more seriously, that store from which you bought it sucks. You shouldn't give up they can't sell you something you can't use and then not fix it. Atleast not according to most coutries laws.<br />
<br />
Another part which sucks beyond my understanding here is VI. Why the hell couldn't they give you the code? They have been mailing free trial codes to folks and been giving them away in some gaming magazine cover promotions and when they get a phone call from a customer (who's actually really good customer cause he's paying for double price to have two accounts) they can't provide him with key? Aaaaaargh amazing customer service. Just fab...<br />
<br />
There's even no way to abuse the keycode that I can think of :p<br />
<br />
Gluck hope someone gives that code to you who's gotten one of those emails...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doh that sucks :(  I never got one of those emails, either /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can only think of one electronics store chain with such draconian return policies.  I won't mention the name (but let's just say it rhymes with &quot;Test Guy&quot;). My solution has been to not buy anything from them unless they are the only store in town that stocks something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I first bought EQ a couple of years ago, the key code in the box didn't work (I think I got a 'recycled' copy). I phoned the customer support line and they gave me a new code there and then. I suggest you try again, I'm not sure about US law, certainly under British law the retailer is ultimately responsible for the quality of the goods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kumari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if you paid by credit card like I do, just stop payment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To the original poster:<br />
<br />
First of all, you have been ripped off. They cannot sell you something, which you cannot use and refuse to exchange or refund it. This is no different than selling you a Playstation that does not work and telling you, too bad.<br />
<br />
I would call the store manager and send an email to Verant explaining the entire situation from start to finish. If that does not resolve the problem there is one more thing you can do.<br />
<br />
Go back to the store and purchase another copy on a credit card. Then as soon as you have paid for it and have it in the bag, lay the bad copy with no CD key on the counter and tell them that this is the copy they screwed you out of and that you will be stopping payment on the one you just purchased and walk out. Do not argue with them, do not discuss it with them, just leave.<br />
<br />
Then contact your credit card company and tell them that you purchased the software and the CD KEY required to make the game work was not in the box and the store refused to exchange or refund it and stop payment.<br />
<br />
Some people may not agree with this and say it is wrong or immoral, but those are the same people that either enjoy seeing people get ripped off or if it happened to them, would enjoy bending over for the reaming they received.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wouldn't even buy a second copy from them. Just call your Credit Card company with the issue and they will deal with the company. Bring you old copy back and politely tell the store manager you are stopping payment, why,  and here is the product back.<br />
<br />
For some reason when I buy stuff from this particalur chain I get stuff that is broke and has to be returned. I'm 4 out of 5 for returns.  I stopped buying here ages ago, fortunately I live in a large city where I have plenty of other options for electronic goods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There is nothing immoral about any of these scenarios. You were sold a product that does not work.  I think it's definitely not the right path to take getting into a shouting match with a Best Buy manager/worker, but it is YOUR money that you bought a product with.  The second scenario (if still applicable) sounds not only reasonable, but a perfect solution.  &quot;It's only 30 dollars&quot;.  Unless you're a millionaire, that's a LOT of money.  If you make $30k a year that's _THREE_ hours you had to work, $60k. .. 1.5 hours just for them to screw you over. So for the next hour and a half.. 3 hours whatever your time of reference just keep saying to yourself &quot;The money I'm making right now got stolen from me&quot; and see if it is still &quot;30 dollars&quot;<br />
<br />
I get bad about this sometimes.. &quot;It's just a dollar.; No big deal&quot;. A DOLLAR I work for 3 minutes just so you can flush that dollar down the toilet!<br />
<br />
I love spending money, I just hate wasting money :)<br />
<br />
It sounds like someone purchased/returned your copy and took the CD key out of it (may have already been said)  Shrink wrapping machines are accessible in most retail stores and if someone purchased it they could have easily just used it and reshrinked.<br />
<br />
Bakkal<br />
<br />
You have a receipt for this thing and they won't exchange it for another copy? It's not like you're taking in some battered up box with no receipt and asking for money back. Completely absurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">VERY important to buy software with a credit card.<br />
<br />
I also don't feel it's immoral at all to do whatever necessary to return your product - OPENED or NOT.  It's not VI's fault - who knows how the code became missing and they certainly can't just start giving out codes to anyone calling and saying their sticker wasn't there.  The way software stores treat you is BS - Do EXACTLY what Braxton said.  Walk in - buy another copy, go home and stop payment.  <br />
<br />
As a matter of fact - I was SO upset with the launch of anarchy online that after playing the game for a full two months, I put it back into the box, and brought it back to the store.  Of course they wouldn't take that POS back, so I bought an equivilently priced game that I wanted, charged it on my credit card - went home and stopped payment.  I told the credit card company exactly what happened, they stopped payment and I got my in store return in the end :)<br />
<br />
BTW that credit card still works there - the stores are all bark and no bite.<br />
<br />
If you bought another product from a store and it blew up or didn't meet the advertised features - any quality store will take it back.  Software should be no different.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I had a copy of Kunark that came without the sticker.  I called VI they told me to make a photocopy or scan the CD cover and email it to him or that I could return it to the place in which I bought it and get a new copy.<br />
<br />
I did both. I seems retarded that they give away 30day trial keys to customers who read the newsletter but then won't give a key out to a PAYING customer!<br />
<br />
Call again and get someone else. If they contradict themselves speak to the CS manager or bring up the fact that you want a flippin 30day trial key!.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Do the 30 day trial keys come with Velious and Kunark access enabled?  Because that's what he paid for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hahaha, the reason I don't buy software from Best buy anymore. The headache you have to go through is &gt; the 5 dollars or so more you will have to pay at like Comp Usa or something who IMO (since i have never had a prob returning something) is much better.<br />
<br />
For the other poster who mentioned they did not get an x-tra CD key that is prob b/c you are no on the VI mailing list (e-mail). You had to be getting those to get a new cd key. Which frankly i am supprised. It took me a month of hitting &quot;don't send me anymore e-mails&quot; before I finnaly got removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>svaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I had this SAME EXACT thing happen to me with Black &amp; White.  Best Buy wouldn't do SH*T for me.  Go figure.  Had to deal with the distributor for the game (I forget who... dont think it was Lionhead... they made it).<br />
<br />
   Anyway, I used a ''warez'' key generator to play until I could get in contact with the game distributor.  Obviously, that's no good for EQ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Kongar,<br />
Just wanted to say kudos to you man.You bought a game that worked fine by your own admission and played it for 2 months then decided it sucked so basically stole another game from the same store to make up for your poor choice as a consumer.<br />
The original post is about someone that DID NOT get what they paid for.And its a legitimate complaint i hope he has rectified.<br />
You on the other hand got just what you wanted ,used it for a specified amount of time,and then decided you had somehow been wronged by a faceless corporation and it was ok to steal from them.<br />
I sincerely hope you arent passing these values onto any children because lord knows the prisons are overcrowded enough as is.<br />
<br />
Peace love and geese<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Oh to clarify i dont see anything wrong with Braxtons advice of actually returning the defective (no key) game and getting what you originally paid for in return.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well thanks for the flame Arorot, now that my entire set of morals have been questioned by you over one paraphrased paragraph of an old situation, I simply must re-evaluate my entire existance.  <br />
<br />
I was merely trying to point out that major retail stores are held responsible for the quality of the goods they deliver just as much as the manufacturers themselves.  You - as a consumer - have a RIGHT to return any goods that do not live up to advertized claims.  If he bought a game that shipped without a CD - and both the manufacturer and the retail store fail to address his concerns - he is not SOL - he is still free to pursue other means of compensation(and rightfull to do so).  <br />
<br />
My POINT, oh vengeful one of much flame, is that credit cards are your only source of consumer protection against software sellers, AND because of lame return policies - you may be very glad someday that you are using plastic instead of green.  I can think of no other industry where consumers are told &quot;sorry but you can't return that item because of xyz&quot;  Heck - there's even lemon laws protecting people who drive cars around for months - but not in the software industry.  <br />
<br />
I got a game as a birthday present from my sister in Feb.  I already owned the game.  No biggie - I'll just return the UNOPENED box to Babbages and pick something else off the shelf.  They would NOT take the game back - said they only accept returns up to 10 days after the sale.  It was bought like 2 weeks prior....../boggle  This is why I say it's important to use your credit card.  These major retail stores are getting out of hand with their return policy crap.<br />
<br />
So, you think I'm a POS for what I did, but really you were more interesed in showing off your flaming abilities than actually thinking about what I was trying to say (I'll take the blame for not getting my point across)  <br />
<br />
&quot;The original post is about someone that DID NOT get what they paid for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ummm ya - I DID NOT get what I paid for - same thing.<br />
<br />
And I most certainly did not admit that the game worked - if it worked I wouldn't have tried to return it - Seriously - did you ever play AO on it's launch???  That video game was by all definitions of the word - a ripoff.  I can't possibly see an argument that AO lived up to it's claims on the box - it didn't even come close to working as intended :p Funcom will never see another dime of my money ever again.<br />
<br />
So to summarize - I obviously failed to communicate what I consider an extreme example of how commerce in the software industry is filled with many shades of grey.  And since retailers are trying very hard to make it black and white - you need to take some precautions if you dont want to get screwed out of 30 to 50 bucks.  A credit card is the only way I can think of protecting yourself.<br />
<br />
Kongar<br />
<br />
PS also re-read my post and you'll see that I didn't lie to the credit card company - I outright told them what I was doing and they said that I was within my rights to get an exchange if i felt I did not recieve what I paid for.  It's actually MORE ethical than buying another copy of EQ, and then LYING about which box was missing the CD key - food for thought...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Kudos to you Kongar!  I could go into a million reasons why I think you were totally justified doing what you did.  Good job )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I agree with Kongar.  Remember the EQ lawsuit because it wasn't up 24/7 like they said?  EQ overstated their availability.  They claimed they would do something they didn't do - provide access to the game 24/7 with no downtime.  That was the whole basis for that lawsuit.<br />
<br />
If EQ had made different claims saying 95% uptime 24/7 or 90% uptime 24/7 or whatever the lawsuit would have had no basis.<br />
<br />
AO made claims when they shipped.  If the boxed game did not live up to those, hold 'em responsible.  He gave them two months to fix it.</div></div><hr />
