<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I'm plannint a PoA raid and I'm not sure what to do about island 3. I have 3 full groups and one partial, most 55 plus with a few under and one under 51.  <br />
What I need is strategies on how to kill these buggers with no whipeout.<br />
Oh yeah one 61 enchanter atm.<br />
 Any suggestions greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">by island 3, I gather you refer to the Gorgon island right ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Azracks actually. You have faerie Island, dojorn, then azracks then the gorgon island. Though info on any past fairies would be good. that is as far as we've gotten</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For the Azarack isle, just make sure that your chanter is grouped with a very good cleric and a good secondary healer.  IMO keeping the chanter alive when you first enter the isle is the most important thing here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tefon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're unsure about all the folks on your raid not following directions clearly, have a break in team of  6 - 12 go over with 2 chanters, clerics and tanks dmg dealers  and clear the spot.  A well organized team breaks the Azs easy, but if you get a bunch of peeps not assisting, etc, you will get a ton of adds and lots of deaths if you're not careful.<br />
<br />
Once break in spot is clear have everyone else come over to clear the rest of em.<br />
<br />
This has worked well for my guild when we have a bunch of people on a raid that we don't normally raid with us.</div></div><hr />
