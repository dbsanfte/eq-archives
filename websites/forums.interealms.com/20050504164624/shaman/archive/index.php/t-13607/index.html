<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious if anyone has any idea---  will the original flagging quests remain, and will people who finish those quests after the flagging change be rewarded as well?<br />
<br />
The reason why I ask is that I have the box of souls and three soul spheres, but would like to wait until the flagging change, so that I can group with some friends (who can't enter valor til after the change) and hand in the spheres and box, giving all of us a reward, if the quest still exists and the reward continues to be given...<br />
<br />
Does that make sense?<br />
<br />
Basically, can I do a flagging quest after the flag requirement is removed, and get rewarded for it?<br />
<br />
...or will my box of souls and soul spheres just be useless junk after the patch, leaving me unrewarded?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Firstly, as far as I'm aware, the quests will still be in place.  The alt quests really shouldn't get you anything afterwards, because you still have to do the main quests to preoceed onto the next level.  *IF* SOE really does reward us for our flags, then there are three possibilities:  they reward everyone who has flags (probably with a graduated reward), they reward only those who have done the primary quests for the flags (again, probably graduated) or they reward people who have ONLY all flags for the zones (nice big reward).  <br />
<br />
No matter which way they go, they're unlikely to reward you for getting the flag after they remove them.  Doesn't fit their history, nor is it logical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like the idea of being rewarded for already being flagged.  That way key removal won't feel like a slap in the face to some.<br />
<br />
As to what kind of rewards I would like to see -- I think maybe an EXP bonus to those already flagged for certain plane, while they are in that plane, would be nice.<br />
Or maybe an increased chance at getting loot or parchments.<br />
<br />
/shrug <br />
There are many ways VI could go about this, but to be honest, the simple fact that they are removing some flags is good enough for me.  I just hope they decide to implement the lvl restrictions -- will limit the planes to the folks that should be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A free AA per flag that we got would work for me.<br />
<br />
Or maybe key us for all the Luclin zones.  that would make me happy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hopefully it will be a lot more than 1 aa per flag. And as far as any kind of keys for Luclin zones you are nuts. My guild just spent 2 and a half months keying up for VT and we haven't finished the shards yet. I assume you are kidding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">First, the flags (as opposed to the quested zone keys) are their own reward. You have to get them to follow the storyline and get to the zone without quested keys (i.e. the elementals planes and the Sol Ro tower). I wouldn't be surprised if they did 'reward' the flags beyond that.<br />
<br />
Now, the quested keys themselves... well, they're items most of the time, no? Diaku amulet, ring of marr, etc. The easiest way to 'reward' the pain of going through the quest would simply be to give stats and effect to those items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No way, if they give out free keys to VT, I'll know there's a serious problem at VI.  That is no doubt, the HARDEST key to get in the game, and also the most worth it!  Getting to hunt with your guild in VT is a major reward for slaving thru all the mindless timesinks and learning emperor and defeating emp.  I also wouldn't support them removing the VP key.  But perhaps streamlining it a bit would be good.  Up the spawn rate on pained soul and rotting skelly and ancient jarsath.  That and re-think needing Trak's tooth for the key.  That's gonna be a giant bottleneck.  But I WON'T say it will separate the uberguilds from the small guilds.  Even Ximix's guild could easily down Trakanon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree free VT keys, ST keys, would all be ridiculous.  However it would also follow the exact same retarded logic that is getting the flags removed, just to a further extreme.  Take something that is a pain in the ass to get, and give it away to please the customer base.  VT guilds carry sufficient political weight to prevent that from ever happening I imagine.  ST on the other hand may not be as contested any more.<br />
<br />
My money is still on some slap in the face like a +5 cha charm or 1 aa point per key - finding a way of leaving out the people who got keyed by being grouped with a questor.<br />
<br />
100's of hrs of keying and flagging /= 4 hrs of AA xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nah, the thing about PoP is that those particular zones that are going to be opened up SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN KEYED!  It's ridiculous to charge a customer for an entire expansion when over half of the zones will be locked away from them unless they are fortunate enough to be in a substantial raiding guild.  Because let's face it, up until about a month ago, even the alternate entry quests DID NOT WORK!  So unless you were in a raiding guild, you were generally screwed.  It wasn't fair and it wasn't right.  And they SHOULD have fixed this a long long time ago.  Instead they let it fester and now it's more difficult to lance the boil.  <br />
<br />
With respect to ST and VT, those are ONE zone per expansion that had a difficult key.  With PoP, they introduced an entire expansion full of difficult keys.  If you were told ahead of time that most of the zones in PoP would be difficult to enter, would you still have bought it?  I dunno.  <br />
<br />
This is just righting an ancient wrong IMHO.  They should have opened the &quot;exp-zones&quot; of PoP from the start.  If not for gameplay reasons, for the reasons of not driving apart friendships.  I lost so many good EQ friends due to POP and them not being able to join me.  And so many acquaintances I've not seen hide nor hair of in months.  Locking away the main exp zones from the majority of the player base was a sick and wrong thing to do, and never should have been done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think it was on the Safehouse it was suggested that one of the rewards could be the introduction of automatic backflagging, which short of experience rewards are about the only thing that would appeal to high end guilds who are already done with all the flagging. Appeasing the high end guilds will by definition be the hardest thing.<br />
<br />
Automatic backflagging means that killing a flag mob would automatically flag you for every encounter that that specific mob requires. In other words, capping Rallos means you're automatically flagged for HoH, TMM, Saryrn, CoD etc etc. While not giving any individual benefits, this would be huge for guilds who are already past the flagging content, but find themselves endlessly having to redo every flag in the script for new guild members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Anyone expecting more than 1AA per flag is seriously kidding themselves.  Personally I think that is too much because the keys themselves are rewards for future advancement and probably still needed for progression to elementals...  This nonsense of exp bonuses etc is just LOL funny... if they implemented such I would hope they would be accessable to anyone that keyed in the future to also get such bonuses because it would just be crap otherwise for lack of a better word.</div></div><hr />
