Almost feel like saying the hell with it and playing EQ.<br />
<br />
Id rather go back to Final Fantasy Online if I had to give up WOW., atleas that game has a compelling atmosphere. Havent logged in for 12 months, but I do listen to the soundtrack every now and then...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Apparently it's the same servers over and over and over........<br />
<br />
I know because one of them (Silverhand) is the one with my main and my alts. Been down for the most part of today.<br />
<br />
What does this cost Blizzard?<br />
<br />
In the short term - nothing. Maybe one or two cancelled accounts.<br />
<br />
In the long run - customer loyalty.  Because when &quot;the next big thing&quot; (MEO?) comes out - I am checking it out.  <br />
<br />
Hard to develop loyalty to toons and a game I can never play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lightbringer has been down most of the day as well.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My server's been down 24 hours and counting !</div></div><hr />

This is amazing to me, since we all know they made a huge amount of money off this game, wildly successful. Can't they just hire some quality technicians and equipment? I don't get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its pretty simple. Servers are overloaded and they need to offer a transfer solution, even if only to high populated servers and watch the numbers so that they dont trash a new server.<br />

FYI, my server is not a high pop server and i have 0 issues. No ques, rare cases of lag. So if its that bad you might want to think about moving.</div></div><hr />

Never had a queue, had a couple of crashes but thats it, server was back up within minutes.<br />
<br />
Only moan was using AH on a US server while being Alliance. Totally unusable becuase of lag and failed database queries.<br />
Horde EU though has no AH probs, except for the lack of good stuff for sale.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knock on wood, but I have yet to encounter them.<br />
<br />
Still gets a bit laggy in IF AH, but I only go there when I absolutely HAVE to (which isn't very often).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">eq servers never lagged or they did RARELY. Even the high population ones. It comes down to this. Either pay a LOT of cash for bandwidth or try to save money on that and buy crappy servers and crappy bandwidth and lose customers. In the long run they are better off buying more bandwidth. It's expensive yes but they got probably a million customers by now who are paying 14.99 per month. If that is not enough to cover it then what is?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm pretty sure it's not an issue with bandwidth. My ping times are usually quite good. (for my location) The lag everyone is seeing seems to be mainly related to database bottlenecks, as it's usually evident when looting items, retrieving mail, or searching AH.  When people are complaining about lag, I can kill without any problems, so long as I don't stop to loot anything.<br />
<br />
Usually, the moment I stop to loot, that's when I get the 'lag', and on my partner's screen I'll still be stuck looting, whereas on my screen I can move around, but can't cast/melee/etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Then set up a new database. look i am not a Programmer but they should pay WHATEVER it costs to WHOEVER can fix this ASAP.<br />
This is a priority. Unlike other games this game relies on keeping customers and a lot of people are unhappy with how things are going. <br />
<br />
For instance: I cannot play an alliance character. I mean i CAN. But the lag is horrible the newbie areas are unplayable evenings. Even late at night i start to cast i see the spell effect but it takes 3+ seconds for the casting bar to appear and another 3 seconds after it completes to shoot the spell. It is disgusting. I am happy i hate alliance but still the alliance lands are closed to me due to too much lag creatign an awful experience.<br />

Both Sargeras and Durotan among others had emergency maintenance yesterday in the afternoon. IMO that didn't go well and led to the server problems you and I both experienced last night. They finally either crashed the server or rebooted it intentionally, but then things improved.<br />
<br />
However, reboot != fix.</div></div><hr />

******************************<br />
<br />
Back in the day when I was with a tactical Signal Battalion in the Army our main means of providing battlefield coms to higher echelon (Battalion / Brigade / Division) was MSE - also known as Mobile Subscriber Equipment.<br />
<br />
Now, the first thing you should know is that MSE was based off of a  french  system. That alone should give you pause.<br />
<br />
But anyway, we would have issues every time we went to the field with at least one link. Enlisted, senior enlisted, warrant officers, sometimes even civilian engineers would come out to try and troubleshoot the problem(S).<br />
<br />
Eventually the solution was (quite often) to simply shut down / turn off the system. (Much like simply turning off your computer to clear BSOD).<br />
<br />
As I offhanded remarked one day to my senior maintenance NCO (I was a company XO at the time)<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know, I can turn off and turn on my computer without properly powering it down. It won't fix the underlying problem. <br />
<br />
&quot;It may not be bad for my computer - but it sure ain't GOOD for my computer.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">So jokes aside, which do you guys think is the main cause:<br />
<br />
1) Not enough technicians/programmers to fix things.<br />
2) Crappy servers and other equipment.<br />
3) Not enough money thrown at the problem.<br />
4) Just too many people on some servers.<br />
<br />
Or what? I mean really, there must be some main cause of this stuff and I'm curious what it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Poor database infrastructure and design combined with an extreme underestimate of how popular their game would be.<br />
<br />
Everything I've encountered with exception to the video lag/low FPS I posted about seems to be data related. Looting, mail, AH listings/searches, all make data calls.<br />
<br />
I also recall a job posting on their site for a high end Oracle DBA shortly after release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Val is right about the main issue being the database structure, poor design.  That said, Bliz has said there have been some load balancing issues (also addressed by Val).  These issues were obvious in the Beta and it's reasonable to assume they have been working on it since then.  I find the game is remarkably stable, well there are issues that are listed here with the queues, database rollbacks, load balancing, but the client has never done a crash to desktop on me and the only video issue I ever had was easily fixxed by dicking around with shader settings in the ingame options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I have crashed to desktop several times. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I think I've CtD'd once or twice since release, same for my wife. I could count on CtD's several times a day during ST1/ST2/OB, but they've made remarkable improvements in client stability since release.<br />
<br />
Most problems these days are back end/server side it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Poor database infrastructure and design combined with an extreme underestimate of how popular their game would be.<br />
What he said.  Their network architecture in general and database design in particular do not scale well at all.  I have not understood why this wasn't caught even with automated load balance testing prior to the ST betas.  There are all kinds of tools that can simulate network traffic and load, yet this still made it into retail.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is phenomenal at conceptual game design and rich client side implementation, but their forte is not and has not ever been multi-tier client server architecture, as is readily apparent.  Sadly it's not the easiest problem to fix once it's up and running- this should have been fixed prior to launch, no matter the delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Seems the guys on this board are smarter than the &quot;braintrust&quot; at Blizzard.<br />

Seems like the same thing happened when SOE released Star Wars Galaxies in June 2003.  The database buffers on the server side would become so inundated with client requests it could eventually take several minutes to purchase, loot or trade items.  In order to deal with this fundamental design flaw, SOE shut the servers down for two hours every morning to purge the buffers.  They didn't &quot;solve&quot; this problem until last Dec (2004), although I don't know what the fix was - I left the game within a few weeks of release since my primary playing time was when they chose to do a server recycle every day (every frickin day!).<br />
<br />
If WoW made a similar miscalculation in their own data structures, it may be a long time before it's fixed.  The good news is at least many of their servers (mine included) seem to be able to run for days uninterrupted.  There is a 15-30 minute period nearly every morning at ~0500-0530 EST where the &quot;Loot Lag&quot; makes the game nearly unplayable, then it suddenly goes away.  I wonder if they've figured out a way to purge their query buffer without completely resetting a game server?</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a memory &quot;leak&quot; where in the database does not scrub the memory and eventually uses up the available memory. This will cause excessive page faults within the system drastically degrading performance due to higher cpu usage and slower response from the pagefile. Oracle is a resource hog to begin with but is rather notorious for memory leaks depending on the level of software they are using for the database. Although piss pour database structure and coding lead to the majority of database issues. <br />
<br />
Doesnt sound like WoW is running into this situation as you cannot free up the memory without bouncing the box. They seem to have severe issues with allocating resources for the databases by attempting to have too many on too few.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Except that blizzard posted saying it was a database error, at least the first week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Today they said:&quot;The data center that happens to host the above-mentioned realms is performing maintenance on site which is causing latency issues to services they host, these realms included. This is not directly related to Blizzard or the realms in question, and is NOT a result of the fix that took place last night. We have been informed that the projected time the maintenance will be complete will be 5:00 PM PST.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reading between the lines, it sounds to me like they farmed out the database and the realm servers to a subcontractor, instead of doing it themselves. No wonder they are having problems.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying what it sounds like, and since they don't offer many specifics, it's only natural people will speculate.</div></div><hr />

MillI work with network/internet client/server database applications on a daily basis. It's not hard for someone who works with the technology to know and recognize the symptoms. And as someone already pointed out, it was acknowledged by Blizzard personnel early on in release, not to mention they keep pointing to database servers as the main cause of most of the latency. Current data center connection maintenance not withstanding.<br />
