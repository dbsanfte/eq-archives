<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Farm the asslings on the outer castle wall in Plane of Mischief. Likely to see one every 4 hours or so based on my experience. Had some hot runs there when I'd get a couple a night and some days when I didnt get any, but it dropped there ALOT more often than in CT.<br />
<br />
All of the &quot;Dastardly Rascals&quot; will be dark blue to 65 and not exactly a challenge by any means but least there is some AAxp rolling in. They can drop upto 15pp each along with gems and tons of Words, Runes, and other research components. Can normally clear 10-12 of the mobs or so before repop starts while soloing. Normally fairly empty zone and an easy camp. Good luck  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IF you dont wanna have to worry about stupid combines for this spell or spending an assload of money for it, LDoN Nro 800 pts for RGC!  you get XP while working on getting this fantabulas spell! :)  just a thought.<br />
<br />
I have not ever seen yaeth's 73R, even in baz.<br />
<br />
BTW:  RGC from LDoN is NOT NODROP...so if you have a friend who loves you and will get it for you, or you are a nice friend and gets it for someone else (after you got it for yourself) or you simply wanna make some PP...its not a bad way to do so.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps :)</div></div><hr />

Wow, can I come and play with you, you be the luckiest shaman in the game, you get on 73R every 4 hours, and/or a couple a night. Thats astounding. I've been there for more than 20 hours playing time, and never seen one. I could have done hard LDONs and got it in half the time.<br />
<br />
I'd say, if your level 65, just spend the adventure points for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you have an alt who is a researcher you definitely owe it to yourself to farm PoM.  It's amazing the number of spell parts that drop there.<br />
<br />
In one 3 hour session I got all the components for Bane of Nife.  Wasn't really even *trying* for it, thats simply what happened.  You should have seen my jaw drop when I saw Words of Agony.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Words of Agony cost me a pretty penny in the bazaar to research my Bane of Nife.<br />
<br />
I know this may sound newbish, because I am more old-fashioned, but how come everybody loves and desires RGC so?  How many mobs outside of LDoN curse you?  How often do you use the spell once you have it?<br />
<br />
RGC is the only spell i really haven't considered looking for fervently, and I'm just wondering what's so awesome about it that makes people charge 55k in bazaar at Firiona Vie, or laugh at the concept of using a Yaeth's 73R for Primal Essence, a spell I've always gotten a good amount of use out of (bought the spell, not the 73R... never SEEN a 73R)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well truthfully RGC is mostly used on raids but people like to have a complete spell book I guess. Primal Essence is really not that tough to get if you know where to go. I got several copies back in the day in Ssra and handed them out to guildmates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Primal Essence is really not that tough to get if you know where to go.<br />
<br />
Lest we forget, Primal Essence is a L52 spell.  Not too many folks are capable, at that level, of hitting Ssra and coming out with PE.  Heck, not too many folks at that level are capable of hitting Ssra and coming out alive.<br />
<br />
I know L65 Shaman who still don't have the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got mine from farming the halflings on the PoM castle wall.  Took ~10-12 clearings of all the halflings.  The solo aa xp is ~2% a kill so it is not a total waste of time.  I got better drops of all kinds off the 2 halflings at the castle entrance.  They are the only ones that do not come as singles to a level 65.  Overall this seems better than spending 800 LDoN points that I prefered to spend on anathema, bane, FE and BAIV augments.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">PE is easier to get in AC by killing the named that pops in there and getting the clicky hammer with the group form on it.<br />
<br />
RGC is a raid spell, the thing is its a farking SUPER rare raid spell, speaking from the point of a shaman who has spent many raids being the ONLY RGC capable person there I can tell you useing 73r for pe is a crime against humanity (well and elfanity and trollanity and all of those other anity's out there)<br />
Pe is a junk buff for the most part, RGC while rarely used is incredibly powerful when the time comes to load it up. its powerful like &quot;hi I have RGC we can raid now&quot; kind of powerful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Really?  I can solo a burrower now?  Most of the information I've read says that I need at least 2 groups to kill this mob.  Granted, I'd *love* to have the clickie group version.<br />
<br />
I *know* I can solo Rascals on the wall of PoM, and while the drop rate isn't exactly ideal, it's workable.<br />
<br />
You can bet that if I get my 73R, I'll use it on PE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">you can one group the EB in Ac if your crew knows their stuff and you have the healing to back up the dps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i got my copy of 73R in the CT sewers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ouzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Got mine in PoM, took about a month ( hunting about 1 to 2 hours per trip) and the guy That researched it failed...GRRRR. So went back and got it about the same amount of time to get the second, but this time it was a success YAHH. Good timing to guild had a ssra raid that same day so got to use it:) but guess what.. a RGC droped:)..but im sure i would lost the roll anyways. I wouldnt waste ldon points on it unless your a die hard ldon person. Just go hunt in PoM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have basically supported my tradeskill addiction (stupid Aid Grimel quest) by farming Y73R off the Zorro-wannabes in PoM. 1 every 4 hours may be a bit generous, but its not far off. I have gotten one in as few as 3 kills, and I have not gotten one in 3 full (11 mobs for me) clears. <br />
<br />
The sewers in CT is also a good place, however, I have found it to be more common closer to the old Avatar of Fear chamber. That little &quot;staging room&quot; just before the ramp into his area has a couple mobs in it, thats where I got my first copies long ago (before I knew how rare it was, and made PE out of it, /snicker). The first couple rooms in the sewers seem to be rather empty of almost all loots. <br />
<br />
All in all, I would NEVER pay 800 LDoN points for a spell that I mem MAYBE once or twice a week. 800 is a chunk. 3/4 of a 40 hp aug or other good aug, 1/2 of a top piece of gear, heck you can buy a 2nd level gear item for that. Its really not hard to farm. I have farmed 5 in the past 3 weeks, and I only go when I need some cash for tradeskills. Why farm greenies for stupid tradeskill drops when I can get 2% of an aa per kill and make 40K every few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Went to PoM last night to see how easy it is to solo them.  Got buffed and ready, then engaged the first guy.  Killed him easy enough, click to loot, and BLAMMO! pg. 73 right.  :D<br />
<br />
Killed one other just to see if I could be that lucky again, but sadly I wasn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Grats man, good to see folks are starting to find 73R more readily.</div></div><hr />
