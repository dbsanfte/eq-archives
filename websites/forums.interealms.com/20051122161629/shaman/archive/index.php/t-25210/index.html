Amazing how I didn't use evade, or vanish, or even a kidney shot because I get caught up and all I can do is button spam like a moron, I suck at pvp I think but have a good build. 20 points in combat, from here on out I can get mace stun, woot.<br />
<br />
Now I am shaking, haha. Went my way big time, this round.<br />
<br />
<br />
Levels really do matter, not as much as DAOC or EQ it seems, but that hunter was bouncing arrows off me for little damage and I resisted some damage spells from warlock. Not sure if warlock or priest were fearing.<br />

Define &quot;work&quot; :) Good story, though. Not my cup of tea, but sounds like you had a ton of fun.</div></div><hr />

I don't level at work, I feel guilt enough as it is, just fire it up and do the run around charred veil to help with mining. I was so laggy I kept missing bandage too hehe. it is my cup of tea when I win, but when you lose, it can be frustrating.<br />

Mining is a curse, it is almost as addicting as good old beer. Just gotta get that next mithril vein!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On Silver Hand we had a battle last night in Hillsbrad - about 30 on 30 or so.  Was pretty fun.  It does suck that levels matter so much.  I feel bad when I can trounce someone a few levels lower than me hardly breaking a sweat, and conversely, I get trounced by someone a few levels higher.<br />
<br />
I've also seen it where if one ?? rogue or pallie survives a battle, he can quick wipeout the enemy survivors if they are lower level.  It can be 10 to 1 and he will still win with a level advantage.  I know as a warrior, I can't hit diddly squat on anything much more than 2-3 levels above me.<br />
<br />
Btw, we are not a pvp server, but we are an RP server.  Yet we always have marauding bands of goodies raiding the Barrens and vice versa... usually get good participation. PvP is also not my cup of tea, but it is entertaining sometimes.  I guess our PvP is all voluntary, which is cool I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree Mill - the PvP is fun.  It really gets the pulse up.<br />
<br />
I got into a couple of fights while out questing the other morning in Stonetalon before work.  Ran into a NE hunter, co-level (both of us 24) and for some reason he was PvP flagged (I'm on a PvE server).  Not sure if he knew he was flagged or not because I went charging up on him from his front side for as far as I could see him and he never reacted to me until the first spell (flame shock, a DOT) hit him.  After that, he never got caught up and he went down while I was still 75% health and 50% mana.  I wolfed and ran, figuring he had friends in the area, and proceeded to finish my quest (a really quick one).  <br />
<br />
On my way back, while still flagged PvP, I ran into a co-level Druid that had just rezzed his hunter buddy (the guy I previously killed).  He saw me a ways off and DOTted (Starfire?), rooted and charged into me.  I panicked and bolted (Lightning), DOTted (Flame shock) and dropped Stoneskin, health regen, and searing totems before/as he got to me. After his first round attack, I was almost dead.  I gulped a potion, and earth-shocked him (interrupts his cast plus prevents same cast for 2 more seconds) as he tried to self heal. I earth-shocked him again as he tried another self heal meleeing between the casts. He then re-rooted me and ran and I bolt-killed him with a fall-away jump shot.  The hunter I had previously killed was still in rez sickness and never tried to enter the fight (didn't even sic his pet on me!).  He could have easily finished me at that point (heck, his pet probably could have), but for some reason stayed out.  So I just slapped on a bandage, saluted him, wolfed, and ran like hell.  Turns out my instincts were good as I passed level 26 and 28 NEs headed our way during my escape.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Still gets me excited to type about it now.  I suppose next time it will be my turn to die, though.  :(</div></div><hr />

A lot of people on the alliance side just don't realise shaman can be wolves, so he may have just thought you were 'some kind of dog' until you laid into him. :p   But yeah, you can't beat consensual PvP, as opposed to the gank fest and corpse camping that is apparently becoming quite common on the PvP servers.  (second hand info, don't sue me if it's not quite that bad on all PvP servers)  I like to run around the barrens (NE Warrior) with PvP flag on. Sadly, no horde members have tried to attack me yet, so I've just become this sad, lonely NE wandering around the barrens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;Ganking&quot; as you call it happens routinely in a PvP server, meaning you can be attacked for any reason in a contested area by enemy faction players.  <br />
<br />
Corpse camping does not appear to be very common but I guess it can happen occasionally.  Not many players really enjoy sitting there doing nothing except to prevent a person from retrieving their corpse.  It's not very productive.  What I think usually happens is that a person(s) of the opposing faction kills another player and hangs around that area to exp or quest.  It was their intention from the beginning to go to that area to do quests or what not and it just so happens that there was a player from the opposing faction.<br />
<br />
Many times when I arrive at a questing / exp area, I see players from the opposing faction.  There are only two choices to make:  Attempt to kill them and take over the camp or leave and find something else to do.  I usually pick the first.<br />
<br />
That may appear to be corpse camping to the victim, but it is not so.</div></div><hr />

There is a horde camp in stranglehold, I was doing a few quests there, stupid alliance fight right outside it, I killed about 10 level 32-36 people, and almost got a 42 mage who was tagging somone else, and they just keep coming, weird. Don't they know there is a horde outpost there?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One of the things to consider here is how the populations on the servers evolve in situations like this.  <br />
<br />
The PvP servers start with all the griefers, but also with a fair number of decent players who are (possibly naively) hoping that PvP wont degenerate into a griefer-fest this, the latest new game.  Over time the proportion of griefers go up as the decent players get fed up of being griefed and either quit the game or head to a PvE server.  Eventually pretty much the only non-griefers left on PvP servers are either noobies who haven't realised what they are up against, or a few high level players in good guilds who are protected to some extent from the griefers.  So at this stage the PvP servers are - if nothing else - doing everyone on the PvE servers a favour by attracting the griefers.<br />
<br />
The next stage comes when the number of victims available on the PvP servers falls to such a low number that the griefers find they are either eating each other or else failing to find victims at all.  At this point the griefers start heading to the PvE servers which start seeing a significant rise in all the nonsense these idiots pull - scamming, tricking noobies into duels etc.<br />
<br />
OK, thats a cynical view based on past experience.  It will be interesting to see if WoW follows the norm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Haha, I'm the same way when I get jumped by someone in PvP.  I always have this nice laid out plan to go against every class, but when the fighting actually starts, all I can focus on is spamming shocks and healing myself.  All my 50 billion different totems go to waste hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Crusty,<br />
<br />
sorry bud, but you relly need to either try the pvp servers, or stop talking about it. It is not a bunch of kiddies running around anymore than on the care bear servers. In fact it is probably easier to grief people on a care bear server, as you cannot kill the enemy if they get in your way. You cannot be killed under level 25-30 unless you choose to, you can fight in your home territories.<br />
<br />
I rarely get ganked, because I am observant and know when to run. And there is honorable people around too, more and more lately, people high level on mounts leave me alone and wave or such.<br />
<br />
It just isn't some grief fest like people think.<br />
<br />
mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Not to try and start any kind of flame but I have to ask, did you guys ever try PvP in EQ1? Most of what you are describing sounds a LOT like the PvP I experienced on Tallon Zek. <br />
<br />
It sounds like the fights are somewhat shorter in WoW but essentially the same attack/counter attack, debuff etc. I haven't played WoW yet because I'm waiting to see how the PvP servers evolve and what part griefing plays, if any. From what you guys are describing here it sounds remarkably similar to TZ which is kind of a bad thing. TZ evolved into a guild based server with the top guild doing anything possible to prevent the 2 and 3 guilds from catching them in the progression. Pandemonium would resort to any tactics in order to prevent Indignation or Discordia from progressing, including but not limited to; High Sun on Sol Ro several times during fights with him to prevent an opponent from killing him, hacks which allowed their players to enter walls within a zone and cast spells from there while remaining untargetable, auto-follow hacks so their rogues could actually do something in PvP, training the entire upper part of PoEb on Indignation when they spawned Avatar of Earth on their first attempt and would have surely killed it gaining access to Time, the list goes on and on. <br />
<br />
I really hope Blizzard can maintain some kind of control on their PvP servers but I am skeptical. It takes pretty much constant babysitting to keep people playing clean in games like this and I doubt Blizzard can afford the manpower for that. Sony made a decision that it wasn't worth the money or effort to try and keep things clean on the Zeks because the number of /reports and /petitions generated by the 4 Zek servers vastly outnumbered all other servers combined and they subsequently have decided not to include PvP in EQ2, at least at the start. I really wouldn't be surprised at all if they never include PvP in EQ2.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is a forward thinking developer for the most part, perhaps they will come up with some new means by which to keep the PvP fair and entertaining for everyone, not just the griefers. I'm going to wait and see how it goes before I buy the game.<br />
<br />
As to what you are describing about PvP, it's definitely a rush. It adds so much to the game that you almost can't compare red and blue versions of the same game. Not only do you have the adrenaline induced fervor of one on one combat but large scale guild wars add a nearly indescribable element of cooperation and competition to the game. The ties you develop with your fellow guildmates when fighting a large scale battle are profound, and the hatred for your opponent is palpable. Not to mention the tension that always exists on a PvP server because you never know when you or your group is going to be overrun by another, more powerful group of players. <br />
<br />
Despite the problems with the Zek servers in EQ1 and the lack of customer service there I still feel the red servers offered a MUCH better game experience than the blue servers. After 3+ years on TZ I transfered to Quellious during the last few weeks I played EQ1 to join some friends and was bored silly. I guess I just don't understand what the motivation is to spend all the time and effort required to get to and progress through the high end PvE game if you don't ever have an opportunity to use that gear and experience against human opponents. That is where the real strategy lies in most computer games, AI always has been and is still ridiculously easy to figure out(not including chess programs because they are a whole different animal), humans opponents are full of surprises. It's much more satisfying to beat another person in a battle than a simple program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What's up with booty bay? Thought it was neutral? I got attacked by a level 42 pally and friends right on the docks, ran to a guard, and the guard kicked my ass and left them alone. That kind of pissed me off hehe.<br />
That is weird Mill!  I can think of a couple of things that might have happened:<br />
<br />
1. You came into Booty Bay already flagged PvP.  The guards will kill you for that.  The Level 42 Pally saw you were already flagged and took advantage of the rule with the guards.<br />
<br />
2. You have bad Booty Bay faction (probably not  likely - you would know that already for sure, I imagine).<br />
<br />
Is #1 maybe the case?  Either way, I'll bet you felt deeply betrayed by those silly, materialistic goblins!  :p   Luckily, the graveyard's just outside of town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Booty bay is a contested area.  You can and will be attacked by the opposing faction players.  Guards pretty much ignore the fighting, but some merchants may attack whenever they see fighting going on.<br />
<br />
As for Stranglethorn, yes, they do know there is a horde outpost there.  They also know that the human camp and gy is very close by.  Currently, the Alliance side dominates both Stranglethorn and Booty Bay on my server.<br />
<br />
To answer Throxis, No.  You can not stop other guilds from progressing.  You can not even stop guilds from the opposing faction from progressing.  All the good stuff comes from instanced dungeons, including raid content.  Players can attempt to stand guard at every instance dungeon entrance 24/7 and kill off lower level opposing faction players if they wish, but then they wont be progressing either.  Plus, they can simply run over as a ghost and rez themselves closer to the zone and try again.  All you can really do is annoy them and delay them 15-30 min from entering the dungeon.  It's basically impossible to effectively block a guild from progressing, whether they are on the same side or not.<br />
<br />
Edit: Contrary to what Mill claims, the pvp server is not a Merry Land like he claims.  People do get ganked often.  Mill doesn't because he probably plays a rogue or hunter, not because he's smart.  If my shaman could stealth or had tracking, I would could get away when I see a high level coming too.  I have been ganked so many times while exping or questing that I have pretty much given up being nice to lower level Alliance folks.  I will usually attack any alliance I see (if it's not suicide), even if they are 10+ levels below me.  Sometimes my friend tells me I'm ruthless, but hey, I'm sure they would do the same if given the chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
then you are playing with poor observation skills and in areas you should not be. I am one of two rogues in my guild, no one has a problem with ganking that often at all. It is not merry land of course, but people bitching about being ganked simply do not have good observation skills, or are running quests in enemy held territories when they should not. If a horde person gets ganked in stranglethorn, it is their fault, the place is literally crawling with alliance. Don't do the quests yet. Same is an alliance pokes their head into some of our zones.<br />
<br />
I agree about not being nice, it isn't time for being nice. I won't attack somone really low, but if I feel they threaten me or my fellows at all, they die.<br />
<br />
By the way, shaman get away far, far better than I, little thing called wolf form, and high levels see through my stealth no problem at all. Shaman are one of the most survivable classes of all, frost shock to snare, wolf form to run and bust snare. Hell your shield alone is probably higher ac than my entire leather outfit :)<br />
<br />
Just fight in areas that are mostly controlled by your faction and you are fine, you may get ganked occasionally, everyone does, but use and listen to the defense channels and kick their asses. People get so quest crazy they get blinders on and think they have to go quest in opposition zones, that is when most of the ganking happens.<br />
<br />
Booty bay is neutral Krup, neutral faction, and it starts contested so everyone is flagged. My thinking is, perhaps they had increased their BB faction to friendly? I dunno, no biggie, the group bowed and took off. Next time I beelined for the trainer and swam up the coast to where I needed to go.</div></div><hr />

some NE hunter lvl 33 was killing off the quest npc's in and around taurajo, some lvl 15's tried to run him off but he wiped the whole lot of them.<br />
<br />
i see him running by flagged.<br />
<br />
he just got done killing Gann befor i could do a turn in .... SOB ! (keep in mind im lvl 30)<br />
<br />
i pop spirit wolf, chase him down, flag myself, hit him with flame shock, pop WF, pop LS, start swinging, land earthshock when he tries to cheeta<br />
i drop magma, SK, healing, and use my stomp, he resists, hes beating on me bad, i have to heal 3 times, i refresh LS, earthshock him again, and BAM BAM from behind his pet comes outta nowhere, i turn around, stick my meteor shard in his pets face and proc windfury 5 times ! and crit twice, pets down in a heart beart.<br />
i turn back around he killed two of my totems left the healing up, i recast, earthshock again, heal, and then he starts to try and run, he uses a potion of speed, i purge him, frost shock and i proc windfury 3 times and hes out.<br />
my health yo-yo'd alot and so did his, but i got lucky, if he was outisde my melee range i would have died a horrible death.<br />
<br />
my class is resilient, but once you get outside my weapon range, i suck, anyone with a bow and a way to snare me can pretty much kill me.<br />
<br />
i see alot of weaknesses with the shaman, one namely the spell ranges, all are at max 30 yards, and the mana costs are huge, so no spamming and the cool downs are also overlapping.<br />
<br />
the best surviving class i know so far, is a mage, frost nova, fireball, teleport, and its pretty much over for who ever is chasing them.<br />
<br />
pvp in WoW is VERY skill based, you have to know what to do and when to do it. you don't just go in spamming nukes hoping they drop befor you like people do in EQ.<br />

You're dealing with a newly released game.  Comparing pvp in WoW to pvp in EQ after numerous expansions is an unfair comparison.  Take EQ back to the first expansion, and you won't see a whole lot that's different from what you're experiencing now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Everquest PvP in 1998 was atrocious (and I'm comparing it to UO :eek: ).  Don't know how much worse it became because I left the PvP server in 1999.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dannil Farseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Last night on Frostwolf, a group of undead came poking around Lakeshire (horde seem to love this area, due to the zillions of teens running around I guess) and I got into a three-group raid that eventually ran them down, like a semi... It was only my second foray into group PvP and it was really fun. Intense, got a kill shot on some orc, pretty sweet.<br />
<br />
Of course this is still kinda offset by the 40+ shaman that two days before ganked me half-a-dozen times while I was 15 and still trying to quest the whelps.<br />
<br />
You win some, you lose some and what goes around, etc... People get too bent out of shape about PvP IMO, it drives the endless nerf calls on those horrible forums I think. Not like there's a penalty for dying, so who gives a hoot? <br />
<br />
PS - after we stomped that undead group (which reportedly took the first lone group that went after it by charming it and making its members off each other) our mini-raid turned into a 7-group affair that ended trying to raid a horde zone and instead was led into a city with a bunch 50+ elites. Was fun while it lasted though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">PvP in WoW is the most fun I've ever had in a game.  Me and four of my RL friends get in teamspeak every night and just roll through a zone, killing everything that is red.  We've only been at it for a few weeks but we already have so many great memories.  Lots of really intense fights, and lots of really funny ownings.  <br />
<br />
I have too many stories of intense battles to list, so I will share a funny one.  I think the hardest I have ever laughed at a game was last night when we were in Arathi, going down the road towards wetlands.  We run into a group of alliance coming down the road near the big stone bridge, right next to the huge waterfall.  There are four of them and two of us, but they are low 30's and we're 40 and 38 shamans, so we engage them.  We drop three of them really quickly, and then start on the last guy, who happens to be a little level 30 gnome mage.  He knows he has no chance, so he tries to escape.  His method of escape was to jump off the cliff and try to land at the pool below.  I caught him with a shock just as he was jumping off.  The shock kills him and he makes the gnome &quot;EEEEEEEEEEEEE&quot; death noise, falls about 500 feet, bounces off a rock, and splashes into the water.  Funniest thing I'd ever seen and it took me and my friend about two minutes to compose ourselves and move on.<br />
<br />
Another good one was when we were trying to get to swamp of sorrow for the first time.  This requires running from stranglethorn through duskwood, which is a level 15-30 HEAVY alliance population contested zone.  We subscribe to the &quot;red is dead&quot; philosophy, so any poor soul who happened to be coming down or fighting on the road as we passed by got a quick beatdown.  News of our crimes traveled quickly, and as we approached the Darkshire intersection, all our computers lag and our FPS drops to about 5.  When we unlag, we see literally about 60 alliance people gathered in Darkshire waiting for us.  We run like motherFers back the way that we came, and vanish off the road into the woods.  We play guerilla warfare with them, jumping out of the woods to take on small groups and stragglers, then disappearing again.  Every now and then, though, they'd get a root or long stun off and one of us would get gang mauled by about 20 little alliance players.  I think these types of battles are some of the best.  It's fun for us because it is like we are playing in god mode, and it's fun for them because I know how awesome it is to gang up on and finally kill a high level enemy.<br />

Later that night, we were in redridge mountains trying to find Badlands (turned out we went the completely wrong way) and we had a similar experience.  We were being hunted by tons of alliance, and we were camped out north of the bridge.  We are standing on a mountain over the lake when we look down and see about 20 alliance in the water trying to swim to the beach behind us and take us by surprise.  As they approach the beach, they get entangled with some murlocks and cluster up to fight them.  Once they cluster, our mage unleashes the blizzard from 500 feet up.  After it clusterscrews them for about 5 seconds, the other three of us dive off the cliff right into the middle of them, drop some fire nova totems, and kill off any stragglers.  Poor bastards never saw it coming.  Death from above has got to be one of the best rushes there is.<br />
<br />
Another great story was the Battle of Booty Bay.  We were on the boat from ratchet, and our two rogues were stealthed on the deck while the other three of us were hiding in the captain's cabin.  When the boat pulled in, the rogues report lots of alliance getting onto the boat.  The three of us charge out of the cabin and the rogues strike.  We completely roll over everyone on the boat and everyone on the docks.  It was probably the most surprised that any alliance has ever been at our ambushes, and we've ambushed a lot of them.  Unfortunately for us, we were all in our low 30's at the time and there was a level 44 alliance mage there to put a stop to our antics.  He killed us several times each as we got seperated and scrambled in this unfamiliar town.  We eventually regrouped and started stalking him.  We got up on top of a building and waited for him to come by the dock two stories underneath.  We all jump off and land right next to him and smack him down.  Mages are much easier when they don't start with a range advantage.  After taking over the town for about 15 minutes, we got all our quests and peaced out.<br />
<br />
Another thing I have noticed is that there are a LOT of high level alliance who happen to be complete idiots when it comes to PvP (why are you on a pvp server?).  Last night we were killing some elementals in Badlands, and after we'd been at the camp for about two minutes we noticed some corpses that we weren't responsible for.  We were the only horde in the zone, so we knew there was alliance about.  Then, I see a pet - one of those stupid, &quot;cute&quot; level 1 pets that will follow you around.  It is just standing up against a wall by itself, so I run up to it and drop a snare totem.  It knocks a rogue out of stealth, who quickly died.  HELLO, ROGUE, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?  This person was 47, and I don't understand how you can get that high so fast and yet still be so stupid.  The rogue came back and got their corpse as we continued hunting the elementals.  Then, get this, the genius didn't stealth after they got their corpse.  They just started running away.  Why would you do that?  You can't run from shamans.  I go into wolf form and catch up to them, and start fighting them.  They just keep running, even though the rest of my group is a good 20 seconds behind me.  I was level 40.  The rogue was level 47.  She could have EASILY killed me before my group caught up, then vanished.  Once she was dead a second time, we went on hunting elementals.  Then, after we finish one, she comes out of stealth and saps our level 35 mage.  Level 47 rogue vs level 35 mage, and she saps him.  Why?  You leave a 40 and 38 shaman enabled, and disable the least dangerous member.  Moron.  She should have sapped me, killed the mage (2 seconds tops - he has 800 hp and 200ac), and then killed the other shaman while I was still sapped.  Moron moron moron what are you doing on a pvp server.<br />
<br />
Another thing that cracks me up every time is when some low 30 alliance member, solo, charges straight into our full group of high 30's.  It's like it's Valentine's Day and he wants a card.  You wouldn't believe how often this happens.   &quot;Hmmm, they are only 8 levels higher than me, and there are only 5 of them.  I can take them!&quot;<br />
<br />
Soooo many stories, that is just the beginning.</div></div><hr />

sounds like you are having as much fun as I am. I am specced to kill and kill hard, I do not need daggers either, maces + mace stun and all the goodies, I own any warrior up to 4 levels above me, and simply maul paladins and casters, and hell everything else. I think mace rogues will get the nerf bat eventually.<br />
<br />
When do I get ym ass kicked? When I am dumb. I get complacent sometimes and forget there are people about who want me dead. I get feared into mobs a good amount of time and that is always funny. We haven't done too much group pvp yet but it is fun. I have a huge advantage in that I can pick my fights for the most part, I don't lose much because of that. Even when I lose I have to chuckle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've only had a couple of PvP experiences so far, but they were fun. First time I tried it I passed a human warrior 4 levels above me in between The Crossroads and Stonetalon. I'm a hunter so I figured &quot;What the hell, I'll give it a shot.&quot; I marked him, sent my pet in and started blasting away at him. I got him to 20% before he finished me off. Then he decides to corpse camp me. I'm impatient so I release my spirit anyway and head back to my corpse. By the time I get there, a Horde shaman has engaged the warrior standing over my corpse. So I get behind him, ressurect, and start firing away at him. After the warrior bites it, I run over and start dancing on his corpse then go on my merry way.  :D <br />
<br />
Second time I was in a group doing the eggs quest in Windshear Crag. We were happily killing spiders and collecting eggs when a night elf hunter 5 levels above our highest member decides to gank us. Taken by surprise, I went down fastly, but my group finished her off. Well, that area is a confined space so anytime she resurected we saw her and immediately jumped on her. She died 4 times before she able was to resurrect far enough away from us and get away. <br />
<br />
I personally like the PvP server setup. It keeps the gameplay fresh by having to watch out for those goody-two-shoes Alliance wankers while questing. Once the honor system is implemented, you'll probably see a lot of the griefers scale back their antics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Had my first encounter with a Rogue, Mill - was an interesting fight.<br />
<br />
I was cruising along the main east-west drag in Ashenvale on yet another quest, when a Human rogue (level 27 - 1 below me) goes trotting by me in the opposite direction, PvP flagged, just as happy as you please.  :p   I pull a 180, close on him, de-wolf, and start wailing/shocking him as I rebuff (rockbiter/lightning shield) and he just sprints off.  I rewolf (glad I shortened the cast down to 1 second with talents) and start after him.  His sprint wears off and I start gaining on him again.  I de-wolf again as I close in.  <br />
<br />
Interesting sidenote here.  In the time it took me to wolf, follow, and run-him down, he was completely healed - probably bandages - as I didn't see a health jump like a potion shows.  Are you not able to stealth while sprinting (pretty sure you can sprint if already stealthed)?  Would have helped him get away for sure.<br />
<br />
This time I Flame-DOT him as I get into range (now he stops to fight) and concentrate on staying on him with melee, earth-shocks when available (I use talents to reduce the cool-down down a second too), and keep re-applying my damage shield (51 counter-damage every other rogue attack).  At one point he managed to stun me (was that a &quot;Cheap Shot?&quot;) and attempts to get behind me for a BS, but the stun broke and I turned before he performed the move (at least it wasn't in my log).<br />
<br />
Bottom line - he was a damage-dealing blender.  The only things that probably saved me from dying were:<br />
1. I knew he was there and could plan the fight - I've seen your screenshot with 1,000= dmg single-shot.<br />
2. I had a level on him - I'm sure it helped at least a little.<br />
3. He didn't seem particularly good at his character yet - seemed like slow reaciotns compared to others I've fought.<br />
4. I took a &quot;precautionary&quot; heal potion when my health hit 50%.  I ended the fight with 1/3 health.  Turned out to be a good idea.<br />
<br />
I don't think I'll go trolling for rogues in the near future.  I'll stick with easier game like the hunters and mages out there - on PvE servers they expect everything to act like a MOB.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">That damage shield is a pain in the ass in duels. When you get mail you gonna be even more tough. I am really cautious with heal pots, get alot of them pickpocketing. You can stealth while sprinting yes.<br />

Personally I am glad I don't have to face shaman in real pvp, pallies are tough enough to take down.<br />

My brother and I, he a 28 rouge and me a 30 Shaman, were in Ashenvale doing a quest and fighting a mob when a stealthed Rogue started deciced to party. He was only 24 but got me stunned quick and was very, very good at spinning and being a pain in the ass. My brother wore him down to about half life when the rogue killed him, I came out of stun and was able to get a Frost shock on him. Well, his day was done after that. But the funny thing is, there was a 30 Hunter that came along and started to shoot his little arrows at me. Well, I ran after him, snared his pet and gave him a good thrashing with nukes and mace. He decided to melee with me which was very silly. It was such a rush I hoped that they came back for more!</div></div><hr />

I have seen the paladin bait strategy a few times now. Paladin sits in the middle of the road while his buddies hide and wait for your attack. We counter bait by having a tank out of range grab his attantion and ill sneak in and lead with a earth shock while the tank charges the pally. We normally have the pally dead before the his friends can get close.<br />

This hasn't happened to me yet as I typically play insanely early EST when no one is on or I'm w/ my crew in an instance and the gankers can't get to us.

<br />
Yeah, I tend to agree with you Iz.  It has been amazing to me how much PvP goes on on a PvE server.  Kind of mind boggling.  I was totally shocked the first time I saw a flagged Alliance player running through the Barrens.  If they wanted to battle the Alliance or Horde, why didn't they play on a PvP server?  I have basically learned to ignore the Local Defense channel.  I guess people want to level up in peace when possible (ignoring griefing exploits), and then PvP when they choose.  Maybe they're just anxious for the battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
And I think the charm spell that priests get only works on mobs up to level 35, but I could be wrong, so yeah, the griefers only do it to gank someone lower than them I'm sure.  The AE thing is unfortunate, I hope Blizzard fixes some of this.</div></div><hr />

I'd be interested in how many times you've personally been forced into non-consensual PvP by these &quot;exploits.&quot;  I have played since last June under the current PvP-flagging rules (with some minor adjustments) and haven't once been duped into triggering my own flag (we won't go into the 2 times I inadvertently flagged myself and got owned for being an idiot!).  These &quot;urban legends&quot; are all well and good, but I sure haven't seen signs of rampant non-consensual PvP going on (not like UO was back in 96-98!).  I just don't see it happening.  The closest thing to griefing I've seen are little dirtbags that try to ninja-skin some of your mob drops.  Big deal - my own horde-mates do that to me too and I'll NEVER be able to kill them!  :p <br />

I'd be interested how much PvE it takes to amaze you.  Next time you're in the Barrens, do a /who barrens to see how many folks are there, then count the PvP flagged ones you see. Does that number between 0 and 2 out of 100+ really &quot;amaze you?&quot;   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
As for seeing someone flagged running through a zone - big whoop!  There are so many ways that can happen (/f, kill a &quot;flagged&quot; npc, heal a flagged buddy, kill an opponent that was already flagged, etc) who cares if someone is running around flagged.  If you want to kill him then go for it.  If you don't want to do PvP, then ignore him.  Either way it just shouldn't matter.  :)</div></div><hr />

And no, I don't do a /who to see how many.  But on Silver Hand there are organized raids of 40-50 if not more that engage in PvP quite often.

3 times, all in closed beta.  I'll take the blame on 2 of them for &quot;user error&quot;, third was a bug.  I'm not in contested areas yet and for the reasons above this hasn't yet happened to me.  Apparently it's happened to a fair number of people in the 30+ page thread I linked.  If it happens once it's too much- I do not want to PVP under any circumstances.  So long as it's my decision to PVP, not the ganklords', I'm happy.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Thought I would share a story:<br />
<br />
(cut-n-pasted from an email to my buddies.  I was lvl 26 at the time.)<br />
<br />
On Saturday I was back in Ashenvale and I ran across a 25 rogue who<br />
was all by himself fighting mobs.  I immediately decided to gank his<br />
ass.  I went catform and prowled around behind him as he was<br />
fighting...tried to right click and attack but it didn't work.<br />
Previously I had read that attacking a PvP flagged player would flag<br />
you, but apparently they changed it so you now have to turn your own<br />
flag on first.<br />
<br />
So I right click a few times, nothing.  Damn now I'm getting nervous<br />
and he sees me just 2 feet behind him.  I remember that &quot;/f&quot; was a<br />
shortcut for /pvp so I try that a couple times...Nothing.  I'm getting<br />
frantic at this time, the element of surprise is gone and he's<br />
starting to maneuver around me.   Finally I &quot;/pvp&quot; and immediatly open<br />
with a special attack.<br />
<br />
His PvP flag had wore off.<br />
<br />
Damn.  Now I'm the one who is flagged PvP all by myself in the middle<br />
of nowhere...  I give him a few seconds to see if he is going to flag<br />
but he is at 40% health.  I decide that I need to find a nice quiet<br />
spot to wait out the 5 minutes so I get off the main path and find a<br />
spot to pull a few mobs.  The mob is higher level than me so it's a<br />
decent fight when lo and behold I see an invisible rogue sneaking<br />
around near me.  Guess he was pissed that I tried to ruin his day.<br />
<br />
He gets the jump on me (although he waited until I had killed the mob)<br />
and immediatly starts shredding my health.  In the 20 second fight I<br />
managed to root him and back away.  Heal nuke nuke reroot nuke etc.<br />
He breaks root and gets close and stuns me.  I see him moving around<br />
to my backside and I'm sure this is the end.  I manage to live through<br />
the backstab and I spin around and start in with the beatstick.  He<br />
almost had me but a well timed heal potion turned the table.  He died<br />
and I was left at ~20% health and mana.  My heart was racing but I <br />
was whooping it up at home.  :)<br />
<br />
The graveyard was right across the road and I knew that he would be<br />
able to run back 15 seconds or so...Even freshly rez'd he'd have more<br />
health/mana than me so I high tailed it into the hills to rest up.<br />
The hills were full of dead ends (which were full of  lvl 30 spiders)<br />
so I ended up running around frantically trying to out race monsters.<br />
By the time I was patched up and back to the spot the rogue was gone.</div></div><hr />
