<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi.<br />
<br />
I bought Advanced Healing Gift 3 yesterday, which is ~16% chance to land an exceptional heal.<br />
<br />
Healing Gift 1 = 3%<br />
Healing Gift 2 = 6%<br />
Healing Gift 3 = 10%<br />
<br />
I *believe* that's how it works.<br />
<br />
Then:<br />
Advanced Healing Gift 1 = additional 2%<br />
Advanced Healing Gift 2 = additional 2%<br />
Advanced Healing Gift 3 = additional 2%<br />
<br />
So 16%.  That means roughly 1 in 6 casts should be a crit heal.  This is also a 21-AA point expenditure.  In the last 2 nights that I've played, I've accumulated about 4-6 hours of playtime, mostly xp'ing.  One night I was *the* main healer for 2  hours or so in CoD and last night I was supplemental healer in OOW zone for another 2-3 hours.<br />
<br />
During this entire time, I had exactly *two* crit heals.  I casted my spam heal, I'm guessing, in the ball-park of 200 times minimum during this time.  At one point I was casting it even if the person was only 80% health, just to see if it would crit.<br />
<br />
2 times.  that is like....  1% chance to crit.<br />
<br />
Anyone else noticed this crap?  I hardly think that's the &quot;RNG&quot; dinging me hard... I mean it could be, but then I heard the cleric in my group say &quot;damn I'm not crit'ing very often.&quot;<br />
<br />
I plan on /bug'ing this when I get home, just in case something got jacked...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I swear the RNG works by checking the target's hitpoints - if they are almost full (due to another's heal landing right before yours), then you have an 90% change of a critical heal, otherwise, it's about 5%. &lt;grin&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya bad luck. I get crits quite often.  It's really nice since i can crit for over 5100 now =)</div></div><hr />
