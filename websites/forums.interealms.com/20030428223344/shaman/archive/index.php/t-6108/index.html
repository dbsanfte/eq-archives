<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious what prices some of you have sold for.<br />
<br />
10 stacks of port potions<br />
<br />
10 stacks of the +10 to all saves potion<br />
<br />
10 stacks Stinging wort<br />
<br />
10 stacks damageshield potions<br />
<br />
10 stacks of the +level to the level of the spell caster<br />
<br />
10 stacks of the gimp breeze potions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">10 stacks of port potions  - 3kpp have only sold to barb smiths who need to go to Halas and a few Iskar.  Thurg gate potion ended the market for gates for the most part. <br />
<br />
10 stacks of the +10 to all saves potion - never sold<br />
<br />
10 stacks Stinging wort - 1k, a few of my enchanter friends love these<br />
<br />
10 stacks damageshield potions - 1k, I make these all the time, but usually just pass them out on guild raids<br />
<br />
10 stacks of the +level to the level of the spell caster - never sold<br />
<br />
10 stacks of the gimp breeze potions - never sold on bazaar mule only sold one batch to a wiz who gave me 5k and bought all materials to make 4 10 shots, took about 80 combines at skill 170.<br />
<br />
<br />
In summary:<br />
<br />
None of these potions sell, although the effects are situationally useful.  The high end players who may use them seem to be in guilds with shaman who will make for free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Prices I see in the bazaar on The Nameless:<br />
<br />
10 stack ports = 3K<br />
10 stack +10 saves = never seen for sale<br />
10 stack stinging wort = never seen for sale<br />
10 stack Skin Flame = 450<br />
single dose Mystical Apititude = 200 (way cheap...)<br />
10 stack Breeze potions = never seen for sale</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">10 charge port potions - 2500p<br />
10 charge Skin of Flame - 450p<br />
<br />
Other than the grow potion, none of the Luclin potions sell. I have some up for sale since luclin came out... And I didnt make that many of them back then.<br />
<br />
Some idiot has been trying to sell 10 charge skin of flame potions for 350p this week. Hopefully he will go bankrupt soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm just about the only person on Bristlebane that makes Stinging Wort potions for sale.  5-dose potions sell just about as fast as I get them in stock.<br />
<br />
Everything else I do alchemically is special order or for my own amusement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll try making Stinging Wort for the bazaar-<br />
<br />
After I've made a 10shot for myself<br />
After I've made a 10shot for my guild<br />
After I've gotten 60 :)<br />
<br />
So in other words, the time it takes to get those giant toes makes it a pain :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, yes it is =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I make skin flame pots for a guild mate that has screwy playtimes and likes to solo with his paladin.  He buys 10-20 stacks from me at a time.<br />
<br />
I sell to him at 325p per stack and still make 40p per stack profit.  Selling them in the bazaar for 350p would be even more money to me and would hardly make me bankrupt.  :)<br />
<br />
Of course, I am beyond the trivial point for them... when I was first skilling up 325p was break even for me... but that's where we established the price.  This guy actually funded about 20 skill increases for me AND I made a profit since.  He's happy because he pays 100p+ less per stack and at the quantities that he buys, that's a lot of money for him.</div></div><hr />
