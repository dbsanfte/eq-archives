<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To all of you high level shaman who like a fun challenge - give this one a try. This is not about uber lewt or fast AAs, this is about a fun challenge.<br />
<br />
Solo your way to the Deranged Underbulk camp in The Deep, and camp your Levitation spell.<br />
<br />
I have been playing around with doing this. Ultimately my attempt (to solo this) failed however, as a 61 warrior friend of mine wanted to come along. We found it very easy with 65 Shaman + 61 Warrior, and I scribed my spell last night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ive done this a few times now, 4 to be exact. i have yet to see my poor spell drop. wondering how rare this spell is and how rare the guy that drops it is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">4 times without seeing the spell? /comfort.. You've had some bad luck, it seems, unless the drop rate has changed. Almost every time I've helped kill the deranged underbulk, he's dropped it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Could you describe the route to him please ? might try this later as Im sick of running out of batwings at embarrasing times :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Take your first right, and then your first left after that. He spawns in the dead end that you reach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Talthos_</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">check the new Reasearch lists posted in the forums for EQtraders.com.<br />
<br />
Levitation is now able to be done using research (its listed under enchanter spells)</div></div><hr />

Research is nice and all , but you have to admit , there is something aout going and killing a mob for the spell that has a draw to it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Research is a nice thought, but I've been trying to assemble the parts for this spell, and after all this searching, I probably would have made more AA and cash by camping the underbulk.</div></div><hr />
