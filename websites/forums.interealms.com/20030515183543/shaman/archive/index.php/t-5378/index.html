<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(I am going on the assumption if you are reading this you know about the first Halas shaman necklace ie. Initiate symbol of the tribunal.)<br />
<br />
Well, I love finding quests so I have devoted a large portion of time trying to find quests instead of hunting exp, I beleive I have stumbled apone something that would suggest the 2nd quest is in the game.  When you are doing the first quest you have to turn a note into a guard at the bank, if you read what he says to you he mentions that there are rumors about a northman fugitive hiding inside of qeynos.  When you talk to the Main shaman guild (the lady at the very back) she talks about hunting down fugitives, if you say you are a new member she sends you out to the everfrost to kill O'gill, if you say you are a standing member of the court, she says there is no news of any new fugitives and she prays that no news arrives (but as the banker said there is rumors of a new guy in qeynos).  This is a fair assumption, but what really makes me belive this is the second quest is that if you turn in any random item into her she hands it back with the typical **I don't want this** reply, but if you hand her your first necklace, she eats it.  If you hand that same necklace to anyone else, they give it back.  Just figured Iifanyone else that is interested in finding the next tribunal necklaces could use this info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Am not aware of the 1st necklace. Can you post it please or tell me where I can find it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The second hasn't been in yet.  The Gannin O'Gill part has been in since the beginning - reward is a lvl 9 spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol maybe the 2nd part is topar and thats y the drop rate stinks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As far as I have noticed the second and third Barbarian shaman necklace quests havent been implimented to date (and I check every patch :-P ). The quest that is asking you to search for O'Gills head can be found here :<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=229<br />
The resulting reward is a copy of Spirit of the Bear (it was how I got my copy WAAAAYYYY back in the day).<br />
As to those of you that arent aware of the Initiate Symbol quest, it can be found here:<br />
http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=749<br />
The result is a nice neck slot considering the effort; its also a good faction quest for those looking for such things, it can be done with sneak and garners nice faction hits for very little work (my bard went from apprehensive to amiable in around an hour).<br />
For non-twinks or pure players the hammer that the necklace summons is actually useful till something better can be found (or a nice spear comes your way).<br />
/rant on<br />
Most other religons have their 2nd and 3rd symbols completed, noteably the Dwarf Cleric one (the second right clicks summon beer, how cool is that?) and the Tunare 3rd symbol right clicks Grasping Roots, and all you Troll Shammies out there know that yours right clicks Clinging Darkness (one reason I wish I had played a Troll...but that is another argument). Come on VI, give us some equal time here, I really am sick of some classes/races getting these nice quests and other basically getting left out in the cold (hehe no pun intended there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
At FanFaire Boston, the Tradeskills guy said the creator of the Tribunal Initiate quest no longer works for Verant.<br />
<br />
Most of these type of culture/religion specific quests are put into the game by employees working in their spare (unpaid) time, simply for love of the game.  If our guy left, there was no one to pick up the Tribunal quest mantle for us.  Which is why we've been out in the cold (sic) for so long.<br />
<br />
Our best shot was for newbie quests integrating into Halas.<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
I'm not defending Verant (I want the quest series to continue too), but I am pointing out reality with the company.  Verant has their priorities for paid development of new content, and this simply isn't one of them.  If an employee who loves the Tribunal donates some of his free time, that would be great &amp; they'd let him do the work.  But I wouldn't expect it any time soon. :(<br />
<br />
(Oh, yeah, this volunteer would need to have the technical skills to do it, or bum a major favor from a coder in order to make it happen if he/she didn't have the skills to do it solo.)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kanad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your post made me curious, and as such I tried giving my initiate necklace to Margyn McCann once more (having done it once just after the code for returning unwanted items went in).<br />
<br />
She handed it back to me and sent me on my way.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">about a year ago I made a hot key with the key phrase of the other disciple quests &quot;I am an initiate&quot; and spamed every NPC I could think of. No answer. So I guess it's just not there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">heh, clinging darkness bites man.  Trust me, I wish I'd worshiped Cazic Thule (and may remake him to do that), since his click for panic animal, spook the dead, and hopefully the 3rd will click for FEAR!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did some mad kobold slaying and am now amiable to Paineel.<br />
I stuck to the Initiate CT necklace with spook the dead, handier imo. I can fear kite 2/3 spectres in Oasis at the same time (not that that is more efficient than killing em one by one, but its a good ego booster ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">gotta love those fear-clickers!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Keldain Silvermyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It *is* rather amusing how the seemingly most popular shaman race, as well as a VERY popular warrior race, has precious little in the way of ANY questing.. near nothing for newbies at all, near nothing for class-specifics, forget about diety-based...<br />
<br />
Average city has 35+ quests that start there, all newbie gear ones consolidated into listing as one quest each, not 1 for each item, and Halas has a raging 22, for everyone...many of those being purely for faction work for others.</div></div><hr />
