<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am comming back to EQ after a year away and am going to start out fresh, new server (prexus) and with no twinking.<br />
<br />
I have always liked shaman and this time I will be 2-boxing so I have been trying to think of what melee class to play.<br />
<br />
At first I was thinking shaman/monk, but then I found out that monks have been hit pretty hard with nerfs so I am not sure about that option.  <br />
<br />
What melee would you pair up with your shaman ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think its all your preference, personsonally, if i started over, i would probably take beastlord, because you can send their pet in to attack and not really pay attention to them if the situation gets hairy and let the shaman do his job, later on the have decent hp buffs to add to yours as well as mana.<br />
<br />
I would also say rangers are great if geared right, good dps, DS, also buffs that stack with sham buffs, plus the snare would be great for root/rotting and archery in the end, now that i say that, i love that possibility, having a mob all dotted up and snared with the sham, and bowing him down while the shaman meds, i can't really think of much else now, its to early in the morning, but i'll try to post more later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ranger no question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can duo well with any melee except a rogue, really.  A rogue duo is doable but not really practical, and it requires a lot more effort, especially if two-boxing.<br />
<br />
At level 65, I would rather duo with an SK than any other melee.  They can hold aggro over your dots without trouble, their damage is significantly better than a paladin, and they bring snare and FD to a group.  A well geared and AA'd ranger can tank fine in pop, but it will take a while to get him to that stage.  Same thing for monks, except they will have trouble holding aggro.  It is rare that I see a monk tanking any more.  Beastlords are like monks except they don't mitigate as well (I think), but have an easier time holding aggro.  Warriors and Paladins do just fine, but I prefer SK.<br />
<br />
On the way to 65, though, you can do just fine with any melee partner.  Monks aren't as great as they used to be, but mobs damage output is still pretty gimpy so they can handle it.  They bring great damage and FD, so they're still perfectly viable.  SKs and Paladins will do fine, but their damage is pretty crappy.  Warrior will do ok.  Ranger will work pretty well if you have decent gear on him.  Beastlord would be great, but in my experience two boxing a bst (my only alt is a bst) there are just too many spells that you need to cast to play both characters to their full potential, which makes twoboxing a pain.<br />
<br />
So, basically, just pick whichever melee class you think is the coolest and play that.  It is pretty easy to make any duo work when one of the characters is a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like the idea of shaman/ranger, only problem is I will be playing untwinked so I wont have great gear, seems ranger is kinda gear dependant.  I might give this combo a try though as I like the possibilities with snare, dots, and bow for sure!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gazlal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's not all that gear dependent for a ranger to tank, as long as you go for hps and ac rather than straight stats.  Especially with shaman slows, they do just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Try Gloriana's helpful links in The Medicine Cabinet section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the advice, I read the threads linked in the medicine cabinet and I am liking the idea of SK/Shaman duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Laranu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would have to agree, at 65 I'd choose a SK over any other melee to duo with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Screw melee..take a necro.  Me and a guildie necro have dueced some pretty big stuff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Meladrak Doushi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I duoed with a lot of beast lords through out my leveling experience.  Beastlords DO mitigate better then a monk (20% better if I remember the parsing right) because they have the same armor / relatively same ac but the monk mitigation penalty doesn't apply to them.<br />
<br />
I think duoing with a necro would be pretty awesome too.  My guildies once told me that a bard is nice as well.  But with a bard your going to be doing a lot of work and that is probably not good for 2-boxing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Why prexus?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like a beastlord.  You can duo BoT minis with pet tanking and both beastlord and shaman healing.  Plus with a beastlord you can be garantueed everything is slowed early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>slitherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I play a shamman and fiance plays a ranger, best dou we have found.<br />
I tank and she lights them up with her bow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not many rangers can effectively tank tier 2 mobs, and even with bow aa's the world is still full of summoning mobs that neither of you could tank.<br />
I'd definately go with sk/pally/war in that order without a doubt.<br />
<br />
And remember there is no auto attack for a bow /shudder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Prexus is a good choice to start off on imho as it's one of the older servers (June '99), and so the economy is nice and saturated.  Being highly populated is a bonus at 45+, because it means you'll always be able to get KEI.  Because of the extreme tilt towards high levels on Prexus, simple tradeskill items that you can pharm at low levels actually sell quite well in the bazaar.  It takes a while to bootstrap yourself on any server, but an older server will generally be far easier to do so on than a younger one.  FWIW, I thought trying out Stromm, while refreshing, was rather painful, because there weren't enough high level people with unholy amounts of cash to buy pitifully easy-to-obtain items like spider silk, and low quality animal hides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best response I have seen so far, as Rangers ARE NOT TANKS. Yes yes everyone knows the ranger with PoTime gear that can tank but that person is a rare exception. <br />
<br />
&quot; Mr Ranger,<br />
Just because you can take agro from the warrior doesnt mean you should, please dont snare the incoming mob and use jolt the cleric running OOM will thank you&quot;  -Slob    (58 War. D-Ro)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Rangers CAN tank Tier2/3 mobs.  My main is a ranger and I tanked PoV when I had 5800 HP and CA1 only.  The key to a ranger tanking in any PoP zones is having them using a 2hander and not duel weld.  Duel weld increases damage taken by a ranger by almost 50%.  (I calculated this on PoJ Rats/Sentrys, using ToxAxe/Swiftwind for duel weld and Windblade w/ SCHW for haste for a 2hander, DPS done was the same).  Now I have 6500 HP (no VT/Elem gear), CA3/LR2 and can tank just fine in any Tier 2/3 zones and also have tanked BoT wing bosses.  As long as the ranger has decent gear (all droppable gear is not decent gear) and uses a 2hander they can tank in pop just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">65 shaman, retired my 60 monk with 18 AA's when the monk nerf hit.  Unless a monk gets really really good gear, he is not the tank he used to be.  In PoP, groups often dissolve unless you have a plate tank.<br />
<br />
Tried warrior, but I missed the FD power of a monk, and liked the idea of having better aggro than a warrior gives, and having snare, the one spell I most wished my shaman had.  So I made an SK, and really love him.<br />
<br />
I put him in cultural armor, and at level 58 he has 218 stamina unbuffed without any AA(except runspeed 2).  He's an ogre, and almost any buffs put him at maxed STA and STR.  <br />
<br />
I love the flexibility!  He can snare pull and then someone can pull the mob separated away from the slow mob who also charges in while he FD's, or he can wait for the other mobs to re-set and lose aggro, then pop up and still have plenty of aggro on the snared mob(SK snares are also very aggrolicious DOT's) and get it as a single.  There's a good deal of flexibility.  SK's also have very very fast DD spells, so you can take quick advantage if you see a sudden opening to aggro something.  The combination of FD pulling and snaring is a powerful one that you can really play with.  Sometimes I pull with the shaman, sometimes with the SK; sometimes I root the pull, sometimes I don't; a lot of flexibility.<br />
<br />
He doesn't put out the damage my monk did, but he could be buffed to  255 sta/str in his low 20's and at 52 he had more HP than my monk did with natural durability AA's !  Holey moley.  His damage is still fine, and he has the wonderful ability to use lifetaps to keep his health high even without my help, or, since healing him is no probably at all with quintessence, he can use his mana taps to keep his mana very high, letting him cast DD's and snares and dots.<br />
<br />
My monk used to sometimes have a devil of a time getting aggro even though he was well equipped;  my SK almost never loses aggro.  This lets me canni away peacefully and happily while he does his business, and do my DOT's or DD's as much as I like.  Could not do that with monk; my shaman could DD with him, but DOT's were much more of a problem.<br />
<br />
Also, although I lost a bit of damage output with the SK, perhaps, I gained snare, a great deal of flexibility, a character with BOTH invis and ITU, I kept the FD power, and got a character who can do a lot of interesting things and even has a second weakie pet to add to the equation, plus a nice harmtouch to deal with those jerks who like to try to KS mobs.  And as an ogre, unlike my monk, he's not stunnable from the front, so he's not about to lose aggro due to being stunned.<br />
<br />
Further, SK's can get one of the best items in the game, and I really do love it -- the circlet of shadow, which casts invis instantly; you can even have it drop or click it right in front of mobs and have it re-invis you without them detecting it.  They can also lev, and anyone can get run3 or jboots, so this is a melee toon who can get around very very easily.<br />
<br />
Rangers are very powerful, but they're like bards sometimes in that they spend so much effort trying to show how powerful they are that they become mana sinks and screw everything up.  Really, if they would just stop getting the cleric summoned, everyone would be a lot better off.  <br />
Rangers are extremely far from good tanks these days; their uberness comes from their bows and utility spells like snare.  <br />
<br />
If you are with a shaman duoing, you want someone who can first of all get high aggro but also can tank.  Leaving aside pride-based arguments and elemental-based armor and weapons, ranger fills only one of those two necessary abilities; monk only one of those, warrior only one of those(and is entirely too dependent on a very few weapons in the game to hold taunt well), SK both, pally both, rogue only one, BL sometimes both but too complicated and you might need to root a lot.  Necro is very strong but he won't be pulling any aggro off the shaman without taking a good chance of dying.  Bard playing songs and shaman playing at his max is just much too much for the average or even really sharp player.  The bards I know who duo mostly play their bard and the other toon contributes minimally.<br />
<br />
The shaman is flexible and powerful enough to cover up for toons that don't quite fit in with him, though, so no choice will really be a terrible one.  Of my 60 monk, 52 warrior, 54 druid, and 58 SK, I'd have to say that both my personal experience and reasoning point pretty clearly to the SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">if you want your shaman to be a pansy caster.. then SK or pally is a good duo partner.. SK for a bit better damage.. pally for extra hells and stun..<br />
<br />
if you want your shaman to be tanking.. then rogue or ranger is a good duo partner.. either is good here, i dont remember the specifics of damage between them.. but its more a choice of preferance here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">SK.  If you want to be able to fight a smaller variety of stuff but have a bigger safety margin, Pally.  If you want to be able to fight even less stuff, but be a macho tanking shaman regardless of how much of an inefficient pain in the ass it is, rogue or ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ueauvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">rangers can tank we are just intelligent using our bows<br />
<br />
if a ranger has a 2h then you are fine.  Course having CA3 LR5 helps.  But with a ranger you know that they will have aggro you can slow on the inc, the mob is snared for 11 mins (2 for SK)?  Rangers can root park etc harmony pull, invis etc  Then add in the bow<br />
<br />
do what you feel comfortable but dont take the view rangers cant tank, even with 1617 ac buffed and LR4 i still get hit, so do most classes.<br />
<br />
the advantage of a ranger 2h versus an sk 2h is that a ranger will have better dps and hit the mob :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">SK is probably the overall strongest choice, but I'd be highly tempted by the paladin. His buffs stack with yours. He can stun to interrupt casters easily, which a shaman cannot do. His DPS is good (if not great) with a good 2h weapon. But most importantly, he can rez. And at higher levels he gets pretty good exp rez's. That'd matter to me if I wanted freedom to duo in out of the way places. <br />
<br />
It's still damn hard to pass up FD and snare with the SK, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I duo a 65 Shaman/65 monk combo. It works well for the most part and pulling with a monk is godly when you know what you're doing. <br />
<br />
However is I had to do it over I'd probably go shaman/sk You get real tanking abilities, still have FD for single pulling, Windblade can put you in the same damage range as most non uber monks and SNARE is the name of god on the lips of dungeon crawlers everywhere. <br />
<br />
Lately I've been finding less and less reason to log in my monk as opposed to just my shaman. Groups are easier to find and unless you're in need of a split puller (ie. no cleric or chanter to pacify and you're not in a LDON dungeon) there just isn't much point. Maybe if they ever get around to rebalancing the pure melees...but I won't be holding my breath.</div></div><hr />
