Superior Immobilzation -- same as our greater immobilze but -25 harder to resist<br />
<br />
Level 67 Clinging Drowsiness -- Slows an already slowed mob 2% extra to a max of 75%... Hence if a monster resists slow 50% such that tugurs is 37.5% -- each shaman casting this would add 2% to the slow -- IE 5 extra shamen = 47.5% slowed.<br />
<br />
Spirit of the swift -- 65% speed increase single spell with +40 atk.<br />
<br />
Talisman of Celerity -- like talisman of alacrity but 10% more haste -- slightly longer duration...<br />
<br />
Primal regrowth -- like regrowth only 50hp/tick on the party..<br />
<br />
Saryn's Spear -- 1500 damage DD poison... same casting speed as our other poison DD same ratio as vellium strike.<br />
<br />
Level 68 Insidious Tigirs -- AE slow max 60%(at 70th level) same as tigirs with a -30 to the resist...<br />
<br />
Ferine spirit -- summons a dog that is 3 levels higher than our level 61 pet with 25% more hit points that hits for a max of 75.<br />
<br />
Talisman of the griffon -- gives +55 sta and +55 agility in one buff slot to the party...<br />

Spray of Saryn -- 3 rounds of 850 damage rain... <br />

Level 69 Undefendable plague of Bertox -- 120 per tick 3 minute Dot with a -300 to the resist.<br />
<br />
Superior bear form -- +5 to regen +5 to magic regen +200 to mana pool...<br />
<br />
Focus of the eighth -- +500 more hp than focus of the 7th -- 2 hour duration -- otherwise the same.<br />
<br />
Tnargs touch -- 2000 point heal -- 3.0 second cast time.<br />
<br />
Level 70 Talisman of the swift -- as spirit of the swift but group<br />
<br />
Talisman of the ferine -- as ferine avatar but group..<br />
<br />
Talisman of Quessence -- Casts Que on every member of your party...<br />
<br />
Reverse Ferine -- -140 to all stats and -140 atk on your target for 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
This is my guess and yes I posted it in the wishlist section but it sort of was buried in there...  <br />
<br />
Personally I think we should get the whole list together in its best form and post it somewhere sony will look at it... The reason is whatever they do without any input will possibly be worse than what I have shown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of it looks pretty good, but:<br />

Level 67 Clinging Drowsiness -- Slows an already slowed mob 2% extra to a max of 75%... Hence if a monster resists slow 50% such that tugurs is 37.5% -- each shaman casting this would add 2% to the slow -- IE 5 extra shamen = 47.5% slowed.<br />
<br />
Won't happen.  Mobs are designed with their mitigation as it is for a reason.  To allow a mob to be slowed from the 37.5% it was designed at all the way back to 75% by zerging it with tons of shaman would defeat and trivialize many encounters.<br />
<br />
Everyone still gets all pissy about mitigation, but no one seems to grasp that partial mitigation is a GOOD thing.   Mobs are designed to be fought in their slowed state.  So if they want a mob to do 1000 DPS when slowed, if its not a mob that can mitigate then it must do 4000 DPS when unslowed, which means some top end mobs would kill tanks and half the raid near instantly when pulled.   Having a mob that mitigates to only 20% slowable, means that the mob is doing only 1250 DPS when unslowed.  Which makes the intial period after pulling while debuffing harder but manageable.</div></div><hr />

wont happen ..... cripple anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Superior Bear Form doesn't work either.  Need a better name--something like . . .<br />
<br />
Form of Non-Inbred Bear<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />

<br />
Re-name to something else. Focus of the Seventh was used regarding the Seventh Hammer. Focus of the Ten perhaps, the Rathe council? Also needs single target at level 67?<br />
<br />
Talisman of the griffon -- gives +55 con and +55 agility in one buff slot to the party... <br />
<br />
+con.... I assume you mean Stamina? (Constitution, too many Baldurs Gate games!) I like the name!<br />
<br />
Superior Immobilzation -- same as our greater immobilze but -25 harder to resist <br />
<br />
We already have a -magic check on Petrifying Earth. Do you mean this for cast speed?<br />
<br />
Improved Invisibility -- About time... <br />
<br />
Also wont happen. Consistently hear from FF go'ers that shamans were never meant to have invis in the first place. <br />
<br />
Some other good ideas. I like the Insidious Tigirs one alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Watching EQ's inability to reason, I'd have to say that the following level 70 spells are most likely to be added:<br />
<br />
Beastlord - 99% resurrection (Paragon of the b******t or something)<br />
Cleric - 2500 hp buff<br />
Druid - Plane of Time port (No level / key nerf)<br />
Wizard - 10,000 dd nuke (unresistable of course)<br />
Warrior - Superior Avatar and Spirit of Cheetah proc (No refresh timers)<br />
Rogue - AE backstab for 32,000 dd<br />
Enchanter - 95% slow + tash (unresistable, no matter what)<br />
Paladin - 7500 heal<br />
Mage - DC to level 80 (Quarm says 'Attacking an orc pawn, master')<br />
Bard - 900% run speed indoor selos + invulnerability<br />
Necromancer - Cheaper more profitable version of Alchemy<br />
Shadowknight - 10 second refresh on harmtouch<br />
Ranger - 5 hour true shot buff (group v2)<br />
<br />
Shaman - hmmmm, how about group grow spell (group v1) + 40% charisma! (Quest spell involving alot of raids and several tradeskills at 200+)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL i can only agree it is getting a bit out of hands now, but if bards get a upgrade to selo, im quitting my shaman....<br />

is it a horse...no,is it a firebolt....... no, ahhh its a bard<br />
<br />
and it have to be on a PvP server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok first off -- I really think clinging drowsiness is needed -- It would give a reason to have more than a couple of shaman on a raid... I dont think you would have a huge zerg force of shamen(for one they dont exist in most guilds, for another each would take up a buff slot on the mob and the mob only has 35)...  <br />
<br />
As for the +con gaffe I replaced it(thank you edit key) and it is more from asherons call and AD&amp;D that I think of con rather than stamina.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will never happen.  You don't even want us to have it.  Because if we did SOE would just design mobs to hit faster so as to REQUIRE numerous stacked slows to get it back to their designed goal. They aren't going to let you over slow a mob that they designed to hit a certain rate. Which means you'll have to recruit even more shaman.  And yes, guilds will get a zerg force of shaman if that happened.  They'll add as many shaman as can be stacked.  And if they limit how many you can stack that just makes shaman do nothing but each cast slow instead of doing things like DoTs, Nukes, and Heals that we do now.  Sorry, but I don't want to see every shaman having to slow each boss.  We won't gain anything out of it as far as advantage on mobs, we'll just have to do extra casting.<br />
<br />
Look what Cloud of Grummus did to Seru and Emporer.  Made them both a joke of an encounter compared to what they were designed at.  Seru, the badass of Luclin was nearly one groupable when that spell came out.  No way would they allow you to do that to a brand new mob in their new expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">all we need is two lvl 70 spells<br />
<br />
Hammer of Kunark: 75% slow, -500 AC, -500 ATK, -500 str, - 100 MR, PR, FR, CR; unresistable<br />
Power of Kunark: +1000 HP, +100 AC, +200 ATK, selo speed, group/mgb-able, 2h duration <br />
<br />
Then we'd made up for the last 4 expansions.<br />
Too bad that Sony's shaman special would be 5000 mana for both spells, since we'd got too good a mana regen as it is :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm...I bet we'd get something like a better version of the group charisma spell...and people would try to sell it to us for 20k.<br />
<br />
And we'd probably get another single target upgrade to focus that has an even shorter duration with the group version coming another 3 levels later.<br />
<br />
/em grumbles<br />
<br />
On a semi-serious note...I'm just approachging 65 and the financial punishment of spells at these levels...I could wait a long while before the level cap is pushed!  8)</div></div><hr />
