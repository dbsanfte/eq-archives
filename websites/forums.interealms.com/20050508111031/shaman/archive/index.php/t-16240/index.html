<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>teccumseh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My wife began playing EQ before I did, purchasing the original game with her new Sony computer.  Online gaming was new to both of us, and I became hooked while helping her play. My wife created a female paladin and we both began playing that character together.  I noticed that I was uncomfortable playing a female character and quickly started a new account for myself with all male characters.  My wife chided my about this saying that it didn't make any difference (although she has no male characters).  <br />
<br />
Now that various sites are selling equipment and characters for money, it seems that an equally good female character is cheaper to buy than its male counterpart.  While I have no intention of buying any character, I found it interesting that someone would spend more money to get something of equal value based on sex. It would indicate that players become very attached to their character.<br />
<br />
What do you think of this.  <br />

Nathan Cochrane has a post today summarizing and selectively quoting a study of the costs of avatars on Everquest by economist Edward Castronova. <br />
<br />
Castronova finds that female avatars experience about a 20 percent discount compared to male avatars offered for sale on auction sites. Bilskirnir selectively quotes Castronova as saying that this might be a case of sexism from the real world making its way into the online world. <br />
<br />
But Cochrane leaves out the obvious, simplest explanation that Castronova does, to his credit mention, <br />
<br />
Alternatively, it may simply be the case that the EverQuest player base, which is primarily single, male, and aged 18-29, prefers to have a male external appearance rather than a female external appearance.<br />
According to Castronova, the player base for Everquest is almost 93 percent male. It isn't exactly shocking that in a MMORPG with is almost entirely male that there is more demand for male avatars than for female avatars.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always play male Characters. Anything else would feel creepy to me.<br />
