<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarconus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im not sure how to put my feelings into words but i will try my best.<br />
<br />
As you may already know i have deguilded myself and my Alts from KoE. Koe and all the friends in it are something special to me and will always be. The bonds we have made and the times we have shared i will always hold great to myself. My choice to leave koe was not an easy choice by far. I feel that the day i reached 65 was a day i defeated myself and my friends. It left me with a bitterness for more and more i could not get. <br />
<br />
While i no longer wear the keepers tag i will always try to maintain the kindness that koe showed me and everyone on the server. how to put diffrnceses aside and not to disrespect the other players even if they treated us like trash. These kinds of things is what makes KoE stand out from the thousands of guilds all across the eq realm. This i want to thank you for. <br />
<br />
I only hope that you treat me as the same person that i am now as i was when i had the keepers tag on. I only hope that yall know that the reason i left had nothing todo with the members in KoE but myself, and that i greatly respect each and everyone of you and all the hard work the officers and each member has gone through this year and half that i have been a keeper.<br />
<br />
I will always be there if you ever need me for any reason at all. I still hold you all close to me and i thank each and everyoen of you for all the kindness and warmth you have shown.<br />

See ya around guys and take care of each other.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well Sarc, I will miss you. I liked grouping with you. I wish you had posted something in members about any difficulties you had with grouping at 65 if that's what the issue was. We are getting more and more people in PoV/PoS. As you know we have lots of people flagged for PoNB. We will soon be going to Plane of Tactics. I wish you could be there. Best of luck on your new endeavors.</div></div><hr />

I don't think anyone here or in my gang wishes anything but the best of luck to you.  Hope you get what you want out of the game.</div></div><hr />
