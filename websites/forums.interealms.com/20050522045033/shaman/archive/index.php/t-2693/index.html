<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As an anbitious troll, I stayed in Paldual from 8 - 24...the xp bonus was massive, and made me feel almost normal leveling (well, as normal as a troll can feel...)<br />
<br />
Anyone have a link to all the exp bonus zones in Norrath?  Id hate to level in a &quot;static&quot; exp zone if I could go to a xp &quot;enhanced&quot; zone :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...hrmmm..didnt do a search.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Check Allakhazams. IIRC they sometimes put the exp mod in their zone description.<br />
<br />
Kedge  used  to have the highest zone mod. Not sure anymore.<br />
<br />
I know we killed about 15 MOBs in CT, I died three times and I STILL made a blue and a half or so of exp. (Fek that zone is tough)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Checked search...nothing really substantial.  Any yes, EQAtlas and Allacantpronounce lists it sometimes as well.<br />
<br />
Figured there HAd to be a one stop shop to list all the xp bonus zones....maybe...Bueller?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
