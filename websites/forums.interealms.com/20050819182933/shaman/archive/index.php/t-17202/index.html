I'm pretty partial to Rockstar with Pepsi chasers (sometimes just Rockstar), but I'm looking to explore other options this weekend. I've also tried Rockstar with a coffee chaser but thats a bit rough on the stomach.</div></div><hr />

I, for one, have attended raids that lasted 10-12 hours, starting at 7pm. I can’t tell you how many times a guild member on a late night raid has fallen asleep at his/her computer and needed to be TPed away to a safe area in the zone so as to not die. I am going to let you in on a secret shared between a few of the larger guilds on my server enabling you to go a full night without a wink of sleep.<br />
<br />
In medical circles it is known that grapefruit juice does not mix well with many drugs. It produced odd side effects which are detrimental to our health. On the other hand, when you mix grapefruit juice and caffeine the results are, well... eye opening to say the least. <br />
<br />
Let’s look at this claim. Read what this research time found when experimenting with grapefruit and caffeine.<br />
<br />
Previous research has found that naringin, found in grapefruit, interferes with enzymatic activity in the intestines thus slowing the breakdown of certain drugs and resulting in higher blood levels of the drug. A number of drugs that are known to be affected by the naringin in grapefruit include calcium channel blockers, estrogen, sedatives, and medications for high blood pressure, allergies, AIDS, and cholesterol-lowering drugs. Consuming grapefruit or grapefruit juice may also extend caffeine levels and effects of caffeine.<br />
<br />
While the effect of naringin on the metabolism of a drug can increase the drug's effectiveness, it can also result in dosages that are inadvertently too high. Therefore, many physicians do not recommend that patients take any drugs with grapefruit juice unless the interaction with the drug is known. In addition, the effects of drinking grapefruit juice is cumulative, which means that if you drank a glass of grapefruit juice daily with your medication for a week, the drug interaction would be stronger at the end of the week than at the beginning.<br />
<br />
The majority of caffeine (approximately 86 percent) is metabolized by a similar enzyme group, CYP1A2. Other enzymes (CYP2E1 and CYP3A4) play a minor role in caffeine metabolism. However, naringin, the bitter constituent of grapefruit juice, has been documented to inhibit CYP34A activity in human liver as well as CYP1A2.<br />
<br />
OK enough mumbo-jumbo doctor scientist talk. I will tell you straight, in layman’s terms how this works. Go buy some grapefruit juice. Bottles are good, but the metal canned stuff is it even better. Drink a nice tall glass of it, then 30 minutes later, start drinking your caffeine (Pepsi). Throughout the night continue drinking Pepsi and grapefruit juice intermittently. Not only will you not be sleepy, you’ll be ‘on tip’. You’ll start reading people’s minds you’re so jittery, casting that rebuff on your group .5 seconds before they ask for it. Dancing around in your seat like your like you’ve got cockroaches in your skivvies. I am joking, it’s not that bad. You just feel very alert for a long time. Prolonged uses of this combination can not be good for your body so keep it to a minimum.<br />
<br />
I, nor the sites that run this tip, are responsible for misuse of this information. Discression always applies when we are dealing with drugs and our bodily systems. And on that note…<br />
<br />
Stay Safe and happy hunting</div></div><hr />

coffee actually deoxygenizes your brain so you become sleepy later on, and like somebody earlier said, alcohol makes pickup groups bearable.</div></div><hr />

He would stir a spoonfull into a can of jolt, and use it to wash down a handfull of skittles. The results over time were not pretty, so use moderation.I highly recommend that nobody attempt to do this.  Caffeine is a poison and can kill you.  Following quote is taken from OpenCola's (http://www.dma.org/dmahurin/docs/Food/Cola/OpenColaFormula/) page on how to make your own cola at home:<br />
Caffeine: It's best not to store caffeine in any amount. Caffeine can kill people in relatively small doses. The median lethal dose for an adult human is around 10 grams, or approximately one third of an ounce. You can find out more by reading the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for caffeine at http://www.jtbaker.com/msds/c0165.htm. Don't yeild to the temptation to create a &quot;Super-Jolt™,&quot; adding tons and tons of the white stuff to your cola, our you'll be in a world of hurt. If stored, store in a secure area away from children. Toxic by inhalation and ingestion: If inhaled, remove to fresh air, If ingested, call a physician. Possible teratogen and mutagen. If product comes in contact with the eyes, flush with plenty of water. There is some great information on caffeine and it's over-consumption at http://www.thecaffeinepage.com.<br />
<br />
Caffeine is completely optional. I used part of a caffeine pill (MVP, www.mvpnutrition.com), ground up in a pestle with a mortar. According to information on the pill bottle and on the Web site, the pills are 100% caffeine. As an extra safety precaution, I strained all of the syrup through a 4-ply of cheesecloth, in case any of the caffeine wasn't dissolved.FYI...</div></div><hr />

-Started with water, didn't work for very long after 0000. put down an odwalla grapefruit juice, and then put back a sprite remix+vodka (also tried redbull/vodka mixer, but it didn't taste so hot). Was good for about 1-2 hours, but the sleepinees really starting coming on strong from the alchohol. Put back a near frozen rockstar and was bouncing off the walls. I forced myself to sleep around 5am but had at least 3 hours+ of zinging from the rockstar/grapefruit thingy. good times.</div></div><hr />
