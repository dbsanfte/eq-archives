The Shaman’s Tale<br />
<br />
For as long as I can remember, I have been a man without a past. I have searched far and wide, looking for something, but never knowing what it is that I sought. Every time I think I have found a piece of the unknown puzzle that I have become, I find that I am mistaken. I sometimes feel like an empty shell. There seems to be a bottomless hole in my being that cannot be filled. I have long wondered why this must be my lot in life.<br />
<br />
I was gripped by one of the deep, dark moods that so often afflicted my soul, when I wandered into a humble inn, in a far away land. Though I knew peace could not be mine, I nevertheless sought respite in this place.  Perhaps tonight sleep would overtake me and I would be free for a period.  If not, sufficient amounts of cheap ale would have to suffice to hold back the pain. I took my first cup of ale to a dark corner of the inn’s tavern where I could be alone in my despair.<br />
<br />
At the very moment I sat down, the door of the tavern opened, and a very large man entered.  I had never seen someone of his size. He must have been nearly seven feet tall, and he was built like a mountain. Though clouded by his massive brow, I could see his silver blue eyes piercing the air of the tavern. The man had such a powerful presence that the innkeeper shrunk before him as he ordered a tankard of ale. A pair of robbers sitting in the middle of the room quietly left their food and drink and slipped quickly out the door. Even the innkeeper’s dog whimpered in the corner.<br />
<br />
After taking a mighty draft of his ale, the gaze of this giant of a man fell upon me. I was too deep in my depression to fear him, so I simply returned his gaze with dull, watery eyes.  After a moment of staring, he flowed across the room towards me, his dark cape parting for a moment revealing stunning armor.  I have never seen such armor in my life. It was dark, nearly black, but yet I could swear it emitted a darkened bluish glow.<br />
<br />
But his armor was not the most curious thing about him. Across his back was strapped a most unusual shield, which at first glance seemed ordinary. But it was no ordinary shield. It shimmered with a barely perceptible whitish light. Across his shield was strapped a long, powerful spear. The spear’s point was intricately carved out of bone in some design I had never seen before. Two large red feathers were tied to where the long point attached to the shaft. The feathers emitted a soft glow like a lantern. The shaft was enormous, and was made out of a curious wood I could not identify. It appeared that the shaft had been shaped by someone using their fingernails to scrape wood off of it.  The spear was perfectly straight, and was nearly as long as the man was tall. In his hand he carried a powerful mace made of ivory and shark’s teeth. On the ball at the end of the mace large, dangerous spikes protruded, each nearly as long as my arm.<br />
<br />
This massive mountain of a man stood before me and with a quiet voice that pierced me like thunder asked,<br />
<br />
“Are you the one they call Norhaven?”<br />
<br />
My poor name spoken by this man’s voice sounded so vulgar to me that I hated myself all the more for my weakness.  I managed to stammer a pathetic “yes” into my drink. Without asking, the giant took a seat across the table from me and glared at me with deep, ice blue eyes. I mumbled something in protest, but he continued to watch me with piercing eyes. Finally, after what felt like an eon, the giant spoke.<br />
<br />
“You are more pathetic than I expected. Drowning in your misery like a dying rat, you are.”<br />
<br />
I could not look into his face, so I stared into my drink.<br />
<br />
“Hear me, and hear me well, young knight. You will fulfill your destiny whether you desire it or not. Now listen to my story and see that you do not make the mistake that I did.”<br />
<br />
I groaned, and eased back into my chair, still unable to look into the magnificent face of this stranger.<br />
<br />
“I have traveled from a far away land so strange that you could barely comprehend it. I have seen such wonders that it would boggle your mind if I were to describe them to you. What I have to tell you is far more important than any of these wonders.”<br />
<br />
Finally, I chanced a glance at the stranger’s face. What I saw shocked me. The man was obviously of great age, as the lines on his face were worn deep with sorrow.  He was stunning in his appearance, one might even say beautiful, despite his great age. Yet there was a deep sadness that lingered about his eyes that nearly broke my heart to see it on such a visage. I quickly looked back into my drink, hiding the building moistness in my eyes. He continued, each word careful chosen and spoken with deep conviction.<br />
<br />
“I am a powerful shaman, a barbarian from a land called Everfrost. I spent many long years traveling across the world gaining might and power, learning magics and obtaining treasures you can barely imagine. I singled handedly killed dragons that could tear ten men apart with ease.<br />
<br />
“So powerful I became, that my fame spread far across the land. Kings and princes clamored to engage my services to solve their problems. Eventually, I was recruited by a guild of warriors and mages so powerful that they could literally topple mountains and destroy entire cities if it served their purposes.”<br />
<br />
The huge barbarian’s story sounded so incredulous I could scarcely believe it, yet was spoken with a conviction deeper than I could have ever imagined.<br />
<br />
“As powerful as this guild was, their courage and moral integrity were so great that instead subjugating kingdoms and peoples, they sought to do good rather than evil. I became very close with them, and we had many marvelous adventures together. In their company I became more powerful than I could have ever imagined.”<br />
<br />
He paused to take another long pull on his ale. Not a drop of it fell on his beard.  He then continued.<br />
<br />
“But one day, we admitted into our guild an elven druid of such beauty that I was immediately taken by her. We fought together side by side for many seasons, and became very close. After one particularly long battle, she took me aside and opened her heart to me. She then threw her arms around me and embraced me with such fervor that it touched the deepest depths of my soul. We soon became lovers, sneaking bits of time alone with each other whenever we could.”<br />
<br />
The giant shaman paused for a moment, and I glanced up at him again, I saw a deep shadow pass across his eyes, and for a moment he gazed past me as if I wasn’t there. He then turned his head slightly and spoke again, this time more deliberately.<br />
<br />
“Then one day, she came to me and told me she was betrothed to an elven prince. She said because of this, everything that had passed between us could not continue, but must be forgotten. I was stunned. I could not answer her as she walked away from me. I stood for hours perplexed not knowing what to do. I raged against her in my mind, but could not bring myself to hate her because I loved her so much. I withdrew into myself, forfeited my position in my guild, and wandered listlessly for many years. I lost everything I had worked for because I could not overcome my own broken heart. I thought I was master of everything in my world, but learned sadly that I was not even master of my own heart.”<br />
<br />
His final words were spoken with such emotion that I was swept away in his grief. I put my hands on my eyes and wept into them like a child. I don’t know how long I cried. Everything seemed to turn grey around me and I could hear nothing or see nothing.<br />
<br />
I must have fallen into a deep sleep, because I was awakened by the sound of the innkeeper’s broom scratching across the wooden floor. Light shown through the opened door and a gentle, peaceful breeze blew into the room. The innkeeper whistled a light, cheery tune as he swept. I raised my head from the table and looked at him.  He smiled at me and nodded lightly.<br />
<br />
“Looks like a nice morning, son,” he said happily.  “If you’ve got somewhere to be, you’ve got a wonderful morning to get there.”<br />
<br />
He returned contentedly to his chores. I rose stiffly from my seat and walked to the open door.  I drank the fresh morning air deeply into my lungs and stepped out the door into the sunlight.</div></div><hr />

The Days of Haunting<br />
<br />
The cold breeze of late autumn bites at my face and tears through my ragged cloak. The bleak, grey sky of late afternoon portends the long, cold night ahead. I know now I shall not have to endure another night alone. It is days like these that give rise to people’s fear of death. Myths of vampires and undead walking the night are born of the despair people feel at this time of year. For me, however, such myths hold no appeal, for they can never hide the pain I feel. As the days shrink, so does my desire to travel the weary path that life has placed before me.<br />
<br />
It was not always like this. Even now, I remember the warm days of summer when I stepped off the boat on Talking Island and first met Graeci. The sunlight danced in her blonde hair and sparkled from her blue eyes. Oh how my heart raced in me as we talked. I cannot fully describe the hope that began to blossom inside my tired soul that day. I made my delivery to her and then watched with a heavy heart as the boat pulled away from the island and headed back to Gludin.<br />
<br />
Eventually Graeci was ready to come herself to Gludin, and so I raced back to the city with the hope that I might have the chance to see her again. As fate would have it, I had put aside my training to become a paladin to search for some spiritual base upon which to build my faith. As Lord Smogula once observed, what use is a paladin who has no faith? My studies brought me to the church in Gludin on the very same day that Graeci first set foot on Aden.<br />
<br />
The wonderful days that followed will forever be written in my heart. I thought they would never end. My faith swelled within my heart and I knew that with her at my side I could overcome anything. If I had known then what the end would be like, would I have had the courage to stay by her side? Only Fate knows, and she has never been willing to share secrets with me.<br />
<br />
Early on, Graeci told me she was married to a king, but so earnest was our passion that I thought I could ignore that important fact. I laugh bitterly now at the audacity of fancying myself ever being worthy of the love of a queen. But love is truly blind, so I crashed through the days of summer fearless in my foolishness. The shaman’s earnest warning went unheeded as my heart became ever more entwined with hers. The time we spent together lifted my spirits higher than they had been in many years. When we were apart, we yearned to be together. We wrote long letters to one another speaking of our yearning. We thrilled in our passion when we were together.<br />
<br />
Then as the days of late summer began to fade, and the cool nights began to speak of the coming winter, Graeci came to me in secret. Oh how I my heart breaks anew each time I think of that meeting. Her head was veiled so I could not see her face. Her voice was full on uncertainty and doubt. One of her truest friends had turned against her. To make matters worse, her clan leader whom she admired so much had spoken with her of how irresponsible it was for a queen to consort with a wandering knight such as me. But she seemed at that moment to be steadfast. Later that evening, as I read her latest letter, she pleaded with me to try to confine my passion and not force her to make a choice between me and her king. Like a fool, I felt that I could continue to do her bidding, and that we would yet spend many days together.<br />
<br />
I had only asked two things of my dearest Graeci. First, I insisted that she always followed her heart, and second, that she speak to me only the truth, no matter how harsh it may seem. I felt that if fate were kind, her heart would always lead her back to me. I believed that our passion was truer than anything else. And so I put my faith in her and my hope in our future.<br />
<br />
Oh how I curse the next day. If I could rip it from my memory I would. The early fall day seemed to be filled with promise. How foolish I was not to have expected the spectre that bore to me a simple note from my Graeci. The words were short, but as I read each one and struggled to understand them, I could feel something deep inside me shattering again and again. She had confessed her actions with me to her king. For her penitence, she was to never see me or communicate with me in any way. Her final request from me was that I pray for her.<br />
<br />
As her words lanced through my soul, I fell to the ground in anguish. I cried out “No, no, no….” again and again as I doubled over in pain. Tears poured down my face and I pounded my fists on the ground over and over. So exquisite was the pain that I could see nothing and hear nothing other than my agonized sobs. The room spun around me and I could not tell whether I was alive or dead.<br />
<br />
Eventually my anguish subsided and I succumbed to a deep darkness of the heart like I had never known. I could not think, I could not eat, even bottles of ale failed to numb the pain. I wandered from one day to the next like a ghost, devoid of life. As much as I wanted to pray for my sweetest Graeci, I knew I could not. What shreds of faith I had managed to pull together when we were together and happy had been swept away.<br />
<br />
In my grief I came to the marketplace in Dion and next to the humblest of vendors I sat down and scribed a simple sign. I placed the sign at my feet and began a vigil that lasted many days. The sign’s simple message was “Graeci come back please”. As the fall became colder, I sat day after day, night after night, hoping somehow my futile gesture would please Fate and my Graeci would return to me. I began to realize that there was nothing I wouldn’t do to find her and try to bring her back to me.<br />
<br />
One grey morning, the thought struck me that there was only one last thing I could do for Graeci. I realized that I could never rest until I found her, but that in finding her, I would be yet a greater burden to her than I had ever been before. I knew I could not ever let her go, but that if I really loved her that was what I had to do.<br />
<br />
In my studies, I had read of many martyrs who paid for their beliefs with their lives. I had lost all belief, yet one thing remained. I knew I had to free Graeci from my heart for once and for all. And that is what brings me to this cold, bleak day. I stand on a cliff high above the ocean in a far away corner of Aden. I am dressed in the simple robes the priests gave me while I studied in Gludin. My shield is strapped across my back, and my sword is sheathed around my waist. I carry a bag that holds my armor, now grown rusted with disuse.<br />
<br />
I unsheathe my sword, holding it before me, pointing out to the ocean. This was the sword whose every swing was for Graeci.  I let go of it and it tumbles and clatters down the cliff and onto the rocks below. I unstrap the shield that defended me in battle, but could not defend my heart. I heave it with what little strength I have left, and it sails out and away from the cliff, splashing into the ocean. It floats briefly before sinking. I take out my rusted armor from the bag as it begins to rain. This armor was once so strong, but now I see that when I put it upon my body, yet it was still empty. I toss each piece of armor over the cliff, listlessly hearing the crashing of metal on rock over and over again until at last the bag is empty.<br />
<br />
The rain stops, and a cold wind blows in from the ocean. As if in a vision, I see the clouds parting. The sun breaks through just above the horizon, flooding the fading day with oranges and reds. My eyes are dry, the last tears having been shed long ago. But the sinking sun over the ocean beacons to me. I step closer to the cliff’s edge, the wind blowing in my face, the sunlight sparkling in my eyes. I breathe deeply, feeling suddenly very alive and filled with courage.<br />
<br />
Graeci’s face is before me now, her hair sparkling in the sun light. I close my eyes yet she remains, beautiful as the day I first met her. What we shared together wells up in my heart, strengthening me to give her my last gift. I lean against the wind, feeling it cut through my threadbare robes and pierce deliciously into my skin. I am free now, I am ready. This is my final gift to you Graeci.<br />
<br />
I bend my knees then spring forward into the wind. I stretch my hands out like wings. I have never felt so alive, so free, so complete. I am flying now, high above the ocean. I can open my eyes, and to my delight I am crying tears of joy. The sun slowly descends into the ocean as I arc out into empty space. My whole life seems as but a moment compared to my flight towards the rocks below. With each passing moment, I am more fulfilled, realizing that fate for once has been kind to me. Finally, after all my journeys, I am at peace with myself. My work is done.<br />
<br />
The last thing I hear is my body shattering on the rocks.</div></div><hr />
