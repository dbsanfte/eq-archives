<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Porunga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I noticed last night that the last tic on the epic dot was doing 167 a second time instead of 179.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Same here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's kinda lame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ALL dots have been nerfed.  They used to last one extra tick more then it says in the database, now they took away that tick. REALLY LAME!! Please bitch loudly about it, dots sucked compared to nukes before, now they widen the gap.  SoE just makes my mind hurt sometimes trying to figure out what the hell they are thinking.  <br />
<br />
Lets see dots are not balanced with nukes now, hmm...Lets make them more gimp!!  We can blame a bug fix that was in the game for years.  Just lame.  I think they saved me from buying 3 copies of LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yah if they did remove a tic off every dot that is serious suckage and will really hurt bane imo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just did some extensive testing. All DoT's except epic still lasting same time they did before. Epic's last tic is fubar'd. Will post logs shortly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heres my logs:<br />
<br />
Nife and Blood both last the full 8 tics<br />
Breath lasts the full 27 tics<br />
Curse does do the same damage for the last tic. I suggest doing /bug on this<br />

<br />
http://necro.eqclasses.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=21785<br />
<br />
They're saying that dots now do the damage they were supposed to, but that dots are running one less tick than before the patch. The extra tick was an accident.<br />
<br />
Splurt also has the same damage on the last tick as on the previous one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The damage you posted in your log, is that affected by PVP? Seemingly reduced numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dots only do 66% damage in pvp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ok - I was gonna say that damage looked all wrong.  It's been ages since I pvp'd on my Sham.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">has anyone notices the last tic loss of Torpor/Q as well. I noticed that torpor/q didnt heal as much as it shoulda<br />
when SCR/SCRM maxxed as well my friends are getting that last tic or 2 ramdomly .<br />
<br />
again anyoneelse noticing this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wonder if epic druid is nerfed too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I like how you abused your cleric instead of finding a mob to cast the dots on.  :p<br />
<br />
I tried casting on myself at first, but you don't get the DoT feedback on yourself so I had to do something..<br />
<br />
The cleric doesn't complain or strike back, less spam to clear out  :D<br />
<br />
I continued for a while after that checking Pox then rechecking to see if it was random, but got same thing each time. <br />
<br />
Of course when I was done I just had to put all 5 on him and see how long he lasted. /evil laugh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wonder if epic druid is nerfed too...<br />
<br />
I doubt that, if anything they gave druids some new ability to Dire Charm the boss mobs in every zone, thus giving them better dps that they were lacking, further balance them , and put them more in line with other classes.... <br />
<br />
/sarcasm off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Confirmed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">yup, 167/167<br />
<br />
The extra tick is there actualy, its just reduced.<br />
pretty lame ot nerf us, even that small amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Redspeed-Valoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">oh no, anything but 12 less damage!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">A funny thought, could you imagine if this popped up before we could see how much dmg out dots did a tick?<br />
<br />
1/4 of the shamans would be screaming that there epic can no longer kill that highland kolbolb on the last tick and that the damage was reduced.<br />
<br />
3/4 of the shamans would be calling them liars. (Withought any attempt to test it themselves)<br />
<br />
Interesting how diffrent a situation can be when it's so easy to aquire proof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">oh no, anything but 12 less damage!<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not the point of missing 12, its the point of why. Why even bother for such a small amount, it seems stupid more then harmful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I wouldn't have thought it's a matter of &quot;why bother&quot;. I imagine it was an unforeseen consequence of something else they did (such as fixing DoT damage to not give the extra tick). I very much doubt they'd simply reduce the last tick of damage deliberately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Smert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I haven't had time to play or read the boards of late, but...<br />
had they goofed and added an extra tick that they now stripped off? Or is it they removed the bonus tick they added for stationary mobs. <br />
<br />
As I recall back when they nerfed Necros (and in the process us) they made dots on moving mobs do less damage after the first 3 ticks, and added a bonus tick if the mob was kept stationary. <br />
<br />
I know they took off the penalty for movement a while ago, but apparently left the bonus tick - is that what they took off, or some other bonus tick? <br />
<br />
Or am I just really, really confused?  I *think* I'm recovered from the beer-fest, but could be wrong...<br />
