<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As of now, I've been on a cruise since the last time I posted about my upcoming Shaman, and I still can't sort it out.<br />
<br />
I've been looking for a new main, and a shaman was to replace my monk. I've been quiet serious about this and I've got most of this shaman stuff figured out.<br />
<br />
The only part no one will help on, and being a melee character previously I understand, is equipment. Yes, equipment posts are annoying, but usually after reading the board using seaches, etc. you just learn. Such is what I've done wiht all my melee characters, but after reading up on Shaman equipment for days, I'm just as confused as to what I'm supposed to do. <br />
<br />
All I've learned is that wis is nothing compared to AC/HP, but that confused me even more. <br />
<br />
Should I aim for 0 wis early stages? I have literally no idea what to shop for in EC when I get back on Friday, and it's giving me a headache. Shaman's don't seem to have any straight upgrade paths like other melee characters, and everyone seems to use different equipment, whatever suits them. <br />
<br />
If wis is that useless, can't I just bring over many of my monk items, like Shimmering Terror Hide Cloaks? Do I even really need wis at all? I haven't touched my character at all, rather just made it and parked it next to Druid rings. I'm a Inni worshipping Troll, but all I've done is create it to preserve the name. When do I need to get some wis?<br />
<br />
As of now I'm not sure at all whether I'm going to make a shaman instead of some other caster class, because I have no idea what I should buy. If no one cares to give me an equipment loadout, could you just point in a general direction of what equipment I should shop for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im by no means an expert.  But like you, I started a twink shaman (errr..you eventually will)<br />
<br />
I started a troll...cause I think they're sexy.  No other reason.<br />
<br />
Now, I would vouch that WIS is needed, at least for the first 24 levels, moreover for a troll.<br />
<br />
I put a lot of my points into WIS to start, cause my other stats were sufficient.<br />
<br />
Now, for approximately 9k, I have what I would consider a great setup.  Many (most) of the choices were made with strong recommendations from the folks here.<br />
<br />
How did it work out?<br />
<br />
not sure hours played, but in 2-3 weeks, 10-20 hours a week, I hit 24.<br />
<br />
Here is my profile for reference.  Disregard the ac, as I didnt set up my profile correctly, but the equip is right<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=258298 <br />
<br />
I got my WIS to 119 I think, and my ac made tanks weep, even at 24 lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have moderate Wis, and good AC etc<br />
<br />
<br />
Wis is still needed, though straight mana might be better.<br />
As you progress in levels, wis kinda &quot;comes&quot;.  Good equip will have wis on it, even if you were goin for AC/HP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, you have the gist of it right ... but don't &quot;aim at zero WIS.&quot;<br />
<br />
You do need WIS, it is just that WIS is least useful in the early stages, and is never as important as mana regeneration.  WIS gives you 1 point of mana for your level divided by 5.  So at level 20, one WIS gives you 4 mana.  At level 50 it gives you 10 mana, and at 60 it gives you 12 mana.  Mana regeneration via cannibalizing is a key element of shaman play, and the hp/ac are important ingredients for that.<br />
<br />
Aim for hp/ac and let the WIS come.  the Arctic Wyvern Mask at 6 ac and 5 WIS (if I recall correctly - worn it so long I don't remember  LOL) is much, much better than the Platinum Ruby Veil at 8 WIS and 8 STR.<br />
<br />
But a spider fur belt is not necessarily better than a flayed turmoilskin belt.  The turmoilskin is 1 ac less, and has WIS versus the hp on the spider fur ... your needs my dictate the turmail as a better choice - for you.<br />
<br />
I, and many other posters on these boards, do just fine with wis at, or even below 150.  The most valuable item to a shaman coming up is a fungi tunic - that hp regen is a constant source of mana (yes, when/if you hit 60, and if you have torpor, it finally loses its must wear label .... personally, I am not holding my breath!)<br />
<br />
Don't avoid WIS,  look for one of the threads on formulas for comparing items with different stats.  <br />
<br />
For twinkage, you would do very well with the common jaundiced bone pieces (helm, arms, boots, gloves).  they would give you outstanding ac staring out.  <br />
other slots - the AW mask is great.  <br />
get the 6 ac/55 hp rings.  <br />
I am currently wearing the 6 wis earrings, because I am still just over 900 ac with them on, and nowhere near 950 with the ac/hp rings.  That will change as I upgrade other slots.<br />
then you can look at wis on the other items.  Elder wolf hide is good ac in the shoulder slot, and has 4 wis on it, and hp, for example. or mammoth/molten cloak.<br />
<br />
and that is not a aconsensus opinion - just my take on what I have learned here and in game.<br />
<br />
Run fast - bash hard !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like HP/AC all the way.  At early levels HP will make a huuuuge difference.  1 - 65 HP ring doubles your HP at early levels, some nice HP gear will keep you going til 24.  Then with Canni you can turn that HP pool into mana fairly quickly.  Get a Fungi/Iksar CP/Rubi BP and you have free regen of health and mana by way of Canni.  I don't think you can go wrong with HP/AC stuff.<br />
<br />
~Bax</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At early levels, you're almost a tank with some spells - at 30th or so, I was meleeing things when soloing... throw on some debuffs &amp; dots, then melee &amp; nuke in between (big slow hammer let me get off a nuke between swings).<br />
<br />
However, the biggest thing - your needs will vary based on what role you play.<br />
<br />
Shaman can solo a lot, by dotting &amp; tanking, in which case you need decent AC, hp &amp; wis.<br />
<br />
We can also be the main healer for groups, at least up to the low 50's.  As was said, you really have to look at mana regeneration...  since we don't get Canni until 24th, go for a mix of AC/Wis prior to that.  Once you start to form the Canni habit (like, um, hitting your hotkey while FM) and get different Canni spells, Wis becomes less important.  Here's why: if you never to OOM, then you have plenty of mana, and thus plenty of Wis; so, you can tweak your gear towards AC &amp; hp.  AC to preserve your precious hp's when you get beat on, and extra hp to Canni more.<br />
<br />
From 39th up to 51st you are going to be slowing things all the time.  Togor's Insects starts at 39% slow, going up as you level &amp; Turgurs Insects is an upgrade at 51, going up to 75% at 60th.  These also get you one heck of a lot of aggro, which is where the AC bit comes in... because a good shaman will slow everything while the enchanters mez things, and stand there getting beat on until everything is locked down, or until (if) the tanks get aggro back from you.<br />
<br />
The people talking about maxxing AC/HP gear are mainly the upper level folks, who are topping out on gear choices.  At low 50's, I think I was focusing on a mix of AC &amp; Wis - of course, that was pre-Velious, so my choices were more limited, usually having to choose one or the other to raise.  With the newer expansions, at 60th (depending on what your guild is capable of) you can get gear that has a better mix of stats, and begin to focus more on HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, maybe you have said in other threads, but ... how much money do you have to spend and to what level do you intend to play?<br />
<br />
My first priority would be to get a regeneration item.<br />
Ceremonial Iksar CP, Fungi Tunic, whatever.<br />
<br />
Then I would get a decent spear/shield and/or a 2hb.<br />
<br />
If you have money after that, spend it on items with some balance.  Consider using items with a combination of nice hp/ac/mana stats, rather than pure wisdom.   Remember 1pt of wisdom is 10pts of mana at level 50.  At level 10, it is like 2mana per 1 wisdom.   At level 20, 4 mana per 1 wisdom.<br />
<br />
So rather than wearing an 7 wisdom ring, which would give you 28 mana at level 20.   Maybe you would consider a Jaded Velium Ring, which would give you 5ac, 30hps AND 30 mana.  That is a much better combination for you.   I would wear the jaded velium ring over a wisdom ring at any level.<br />
<br />
Other examples would be, don't wear a 3 wisdom earring when you could get say an Black Sapphire Electrum Earring that has 2ac, 35hps, 25mana.  Or an earring of twisted leaves, that has 2ac, 1wis, 35hps, 35mana.<br />
<br />
Also consider a haste item.   FBSS are fairly cheap now, or you may have one on your monk you can transfer over for self PLing.<br />
<br />
At level 60, I wear the same things as some monks and other melees I know.  6ac/65hp rings, barbed dragonscale boots, working on the Spirit Wracked Cord and Regal Ring of the Bathezid quests, crystal spider eyes, enshrouded veils, black sapphire electrum earrings, gorganga idols, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Would be a lot easier to help you if we knew what items you had available to transfer from your monk and how much money you have to spend.<br />
<br />
Best of luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Outfit as a melee, you'll do just fine.  Wis is crap from 1-24, and mostly irrelevant after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are some people on this board who are complete ac/hp nazis and act as if having high wisdom is actually bad.  I forget his name, but the guy that talks in trollspeak is one of them.<br />
<br />
Don't listen to them.  For a while, I decided to go the &quot;screw wisdom, I want to be a tank&quot; route.  My buffed AC was over 1000, which is decent considering my very limited cash flow.  However, my wisdom was only 129.  The only reason I was able to pull off this setup was because I was long-term borrowing a friend's fungi tunic.  Then, one day he started playing again and took it back.  Needless to say, I felt crippled without it.  My mana pool was tiny and even though I am very good at managing my hp's/canning/mana I was still going oom in groups.  Casting bane took more than an entire bubble of mana.  I sacrificed a few AC/hp pieces and got my wis up to 175.  I can't solo as well as I could with a fungi and tank gear, but I feel that I am in general a more effective shaman.  It is all about balance.  If you are 60 with torpor, you can wear all the ac/hp gear you want, but before that you DO need decent wisdom and a mana pool.  You just need to balance it.<br />
<br />
Here's what you can get:<br />
<br />
rings:  one 6/65 ring and one +7wis ring<br />
earrings:  the hp/mana ones (black electrum?)<br />
bp:  barbed ringmail<br />
gloves:  coldain skin<br />
legs:  you're screwed here.  ry'gorr i guess.  shamans get crap for leg choices.  Dragonleg breeches are good but they're pricey.  I lucked out and won peerless.<br />
mainhand:  weapon of choice.  howling harpoon is good<br />
offhand:  sbs or crystal chitin<br />
wrists:  not sure.  RMB's would probably be good.<br />
boots:  I can't remember what boots I wore before my barbed dragonscale, and I can't think of any good ones.  coldain skin and GEBs i think have really low AC.  jaundiced might be a good choice<br />
shoulders:  dragonwing mantle is good<br />
back:  studded acrylia.  ac is sort of low but the 10wis is awesome. There's lots of competition to sell between tailors on my server and i've seen them sell as low as 1k.  spider fur also good because it has good ac and hp's.  <br />
neck:  i wear imbued ivory but i dont think thats a choice for trolls.  not a clue what you can do.  maybe spider fur again?<br />
belt:  cobalt drake hide is awesome, but pricey.  spider fur again would be good.<br />
arms:  again, depends on your money supply.  barbed ringmail arms are good, but run about 3k.  jaundiced is also a good choice.<br />
helm:  anything but a nightshade wreath.  totemic and jaundiced are both valid choices.<br />
face:  crystal spider eyes.  anything but platinum ruby veil.<br />
<br />
as long as you're not wearing a nightshade wreath and wielding a book or ice cream cone, you're good to go imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">wrists: not sure. RMB's would probably be good.<br />
<br />
*whimper*<br />
<br />
I do agree, I balanced AC and wis in my 50s and found 170 wis was a pretty comfortable place for me.  If I gained any gear that added wis, I swapped out low AC/wis gear for higher AC gear to stay around 170.<br />
<br />
There are a heck of a lot more good choices now than there were when I was in my 50s!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My thanks to you all, and may I say, you guys are incredible.

<br />
Kudos to you all and this board. My mind is set on making my shaman now, the moment I return home. I have a much clearer picture of what I want, and this clears my mind that much more.<br />

EDIT: Adding on, some opinions may change when I mention I plan to solo? I plan to raid often, and group to gain experience of course, but the bulk of my leveling will probably come form soloing. 9k or maybe more seems about right in terms of my twinkage, nothing that will net me a JBB or anything that uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sisthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My Iksar shaman is now almost 13 and has a 400 HP with a 389 AC and a 149 wis.

Don't wear someone else's gear setup if you don't feel comfortable in it. People play differently, and enjoy different types of gear setup. I personally have 170-175 wis, but about 809ac and 1310hp unbuffed. I have room to improve, but I personally love the setup. A friend of mine is 55 in a good guild, and wears (you ac/hp fans are going to DIE laughing, I did at least) a paw of opalla, and a testament of vanear, no lie. He has 230-something wis, but I gurantee you if he ever got rooted it would be the end of him.  Although it IS up to you, I highly advise going with what the elders here have to say on most of the subjects. I listened, dropped some wis, gained AC/HP and couldn't be happier.<br />

There are some people on this board who are complete ac/hp nazis and act as if having high wisdom is actually bad.  I forget his name, but the guy that talks in trollspeak is one of them.<br />
 His name is Radag, and I don't recall him, or anyone other than myself ever saying that extra wis is actively bad.  The thing is, unless you have quite a bit of cash just lying around, getting that extra wis always comes at the cost of ac or hp.  You can cover for a lack of wis with hp and ac.  You cannot cover for a lack of ac and hp with wis.<br />

My mana pool was tiny and even though I am very good at managing my hp's/canning/mana I was still going oom in groups.  Casting bane took more than an entire bubble of mana. No offense, but if the &quot;only reason&quot; you could pull off the high ac shaman bit with 129 wisdom was your fungi tunic, I have to question the validity of this statement:...I am very good at managing my hp's/canning/mana...There are many extremely effective shaman who post here who've noted that they had low wis for most of their careers.  For you to imply that it can't be done, at least sans fungi, is inaccurate to say the least.  At 55 I run either 118 or 128 wis, depending on bearform, and running out of mana is basically a non-issue.  Of course, I am more or less in a constant state of canni-dancing, but that's the price you pay for being able to tank adds and root-park.  :) I sacrificed a few AC/hp pieces and got my wis up to 175.  I can't solo as well as I could with a fungi and tank gear, but I feel that I am in general a more effective shaman.Why?   It is all about balance.  If you are 60 with torpor, you can wear all the ac/hp gear you want, but before that you DO need decent wisdom and a mana pool.  You just need to balance it.Why?<br />
<br />
<br />
Generally the pro-ac/hp people are fairly thorough (not to say verbose) in their explanations of why exactly it is that ac/hp is more important than wis.  Your post attacking this point of view basically said &quot;They're all wrong, and I feel I'm more effective.&quot;  It would be helpful to maybe elaborate on that a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You need enough wis(150) because Canni is sloooow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I went through my early 50s with about 900 ac and 120 wis. When I hit 55, I had around 1000 ac and 140 wis. I did not seriously upgrade my gear until I reached 60, at which point I had ~1050ac and 180ish wis.<br />
<br />
It's quite possible to go through the levels with low wis and high AC, it makes you more effective in a group that pulls less than 3 mobs per pull, and teaches you the true meaning of mana conservation. For example, casting Bane is about the worst thing you can do in most groups when you know you are hurting for mana. You just spent a large chunck of your mana, and the DoT may not even run for it's full duration. You just quickened the fight by about 20 secs, and added 120 secs of down time.<br />
<br />
If your wis is low and you are grouped, restrict your mana to slows, regen, and heals. Spend the rest of your time canni dancing. Use DoTs in groups if and only if you can keep up with a continous stream of mobs and you still have more mana than you know what to do with.<br />
<br />
It's a different story if you primarily solo with root/dot, but if you tank solo with DoT and pet, a high AC low wis setup will still work well for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I had in the 130ish Wisdom in the 40's<br />
150 Wisdom till 56 got 2 upgrades brought that up to 158, at 57 where I looted 2 of the cultist rings that brought me too 178. <br />
<br />
Now at 59 I got rid of my Arctic cloak for Seahorse cloak and my wisdom is 170.  ATM I think it is still to high personally and looking to swap out some wisdom gear for HP/AC gear.<br />
<br />
In my opinion 150ish is perfect.<br />
<br />
Best thing to do is balance it where you are more comfortable.  If you feel your oom alot and need more wisdom then get it, everyone has their preference.   However, solo and grouping is alittle different IMO, since I solo more often then any HP/AC is so more important then Wisdom, 100 wisdom would do me just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nazis?<br />
<br />
Dem where socialists dem Nazis where and Gerka beleive in freeeedom and liberty *burp*.<br />
<br />
At 60 now I have 141 wis with 151 in bear form.  It working guud.<br />
<br />
This subjuect is confusing because shaman can chose to play more then one role and what gear is best depends on what role joo chose to play.<br />
<br />
a) joo can group and play healer...  In this case a sizable mana pool is somwhat usefull for when things ger very nasty.  Having a large reserve of mana give joo group a better chance to make to the end of da battle.  (any shaman worth his salt know that our best heling spell is slow thow).<br />
<br />
b) joo can solo all da time and play tank....  In this case the size of your mana pool is almost compleatly meaningless.<br />
<br />
These are the two extreams and most of ous fall some where in the spectrum between the two ends.  Mez is far closer to the solo tank end then da group healer end and my equipment choises reflect that choise.<br />
<br />
Joo being a monk understad DPS and damage mitigation and recovery time.  A guud shaman understands these topics also but it is somwhat more complex because we have 2 primary resourses to expand (hp and mana) instead of just one.  We also have the ability to convert each of those resourses to the other (heals and cannibalize) wich makes ous quite flexable.<br />
<br />
In then end ALL shaman should spend a significant amount of time solo tanking to develope the defensive skill and the free ac that comes with it.  If joo got that job done then what joo do with the rest of joo time is far more optional.  If joo play a tanking shaman then anytime joo want joo can swap in some wis gear and &quot;poof joo be a soft wis shaman instantly.&quot;  If joo a wis shaman and neglect joo defense skill because you group all the time then you can never do the job of a tanking shaman.<br />
<br />
This is realy not a very hard topic to comprehend if you start with a clear understanding of the basics.<br />
