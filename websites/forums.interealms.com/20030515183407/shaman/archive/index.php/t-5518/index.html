<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I think I've got it down for Ghiosk, he's the first reaver right inside the castle in front of the throne, right?<br />
<br />
Neh Ashiir is the reaver in the very last hut with the trap floor (which I fell through once while fighting a reaver. :( )<br />
<br />
But which reaver spawns Rak?  <br />
<br />
And, does anyone have a map that marks out the reaver locations?  <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">first floor reavers spawn ghiosk, sec floor spawns lord rak, third floor reavers spawn neh is how it works i believe.  good luk btw, :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fyful</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was under the impression that both Rak's don't need to be spawned.  Rak Ahir is kicking it outside the Reaver house, and Neh Ashiir is in a hidden room on 2nd floor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both are spawned from reavers but it's not uncommon to find them up since they hang around for quite a while if people were just farming for jade reavers.</div></div><hr />
