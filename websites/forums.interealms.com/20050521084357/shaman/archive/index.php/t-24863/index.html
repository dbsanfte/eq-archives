In a nutshell.. just about any class in the game works well with a shaman.  It all depends on what you want to do with your two-box.  Lots of good info in that above link.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Every time an expansion comes out the ballance shifts.<br />
<br />
I dual boxed a monk with my sham for 12 months till the dreaded monk mitigation nerfs, then i dumped him and made a SK.<br />
<br />
SK's are kewl, and a great dps combo with the sham.<br />
<br />
However they really dont work when raiding, because both toons are high maintenance.<br />
<br />
Great for duo'ing, can do great stuff, but when you go to a raid, sk's need to be very very busy to make a difference (and no one wants them ayway) and so to shamans.<br />
<br />
I would offer the following advice.<br />
If you want a toon to form groups with and be invited into group sex sessions, make a cleric. Sham + cleric = instagroup. However they dont duo well.<br />
If you want a good ballance or raidability, DPS, and duo partner id go a mage.<br />
<br />
Why? mages are very low maintenance. Send in pet, nuke twice, thats about it.<br />
<br />
Some fun in jugling malo/slow between two toons, but trivial really. Means you can have some fun duoing, but keep the raidability for when you want a shaman with a mean pet, pet toys and nuuuuuukes.<br />
<br />
Root pet takes care of most runner needs.<br />
Very rare to have a runner after earthy sinks into em.<br />
<br />
Although pet weapons with procs make for a bit of running. ITs not that bad when you considder that the pet root/stunn will land on 99% of xp mobs.<br />
<br />
Necro is super dps combo, but another very very busy toon that makes it hard to raid with.<br />
<br />
Ive had nasty issues with trying to gear up my SK and him always being the first toon kicked from the raid. therefore no dkp, therefore gets no loot, guilds really hate SK's they dont serve much purpose.<br />
<br />
Pallies are good but almost non existant dps, i mean they really really suck. Unless its undead. then if they have thier slay undead aa's they can do some good dps.<br />
<br />
Anyway good luck.<br />
<br />
oh had a friends war (at almost identical level to my sk) recently. Made me end billing on the sk. warrs may start weak, and have issues with agro, but by ****, defensive makes all situations manageable.<br />
<br />
Two mobs? go furious.<br />
<br />
Man, get some ldon agro procs and they hold agro better than my sk (sniff)<br />
<br />
Rowf! rowf rowf!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm a guild that does Luclin.  Most of us have seen Time and endgame-ish GoD, but we formed our own guild and are starting to progress towards Emp and VT, then eventually EP flagging the rest of our guild.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of great boxers in my guild.<br />
<br />
I'm usually boxing a cleric, ranger, and shamam.  Rangers are great for boxing.  Load up autofire, and you rarely have to bother with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i box a pally.  Now that i have the shaman &quot;rez&quot; i kind of wish he was an SK...i like the FD and DPS of an SK, and i like the life taps most of all (also, imo SK AA are way better than pally AA. you can check the AA lists and make that decision for yourself though.) <br />
<br />
pally group heal is &lt;3 and can't be forgotten about... nice thing about the pally is he is a lot more hands off than an SK...couple stuns and generally he is gtg on agro, and i can pay attention to my shaman.  i have noticed i don't have a hard time out agroing SKs with my pally, but that is only my personal experiance and is really dependent on a lot of factors.<br />
<br />
really more of an up to you kind of choice and play style based.  with my play style this expansion kind of makes me wish i had an SK instead of a pally =p  <br />
<br />
(the guys in my farm crews all box SKs and have no shaman, so haveing the only pally/shaman is a nice nitch for me personally.)<br />
<br />
<br />
edit- sucky thing about boxing a tank as a second toon is that to make the tank usefull you really have to gear the **** out of him.  meaning-choice gear really needs to go to the tank over the shaman.  in general how i decide loot is spells= shaman &gt; tank ; gear= tank&gt;shaman.  it kind of sucks because i try to be the best shaman i can so giving my pally gear i could equip the shaman with saddens me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My personal fav is a mage<br />
<br />
A mage pet with full shaman buffs is a site to behold.  And you don't have to worry about positioning.  Not to mention pet toys for your doggie.<br />
<br />
And, once in a while, my mage tosses a nuke or two.<br />
<br />
Currently, my mage is 66 and has the 66 pet....that suckers puts out dps like no knight-bot can ever do!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still say Shm/Mnk is a very hard combo to beat.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kargren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally I 2 box a 61sk (38aa)and a 52 shammy. I recently got married and don't have time to go LFG for hours on end. So I started to make a shammy. I love the combo so far. <br />
<br />
If you have the sk reasonably eqpt and he has a mace of dark glory you should be all set for duoing. With all the new magnetic gear going for around 6-10k on my server you can very easily eqpt an sk for fairly cheap. Throw in a blade of disruption(30 delay 43 dam)for another 10k and you have a 1400ac partner with damn good dps.<br />
<br />
As of yet I don't have the LDON spells for my shammy so her DPS is crap. But even so I can kill the golems in POJ Caves for 1% a kill on both characters in maybe 1-1.5minutes. Its not the best XP but I can do it safely even with up to 2 adds. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately my shammy does take the back seat as far as most gear upgrades are concerned. But shammy's don't need the major gear until at least 59 with canny aa's. <br />
<br />
To get my shammy up I pled her with roots and damage shields. Going from steamfont kobolds till 6, then over to PC till 18, Echo Caverns Mosquito's till 22ish, then over to sol A till 35ish at which point I was able to group her with an alt till 43 in COM, Stayed in COM till 52. Now I am just looking for my next spot to LVL her with low hp mobs for decent xp.<br />
<br />
I probably am going to take a break from 2 boxing her and find her some LDON groups. This way I can learn to play a shammy better and get the spells she needs.<br />
<br />
I have tried to duo her with a necro and the DPS is killer, but I don't like to rely upon my necro pet to tank and root rotting just seemed silly because I would loose all the DPS from 2 buffed up pets. The other problem with the necro/shammy duo is that the mana regen gear for them is so damned expensive.<br />
<br />
I would really recommend the SK/Shammy duo to anyone. Over all great DPS, great survivability, easy single pulls, great agro, decent CC, Most buffs covered just need KEI and virtue and you are all set. Great duo in my opinion.<br />
<br />
If anyone can make any recommendations for my duo please do I would love the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would go with the Mage personally.  Once the mage gets Ward of Xegony (61 air), that beast can tank a decent amount of mobs.  Child of Air/MS4 are just make things so much better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have Shaman and SK now. (used to be Shaman and Enchanter)<br />
<br />
The Sk is great. Damn good aggro. Snare. Single pulls. Tap heal up if shaman is a littel slow in healing. And a spare pet. <br />
<br />
Paladin gets res. Great aggro And stackable hp buffs. (But a Virtue can last hours and hours. Sk also has self only kei and by far the coolest ability in the game. Feign death.  If snot hits the propellerhead I can flop the Sk and go full bore with Snoww. Or Root rot with fairly effective dots with The sk as well for stuff that just hits too darn hard. You cant do that with Other classes of tank.<br />
<br />
Your choice but the most versitle is Shaman SK in my opinion as a pure meat and Shaman combo. <br />
<br />
(I have thought about Mage shaman. but just dunno. )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mrwallace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Didn't see my combo listed so I wanted to weigh in.<br />
<br />
66 Rog / 66 Shm.  Very, very useful combination.  The one downside is not being able to &quot;tank&quot; anything that would require a WAR, PAL, or SK.  But scouting, pulling, agro control, Dragging:), DPS are all fantastic.  Shm plays meat shield with Q on most of the time (I hope they never change the agro on our dots) and rogue can definitely take a hit or 2 if needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my brother plays a high level druid, and imo we would really have a much easier time if he was a cleric (atm druid/pally/shaman.)  holy light &gt; all =/<br />
<br />
honestly, it is really refreshing to hear that you are haveing great luck with a druid in your combo and that you wouldn't reroll him as another class given the chance.  especially considering druid + shaman = 2 utility classes.  very refreshing and inspiring :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I did a search and I got about 100 threads telling me to do a search =(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>qwymm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Betweek strictly SK and Pal I would choose PAL<br />
<br />
Stun, root, rezz, buffs, LOH &gt; FD, snare, pet, fear, HT other stuff too. <br />
<br />
I duoed a ranger, and liked it.  Snare, track, other rangerly stuff.  Less tankage, but slow took care of most of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">For those or you that are two boxing mages are you able to duo OOW named with the 66+ air pets? I guess I should be more specific as to if you can what zone would be your cutoff? As in &quot; I can hang in Nobles Causway but not in WOS&quot; .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I play a warrior/shaman combo. They were originally on the same account until the late 50s, then got split in late Luclin because it was extremely difficult finding groups for my warrior. When you are talking about 2 boxing I assume you are referring to a duo group. A warrior is a good partner, but IMO for that sort of thing an SK is better as a tank due to the utility they bring in pulling abilities and snaring. Those two things open up a lot of content that would otherwise be very risky or undoable with a warrior or pally as tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Monk till 65, SK till 67, warr till 67.<br />
<br />
Sk is better than monk cause he can lifetap, and once he has his lifetap aa's he counters the sham slow heals. Monks suck cause they get massive spike damage, and thats tough on dual boxers.<br />
<br />
Pallies are good but stuff all dps, and you have to put a lot of dots up to make up, but they can out agro anything, and with thier symbol you dont need to go hunting virtu all the time, so they rock well.<br />
<br />
Bards are fun, cause you can mitigate thier tanking lacks with slow.<br />
<br />
However, once you get WA5 and a couple of agro weapons on a warr, warrs are greater than all.<br />
<br />
Warrs with Wa5 and some good agro weaps tank best, and defensive rules. Who cares about sustained damage, cause a sham can put out massive healing over time with canni.<br />
<br />
Warrs take 50% of the dmg till you get around to slowing the beech and crippling, then they take sweet fa.<br />
<br />
In summary. Three things matter pullability (bards &gt; all) tankability (warrs greater than all) DPS (Monks do better dps but SK's come close and can actually tank post pop tier 2).<br />
<br />
Be well all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">i would choose wizzy or necro.<br />
<br />
both can snare and both have high amounts of DPS.<br />
<br />
i think the necro wins due to being able to FD and rez though.</div></div><hr />
