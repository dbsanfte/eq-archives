<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok all.<br />
<br />
I have dropped as much druid gear as possible and am starting to look like most of you shaman who have been kind enough to assist me.<br />
<br />
However, now my wisdom is at 122 and I am getting somewhat concerned.  Recently I dropped the Sheild of Falsehood for the Clay Guardian Shield.<br />
<br />
I still have a crappy tunic only 18ac so I am looking for a campable (solo) upgrade to it at lvl 49.  I would buy one but since I just bought my JBB I am tapped at the moment.<br />
<br />
Below is my profile I would love some more advice before I move into my 50's which should happen this week.<br />

Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get the imbued earrings and necklace made when a Tribunal Shaman imbues ivory. That would prolly add 12+ wisdom right there with practically no loss to AC. Get a new cloak, tons around with wisdom for cheap now in Bazaar. If you are not running out of mana grouping soloing, then yer fine. If you are, get more wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not sure what your money to spend is, but i'll list a few cheap upgrades.<br />
<br />
Ears - Imbued Golden Ivory (cheap, and more ac, and 4 wis to boot)<br />
Neck - Ivory Imbued Collar<br />
Arms - Froglok Scale Chestplate<br />
<br />
Those off the top of my head, and you'd get more AC and Wis out of the deal.  Your HP is great for your level.  Should be able to get the above for under 3k, maybe 2k.<br />
<br />
BTW, are you insane?  Why would you bag your Coldain Skin Gloves for JB Gloves?  You're losing 9STA/6WIS/6INT/20HP/20MANA, for 2AC more on the JB Gloves.  Switch those back.  Look at the profiles of avg geared non-uber 60 shamans.  They mostly have coldain skin gloves.<br />
<br />
Just thought of a few more upgrades.<br />
<br />
Back - Arctic Wyvern Cloak - it blows away your current cloak, and it's not very expensive.<br />
Head - Arctic Wyvern Helm or Iksar Hide Cap.  You lose a few AC but you gain alot in return.<br />
Legs - Kromrif Military Leggings - more ac, and you get some WIS out of it.<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of right now, and none of these are expensive.  You can do these all for under 5k, and you'd upgrade your AC, and your mana pool significantly.  You're not very high level yet, so your mana pool doesn't need to be that big, but getting WIS to like 160'ish while maintaining roughly your current hp/ac would be ideal.  GL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the awesome advice.<br />
<br />
Will get to work on that ASAP.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I missed the part about the campable BP.  Do the Hunter/Forager cycle in TT with a melee friend, maybe 2, and see how it goes.  That cycles yields alot of good PP items, but the one that is AWESOME for you is the Iksar Regen BP.  Rock on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A great chestpiece that you can prolly camp solo is the Treeweave from BW. Might need a partner at 49, but should be good exp. The iksar regen bp is definately better so get that if ya can. For your other gear, go for bs electrum ears you get a good boost in hp and mana from your current ears. Ivory imbued collar is great, with good ac and some wis and a bit of saves never hurt. I would go for the coldain over the jb gaunts, but go for cc above both for a big boost in ac. Crystal eyes would be an upgrade for your mask, wait a few lvls and camp it with a group in velks, same for the crystal chitin gaunts. Actually, any cc armor that you could get would be good but it is pretty rare drop, but if velks is your thing, you will get a piece or 2 easily. Goranga idol would be a nice upgrade for your range slot. Lastly, make sure your def skill is maxxed, very important.<br />
<br />
Enjoy</div></div><hr />
