<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyas,<br />
Ok, heres the deal, I have a cann hotkey setup that reads....<br />
<br />
/cast 2<br />
/pause 37<br />
/cast2<br />
/pause 37<br />
/cast 2<br />
<br />
Slot 2 is obviously where my cann spell sits, and I dont need to sit, because I cast it while on my Drogma (spelling?) my mount.  What I would like to know is, is there a way to get more than 1 command on a line? For example, can I somehow do a command setup like this..<br />
<br />
/cast 2, /pause 37<br />
/cast 2, /pause 37<br />
/cast 2, /pause 37<br />
/cast 2, /pause 37<br />
/cast 2, /pause 37<br />
<br />
I tried the above setup, and some other variation, and couldn't get it to work.  Thanks for the help..<br />
BTW, the cann I am currently using is cann1 (yes yes, I am still trying to get the @#$% bone chips for cann2)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do the hotkey in reverse of what you have it...<br />
<br />
/pause 37, /cast 2<br />
/pause 37, /cast 2<br />
/pause 37, /cast 2<br />
/pause 37, /cast 2<br />
/pause 37, /cast 2<br />
<br />
<br />
The pause has to come first but it goes into effect after the next command (in this case the cast)...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Saks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I never got Canni II.  I just waited till Canni III.  The 2nd set of Hot keys listed are 100% correct</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, you can do the multi-cast cann thing, but it is a Bad Idea (tm).  You can't interrupt a hotkey once it is going, and you can't issue any other hotkeys until it is finished.  With the /pause, /cast hotkey you're locked in for a good long while, unable to respond to events.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heyas,<br />
Hmmmm.... I seee what you mean Weissblau, I'll be very carefull when to use it (ahhwell). But it is still great to know, makes chain-casting for skill-ups much easier!!  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

That is not totally true, you CAN jump into the hotkey sequence.  I still use the canni x 5 method, especially when I'm two boxing.  If you must cast a spell during the sequence, there is a delay, but if you spam it, you'll jump into the sequence (you will interupt a few of the canni's).  This is a truth, I do it all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's true you can interupt a hotkey sequence, just got to time between casts, I've had to do this before...  If worse comes to worse you can also sit and that will prevent you from casting the rest (once had the mass canni hotkey and I had alacrity inplace of canni, no reason to cast alacrity several times so just sat down) and watch the &quot;you must be standing to cast a spell&quot; blurb...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, you can do something while the hotkey is running - but you can't do it via a hotkey.  i.e. you can cast a heal with ALT-1 (or whatever it is on your setup) or by clicking the gem, but you can't use your HEAL hotkey that announces the heal and does a /cast.<br />
<br />
Good point about using it for skillups, though, Shandrillar - if you're a safe spot, this is the BEST way to do skillups that I have found.  Just turn on the TV and lean over and hit the hotkey every 30 seconds or so.</div></div><hr />
