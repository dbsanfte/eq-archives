<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One guildy playing already, curse him. The Australian community seems to have selected Proudmoore PvE and Blackrock PvP as the unofficial aussie servers. Don't want to be spread all over the place like a lot of us where in EQ.<br />
<br />
I just wonder if by proudmoore they're referring to the dead rascist or his whiny daughter :/ Not a big fan of the name, but oh well.</div></div><hr />

I have NO idea what you are referring to and don't recall anything along these lines (specifically the racism reference) from game lore.  It's from a couple of characters in WC3/TFT Admiral Proudmoore I believe... I want to say there was also a Jana?  sp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dammit, did I choose a bad random server.  Blackrock has been down the entire day almost and I'm not aussie! :(<br />
<br />
They really should have set up at least one offical aussie server.  Maybe they still will and allow people on blackrock to move, I've already leveled up my shaman 3 times, I'd hate to have to start again.</div></div><hr />
