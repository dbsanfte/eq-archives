<br />
 I was at a guild event in the arena the otherday and no one would play with me. they all fear my dots cuz they say they will lose exp if i win. So there i stood in the middle of all this carnage and NO ONE WOULD play with me. Is it true that in a PvP our dots will cuz a lost of exp?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FVDladian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You should have just dotted them and blamed it on a drood.</div></div><hr />

I honestly have no idea if its fixed but sometimes it doesnt matter. People will believe that stuff for a long time even if it isnt true anymore. <br />
<br />
Anywhoo i heard someone in baz complaining they lost exp last week from a dot but also wasnt a very civil /ooc coversation so hard to say if the bug happens anymore.</div></div><hr />

Probably one of the people that runs out of the Arena when they are DoT'd and dies. Stay in the Arena and no problems.<br />
<br />
When I duel I used DoT's liberally (if they will stick). If the person wants to run out of the 'safe' area then it's not my problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only time you lose exp from a dot is if the person that dotted you isn't in the same zone as you when you die from it (IE. you killed  them first or you zoned to &quot;safety&quot;).  And still then it's not every time.</div></div><hr />
