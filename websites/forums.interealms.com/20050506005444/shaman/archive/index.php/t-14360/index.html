<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Melchezedek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've recently thought of PLing up an Int Caster. I decided I didn't want to go Necro since I already have an SK. SO it would either be an Enchanter or Mage. Now I was curious as to what ppl have found to be a better tank... a DC charmed (I think I would like to use a DC'ed pet just because i was planning to full buff it and don't want to have to keep doing that with each new pet) or a 61+ mage pet (with all it's summoned buff items weapons etc). So if anyone could give me some insight on this it would greatly help me decision.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />

DC pets can be very bad if you are fighting casters - DC can be dispelled.<br />
<br />
PoP zones either a)have no DCable mobs or b)have 2-4 DCable spawns in the entire zone.<br />
<br />
Mage pets are always available and no great loss if one happens to die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That used to be the case.  Unfortunately, people would pull a mob and root it right on top of a mage pet so it'd only attack the pet.  Verant nerfed it like 3? years ago I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go mage, the dps of the mage itself + the ability of the mage to increase yours and others dps (summoned jewlery, pet toys, ect) will make up for the difference in pet dps big time. <br />
<br />
My wife has a 65 Enc and a 61 Mag and as far as damage goes there is absolutely no comparision. <br />
<br />
They are definately right about DC mobs in PoP. Theres always at least one per zone, but if it gets killed your SoL. Also if you lose the pet before DC repops (LD, pet death, ect.) your also SoL until it repops.</div></div><hr />
