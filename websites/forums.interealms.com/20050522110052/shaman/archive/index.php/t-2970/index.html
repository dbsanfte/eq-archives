<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Myysticjkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've played with many shamans and have always been fascinated by there skills and spells. More so then a druids(which i have tried with no success).<br />
I play a high lvl ranger and time came to give another character a try.<br />
So i created a Vah Shir Shaman(I also play a vah shir bstlord so i love the race). Most of the equipment i either had or camped or actually did quest. <br />
What i did first though was played shaman too his 12 cycle before i decided if he was worth and persueing and he was which im glad. So after I got him off that rock I started doing his Totemic pcs and transfering items off druid(which is a great mule, lol).<br />
Currently I am hunting wyverns to get hides to make some of the shaman armor pcs but want to have anyone take a look at what he is wearing now to see if i am heading in the right direction with him.<br />
Thank you all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think most people would say your going a bit heavy on the wisdom gear. There are 2 things to consider.<br />
<br />
1) at your lvl wisdom provides very little mana. At 20 you get 4 mana per wis so your earrings are 12 mana your rings are 24. Mana items do have some scaling in them but it's still easy to find a 55mana ring or 25 mana earring.<br />
<br />
2) You haven't quiet gotten there yet but at 24 you get cann 1. With it you can turn hps into mana which allows you to recover mana faster than most anyone else but you need to have hps yo use it and AC protects those hps when mobs do aggro on you and take a swing at ya.<br />
<br />
Some quick and fairly easy sugguestions for a twink. Ditch the loops and get electrum BS earrings. Ditch at least one of the rings and get a shadel bandit ring. Get a tatterd mantle for your shoulders. A clay guardian shield or SBS sheild makes a nice shield. Regen tunics are about the best tunic a shaman can wear till 60. Coldain skin gloves may be viable on your server too. You could easily get another  200 hps from those items and get 50% more hps and most of them still provide more in raw mana than you are getting from the wis you have in those slots currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>fico</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your AC is too low, HP seems ok for your level. try working on your AC, also if you can afford get a Regen BP or fungi, regen BP runs about 7k on Xev and worth every CP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">6/65 rings, new helm (totemic or JB), electrum BS earings, new boots (again totemic or JB), tattered mantle, spider fur belt, goranga idol, SBS or clay guardian shield.  The helm and boots really need a change as the AC is waayyy low.  You can wait till 24 (cani) to do alot of these upgrades, but dont wait after that.</div></div><hr />
