<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bubub the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well. withch is better at 45?  I use enstill most of the time but should I be using root?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">which is a higher level ?<br />
<br />
<br />
That one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used to use just root, but now use Instill because the mana cost isn't an issue for me, and I like the chance of a longer root.<br />
<br />
Still haven't bought that Paralyzing Earth yet.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used instill exclusively. There is never a time when I need to worry about DD breaking a root. If I have to use a root type spell, its to park. The duration is a HELL of alot longer on instill. I used instill over the root upgrade as well (forget what its called).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I still use the original lowbie root (I'm level 55). Bottom line is it is the fastest casting, and IMO the least resisted. Once I get root stuck on a mob I can, if necessary, sit and mem a better root spell.<br />
<br />
Seriously, for me, in the situations where I need to root a mob, casting time is my only concern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I didn't notice a huge difference between root and instill when I was lower level but I usually used instill (or enstill back then).  I actually went back to just root in the low 50's because it has a slightly faster cast time.  Immobilize in my opinion was worthless at 51.  Paralyzing Earth completely blows the other root spells out of the water.  As soon as you hit 56 get paralyzing earth and use it.  Many times when root parking a mob I've had it last for its full duration of 3 minutes.  Until you get paralyzing earth I'd say use instill unless you start to find that the .5 second longer cast time than root is becoming a problem.</div></div><hr />
