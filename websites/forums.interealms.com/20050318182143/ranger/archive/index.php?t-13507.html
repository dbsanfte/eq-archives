<br />
Simple question really but I have a fuzzy memory. Do Deathbone Magus's and Firecasters at the caste in Disease Summon? <br />
<br />
I know they are wizards and like to nuke you for 1 K plus and some other assorted nasty spells as well. I also know they are lv 59 to 60 so no push overs. However try as I might I simply cannot remember if these guys summon. <br />
<br />
Anyone remember?</div></div><hr />

In fact I know Deathbone Magus's and Firecasters had a tendancy to ping pong on casters and healers as opposed to summoning them.<br />
<br />
Having said that, just to be sure I have checked my logs while writing this and the following did have the &quot;You will not evade me soandso&quot; message <br />
<br />
Gryme the Crypt Guardian<br />
Aramin the Spider Guardian<br />
Guardian of Pestilence<br />
Grummus<br />
<br />
I guess it is not surprising that those ones summon but out of all the others we killed nothing seems to have summoned.</div></div><hr />

We tried to root park with little sucess.   They did too much damage on me, and I tried to Weaponshield to buy time for a CH.<br />
<br />
Thats when they interupted WS and summoned me to death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jezekiell</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only deep castle mobs like the ones listed above summons, the normal ones at entrance to castle, and the way up to gryme doesn't.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eolair Strongbo</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, there are several things that summon, but PoP mobs have a higher damage summon limit.  You can do quite a bit of damage to mobs in pop and they won't summon.  I've done almost 200 damage bow shots to wretched puslings and he didn't summon, but did summon later when he was lower on health.  I've seen the Deathbone's and Firecaster's summon, but th gruops I've been in have never had one summon when pulling.<br />
<br />
You just have to do more damage to them before they will start summoning.</div></div><hr />
