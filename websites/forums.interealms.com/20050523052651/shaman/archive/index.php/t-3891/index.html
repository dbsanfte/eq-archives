<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I love collecting fun right-clicky things.  Anyone know of any more that I can get?<br />
<br />
So far I have:<br />
1) white ceramic band ( 5 hp dd )<br />
2) symbol of loyalty to rallos zek ( yaulp )<br />
3) sow boots<br />
4) shovel of ponz ( reclaim energy )<br />
<br />
I'm particularly interested in stuff like shovel of ponz-- a magician item that we can still use because we don't need to equip it to get it to work.<br />
<br />
Any input would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
I'm really curious about the Clay Bracelet-- it summons an eye of zomm.  Anyone know if you can use it from your inventory slot?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">how did u get the symbol of loyalty to rallos zek?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My favorite is the stalking probe.<br />
Great fun to toy arround with the eye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My favorite clicky toy is the JBB.<br />
<br />
<br />
 =)<br />
<br />
Ok, maybe not a *toy* per se... but I couldn't live without it (Now that I have one... I suppose I did fine before owning it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not got one yet (not enough cash), but my favorite will be: Amulet of Necropotence... ah, illusion skeleton 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here's a couple:<br />
<br />
Tinkered telescope -- instant cast zoom in vision.<br />
Spirit Stone's -- unlimited ports to your home town<br />
Bracer of the Hidden -- instant see invis, targeted<br />
Red Buzzer -- Alex Trebeck tell's you &quot;so close...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A rogue I ran into got an item at a gm event that has a right clickable Flare effect (level 1 magicician spell i think).  It just sends out a flare of light, like the bolt spells, but insta cast, so he was chain gunning that thing, looked pretty cool.  Dunno if any other items have a similar effect.<br />
<br />
Other good ones are:<br />
AoN (skeleton form), Holgresh Elder Beads (eye of zomm).  There's also an item that will let you summon a low level magician pet, I don't remember the name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">oogha:  pretty sure he was talking about the Initiate Symbol of Rallos Zek.  Did the quest at lvl 4 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Illusion Assling mask 1charge from some dark elf quest, for darkies.. im gonna try to raise neriak faction / sneak to do it :)<br />

bhahahahaha that has to be the most elaborate hoax EVER :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Someone certainly put a whole lot of time into it. I didn't honestly think that VI would put a 'Ronz Jermy' in like that or have a 'gnomish pleasure toy', but illusion brownie would really have been cool to have :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">lol, its BS. But its really well written BS. Fun read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Like Furor said, that guy needs to get a haircut, and get a life :P j/k I liked the part where he said he got blinded and heard sounds like both he and his &quot;wife&quot; were getting attacked lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually it was his sig on the next page that had me totally cracking up!  LOL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As an ogre shaman I would certainly hope you have the Worker's Sledgemallet, with proc: Gate to Overthere Outpost.<br />
<br />
It is not clicky, but as a shaman we can pull any easy mob with Turgur's and start hammering away. After buffing myself with FoS, Celerity, and Voice - it procs very fast most of the time.<br />
<br />
It comes from a quest in the Overthere outpost - must have amiable or better Venril Sathir faction to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Unfortunately the Workers Sledge doent proc till lvl 50...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nakukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I quested the Star of Eyes, unlimited charges of identify. Very fun little toy, and a fun quest that brings you around a lot of Norrath (old world).<br />
<br />
-Nakukak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Bone of bertoxx<br />
<br />
Its a fun toy, casts a clickable dot that does 780 or so points and stacks with epic lvl 55 to cast and comes off Ssra High Priest. Its 2 HB though so its a real pain to use it alot. 40 dly 48 dmg but really crappy stats and like no resists. Cant compare to a 1 hand and shield stat wise. so its a toy, albiet big toy, but toy none the less.<br />
<br />
I thought gate hammer is lvl 51 to proc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You can get the worker's sledge mallet even if you are a barbarian.  You just need a monk to pull the skelly NPC who gives the quest, and Puppet Strings (drops off demi's in fear (10 charges of Charm)) to charm him and make him amiable to you.  Huzzah!  Then again the port in spot is rather dangerous to someone who is all scowls to the outpost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Bone of Bertoxx goes in range slot too. :)<br />
<br />
Jormal Dawnhammer<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>korinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I like my aon. And stalking probes if I can get my hands on it. You all forgot the funnest toy your sow boots from the epic! Now those are nice on a run and if the particals are on they can put on a show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Preserved Split Paw Eye. 5 charges of Glimpse. Drops on weakling gnolls around the entrance to paw, maybe also inside i don't remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Earring of Twisted Leaves (or something similar) dropped in Char the other night.   Not bad stats and right click for Scale of the Wolf (single target version).<br />
<br />
Taladaen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ring of Stealthy Travel.  Gather Shadows clicky ring with a 2.0 cast time.  Anything that frees up a spell slot is nice IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I agree Nagruz - one of the best purchases I've ever made and awesome on a pvp server. Any idea where that ring drops?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">LOL, that Brownie quest was hilarious.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Bexar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">No one has mentioned Jaundiced Bone Helms - with right click Charm Buff, and Jaundice Bone Arms (i think) with right click Strength Buff.<br />
