<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am I overlooking something?  I got Greater Heal at 29th level and looking at the spell list on Caster’s Realm I don’t see another heal spell until Superior Heal at level 51.  I expected this from my druid, though we just got an additional heal spell to bridge the gap, but I’d always heard that shaman were better healers, second only to clerics.  Is there really such a long dry spell between heals, so to speak?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">take a look at a druid's &quot;complete heal&quot; versus our &quot;complete heal&quot;.  You'll see that druid's heal better in general.<br />
<br />
AT44, there's now a new &quot;heal&quot; that's a mini torpor.  Its a quest only spell available in LoY (though I haven't read where the quest is solved yet.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cesta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The heirarchy of healers is:<br />
<br />
Cleric (way in front)<br />
Druid<br />
Shaman<br />
Paladin/Bard (Paladin better single heals/Bard better group heals)<br />
Ranger<br />
<br />
Shaman are basically 3rd at just about everything we do.  It's one of the reasons the class is so good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, at level 49 Paladins are about the same as shamans for healing.  We both have GH so it boils down to which is better, LOH or regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Paladins also get two new decent heal spells with LOY. One heal over time which is less efficient and heals for less than stoicism but has no negatives. And there level 51 heal which looks pretty nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
kaid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Graz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You have to look at more than just what spell they can cast as to where they rank.  The comparisson above was shaman versus paladin.   While the spell may be the same, the shaman has a lot larger mana pool and with cani a lot better way to refill it.  :)<br />
<br />
And you think it's bad now, when Kunark came out, our heal after yours was what 55 or 58?  (They moved it to an earlier spell level sometime after release.)</div></div><hr />
