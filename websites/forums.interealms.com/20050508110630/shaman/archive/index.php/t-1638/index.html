<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok..the short of the long...<br />
<br />
I've been playing on and off for about 1.5 years...started a Shammy about 6 weeks ago.  For the past 3 weeks (once I moved into my new home), I have not been able to play due to my DSL not being hooked up...and ya know what?&gt;.......<br />
<br />
No internet, no EQ urges!  Good or Bad?  Dunno.  I was always a casual player (5-20max) a week.  But I do admit sometimes, personal life suffered...as it happens to all of us to certain degrees of magnitude.<br />
<br />
Now, DSL will be hooked up next week...but again, I don't feel the urge to play EQ even when I get hooked up.<br />
<br />
Is it finally that time lol?  I've always thought of EQ as an &quot;era.&quot;  An era that was fun, and frustrating..it gave me comraderie (albeit virtual) and some good laughs.  <br />
<br />
I'm thinking of cancelling the ole' EQ account before my DSL gets hooked up....<br />
<br />
Reason?:  My life is incrementally better.  I spend more time with my kid, my Wife (questionable goodness there :) and again...not missing the EQ time.<br />
<br />
/ramble off<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for listening!<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cancel it while you can :)<br />
<br />
Seriously tho - if you dont miss it and feel your life is better without it then dont play</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gotta agree, if you feel your life is better without it, go for it.<br />
<br />
I will say this though; let it linger.  Going a couple weeks without feeling an urge to play isn't neccessarily a sign that it's done with.  You may have been just burn out, etc.  I'd suggest keeping the account for another month or so, and see if you can refrain from EQ when it's available to you.  What have you got to lose?  24 bucks?  It's worth it to be sure of how you feel about something that impacts your life for 3.2 hours a day.<br />
<br />
In any case, good luck, and I hope you make the right decision for you, and the family.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You're not cured. You're at the boards. Get a grip and do what ever you want. It's your life. Live your life as it should be lived, follow your heart, as you're a priviledged person who obviously has possibility to make the choise, would be a waste to not to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Draznar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go ahead and cancel, They do not delete your characters if you change your mind. I was down for over 6 months and all my stuff was still there. Part of me is sad, because I wanted to start from scratch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks all for the feedback.  FYI, I am strong enough to form my own plan of action and make a sound judgement in this matter, but...<br />
<br />
<br />
hell, EQ was never a great game.  Sometimes, it's even piss poor.  What makes EQ is the community..and it has a great one at that.<br />
<br />
AND THAT WHY Im still at the boards.  Hell, I'll probably stay here (regardless if I cancel or not) for the folks, the wit, and the hope that possibly I'll see some of ya'll in a different world.<br />
<br />
Still undecided on the cancelling thing.  I am privelaged enough where I don't sweat $13/month...even if Im not using the service.<br />
<br />
My cancelling would be more symbolic than anything :)</div></div><hr />
