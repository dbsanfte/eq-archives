<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to post about a nice spot I just went to. I have been to CT a few times, never thought the xp was all that great until tonight. Made the last two yellow of 56, and about half a gold into 57 in maybe 2 1/2 hours. We camped the throne room the whole time. Forget the exact levels of group, something like 65 war, 60 enc, 60 mnk, 60 nec, 58 clr, and myself. Definitely need a a 54+ enchanter for mezzing, as there are always adds. But, if you're like me, who loves nonstop action and lots of excitement with multiple mobs and repops to deal with, this spot is great. Loot worked out nice, we got about 10 vials, a mnk haste item (I think they said 35%), pal/shd gaunts, a few words, and a bunch of other junk. Had one wipe when the monk thought he had pulled 3 but really had 5 lol, including the one with that nasty AE poison rain, which is what did us in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tyrika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am curious to learn more about what kind of a group is required for this zone. I loved cazic before they revamped it but have not had the opportunity to hunt there since the revamp. I was out of the game for over a year(I quit shortly after luclin and just came back a few months ago). When I left it was a raid type zone but now I hear about people xping there. I am a 56 shaman and my regular group is a 56 rogue,55 warrior,58 cleric,55 enchanter,52 druid, and a 54 monk, could we hunt here? I also was told something about there being a chance of a death touch on zone in, is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">never been DT'ed there, and been quite a few times since the revamp. The group you describe could maybe handle the zone in, or even invis up and crawl through the maze. However a corpse run in the maze could get nasty. I've camped the zone with a 55 shammy, 57 ranger and 57 druid trio boxed so I know its doable.</div></div><hr />
