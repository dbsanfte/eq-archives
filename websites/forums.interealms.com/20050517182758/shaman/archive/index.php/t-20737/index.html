<br />
Despite what everyone says or feels about the new game. One has to see this game in action to see what an amazing game it has the potential to be. The graphics and model detail/animation is amazing. The water effects has to be seen to believe. They had a playable demo version of it yesterday and many of the webmasters for the big EQ sites were playing the game.<br />
<br />
One big thing I noticed is that clerics will not be the end all be all class for raids anymore. There are 3 priest classes....all the priests can heal for pretty much the same. They will have different abilities that seperates them each other such as better hp buffs, better regen, etc etc.. but they will all be able to heal equally. No more needing X amount of clerics to go do some raid..<br />
<br />
Iksar models look pimpin. Its cool to see your melee class draw out his sword before battle and put it back on his waist after fight is done or to hoist his shield over his back.<br />
<br />
Well Im sure the Baelish or some other website out there will have more info on thier sites soon. All I can say is I was one of the EQ naysayers but after seeing this demo, Im kinda looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">OH BOY! Eye candy!<br />
<br />
Find me a post that describes the problems with EQ1 is lack of eye candy.  I could care less if the graphics were on par with an Atari 2600 as long as its fun to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you see the voice integration video Jen? To me that makes a huge difference</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, that would be cool IF<br />
<br />
You don't have to listen to the people 15 times and can interrupt and get to the point.<br />
<br />
You speak english.<br />
<br />
You can talk back.  Yea they talk to you, you type back, sounds fun.<br />
<br />
You can talk to PC's.<br />
<br />
Those mobs that put out a message each time you engage them, then put out a message each time you kill em should be fun.<br />
<br />
Thinking bout eq2 in an eq1 mindset really doesn't make me wanna go to eq2.</div></div><hr />

That was close to true at one point during everquest as well =)  It's the upkeep and upgrading of things over the past 5 years that have hosed things.  Clerics just had big heals, shm / dru had same heals, but shm could slow so needed to heal less, and druids got better nukes / DS to make mobs die quicker and need to heal less.  Then the game evolved, and by GoD, neither of those works even remotely well.  They may do a better job of upkeeping it (if they've learned anything from EQ), but who can say.  You can't really compare the problems of a 5 year old game with one just coming out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They have also stated flat out from the beginning there will be no &quot;complete&quot; heal either and all priest classes will be able to rez</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is no longer a complete heal in eq1 and shall we talk bout complete rez or some such?<br />
<br />
There will be issues, with the amount that we know bout the game so far we cannot say that it will be good, but from what we know bout their current games I think it would be a far stretch to say that it will be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What I'd like to know is the system requirements to make the game run &quot;well&quot;, not okay but well.  That more than anything else will determine if I even bother looking at it.  $50 for a game isn't too bad really, $500 in upgrades to play said $50 game is another thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Min reqs were 1GhZ processor, 512MB RAM, DX9 compatable card (Non-MX). <br />
<br />
They were running it on a 3GHZ with 1GB RAM and a GeForce 5950 not at highest settings and having some lag in spots. They stated that with current hardware it would be impossible to run at highest settings and this is intentional so they don't have to rewrite the engine a year down the road. <br />
<br />
My guess would be min playable will be about 2GHZ, 1GB Ram, R9600 or N5600 or better. Not that bad really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They expect the average gamer to have a 3GHZ with 1GB RAM and a GeForce 5950 in 6 months?  If they push EQ2 out like they do expansions, out on time, no matter what, then they are going to find a lack of people to play it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The game could be the greatest game ever written and we still won't be bothering if SOE is behind it.  They've burned too many bridges (and continue to do so).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So it's a really pretty game, made by Sony, that requires a Cray to run?<br />
<br />
Oh and there's item decay.<br />
<br />
Wow. And to think it's only three strikes and you're out.</div></div><hr />
