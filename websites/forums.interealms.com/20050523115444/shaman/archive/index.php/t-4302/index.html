<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">if you are duoing a mob like lodizal, ww dragons, guardian wurms or emperor chottal, would you keep the melee torpor'd, or yourself? a rogue could evade no probs, but if you're a monk or warrior, it might be hard to shake agro. slow only agro's that much, JBB doesn't agro too much either, and epic takes a long time to finish.....what do you do?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">FD &gt; evade for aggro control.  When I duo with myself on shm/mnk, I have absolutely no problems keeping mob on Gathu with nothing more than malo/slow/epic/jbb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gathu how do you handle the loss of damage when the Monk is FD? Or is damage output not an issue?<br />
<br />
At least when a Rogue evades they're still stabbing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If a monk successfully FD's their aggro is cleared or at least reduced instantly, and they can pop right back up and go back to killing. With a rogue that evades they have to have attack turned off to successfully evade since it uses the hide skill. This also happens pretty fast if the rogue does it fast. My point? Both rogue and monk have to turn off attack when they fd or evade, so you lose the dps for that moment with both classes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, attack is only off for a 10th of a second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The malxx line doesn't have much of a taunt at all and sitting is just a bad idea all round, but another spell with massive aggro is the unresistable disease debuffer.<br />
<br />
But, most monks have a hotkey setup for FD anyway. Mine is called FDATTK: attack off, FD, stand, attack on. Skips maybe one round of combat. Or you can do it manually if you want to be sure.<br />
<br />
Problem i have with shaman tanking is you may have to rely on channeling to get a torpor off at a critical moment. Nothing worth than 3 interrupts in a row when you are getting quadded for 200. Also monks especially have much higher defense skills. Have to set that against the loss of melee damage from torpor healing the tank, but i usually opt for the safer but slower method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, I've got quickbuff3, so vs a slowed mob I don't even get a channeling check if I time it well.  Without it, I might want the monk to tank, yeah.<br />
<br />
It IS a huge damage loss though.  Going from 181% haste to 70% is just ow for exping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah exping sure. I can tank fine against exp mobs. But, the poster was talking about hard hitters. Also, i dont have the AA skills or the quick cast items yet, so a 6 sec torpor can be an awfully long time to channel through.<br />
<br />
BTW how do you get 181% haste? Thought it was capped at 100% except for bard songs, although i'm way out of touch with these things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, depends where you exp.  In Cazic Thule maze (which is where I do my duo'ing), I often take an absolute crapload of damage, easily as much as lodizal puts out.  2 spiders at once is just pain, especially if one is a large spider (level 58 or so, hits for like 250s, rather than the normal 200ish).<br />
<br />
General practice = monk tanks with stone stance while malo/slow go in (though those mobs mentioned (excepting chottal) are outdoors, so you can kite for slow), then shaman tanks rest of fight.  As long as you're not in danger of dying (IE:  Mob outdamaging torpor consistantly) it's better to have the additional dps.<br />
<br />
The danger of dying thing is completely conditional though, varying based on mob and personal gear...so posts here probably wouldn't help any individual poster.<br />
<br />
Haste number is using 100% as a hasteless baseline, to show how torpor doesn't just slow you down, but it takes away whatever haste you have.  181% is 100% + 40% monk epic (I'm too lazy to celerity) + 41% haste item, though that varies per monk...but then, some other shamans probably actually cast celerity for an extra 10%, so it balances out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would prolly just let the monk tank but then I am more interested in living than absolute maximum dps. But, if you really really want to taunt and get aggro just cast cripple a couple of times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you want aggro, spam the mob with your lowest level poison dot, Envenomed Breath (assuming the mob is already Crippled).  Really cheap and it makes them really mad at you.  I had a taunting contest with a warrior with a Blade of Carnage and Blade of the Black Dragon Eye who was mashing the Taunt key as fast as he could.  It was declared a tie. :p<br />
<br />
I got this from the Tips thread stickied on this forum, under &quot;Ghetto SK tanking&quot;... can't remember who posted it, but thanks.  Sweet tip. :)  Made me move Envenomed Breath and Disempower back to the front of my spellbook. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
don't know where you get this from, malosini have almost zero agro, I think it have same agro as dispell do<br />
for debuff and Dot, the cripple line and poison dot is huge agro, disease debuff/dot seen very low agro now after they fixed the slow's agro long ago<br />
<br />
as far as I know. bane of nife is highest agro spell we have, I cast slow and bane then mob will on me all time untill bane worse off, while I only hold agro for a while if only cast slow+ cripple<br />
<br />
I been try use lower level poison for cheap agro, but BoN seen have higher agro than lower poison dot<br />
<br />
when duoing with melee, I am alway keep them torpor depend on how hard the mob, and try avoid agro, even if duo with rogue, I recommend let rogue tank unless mob is too easy (I been tank for rogue to BS and die because random interupt my cast, while we can do it very easy if rogue tank); fight will be long with torpor heal, just add Pox,epic,JBBmpet to speed up kill, melee is better tank than us and tank for us to safe canni/dot. as long as you not die, you can torpor melee forever</div></div><hr />

<br />
Malosini has crap for aggro.<br />
<br />
Disempower &gt; All.<br />
<br />
I like disempower because:<br />
<br />
1.  It doesn't do any damage which can have advantages in a situation where someone is playing crowd control.<br />
2.  It casts quickly, real easy to channel.<br />
3.  It draws some insane aggro.  <br />
4.  It is cheap, manawise.<br />
<br />
PLing a rogue to 60 + 3AA so far and I have to say hands down, disempower is the best spell to keep the mob stuck like glue.  Can damn near go AFK duoing using that spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Torpor yourself, let the paladin cast CC on himself. ;) If necessary, use torpor to generate mana for a couple chloroblasts.<br />
<br />
If you want to take out harder opponents, paladin is the way to go. If you want faster xp, monk is the way to go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Teaming up with a 60 SHM We've been able to take do quite a lot. Back when I was just 55 the two of us managed to take out a yellow to me named dragon in WW and got us a few nice spells. Most of the other dragons were pushovers. Zoning into DNec Phase Spiders were easily cleared, we both tanked them. The Mice aren't all too hard if you can only get one or two at a time. We once had four in camp at one time and only made it out of that one alive because I used a clickcharge of Soulfire. (Instant CHeal, 5 charges, quested.) The battles took a while, but we both had offense and defense on our side. We both had heals. Our buffs stacked. And he can Torpor me all he wants, I just use a stun or two to grab aggro or just let my lance proc and I only have to touch the taunt button occasionally.<br />
<br />
SHM/SHD would be a little nicer just for the FD ability, but then SKs can't heal themselves as efficiently as a Paladin can, let alone heal the Cannibalizing Shaman or click off an instaclick CH for Canni5 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">how about a root?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Pallies can root, Shaddernites can snare. Both are good, but shamans can also root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Don't forget about bards and rangers.<br />
<br />
If I'm doing the tanking, ranger = the best duo partner bar none, nothing comes even close to the non stop dps a am3/eq/primal ranger can put out.<br />
<br />
Bards are also good, great ac and mitigation, perfectly sufficient hps and plus they are damned useful with songs, there straight dps isnt the best, but torporing them doesnt destroy there dps totally (dot songs or sorrowsong boots).  So if the bard is tanking against nasty stuff, they are actually quite viable (and frequently better than other more usual tanks)</div></div><hr />
