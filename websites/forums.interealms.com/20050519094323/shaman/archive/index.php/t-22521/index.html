<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The AHA fix was to return its effect to CH spells.  Mostly druids are affected by that.  I've still been critting for 5084 though today.   Maybe they finally fixed the calculation to what it should be.</div></div><hr />

Although if they change it back you can be sure a bunch of people are going to point out in hindsight that everyone should have known this was a bug.</div></div><hr />

Actually I bet that people will yell NERF! Its the knee-jerk thing to do, even when &quot;working as intended&quot;.<br />
I havent played much the last few days (I rarely do after a patch, its just safer that way) but I have a cleric buddy that told me that he critted a CH for some ungodly amount like 30k...that mob was his friend for its very short life.</div></div><hr />
