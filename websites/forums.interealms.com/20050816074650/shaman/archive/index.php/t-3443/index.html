<br />
The first time I did rak he was pushed into the water as well and wiped us (like you, couldnt get back and going before he despawned), waited about a month before I went back to fear for another tear, made sure we pulled him to a spot where he couldnt be pushed in the water from then on.  Never occured to me to ask a gm to give me the tear back, it was our fault he was pushed in, not a game glitch or anything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just got my epic last Sunday.  we had a little different problem ...<br />
<br />
Rak was up - upstairs.  we were concerned about BR repops and about dealing with his AoE in the much smaller room up there, so we pulled him down and killed him, and waited on the tear turn in for the next Rak.<br />
<br />
It just hurt to see him go down with no tear invested, but I was not about to try a turn in to a Rak that was aggro on someone already.<br />
<br />
We don't fight the BR's outside by the water, once we have broken the room just inside the locked door.  repops in the room give our suppor troops somehting to kill  8)'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I got my spear Rak fell into the water, gated back to where he spawned on the bridge and fell into the water again.  Luckily both times he went aquatic he summoned one of the mage pets, and the other two mages had the presence of mind to kill their pets and resummon underwater.  <br />
<br />
A Level 60 sk told me that when he does BRs with his guild they kill Rak without fire pets.  I can't even imagine how their tanks stay alive in the face of that AE.  I tend to doubt he was serious.<br />
