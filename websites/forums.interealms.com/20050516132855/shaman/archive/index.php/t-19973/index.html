<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I finally dinged 55 recently and I am noticing more and more lately that I no longer get any &quot;In teh Face&quot; tanking time.  I'm finally learning how to root/rot with my shammy (anathema owns btw) but I'm finding that something doesn't seem to fit...  DogDog.<br />
<br />
Sure, the pup is great for stalling that mob for a few seconds while I re-apply root, but is this honestly all he's good for?  I can't really send him in to tank the mob as he'll last about as long as a virgin on prom night.  So, my question is to you high end folks (especially the 65 crowd)...  What the heck do you use dogdog for?<br />
<br />
I obviously understand his grouping benefits, and I am well versed in dogdog pulling techniques (in which case, he's basically used as an over-glorified speed-bump), but is that all there is to him?  If so, why do you 65 folks still bother handing him pet toys (muzzle especially... the girdle makes sense to me if he's just there to take damage).  Why does it matter if he duel-wields if he's only around for all of 10 seconds?<br />
<br />
Anyway, was just interested in finding out what uses you feel dogdog has, especially when it comes to soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't used my pet when soloing for a very long time. About the only time I bring him out now is LDoN adventures or small exp groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I pretty much always either group or 2-box my warrior (or both), so dog-dog is a long-lasting dot, and giving him weapons and muzzle and all that is his version of BA4. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I mostly use him for comic relief.  People seem to be amused when he dies to single hits in Kodtaz and the mountain trials (not single rounds mind you, single hits).  Go dogdog. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are a lot of farming situations where the dog can still tank, or where he is dps while I tank.  However, for tougher mobs, root rot is really the way to go and dog is only for pulling a named or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you guys are totally bumming me out...  So unless i'm fighting putz's, I'm not going to get to use dogdog solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">okay okay...<br />
<br />
you're level 55?  Yeah there are situations you would use dogdog.  Anything that you are tanking yourself (aka mobs that summon, etc) to kill you should be using your pet to help you with.   If you are in an exp group that is stationary, using pet shouldn't be a problem.  Give him a couple weapons (even mob dropped cheap weapons you pickup as you are fighting are good enough).<br />
<br />
You really won't be using the level 55 pet to tank too much.  If you are root dotting, there is no real reason to use dog.  After you get the pet AA, probably long long in your future, your pet can be a bit more useable in more situations as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Additional dps.  Manaless dps.  Also before I had group versions of spells, I used him as my buff timer for my haste spells.  In the past I  applied haste on myself then melees and used myself as a timer.  But since I hardly meleed, I just gave it to the dog then melees and went from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Doggie makes a good timer for FA. ;) And as someone above mentioned, he's still good in exp groups. He just can't tank anything but additional dps is handy. Even doggie's weak dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Currently, I use dogdog as a distraction and DoT. I've been soloing in Natimbi and dogdog usually lives long enough for me to Malosini and Turgur's a mob, then I apply root, back up a bit and load on my DoTs before wading in to melee. 90% of the time, dogdog survives his punishment and works as an extra DoT. I just dinged 59 in other zones  so I'm gonna go back and see how well he does again...Oh yeah, exp at 59 sucks =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Balzaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I almost always have my pooch up, even if he's not as much use as he once was.  I don't tend to solo in Tier 3 much, but when I do having that furry speed bump around can be the difference in dying/gating or winning.  Sure he dies alot, but he doesn't use experience like we do =)<br />
<br />
For tier 2 solo'ing I still use him for a little extra damage.  The pooch can't tank well, but with the 61 pet regen you can send him in, let him do a little damage, and then call him back to regen. <br />
<br />
For other solo'ing areas (farming, old world dungeon crawling, etc) he is still a viable damage source and tank, and is invaluable as a greeny tradeskill farming partner.  <br />
<br />
All in all, I'm pretty happy with my pet even at 65.  I may not use him like I use to, but that doesn't mean he's not a valuable asset to my arsenal.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">So i was basically right.. He has his group usages and also can be a good speedbump for pulling purposes, but he really has no place in root-parking?  Do you even bother summoning the little bugger when soloing (other than pulling purposes)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bhone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i use doggie off and on when farming - in droga i'll summon him if i'm planning on camping a room instead of wandering from named to named.  (which is rarely, i guess)<br />
<br />
lately i use him as a true speedbump in barindu - definately the toughest solo mobs i've encountered, as i'm non-elemental.  he gives me time to VP or slow before he dies.  i like to think of him as a sacrificial ranger without a bow and who doesn't bitch about needing a rez.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dogdog = Add tank, free dps, speed bump, puller, did I mention free dps?, pull splitter, buff timer, recipient of all the gold, silver and copper I get, dps that costs next to nothing, etc, etc...<br />
<br />
Note:  dogdog tanks much better if you get a cleric to cast virt/aego/whatever on him.  I carry a bag of dots for bribes.<br />
<br />
Note 2:  I'm 65 and I tank when I solo.  Find weaker mobs or get better gear, but theres no reason you can't tank at 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am still using the level 49 puppy (I'm only 52 myself), but he adds some DPS. If I need to back up to cast a heal on myself, he's the constant root. If an add comes up, I don't have to be worried about channeling through a slow.<br />
<br />
I like him, and I've always got him out. The extra damage, the mini-tank, the free root, my companion is always there. Even in raids, I use him. If we get two, I'll sic dogdog on one, and slow the one inc. By the time dogdog dies, I can get a slow off on the inc mob and it'll be slowed by the time the mob gets into camp. <br />
<br />
More importantly though, he stalls a little time. Another speedbump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Only time i found dogdog worth it was when i first hit 34 and having a wolf following you around just looked... cool.<br />

I am serious :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've used dog dog plenty of times as an add tank in BoT, just keep a HoT on him.  When solo'ing in CT or other old world zone he can off tank rather well with only the occaisional heal.<br />
<br />
In LDoN adv's, unless your pulling you should have dog dog out.  Its good DMG, its a buff timer, it slices and dices and gives your car a beautiful glow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I usually have an alpha dog out, even if I just use him as a buff timer half the time.  He's very useful if you have an unexpected add starting to bash on you, and he (sometimes) manages to pull it off you long enough to get a slow/root/mez on him.  He needs frequent recasts in GoD so, the HP are just too low against mobs hitting for 2500 per round.  A single rampage or enrage takes him out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">No idea what you are going after at 55 that makes your dog seem worthless. At 55 the pet upgrade was a big step in ability. I was doing Nadox and Dulak boats at the time. Fully buff alpha pet and send him in to tank while I slowed/dotted mobs. Toss a Stoicism when he was at 50% and jump in to battle, letting pet attack from behind.<br />
<br />
Generally finished fight with pet back to FM and myself at 80% mana/80-100% health.<br />
<br />
At 65 I still use pet 90% of the time in groups. In sewers (GoD) pet can offtank a slowed/crippled add fairly well with an couple quick TMendings tossed in between doing my other group shaman things. Handy to keep him around for those unrootable adds when no chanter/bard around to mez.<br />
<br />
LDoN's I only cast pet and use to offtank emergencies - no buffs or weapons. Generally I have too much to do to worry about pet maintenance in LDoN. The emergency speed bump is nice though.<br />
<br />
When LFG, alpha pet can tank the worms/frogs in PoV near graveyard pretty easy if I have buffed and keep him healed. Same with droga.<br />
<br />
Rarely do I have mage summoned items. When I do, its just icing on the cake ~ pet is still a viable weapon. It just takes a bit of care and maintenence. As someone pointed out above, its like having a ranger that doesn't whine about needing a rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I imagine at 55 he is in PoP now, in which case yea, the 55 pet is abit worthless except as a speedbump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As someone pointed out above, its like having a ranger that doesn't whine about needing a rez.<br />
<br />
LMAO.<br />
<br />
I use my dog all the time when xping - any extra damage done is a good thing.  I only do small-time soloing and the dog serves me well there too (when fully buffed) - I'll usually have it tank a slowed and rotting target and toss the occassional Q if needed.<br />
<br />
It is rather sad to watch dogdog get vaporized against beefier targets though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Unless i'm in a raid situation, I ALWAYS have a dog out.<br />
<br />
Dogdog is free DPS.  I tend to tank when I solo most anything outside PoP mobs/GoD, so the dog is a buttbiter for me.  Dex your dog out (Mortal Deftness, Diaku, IoS, Kragg for HP, FA) and arm him with mage proc weapons, then turn the mob's back to him and just watch him go nuts.  The dog will easily proc at least 4 times a fight.  Once dogdog proc'd 14 times in a single 1.5 minute battle, his personal best record.  ;)<br />
<br />
Mage weapon procs aren't much damage, but when dogdog is proc'ing them over and over, it adds up quickly.<br />
<br />
And then there's the lariats from Splitpaw...  $$$$<br />
<br />
Fully buffed with my buffs and Virtue, dogdog can easily tank LDoN normal mobs, allowing me to root split up to 4 mobs at a time:  pet attack, VP, root, and only 1 mob makes it to the camp (I've really practiced this, I can park 2 mobs and pet tank one in just the time it takes to cast root, because of the no-refresh deal on casting spells after using AA abilities).  I have more than enough time to slow the mob that gets in, then turn and slow the mob dogdog is on before he takes too much damage before slowing the parked adds.<br />
<br />
This is the same trick I use to break camps in Droga and Veksar when I'm farming items, when I want to break a camp with more than 2 spawns.<br />
<br />
Just wait til you get 61 pet...True Spirit is a major upgrade from 55 pet.  61 pet is very, very nice.<br />
<br />
So yes, my friend, dogdog is an invaluable ally for me.  I feel naked and exposed when dogdog isn't up, ready to watch my back for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I use him for the outside chance that he might shield me when I need it. It's saved my ass maybe 5 times in the past few months of raiding =b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Getting shielded while getting beat on or even when canni'ing makes having dog dog around worth it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I am somewhat happy with his dps more wouldn't hurt, it certainly would be nice if he had more hp. I always pull him out in groups as soon as I can. Average group member I've parsed(in PoV) does 30-50dps, higher ppl seem to do 60-75 or so. On a good day I've seen doggy do 35dps against the golems, although he seems to average around 25-30dps.<br />
Root rotting though I'd leave the pet out, those hard hitting mobs take out doggy faster then you can blink.<br />
He has saved me a few times get an add sick dog on it, gives me a chance to slow the mob before it kills someone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I use him for the 12 dps or whatever that our crapass pets do, and as a distraction to get stuff slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">For farming stuff (Seb / AC / Droga / Veksar) and on all LDoN adventures (but don't summon new one if doggy plos enrage) I use dogdog . He is FA timer and some DPS. When I PL my ranger twink I use him too.<br />
<br />
But isn't worth to use it in vxed+. He can't hit **** even with FA / ranger buff / focus / daiku / mage pet toys. I think the proc of the mage weapon is more DPS then his slash / bite / kick.<br />
<br />
Edit: PS: I want our old pet model back. Was SOOOOO NICE to see newbs asking dogdog for SOW. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I always keep the dog up, even if I was root rotting.  He's not the best tank but will often buy me enough time to root or slow anything such as adds etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Farming items from low blues/light blues, yes.<br />
<br />
Raids, hell no.  Not worth the extra worry of keeping him under control for that little bit 'o DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>gin_juice68</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I am still a little young at the shammy thing. But i play on Tallon Zek and dogdog is a great little distraction for PvP. But i use him most in LDON when im too busy to get in there and melee. Solo not a lot unless like i said it is a popular spot and PvP is usually around. I think that he too much of a mana hog to be casting all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">When I soloed around your level, I didn't use the dog.  <br />
<br />
It was actually faster and more efficient not to deal with summoning/buffing/healing/resummoning, etc.  It would depend on how long a session you would solo for, imo.    <br />
<br />
Stoicism and Anathema and lot of other things didn't exist then, so things may have altered those dynamics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I use him mostly in LDoN as a healer basher. He seems to help interupt those annoying cleric-mobs. Honestly, without mage toys, his DPS is so trivial that I just don't bother in EP Xp groups. I also use him for farming, of course, and anywhere I will be meleeing (duoing in Sol Ro, or something).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Puppy and I go everywhere together, save for raids unless I'm specifically asked to pull him up. He loves a good crawl through Droga, and can tank a mob there NP with usually just one cast of Q (buffed with FOS, Boar, Replenishment and Wrulan) and a couple daggers (if you don't give him daggers he whines). Puppy tanks LDON normal mobs NP, which is nice for the little monsters you can't root (he singlehandedly won an adventure for me after our MT died and I was stuck with a cleric, two druids and a wizard!!) -- he keeps them busy all by himself (with the same buffs I mentioned above and something wimpy like Heroism). Sure, he can't tank POP mobs real well, and there's a lot of things he can't do real well. But for me, I agree 100% with Binter -- I feel naked and exposed when puppy isn't up, ready to watch my back for me.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kenneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I still use my dog quite a bit...<br />
<br />
I use him soloing in Droga, Siren's Grotto, PoS, and PoV.  With a hp buff, quies, and regen, he almost never dies.  He's enough dps (with 2 weapons) that I'll never pass him up.  And, we can share hits if the situation calls for it.  If one of us needs some time away from the mob I just root the mob and get out of the way, or back him off and sit him down.  I find that letting him get the beat down can save a lot of mana too.  If he will live through the fight without a heal (or can finish the fight without a heal), I won't waste it on him.  Once the mob is dead, he regen's super fast sitting on his own.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried him solo in HoH or Tactics yet, but in experience groups in Tactics, he seems to last reasonably well on his own when an add needs off-tanking (once it has been slowed).  He also off-tanks fairly well in BoT.  For certain summoning mobs, he is the perfect solution.  You won't get summoned while the mob is rooted and the dog is on it.  Quiescence is usually essential for that.<br />
<br />
I also always use him in LDoN's.  I want to maximize what I can contribute to the group, so I use him.<br />
<br />
When the mob hits extremely hard, he becomes less useful.  And, as I gear up and move on to harder mobs, I think I will put him away more often.  But, for moderately hard-hitting mobs, he can take the punishment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Why &lt;i&gt;wouldn't&lt;/i&gt; you use Dogdog?  The only times I wouldn't use dogdog is in raid environments with mobs that AoE.<br />
<br />
Dogdog has 3000 hps.  He enrages at low health.  Give him Focus, SltW, and FA and 2 rusty daggers and you got yourself a 40 DPS DoT that you can for the most part control.  And it's persistent.<br />
<br />
I've seen dogdog not even sweat while intercepting adds in Tier 2 zones, sometimes even Tier 3.  Group pulls 2, I send dogdog after mob 2 as it's still incoming to separate the mobs, then I Malos/Slow both mobs and 99% of the time dogdog lives through the punishment.  We dispatch the 1st mob and go join trusty dogdog on the 2nd mob.  A Q or Tnarg's will keep him standing long enough.<br />
<br />
Ever pulled with dogdog?  Neat trick.  Say yer solo'in in a dungeon and 3 mobs are close together.  Turn on pet taunt.  Sick dogdog after one of the mobs and hope that he taunts immediately.  This will usually pull one mob out of the pack, 'cause the other mobs don't regard dogdog as a serious threat.  Pull dogdog back immediately after the taunt.  Voila, single pull.  I've used this in spots, although in others it's not been successful.  Just gotta play with it.<br />
<br />
He does a good job of running interference for adds, especially in dungeons...<br />
<br />
Use him as a speed bump on a semi-tough named pull, if ya gotta.  Pull named, sic dogdog on him from a distance, then use the time to Malos and by the time dogdog bites the big bone you've hopefully landed a slow.<br />
<br />
He's great for farming in low-level zones.  Just sic dogdog on everything in sight and loot.<br />
<br />
Dogdog is also helpful against caster mobs.. since he can bash.  I've seen dogdog bash a gating or CH'ing mob and keep him from finishing the cast.<br />
<br />
People laugh at 40 DPS, but hell a lot of the 60ish paladins or SKs or warriors I've grouped with hardly average that...  it's just silly to disregard 40 DPS.  My 63 monk with fairly decent gear averages 80-90 DPS... dogdog is half that.  Monkey boy does 150,000 total damage over a few hours and dogdog does 75,000.  Why would you ignore 75,00 damage?<br />
<br />
I love my dogdog; I think you are foolish if you don't use his utility or if you disregard him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Puppy is a speedbump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">He has a variety of uses.<br />
<br />
If you are soloing, depending on what you are fighting he is often more trouble than he is worth.<br />
<br />
When farming mobs of the appropriate level he is great for interupting mob casting.<br />
<br />
In groups you can use him to add some dps or to slow mobs down in bad situations briefly. I often use him as a timer for FA. However, if your group is frequently invising to move along (as you might in GoD for example), then he is likely not worth the hastle.<br />
<br />
On raids he is a waste of time, you more pressing things to worry about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Ok folks, I am not saying I don't use the dog.  If you reread my post, I specifically give him credit for pulling purposes and all grouping situations...  I know what he is worth there.  Also, if I'm tanking in the face, of course I'm going to use him for the dps.  I understand his farming value... I'm not complaining about any of that.<br />
<br />
I have started hitting harder swinging mobs thought (in pov and such) and I didn't know if there was a way to make him worthwhile in a root/rot situation (other than being a speedbump).  THAT is what I was asking... and it looks like the answer is no.  He's good for stopping the adds for a second, so you can malo/slow... cool.   In that situation, do you still bother to buff him/give pet toys?  or does he die to fast to warrant the mana/pp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Also, there is a big difference in strength of pet between the 55 dog and the 61 dog.  The dogs up to level 55 (which you'll use 'til level 61) are mainly a joke...  very weak.  The 61 dog is a considerable jump in strength.  Not anything like the top SK/Mage/necro/BL pets... but at least somewhat respectable.<br />
<br />
I can't remember the exact numbers, but the 55 spell summons a dog that is something like level 41 or 44 or something...  <br />
<br />
The 61 spell casts a level 58 dog.  Just a huge jump in levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Yea, basically doggy has very little role in root rotting nasty mobs.  But he could save your arse if you mess up or get an add, especially if enrage kicks in.  If a nasty hitting mob starts running you can send in your dog too.<br />

Against normal mobs, doggy is a lot more useful.  Say you get a buncha adds, and one is hurt and can summon.  VP it away, and send doggy at it, and it will not summon anyone since your doggy is next to it (root rules... closest = highest agro).  This works with spellcasting too (except when they try to root, nullify, mez others).<br />
<br />
Here's a random neat pulling trick I've used that I've never heard anyone mention before.<br />
<br />
When you type in /pet sit, your dog stays in place, even after you /pet kill and /pet back off (it'll stand there where you said to back off and not return to you), until you say /pet follow me.<br />
<br />
I was outside the locked door leading to the library in Chardok once, and I tried /pet kill Overking.  He was too far away, so dog didn't do anything.  So instead, I turned taunt off, pet sit on, and told dog to attack something between Overking and I, backing him off before he agro'd that mob.  Then, dog was in a position closer to Overking, and /pet kill Overking worked. :)  Of course, this was just to experiment-- Overking killed doggy too quickly for me to pull with this method :)<br />
<br />
But I guess I would call this the incremental extended range pet pull (IERPP for short) :).</div></div><hr />

Rooted mobs hit nearest target so they will nail your mutt and at 55th there is nothing for exp that won't annihilate him in a round or 2. The doggy is a mobile dot only, useful if snare kiting with a partner or group work as additional DPS, but as a tank he simply isn't worth casting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I'm level 65 and I still use dogdog as a tank in places like Inner Acrylia.  You have to root the mobs to keep their agro on the pet, but with VP (and clickie root for those that have it) its no problem.  The mobs there are dark blue but they hit like wusses.  Most of the time I need only one Q for every two or three mobs, as long as I remember to keep regen up on pet.  I'd use him in drooga also only I don't have suspended minion yet.  And like everyone else I use him in groups for extra dps.  Only place I don't use him is root rotting in the planes, where the mobs hit too hard to make them worth tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">in the 55-63 push, dog dog was invaluable as extra damage, especially soloing in teh face.

<br />
Well, sure, a level 40 dogdog won't be able to tank a level 58-60 PoV mob that hits for 400-600 any more that you would be able to tank them yourself. I think it was in PoN, when I was solo tanking 330+ hitting Wraiths at level 57, that I realized that &quot;in the face style&quot; of Shamanic solo tanking was not going to be a good option beyond Tier 1 PoP and neither would be pet tanking.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just out of curiosity, what are you trying to root/dot solo in PoV at 55? Level 46 Dire Charm critters at the GY? I am not sure it's a good way of XPing -- you could probably do much better grouping in Tier 1/2 or soloing in the Old World. Heck, I remember parsing the 55 pet doing pretty consistent 30-33 DPS to Velks spiders from behind, which is pretty good for a manaless DOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Sirens Grotto is one of my favorite places to go for solo work, if I log on an hour before raid starts, or if I'm on early in the day when its hard to find enough people for a good group.<br />
<br />
Zone in from Cobalt Scar, make dog, buff with haste and FA.  Never need to give him anything more than that.<br />
<br />
Kill bulthar; kill walrus; np.<br />
<br />
Now its time to get in the water.  All the fish and seahorses sea invisible.  None of them can be rooted.  Impossible to root rot these mobs.  <br />
<br />
One wanderer there that paths from below your ledge north to the waterfall and back.  One static spawn in the tunnnel leading east.  Wait for wanderer to head north.  Target static spawn below you.  /pet kill.  Jump in water.  Malos.  Turgurs.  (With turgurs alone mobs are slowed 80 pct of the time.  I've never had a resist there after malos.  So I almost always just lead with malos.)  Mob comes and hits me twice.  Dog keeps attacking, wait 2 seconds swim 15 feet.  Quiescence pet.<br />
<br />
Kenober will tank the mob comfortably, chewing away steadily.  When Kenober gets to 50 pct, cast Q again.<br />
<br />
(I have a Pet Q hotkey that I use for this, btw.  First line is /target Kenober [have to retype new name each time, wish there was coding for My_Pet_01].  Line 2, 3, 4, all identical:  /pause 3, /cast 1 (Quiescence).  Automatically overcomes fizzles.  Line 5:  /assist.  Puts target back on Kenober's mob.)<br />
<br />
And I let ol' Kenober tank the mob all the way down to about 75 pct.  <br />
<br />
Then I add Bane.  After about 3 ticks of Bane, I cast Blood of Saryrn.  When Bane wears off, I recast it.  The mob now aggros on me, but it will be at 30 or 40 pct health, and dropping fast.  I tank it for 3 slowed rounds of melee, and it's dead.<br />
<br />
Because it's underwater, it is very hard to channel when you are taking hits.  There are a few corners you can back into, but on a flat wall you will skid to one side or the other almost every time.  <br />
<br />
So I'm glad for Kenober to take most of the hits, so I can do the casting.  <br />
<br />
If the wanderer comes back before the static mob is dead, he'll probably aggro.  I've learned to watch for him, but sometimes he still catches me by surprise.  When that happens, I just train the add onto Kenober.  Now he's tanking one slowed and one unslowed mob.  I hit my Pet Q hotkey.  Then I cast turgurs on add.  The add now comes after me, and I tank it Kenober keeps working on the original mob.  With Quick Buff 3 I can take a hit from my mob, count to 1 to make sure I've stopped moving, and cast Quiescence in 3 seconds, just before I get hit again.  That keeps both me and Kenober in good shape.<br />
<br />
Almost all the fish and seahorses can be single pulled, and Kenober will tank them just fine, with you slowing and healling, saving the dots and their aggro till you can rip the mob down from 75 to zero in about a minute.  But you will get wanderers and adds.  Including Fellspine, from time to time.  But Kenober can tank him too, the very same way.<br />
<br />
This basic setup works in Griegs, in Inner Acrylia, in Droga, in Veksar.  Probably in Velketor as well, though I haven't tested it there.  It's not as critical in a lot of places, where it's often easier to root rot.  But the principle remains the same:  with Quiescence running, the top shaman pet can tank a slowed mob in these zones with no problem.   <br />
<br />
And underwater in Sirens Grotto, if you don't have your pet tanking, you are not going to be able to cast.  <br />
<br />
I look at it this way.  No matter how good a soloer you are, there are some zones you can solo, and some you can't.  Same with ol' Kenober:  there are some zones where he can't tank, and other zones where he does just fine.</div></div><hr />

He can probably tank in areas like Dulak, Nadox, etc.  The 61 pet is a much better tank.  If i'm LFG, especially early in the morning/afternoon when it takes longer to find groups, I'll head on down to droga and sometimes camp runri.  I pull up dogdog, focus him, haste him, give him 2 weapons and he tanks for the most part.  He also takes the annoying HT from runri/ph tho it drops him down to like 30% so I Q him before he goes in.<br />
<br />
I pulled him out in a BoT group the other day and with 2 rusty weapons, focus, FA (use him as a timer when there are only 2 melee's) he was only pulling in about 20-25dps.  He missed the BoT mobs a lot.  Still that was dmg we wouldn't have had otherwise.  Might have added enough so they cleric had to cast one less heal cause the mob died faster.  He sure doesn't hurt.  Unless he's going to be a liability or after a death in an ldon (where time is important) I'll always pull him up.</div></div><hr />

Pet DPS varies a great deal just like PC DPS varies. When my Monk is tanking your standard high-AC Luclin mob with no ATK buffs, her DPS goes way down. When she is hitting a low AC mob in the back while  oozing ATK buffs, the DPS goes through the roof.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Flogg Lheggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">So I finally dinged 55 recently and I am noticing more and more lately that I no longer get any &quot;In teh Face&quot; tanking time.  I'm finally learning how to root/rot with my shammy (anathema owns btw) but I'm finding that something doesn't seem to fit...  DogDog.<br />
<br />
Sure, the pup is great for stalling that mob for a few seconds while I re-apply root, but is this honestly all he's good for?  I can't really send him in to tank the mob as he'll last about as long as a virgin on prom night.  So, my question is to you high end folks (especially the 65 crowd)...  What the heck do you use dogdog for?<br />
<br />
I obviously understand his grouping benefits, and I am well versed in dogdog pulling techniques (in which case, he's basically used as an over-glorified speed-bump), but is that all there is to him?  If so, why do you 65 folks still bother handing him pet toys (muzzle especially... the girdle makes sense to me if he's just there to take damage).  Why does it matter if he duel-wields if he's only around for all of 10 seconds?<br />
<br />
Anyway, was just interested in finding out what uses you feel dogdog has, especially when it comes to soloing.<br />
I am lvl 55 and I always use doggydog. I almost always give him some mage summoned toys as our group has a 60mage who gives of his mana freely and if no toys, he gets the first 2 weapons off the mobs we fight.. There has been way too many times that the group or myself solo, have been given enough time to zone or gate when things go real bad. This alone warrants his existance. Also, with a little buffing, I notice the hit messages that doggydog is triple hitting upto 50 or 55. With haste mask on and spirit buff, can hit quad 50's if not better..This is a good DoT that helps save mana and aids in whatever battle he engages in. I have even had melee's in group comment that doggy was hitting harder than they were and if adds happen, he can tank for several minutes(with a heal or 2), giving the melee's time to finish off their mob. keeps the adds off the chanters and clerics with his taunt. Sure he takes damage, but thats what he is there for..better him than you or your group. Doggiedog is in the house and here to stay ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">when you have canni, and therefore an almost unlimited mana pool, summoning dogdog is far from a waste of time. for the mana it takes to summon him (if you have scm3), you cann5 once and make up the summon, fos, and swift like the wind. granted, i usually load him up, but even then it takes 3 mins max to be back to full health and hp, and that's assuming you're talking heavily in tells or guildchat.<br />

It is all worth it for the pet DPS.  May not be the best, but it's free, and low mana to sustain especially at your level.  Don't expect dog to hold aggro for the first portion of the fight after you stack DoT's, I'd just keep it rooted... but he should hold aggro for the latter portion of the fight, as well as finishing the mob off as it runs.<br />

Puppy's basically a DoT when alpha'd and given Haste, and at your level, very low mana is used to keep him at high health.  He should also be able to easily finish runners at that level.<br />

In my opinion our dog is a Great help. With the right buffs and the use of Q he can hold his own.

Dont misunderstand me..I can and am able to solo with pups, but I have a strong and active guild and have grouped with the same people for sometime and several toons now.  Soloing requires several minutes regen time between fights and can usually handle single mobs at a time..Experience does not come as fast solo as it does with a group of 6 with a cleric and a couple casters backing up a melee or 2. I can gain an AA point every couple hours with a strong group, of which Doggydog is an active member. When the MA pulls 5 or 6 mobs at a time, I usually pick a stragler and sic pups on him..Dot him with a couple of my best and throw in a slow when I can. We hold our own until crowd control has been achieved and assistance rendered. I even have time to throw a slow or dot on several mobs others are fighting to help them out, while puppykins hold aggro until I finish and can help him. I like meleeing and helping puppy myself..It ups my defence stats and gives me something to do during fight. Shamans rock..Shamans with pets rock and roll :D</div></div><hr />
