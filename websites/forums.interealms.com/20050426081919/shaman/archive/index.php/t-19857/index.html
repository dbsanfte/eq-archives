<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello:<br />
<br />
Did this camp for about 6 hours to get my monk the Spiked Seahorse Hide Belt (34% haste).  Thought I'd relate the details since it is an easy camp and has the chance of some nice rewards.<br />
<br />
The belt is really the only bazaar loot to go after since all the other drops here go from 1pp to 1000pp in the bazaar.  Vendor loot ranges from 4gp (the swordfish bills) to 140pp (flawless gems).  The belt goes for 50k on my server so getting it is the goal.  The belt is the rare off of a named seahorse, Fellspine.  Droped for me on my 4th spawn but I've heard the drop rate is more like 1 in 8.<br />
<br />
The team I did this with is a 65 monk and 65 shaman.  Under 100AA each and bazaar geared.  This can be soloed, but it will be difficult.  The mobs hit in the 200s and are fast.  The seahorses and swordfish also are immune to snare and root.<br />
<br />
First, it is best to have an EB item.  You will be fighting very near the surface at all times, but surfacing risks agroing the bulthars and walruses.  These aren't that bad to fight, but they run at low health.<br />
<br />
The break-in is easy.  The entrance to SG from CS is safe.  Buff there and pull the 2 mobs that are at the ledge to the water.  Go to the left most spot in the ledge and jump in the water.  Make your camp there.  Only problem I had with the camp was the occasional train from people coming from WW.<br />
<br />
From this spot there are many seahorses and swordfish that can be pulled.  There is a single wanderer, but it doesn't path to this spot.  Fellspine can spawn at any of the static spawn points under water, so your goal is to keep as many clear as you can.<br />
<br />
Pulls will generally come in pairs.  They can be split, but with a duo it's better just to fight them.  Slow will land 75% of the time, or 100% with malos.  You want to be sure to keep agro of of the shaman since you get pushed a lot under water and spell interruptions are common.<br />
<br />
If things are going bad then jump up on the ledge.  If you are still at the far left end then you shouldn't agro any mobs.  The water creatures won't come up after you.<br />
<br />
Experience here is about 20% of an AA per person per hour.  I didn't have KEI and I dotted with BoS in about 50% of the fights.  I would expect XP to go up to 25-30% if I had KEI and mage toys for my dogdog.<br />
<br />
There are several other named that spawn on the ledges around here.  Nothing of note drops off of them, so not worth the effort.  By staying focused on Fellspine you can expect to get a belt in 5-10 hours.  This was worthwhile for me since I didn't want to pay 50k for it, but I'm not sure I'm going back to camp another to sell.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />

P.S. Getting to CS is now easy since the PoM entrance has been moved to the bottom of GD.  From the ZI in PoM you can run due north and click on a tree just before a spawn point to be ported to the middle of CS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice post, and great tip about getting to CS easily, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Which tree is it? just run north once you get in and click on first tree?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its not a tree, head north clicking in front of you after you zone in, theres a patch of ground that is the zone out.<br />
<br />
Be careful tho, as you end up where the named dragon roams in CS :) (i.e. in the middle of the water).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That dragon has never lived for very long, though, since he drops a 36% haste cloak.  I have trio'ed him 2x.  Chances are he won't be up when you zone in.<br />
<br />
The click-in from PoM was a great tip, though.  Didn't know about that.  It will save me logging in my wiz to port my duo CS to go WW for dragon slaying, which is still hella fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The cs dragon isn't very tough, kelorek dar is the name i think. Pretty decent risk vs reward if ya ask me. Also drops sea dragon meat for the othmir prexus totem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, i know he has been duo'd, just a warning for the unprepared :)</div></div><hr />
