<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ethari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">the Last part of the quest says to turn in the items to the Great Oowamp or someone on FV docks... For an Iksar both are KOS aren't they? Also cant seem to find Army Behemoth's in CoM are they over by the Stables area?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Behemoths are Golem looking things by the reavers. You have got to have at least one group to do these.<br />
<br />
Oowump and his band of raiders should not be KoS to you, as he is on Venril Sathir / OT faction. I could be wrong about this, as I don't play an iksar and don't know the base factions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Great Oowomp is neutral, any race can do the quest with him. It's only the surrounding Ogres who will be KoS, they are on Venril Santhir faction. Barbarians and Vah Shir have the option of doing the quest in FV or with Oowomp.<br />
<br />
Army Behemoths can be found inside the temple downstairs (3 spawns), on the roof of the temple up the back ramp (3 spawns), and inside Lhranc's house (2 spawns).  They are an uncommon spawn, so you just have to keep killing the placeholders until one does.  You will not find an army behemoth in the stables area -- it's too low level for them.  They can also sometimes be found up on the wall or in the reaver castle, but those places are hard to reach unless you're raiding black reavers.</div></div><hr />
