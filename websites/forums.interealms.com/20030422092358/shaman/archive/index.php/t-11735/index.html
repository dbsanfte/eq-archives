Hey there, in all my tries..i have NEVER seen a shammy pet be affected by giving it any weapons or armor. Ours are totally unaffected by feeding it weapons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have seen my 34 pet dual wield.  Give your pet a one hand piercer and a 1hb (rusties are fine for this test) and you will see that he will both pierce and crush.  The off hand attack is rare so I believe his dual skill value is low but it is there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It gets better as you get to the higher level pets.<br />
<br />
At 55 my pet duals just about every time he swings.  I always cary a few gnoll hide lariats and dragoon dirks with me and will give one of each.  He slashes and pierces.<br />
<br />
As far as armor goes...unless its mage summoned why would you give it to the dogdog?  Even then I dont think that they will use it.  Not positive about that though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes our pets do Dual Wield.<br />
<br />
Use the search feature and look up Project Alpha.  Project Alpha is the &quot;Code Word&quot; we gave this undocumented feature when we were not sure if SoE meant for our pets to have it or not.  We feared that if it was unintentional that SoE would nerf it.  Still have not gotten word from SoE, but ability is fairly widely known so we hope that SoE will let us keep it.<br />
<br />
From what I have read, Project Alpha will give our pet 15% more damage.  As the other poster mentioned, you can test this by giving your pet 2 weapons of different types.  The weapons MUST be of the Primary/Secondary type and one handed obviously.  Damage and Delay have no effect, but the weapons will Proc.<br />
<br />
I have not noticed any benefit from armor, though the Mage summoned Muzzle of Marduk(sp) will grant pet haste.  I also have read that buffs other than direct HP, haste and maybe AC buffs have no effect on pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Easy way to tell if dogdog is dual wielding: <br />
<br />
Give him a piercing weapon and a slashing weapon, and look at his damage output. If you see<br />
&quot;dogdog pierces mob_67 for 34 points&quot; and<br />
&quot;dogdog slashes mob_67 for 51 points&quot;<br />
type of messages, chances are hes dual wielding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Eh, heh.. stupid question.  How do you turn on pet melee spam?  I've gone through my filters, and can't figure it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it would be right click on display window and check in &quot;filters&quot; somewhere. I do know that you have to be standing pretty damn close to dogdog before you will see his melee spam</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you have to turn on &quot;other's hits&quot; unfortunately.  There isn't one just for pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I never really noticed with my 44 pet but give my 49 pet 2 weapons and his damage output increases significantly + more battle spam. Seems like he's dual wielding to me and boy i'm glad he does :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Remember that the pet is a warrior. If you give him weapons that a warrior cannot use he will not use them. He will also proc weapons based on his level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shjekai, I'm sorry, but you are flat out wrong.  Our dog is not a warrior, it is simply a mob.  I soloed a lot in Sebilis and give my dog SBD's (serrated bone dirk's) for the snare proc.  SBD's are rogue only weapons.  Don't be fooled by misinformation.  You can give him any kind of weapon: 2h, 1hs, 1hb, piercers, he's not very picky about type or class.  Add buffs and haste and he'll proc like mad.<br />
<br />
To answer the orignal poster's question:  I can't confirm this, but I believe that our pet always dual wields.  Best/easiest way to confirm this is to give him two different types of weapons, rusty dagger and rusty sword works fine.  Make sure 'others hits' is on and check it out.  As you get higher and higher pets he'll get more attacks and do more things, like kick and bash.  And yes, our highest pet (the spell is level 61, the pet is level 58) bashes like crazy and indeed interupts spells.<br />
<br />
IMHO our pets really suck 'til you get the highest one  :(  But the wait is worth it, our top pet is pretty effective.  He has around 2300 hps, super fast regen.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xlitherina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The pet needs warrior specific weapons. Try giving him a dagger of dropping, and you will not see him pierce, nor will he proc it.<br />
<br />
I have noticed a difference in procs when I cast a dex buff on the pet. Without it, he procs weapon procs less. This works with Focus too, which I cast on him when I solo. Without some kind of dex buff, he WILL proc less. When I'm grouped, I just cast my highest single shot dex buff on him, and some haste =)<br />
<br />
I remember reading somewhere (I wish I could remeber which forum) that the shaman pet CAN wear armor with stats, and gains a benefit. To refresh your memory (and maybe help mine) they summoned the lowest level pet and /dueled, then cast a nuke on the pet. Then they gave it some armor with STA and HP stats, and nuked again for the same amount of damage, but overall less % damage was done to the shaman pet. Bah, I can't remember which forum...old age is creeping in it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Goredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Our pets can't use 2 handed weapons. Only 1 handed. Every 2 handed weapon I have ever given him he eats.</div></div><hr />

Naw, he is a warrior.  He can just equip non warrior weapons.  He'll even move to guard you if you hp drop low enough.  That's a warrior trait if I'm not mistaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">almost makes those dragon horn yaks worth something.<br />

I believe our pets are a medium race, won't use large or small race weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The armor DOES make a noticeable difference in dogdog's ability to tank.  Full set of plate, yeah, it matters.   ;)<br />
<br />
Mage-summoned weapons also do a fine job of upping damage - the swords have a VERY nice proc vs summoned creatures.  Try this on rockfiends in the Grey, try this on the trial of exe in PoJ (half those critters are summoned...)   REALLY looking forward to the Fists of Ixblat - 3 levels to go.  :)<br />
<br />
Mages in particular make noises about their earth pet, for all of its other virtues, having a really horrid agility.  Buffs help.</div></div><hr />
