Nothing like calling people stupid and tossing at people that spent real life times, sometimes hours and hours to get screwed over by SoE. Good job numb nuts.<br />

People were able to get some boots with an instant sow, grats to them. More SoW boots avaible = less sow request when I'm in a city :D.<br />
<br />
Fabled JBoots with SoW is overpowering, unbalance the game, screw the shamans like nothing else as we were the only ones who got such item while we are doin our epic, nerf it quick. Only shamans should obtain such power, no others, only shamans. (please, note the sarcasm ;)).<br />
<br />
Nerf come, SoW boots aren't SoW boots anymore and some stupids close minded shamans are HAPPY for a NERF ???<br />
<br />
That we cry, whine, request some stuff like heal upgrade, canni upgrade, dps upgrade, pet upgrade can make sense, but this ??? geez...<br />
<br />
Sure, the fabled Jboots was really a pain in our back, something who unbalanced us far more than before... Everyone should thanks SoE to save the shaman class with this nerf (again, note the sarcasm ;)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">lol, the only issue I had with the fabled Jboots was the annoying people in PoP spam clicking them on anyone that was nearby.  ;)<br />
<br />
Actually, I saw no reason to nerf these, but I knew a nerf would be on the board the instant I saw the link for them.  I knew people who could cast SoW would be screaming.  Druids loudest of all.  ;)<br />
<br />
IMO they should have fixed our black fur booties to be targetable and left the Jboots alone.  No particular reason, I just would have liked targetable clickies, so I could clicky SoW pets so they could keep up with the group on the move.  ;)<br />
<br />
And if they didn't, no biggie.  I can always click myself, and that's all that really matters to me.  We can just suspend our pets or wait for them to catch up.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fabled mith 2 hander went from +41 attack to 41% haste.  That is a step down in quality for most people that would be using it (36% haste being much easier to get than significant +attack for most people who would be using this).  Not that this was unexpected (old mith 2 hander was +haste, and 41 looks like a haste number, not an attack number).  I still feel for those people who camped the fabled mith and the fabled fbss.</div></div><hr />

I'm horribly sorry if you have to keep memming sow whenever some buffbeggar or group mate wants to run as fast as you. Personally I'm happy about this nerf, yes HAPPY. It lets me retain that little 5% edge in speed over all non-bards, which also happens to be about the very last edge I have in the pvp game.

EQ should never take PVP into consideration when balancing IMHO. Its an add on, and poorly done. You cant land a spell on anyone with semi decent gear, and you are worried about SOW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">That is exactly why I am worried about sow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">That is exactly why I am worried about sow.<br />
<br />
<br />
When your best ability is to run away, thats sad. Give up, and stop trying to screw with the real eq. Why dont you ask for all resists to be removed from VT+ gear while you are at it? PVP in EQ is broken, and shouldnt stand in the way of content, class balance, or gear upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I don't think the fabled jboots were a necessary part of either content, class balance or gear upgrades. Totally disregarding my pvp issues, the item is quite to the contrary unbalancing and needed a nerf. <br />
<br />
An item should, imo, never feature a spell that is part of the regular class spellbooks AND have that spell as instacast. Either a) reduce the effectivity of the spell, in this case 5% speed reduction or b) introduce a cast time on the item. <br />
<br />
While this specific item might not have had a groundbreaking effect on the (pve) game it is still a dilution of class interdependancy and how the so called 'balance' works. As much as we all hate buffing random people, pimping out buffs in infinite amounts to everyone who takes the time to camp the boots is not good. If you take it to its extreme you won't be needing any buff classes at all. Ever take a minute to wonder why half the shaman buff spellbook is useless? It's not only a result of capped stats due to insane gear. <br />
<br />
There is a plethora of items out there that render very many buffs superfluous or even subpar. Avatar proc weaps, wist-ful tunic of the void and pom flowers are a few examples. <br />
<br />
The pvp aspect of the game which I speak of just makes this problem all the more apparent due to its competitive nature. I'll admit I'm a radical pvp enthusiast that would love to see a number of changes to EQ to better the pvp game, but I ALWAYS take the non-pvp game into consideration when making suggestions and hammering on SOE to think about them. <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but very often the non-pvp players seem to forget that pvp is not the only thing we do. We know the pve game too. Pvp is a subset of pve and could not exist without it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, this is turning into a total out of topic rant from me, but I guess you struck a nerve. I just think it is really sad that the pvp game is not taken into consideration when introducing new items/effects/abilities. It would be so very simple to put in safeguards against them being exploited pvp-wise without altering their usefulness in the slightest for the pve aspect of the game. We are not a majority of players, but we are still paying customers. The argument that 'pvp was an afterthought' is a pretty poor one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">For a shaman, PvP is totally broke especially if your opponent has VT/Time/GoD stuff (aka pretty good resists with no buffs).<br />
<br />
On people in Time stuff, druids, wizard, enchanters and even necros don't have too much problems to land their spells.<br />
With just their spells and/or innate abilities (so no other clickies or special items like pumice) :<br />
<br />
A druid can DD or DoT me with no big troubles.<br />
An enchanter ? Not much more problems than a druid.<br />
A wizard, I can resist his big nuke pretty often, but the lures goes in with absolutely no probs.<br />
A necro can DoT me with absolutely no problems<br />
A bard kick me pretty bad and very quickly<br />
<br />
On the other side, except Malos and ID, I'm still waiting to land any other debuff, DD or DoT on them.<br />
<br />
I don't know if the PvP Arena follow the same rules than the Zeks servers, but if it's the case... I'm damn happy to be on a blue server ;).<br />
<br />
Note that it wasn't true fights, just some tests to feed my curiosity. We were all standing in the arena casting spells at each others... just to see which ones lands or not.</div></div><hr />
