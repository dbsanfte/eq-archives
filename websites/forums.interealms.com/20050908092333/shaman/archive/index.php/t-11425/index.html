<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Liley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am only a lvl 42 Shaman, but have been getting great experience with no faction hits at the beach south of the Gunthak Lighthouse (killing Nifiliks, cast aways, mosquitos, undead trolls and skellies, etc.).  Have been soloing and playing with RL family and either way, seems to be great  :) .  Some plat drops, as well as some apparent quest items (none for Shaman that I have seen though), and cash items.<br />
<br />
Always fun to hit the new places too :D !  Please respond if you have other places in that area to go ~ would love to check it out.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I read this post, at lvl 38 headed out there, must say xp was great, maybe 2% a kill easy for fairly underconned mobs, however, after dinging 43...xp dropped hard. So im off to find a new spot, however id recommend the beach ehre for any soloing shammy 39-42 very fast xp for me. There are otehr places to hunt in Gunthak but requires a group ive found as its hard to get solo/double pulls ends up being many.</div></div><hr />
