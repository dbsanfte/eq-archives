<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lucy says this:<br />
<br />
Slot  	Description<br />
1: 	Increase Disease Counter by 18<br />
2: 	Decrease Disease Resist by 55<br />
6: 	Decrease Poison Resist by 55<br />
<br />
But.. what the hell is this?(see Attachment)  (a friend of mine linked it from his guild chat)  Did sony forget to change the string data ingame for it? or is Lucy Way off base?  And did this already get mentioned? heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, SOE forgot to change it. Friend of mine got this last night, and immidiatly sent me a tell &quot;Hey, did we get a new Disease slow?&quot;. I said no, I dont think so, and a bit later, he told me the story. He casted it on himself. The Lucy data is correct. Just one of those text bugs that slipped through the cracks. As more and more shaman aquire this spell, it will be /bugged and /feedbacked plenty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, i've been using the spell on a lot of named fights, depending on how long the fight is and stuff like that, and it def is something that doesn't affect slow speed, but affects resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ahh cool.  Was in CoD with friends busting up Bert's buddies trying to get my epic drop, and it was linked in their guildchat, and they were asking what % my new oow slow was... and I was like.... uhm... you mean the rune type one (was thinking of vindictive spirit), and they linked that heh.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the clearin up for sure though, since I lack most of my 66's :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some descriptions of spell effects are messed up atm. For example Pure Spirit is described as a group spell, but it isn't. Think that comes from the copy-paste job they did with our PoP spells to create those new OoW spells.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Malicious is unresistable while Putrid can be resisted, that isnt a typo on lucy's part. I confirmed this last night while dealing with a raid mob that has refused my shm slows 95% of the time for the past 2 weeks. Finally got Putrid and was looking for to showing this mob who the boss was.<br />
<br />
Had to use Malicious in order for Putrid to land. Even with a full debuff spread on the mob, no form of dslow would land any better. And magic reists are so high on this mob, it makes you recall what tov was like back in the old days.<br />
<br />
In the end, Zacherasi the ancient is still the shammie's daddy. Not immune to slow, but just a waste of time trying. Putrid was little help. This spell wasn't a huge oow spell but I had hopes that it might be useful once in a blue moon. Would be nice if we got some additional debuff or slow in oow. Appears this spell was aimed to help shms land dots in oow, not slows.<br />
<br />
Just don't spend your hardearned plat on the minor runes, spell isnt worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Zellucheraz the Ancient is resistant but we've never had a problem getting him slowed so far with Turgur's/Nihil.   I personally like Putrid, definately makes some mobs much easier to stick DoTs on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't get the point the point of doing Malicious Decay and then doing putrid decay.<br />
<br />
Malicious Decay<br />
Slot 	Description<br />
1: 	Increase Disease Counter by 9<br />
2: 	Decrease Disease Resist by 51 (L63) to 55 (L70)<br />
<br />
Putrid Decay<br />
Slot 	Description<br />
1: 	Increase Disease Counter by 18<br />
2: 	Decrease Disease Resist by 55<br />
6: 	Decrease Poison Resist by 55<br />
<br />
They are both going to debuff disease resist by the same amount or very close to it and the added poison debuff isn't going to help a disease based slow land any better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They stack with MD and Malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Should stack with malos but shouldn't stack with Malicious Decay. It should overwrite it since it has the disease debuff in the same slot,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It definately does NOT stack with MD.<br />
<br />
[Tue Oct 19 20:50:28 2004] You begin casting Putrid Decay.<br />
[Tue Oct 19 20:50:30 2004] Your Malicious Decay spell has worn off.<br />
[Tue Oct 19 20:50:30 2004] Ansdaicher the Ancient's skin becomes slimey and translucent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And I use Putrid Decay for both the DR as well as the PR for DoTs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gesundheit the Ancient and his brother, you slowing them sitting in his hitbox? Not sure if I have slack tas/hos/sina debuffers, but what I've got loaded to slow Zellucheraz tends to just make me recall how much I hated ToV.</div></div><hr />

Malicious Decay<br />
Slot 	Description<br />
1: 	Increase Disease Counter by 9<br />
2: 	Decrease Disease Resist by 51 (L63) to 55 (L70)<br />
<br />
Putrid Decay<br />
Slot 	Description<br />
1: 	Increase Disease Counter by 18<br />
2: 	Decrease Disease Resist by 55<br />
6: 	Decrease Poison Resist by 55<br />
<br />
They are both going to debuff disease resist by the same amount or very close to it and the added poison debuff isn't going to help a disease based slow land any better.<br />
<br />
Main reason this spell is garbage, its resistable and only brings poison counters into the picture. You can actually need malicous to get putrid this to land, b/c putrid checks disease, malicous is unresistable. Spell is meant for dotting, not slowing. Its a sorry spell. Our magic dots bounce and have nasty refresh rates, Poison bounces, no prob cast again. Who would have an extra gem to keep this mem'd either.</div></div><hr />
