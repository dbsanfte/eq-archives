<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bastia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all I have made my first Shaman and now am level 9 almost 10 so I am going to start looking to group some. I have only played a warrior before so I have a question about my spells. When I join a group what is a good procedure for handing out the buffs but not going to 0 mana? Should I only buff the tank and myself to time the buffs and hand out buffs to others after my mana has returned? Or would it be better to hand out all my buffs and med for a pull or two till my mana is back? Or even dont cast all my buffs but just one or two on everyone?  I am still learning about mana managment and wanted any suggestions! I dont want to buff everyone then have to sit there while the pulls start comin. My reaction after playing a warrior is to jump up and wade into the fight Lol. Thanks for any help you can give me!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If at all possible, spread them out, getting whoever needs/wants each one.  So buff one type first, then wait a few mins and get the next buff and so on.  Get the most important things first, haste and hp (you dont have both of those yet) and sow if you are outside (and possibly agility if anyone is below 75), everything else is just icing.  Always buff yourself first so you can time when everyone elses buffs are going to drop.<br />
<br />
When you get to higher levels group buffs will make it easier to buff all at once should you elect to.</div></div><hr />

mmm froggy shaman.  I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I join a group, I give Regen and Haste to the main tank and Regen and SoW to the puller. Between pulls I dispense my remaining buffs one at a time, but only to melees. I'll only give Casters HP/STA buffs, and only if they specifically ask for them.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm still not 50+ yet, so I'm sure it's much easier to manage your buffs once they start coming in handy group form. :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>schuleta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One thing to remember at 9th-10th level is that Inner Fire is a very mana efficient heal. It won't stack with a cleric's hp buff though.<br />
<br />
If you haven't gotten your Group STR buff, go to shadowhaven and get it, Talisman of the Beast.<br />
<br />
When I first join a group and start to buff, I would buff MA and puller first. Then after the first pull start dishing out buffs to every one else. After the first pull, AGI for everyone. After the second pull, STA, etc. That way they were staggered. Granted I didn't give the casters many buffs, but all of the tanks got pretty much everything.<br />
