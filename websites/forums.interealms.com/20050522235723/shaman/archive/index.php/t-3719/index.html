<br />
Second attempt last night, second win. Not bad. One thing im not clear on still. <br />
<br />
His manadrain AoE. Is it resistable? I heard scattered rumors about using an instaclick to negate it. Eh? (btw I hate my telescope and I hope Grachnist the Destroyer is swarmed and beaten by millions of brownies since he refuses to give me an earring)<br />
<br />
Anyway. Seemed pretty easy to slow, both times, however I think I have just gotten lucky. Other 2 shamans there last night were getting alot of resists. Malo/tash/bard debuff. Couldnt get malosini to stick. Had a chance to pop out at the end and drop a few partially resisted ice strikes, otherwise I sat back and healed and kept the debuffs timed. <br />
<br />
A shaman there won the hand of the master, nice item with spell haste 3 on it.</div></div><hr />

I did get hit full on with his aoe innitially whilest landing the original slow.</div></div><hr />

Only tried turgurs once, bounced.</div></div><hr />

Thats cause you got hit for real. You were suffering from the effects of the AE as it is suppose to do. The trick is not to get hit. ;) <br />
<br />
The &quot;bug&quot; comes from getting a &quot;false&quot; ae effect icon when you really weren't hit. Hence the right clickers, or spell casting to force a mana bar update.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ahhhhhhh ok then thats what they meant. Thanks!<br />
<br />
Did I mention how much I hate my telescope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you have NPC Spells set to on, his AE will hit you through walls (not fake AE). Turn NPC Spells off and you will only get fake AE. <br />
<br />
On the bright side, now that Bazaar works, buying a Goblin Skull Earring is easier. I saw 3 for sale in Bazaar on Drinal last night, one for 5k, I think the highest was 7k. Having some sort of instant cast buff is essential (not just for Aaryonar), so you may as well get an earring, or do coldain 8th ring quest, those are the 2 easiest to get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you mean in the chat filter? whoa is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">wasn't that fixed Jing?<br />
<br />
anyway the ae is resistable, but it's class 6 lure, so don't rely on doing it heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Personally i've always had NPC spells turned on but i've never actually gotten hit by the ae around the corner. I have gotten hit for real several times tho and man that thing is annoying.<br />
<br />
As far as getting the &quot;fake&quot; ae what happens is your computer isn't as inteligent about figuring things out so it says o mob x cast spell y and I didn't get a resist msg so i must have gotten hit by it and gives you the icon and starts acting like your mana is draining. The server on the other hand goes ok he's around the corner with a wall in the way he didn't get hit. You client thinks your mana is getting drained away but it isn't. Any spell cast or even attempt to cast spells causes your computer to get the mana amount from the server again. Instaclicks even jboots are enough to get the mana info refresh from the server even tho jboots don't actually cast.<br />
<br />
Cann or other fast casting low/no mana spells work well too. Yalp for clerics for example if you don't have an instaclick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Orakul, it wasn't fixed last time I tried it. If you have npc spells on, walls won't block his AE.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, I don't mean that if you turn npc spells off it makes you immune to his AE. If you stand in plain sight of him, you will get the real AE no matter what your settings are. If you are behind the wall, you need to turn off npc spells, or the wall won't block the AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Did I mention how much I hate my telescope.<br />
Since you only need the spell-cast and not a buff slot filled, use your Black Fur Boots.  No one else gets spammed either, which is another benefit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For some reason, I thought that bug had been fixed also, Jing.  Have you done Aary recently?  Perhaps I was mistaken.<br />
<br />
At any rate, you don't technically need an insta-click--the insta-click are just much easier to do as they have no cast time and you can rush out and re-slow, etc.  As mentioned, canna will work, or any right click item, including a JBB (if you can use them).  Just duck out of anything with a cast time.  As a matter of fact, even though they can't be used in ToV, right clicking Jboots, or Black fur boots (or whatever the vendor jboots are called) also refreshes the mana bar even though they won't give you SoW in ToV.<br />
<br />
Think of Aary as doing 2 different AoE.  The direct line of sight is a true mana sieve--you won't have any mana at all shortly after being hit, and it's not a refresh problem.  You really are out of mana, and basically cannot get more mana until the DoT is gone.  If you still have the DoT and burn a mod-rod from a mage, it will give you a little mana, but most of it will disappear on the next tic of the DoT anyway.<br />
<br />
The other non-line-of-sight AoE is also a manasieve, but it's a wierd one.  Your mana will decrease exactly the same as with the direct line of sight one, but when you use a right click, or successfully get a spell off, it will refresh your mana bar to where it would be if you hadn't been sieved.  The reason everyone should have a right click, is that if you are waiting between casts, the false AoE may get your mana too low to cast something.  If that is the case, you have to have some mana free spell or clickable to refresh your mana bar.  If you don't, you might as well really be out of mana.<br />
<br />
Summary:  have a right click item to refresh your mana bar (Black fur boots), and don't get hit with the direct AoE!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What I do when fighting Aaryonar:<br />
<br />
- CHA buff in top slot. Keep CHA memmed. Have an insta click ready (Black Fur boots are fine, even if they don't work).<br />
- Make sure KEI and important buffs are not in top 2-3 slots.<br />
- Have a group member healer (who hide from AE anyways) keep dispell up.<br />
- Run in for slow/malo. If you get hit by a real AE, get out of AE hit zone. Ask for dispell.<br />
- Canni 3-4 shots, recast CHA and  you are ready to go for next slow round.<br />
<br />
Aaryonar is hard to slow, you need every possible debuff. Fun fight though. One of the more challenging fights in ToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I dont like Aary...I'm always told to spam slow til hes slowed after resists debuffed and I then I see this.<br />
<br />
Aaryonar yawns.<br />
You have been slain by Aaryonar.<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">hehe always us veeshan shaman it seems, I always hit myself with torpor before attempting anything too hurty usually :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Durnitol Tuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I couldn't seem to manage to get slow landed on him before his AE hit me, so by the time i go to recast, im oom. What an annoying fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Zorlac, one thing I have noticed about dispelling onesself ( or a  group member doing it for you ) is that it has been skipping the first buff and going for the second (cancle magic)<br />
<br />
?? anyone else notice this?<br />
<br />
*edit* and btw, im guessing his aoe goes right for your CHA buff first like yeli's aoe right? So his debuff overwrites CHA and then should be in the first slot for an easy dispell.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">ahh vyemm.. i have one of those stories.. So im debuffing him got all the debuff's on then i try to cast..<br />
 I start casting and boom. Get shot up into the air.  Im thinking hmm..  its was interrupted... Nope. i Get near hima nd cast and he start hitting me like crazy i slowed him and didnt even know it. <br />
<br />
OUCH!<br />
<br />
Btw a rogue who has poison skill can slow him way better then a shaman. SO get a damn rogue with some poison skill =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the reasons why I keep junk buffs on the first 2-3 slots when fighting Aary is because dispell is not reliable to take down first buff/debuff. And you are correct about CHA, it's to prevent KEI from being overwritten by Aary's fake or real AE. It is also good to have it on top spot for easy dispell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I fought Aary again tonight with the guild.  It went well for a change, and he went down on our first attempt with minimal casualties.  Maybe none actually . . . I don't remember anyone needing a rez.  <br />
At the start of the fight us shamans went out and Malo/sini slowed him.  I alternated sini and turgurs until someone landed a turgurs (wasn't me this time), then went back behind the corner to fix my OOM problem.  I had the manadrain buff icon on me.  I used cancel magic right after I cast canni4 for the mana to cast cancel magic.  The timing had to be right to get cancel magic to go off, but I got the aary dot cancelled, then pressed Canni5 button and torpored up again.  I was back at 50% mana in under a minute including a few torpors to groupies.  From there it was just heal duty, heal whoever screams  and keep my group alive (no other healer in group).  <br />
We had to reslow once during the fight, and that drained mana again.  Good thing canni5 was back up by then.  <br />
<br />
I dunno, Aary fight is about positioning and good healing support at the start combined with a good debuff team.  Then it's just being able to keep it up for 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We killed Aary twice today (hurray for patches) and yes he does do the fake AE through walls still. If you have npc spells off, you get fake AE, if not, you get real AE through the walls.<br />
<br />
As a side note, never ever ever allow your enchanters to Dire Charm hatchlings for pets. Ours did and during pull the AE aggrod pet, which Aary killed and then ran straight to the camp of casters and AE'd us all right at the start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">DCing hatchlings is tre mal.<br />
<br />
We had one pull all 4 of eashan's guards on us...FROM THE STAIRWAY...not even the ramp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Moogalak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Aary's fake ae doesn't actually overwrite KEI<br />
<br />
It wont show up on your client, but its actually there. You will also not see the benefit unless you cast a spell or hit a click item.<br />
<br />
Aary's ae doesn't hit you if you are around walls, this is what I mean by fake. You still lose mana on your client, but server-side its still there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Moogalak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Oh and if you dire charm hatchlings, don't dire charm ones that ae, silly :p<br />
<br />
Their ae's go through walls too, but their fake ae even adds agro. Not to mention its range is rediculsly large.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Landragoran, you need to work on your Quake Skillz. :p<br />
You should be able to strafe out, cast and get back hidden without ever getting hit with his AE.</div></div><hr />
