A fellow shaman and myself were kicking around the idea of stacking damage shield on ourselves and having critters attack us without slowing them. I actually tried it for laughs one time, using the DS on regal band of bathezid and a skin of flame potion in Howling Stones. With a bit of luck in the channeling department you can keep torpor on yourself and not die horribly and the 56 damage total a pop adds up fast. <br />
<br />
Yes, this is a risky and expensive way to kill things, but it's pretty damn fun.  Might work also well in the Grey against all those horrid PR-resistant mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what other damage shield lines would stack with Aegis of Bathezid and Skin of Flame?</div></div><hr />

I did this on freeport guards when I was trying to raise my defense. cripple them and let them hit away ;)</div></div><hr />
