<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PanzerCat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, this 65 shaman has finally descided to make for greener pastures..  I still love the game and will occasionally play my alts, but my days of slowing/semi-healing/buffing/ and meleeing like a drunk cheerleader are over.  Atleast I can use him as a bot... Its a shame I never really got to experience GoD as a shaman, but getting a group there was just too much of a pain in the bottom.  Nor did I ever get my epic..32 trips to fear over the years and never once did I get that magic number to roll..Thats a bit disapointing... I have enjoyed it and have made some really good friends, who will understand when they dont see my shaman running amok any longer...Nor will they hear Train to zone!  I am the conductor!  Tickets please...... To those of you on Drinal, if you see a severly twinked out Ranger named Gathous go tearing by, a train of mobs hot on his heels, feel free to say hello..  Enjoy the game, and for what its worth I wish you all best of luck..Take care..<br />

/em closes the door quietly behind him, and quietly slips off  into the fog, whisteling a sad dirge as he fades into the mist.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best of luck to you. I myself have fallen in a similar situation and done something i thought would never happen in my EQ career. I swiched mains and made Maitz an alt making my twink necro my new main. I played Maitz for 2 years now enjoying playing him very much but after playing him for a couple of months only on raids having great time with a necro in between i thought what the heck. <br />
<br />
I'm not retiring him completely i just thought i can spend my DKP on a necro better. After i got used to solo the hell outa stuff with a necro i just couldn't bring myself to solo with a shammy any longer.<br />
<br />
Maybe if things change in the future i'll reverse the change ...</div></div><hr />
