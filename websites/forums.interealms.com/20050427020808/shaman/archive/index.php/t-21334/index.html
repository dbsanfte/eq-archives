<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, EP flagged and geared shaman. I need more AA's. If it's a spell, I got it. If it's a focus, I either have it or can get it. (Hell I have my ceramic gavel of justice near perma-equipped, and thank you tribute, for the BA4 withot a crappy bracelet.) I still have my JBB, epic, and other toys any good shaman has, and others should get. <br />
<br />
Here's what I am looking for....<br />
<br />
Boring XP away from the masses. <br />
<br />
Things that come to mind... <br />
I actually liked the katta guards. I spent a level and a half there. 6 pulls, all died in just enough time for repops. Not super fast, but at least steady, very low danger xp. Now, they are lb, and it'd take ALOT longer. <br />
<br />
PoD, well, overcamped at the flies, but I did quite a bit of time there. More dangerous than Katta. <br />
<br />
Would like to find a few spawns that take just long enough to kill for repops, dont care about loot, and as long as they are not lb. I want as little risk as possible, something where I can slow-dot-dot-sic dog... alt-tab work on a web page or other project, my timer go off, alt-tab, finish fight, pull next. With little worry about my death, and where my dots and dog will just about finish off the target, even if i have to refresh them now and then. <br />
<br />
I know, alot to ask for. I could care less about loot, I have enough of that, and the only real upgrades are raid targets. Just want boring xp that I can get with as little hassle as possible, preferably away from the masses, like Katta was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you compleatly defy our logic of soloing! love the high risk, nice loot, great xp!! hehehe<br />
<br />
to be honest anywhere in luclin with dark blue mobs...maybe over the invis bridge in Deep, deep in fungus grove (not sure on cons there), hoh isn't to tough really kind of crowded though, ssra mines, chardok perhaps, deep seb, droga, castle 2 in fire (higher risk but if you time VP /shrug.), some spots in poi, deep Hole, hate...<br />
the list of trivial xp/risk mobs is rather large.  i thinking finding stuff that doesn't flee will be your hardest problem :)<br />
enjoy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The following might work out for you:<br />
<br />
<br />
 As the previous poster responded, The Deep would be good.  Gotta cross the invis bridge and break a camp, but after that it's cake.  Go further into the tunnel to get a camp with only a few mobs.<br />
 Root-Rotting the halflings along the castle wall in PoM is decent also.  Once slowed they are cake. <br />
 Droga is also in this range and has some nice drops to boot.  Just be sure to get to a spot where there aren't any wanderers.  I've had issues with them gating and bringing back friends.<br />
 Veksar gobbies may be mostly LB, but the faction for turning in the weapons is good.  Possibly some of the camps around the merchants would be good.<br />
 1st tier planes are easy, although booring:  PoN hedge zoneout, PoI Factory, PoJ basement, etc.<br />
 Sans Dog-Dog you can root-rot in PoV, HoH, PoTactics, etc.  Probably a bit more interactive than what you want though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It sounds like you want to go somewhere where you can set up without roamer concerns, and have a series of mobs to take out that are drk blue, and if a loot drops, that's okay, but not necessary.<br />
<br />
I'd say Veksar...<br />
<br />
Coming right out of the water tunnel, set up in the corner.  No aggro/roamer concerns at all.  One mob in that room with you, and 4-5 in the next room.  Animist/Feral Lord spawn for possible loot, if you can kill quick enough.<br />
<br />
Another spot might be the Undead blacksmith, upstairs from the clerks.  3 spawn, with a safe med camp spot upstairs around the corner.  You should be able to pull all these single, and the repop will be about right for root rotting, if you don't want to worry about healing doggie.  Grab some pet weapons from the bazaar if you're going to use dogdog.  It will really up their dps, and are better than the weapons you'll take off the mobs.<br />
<br />
You'll need IVU potions to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Inner Acrylia.... it's out of the way, dark blue mobs, a few named spots, and usually empty. You can walk around pulling singles, and if you need an afk you can park in the far corner of the jail where no wanderers go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Nadox area right before the entrance to Hate's Fury, but not sure of a safe spot to park if AFK.  In Hate's Fury itself at the zone though you will have to break the room.  The mobs don't hit as hard as the PoP mobs, but do have somewhat-sizeable HPs.  Currently, there is an xp bonus in the LoY zones, too.  Fun places and mostly deserted.  Entrance area to PoTorment is doable, easily AFKable, and empty, but very boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The reason I am looking for what I am is I do some game programming and now have the added job of web admin for my guild. We are doing a TOTAL revamp, and also, my other work has it's concerns too. Presently, I leave my bazaar bot up, but would rather earn a bit of aa xp than pp.<br />
<br />
Kromnik kinda had the right idea though, a few mobs, db, enough to kill and have repops handy so there's little downtime, with no wanderers, and prefer single pulls. Something that doesn't flee is also a concern. I'd be alt-tabing in and out now and then to make sure my dots are running, or to loot/pull next as neccisary. Don't care about big bang for the buck, just something I don't have to worry about death, prefer something I could tank down (if slowed) and have doggie be able to handle it if i get on a run, and forget to check back quickly. (When I hit a mind-spurt and hit a groove, i kinda loose track of time...) Which is why the Katta guards were perfect before they went and got lb... the only roamer never added, all singles, if i wanted, i could pull with slow, and check back in 10 mins or so and doggie was standing there, a corpse beside him.<br />
<br />
As per PoF, HoH... sorry, root-rot isn't something i wanna try with this, or I'd be at the picnic tables. Root breaks early, or i forget to check back in time, I get to go loot my corpse and ask for a rez. <br />
<br />
Think for stihs and giggles, I'm gonna try deep deep dulak caves. I THINK those might be db still. <br />
<br />
As per PoP, not much I can afk and slow tank without having to check back regularly and heal myself a few times. <br />
<br />
And yes, mage toys for puppy will be in order.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps the ideas, and as per Veksar, for my intents, I'll give that room a try (I think i've killed just about every named in Veksar a few times, 'cept for the dragon). Things hit a bit too hard for good afk-tanking if i remember right. Been a few months though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
The reason I am looking for what I am is I do some game programming and now have the added job of web admin for my guild. We are doing a TOTAL revamp, and also, my other work has it's concerns too. Presently, I leave my bazaar bot up, but would rather earn a bit of aa xp than pp.<br />
<br />

A camp where safely AFK tanking dark blues at 65 isn't easy to come by.  You might find a 1-3 mob spawn somewhere, but I can't think of one.<br />
<br />
PoNightmare INSIDE the Hedge is absolutely free of trains, and you can take it as fast or as slow as you want.  All the static spawns are easily single pulled, and you can generally stop wherever in the hedge (outside of spawn points) for a break as long as you need.  The experience inside the Hedge on trash mobs is much better in my experience than fighting mobs out in the rest of Nightmare.<br />
<br />
Drops from memory are blood raven parts, ribbon chokers, and maybe a few other unimportant bird/nightstalker parts that you can either vendor or bazaar vend, depending on whether they are tradeskill components or not.<br />
<br />
With EP gear you might be able to afk a blood raven once slowed, but I wouldn't try it.  They are trivial fights for me on my mount though tanking in the face - I can easily read a story to my kids, feed the baby, or watch a movie while killing there, though I can't completely ignore what I'm doing or I will die.  My gear is fairly good for being outside of the EP's, so you should have an even easier time of it.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Deep dulak caves is a bad idea, IMO, and I've done it.  So, here why.  All the mobs there run when low health.  Not good because the others are packed in tight and you will get adds.  When I fought there I had to root everything at 20% health.  Fun area, though a bit unnerving at times, not good for afk fighting.<br />
<br />
I'll say again and you'll just have to try it.  Deep nadox or Hates Fury.  Given what you have stated now, I'd say HF.  Take 20-30 mins and clear the entrance room and then you can take solo repops at your leisure.  All mobs are DB at 65, I was there two nights ago.  Good XP, good loot and pretty darn safe once you've broken the room.  Try it and thank me later. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mileron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm gonna try deep deep dulak caves. I THINK those might be db still.<br />
<br />
Very few are dark blue down in the deep caves at 65.  A few green, most light blue, with only one or two darks thrown in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And yeah, i had a mind slip after working a 16 hour day... meant Nadox (where the luggalds are, same side of bridge as HF, other end of zone.)<br />
<br />
Will give HF a shot, someone said there's a nice camp on the other deck, and gave me directions. Will give it a go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mileron, not true about Deep.<br />
i was there 2 or 3 days ago and invised the entire way to the mean mobs close to ssra zone (don't pull these btw, even nonafk you get adds that can potentially kill you...no comment on how i know this...).  over the bridge most mobs tend to be dark blue with a few light blue occasionally.  not sure if the thought horror guys flee, but anything super dark blue is gonna rape him if he tries to afk tank them so he is pritty much restricted to nonpop/god content.<br />
if you don't beleave me invis up, you can run by 90% of the see invis mobs before the bridge, and head into the back.  i am positive most of the stuff is dark blue there (with no greens at all, other than pets.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">To clarify for the people at home, any mob in the deep can pop as see invis. So it can take a while to invis/clear if nobody has gone through befoer you, or if there has been an AE group in the area. Once you've cleared it once, they'll usually pop as a normal non-see invis mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Akheva Ruins has not been mentioned so I will.<br />
<br />
If you have a VT key you already know the place.  Easy single pulls at the zone in.  Mostly safe. Mostly DB.  Good exp bonus.</div></div><hr />
