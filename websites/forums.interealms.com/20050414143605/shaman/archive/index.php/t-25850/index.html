<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have a retired shaman on dro server, but im considering trying to play on a zek server. <br />
So i was wondering if anyone (properly some one that have retired from eq1, have a shaman about the same level as mine on a zek server, that they would let me try it out on.<br />
i guess i just have to move my shaman if noboby have a shaman i can borrow.<br />
I know this is pretty much against the EULA but besides that ;-)<br />
feel free to PM me.</div></div><hr />
