<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Because the lower cannis are short casting time, you can actually get them off in between ticks.  The server only checks for whether you are sitting and medding at 6 second intervals, so if you time it right you can stand, cast canni, sit before the next tick, and get the benefits of both canni and medding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I made a macro for Cann. Don't remember exactly how it went but basically.<br />
/sit off <br />
/cast 2 (or whatever spell slot your Cann is in)<br />
/pause 25 (this changes depending on which Cann you are using and what its cast time is)<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
Hitting this macro will make you stand up, cast cann wait until spell has been cast then sit down again. Play with the pause time to get it down to as close to the cast time as you can. <br />
<br />
If you are on a horse you don't have to worry about the Cann dance since you are always &quot;sitting&quot; so always get the med tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">does this happen to anyone else....on the tick regen, or when canning, the health and/or mana bars dont move at all? im using the default screen, no ui installed or anything, maybe thats it. but there are a lot of times where i canni, lose the health, and mana bar stays exactly the same. or at a tick when im regening, ill only see the health bar move and not the mana, or the other way around. i realize its such a small amount, and originally thought i was just missing it, but i have seen it move plenty enough to know when it does and doesnt move. also thought it was lag or somehthing, but it dont ever move at a later time, and i never seen a double regen tick after it happens. any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I’ve noticed this as well, but I don’t think it’s a bug.  Our health and manna bars just display a percentage of our health and manna, not actual numbers.  So sometimes, when we regenerate some health or manna the amount we regenerate is so small it doesn’t change that percentage enough for it to be displayed.  I bet if you watch you won’t see this happen twice in a row.  That’s just a guess on my part, but it seems a reasonable explanation.<br />
<br />
I’ve not played with any of the UI abilities of my interface, as it seems to be a lot of trouble to mess with every time there’s a patch.  But I think I’ll search for some kind of change for my health and manna display.  Watching those tiny bars for changes is giving me a headache.  I either need a larger display or one with numbers, or a combination of the two.  It would make my life as a shaman so much more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />
