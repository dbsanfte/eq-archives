<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Munkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play on the Test server, and people are scarce which most of the time is nice, but is hard for groups. I am wanting to know where would the best place to go for exp soloing at 31 would be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">my baby chanter (33 currently) hunts the tizmaks in GD.  You could probably solo somewhere inside the cave..walk around and check things out as you are non kos to start.  The entrance would be hard but doable, my chanter has pacify but root also works here.  Of course with the chanter i'm charming a coldain or giant, but its decent exp per kill (nearly a blue per on the higher level tizmaks).  They hit for 60s so its not too rough, and they have around 800-1000 hp.  Watch out for the shamans as they run at sow speed and like to cast sow on their buddies.  Jboots speed is enough to outrun a sow'd tizmak though..so you should be fine.<br />
<br />
You could also try cougars in iceclad.  I did this with my shaman.  Pulling during the day is a bit rough, and you have the chance of running into rude druids charming (they seem to like to pull trains on you for some stupid reason :/ )<br />
<br />
Marus seru is an option..stonegrabbers should still be dark blue to you and plentiful.  Recuso's are definitely dark blue up to yellow and red..although i've never hunted them, but they make great chanter pets :)<br />
<br />
You could try The Overthere...are some mobs at your level range, but you need to pull them to the sides of the zone or face tons of adds.  Rhinos run at near sow speed..so careful (faster than jboots anyhow).<br />
<br />
Once you make it to 34 pretty much all these zones are great, and become a heck of a lot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">DSP there are a shrrom camp you can single pull near SS (SA?) zone</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">shrooms are really good exp.  The shroom palace in dawnshroud might be a bit much since its hard to single pull sometimes...so try the camp to the left as you zone in from netherbian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One of the reasons I'm enjoying marus seru with my little bard is the Recusio.  Not to hunt, but they'll attack either of the two agressive critters in the zone - the lightcrawlers (who don't blind, but are faster than selo's),  and the zelniaks.  I see groups in there pretty regularly, but it's not crammed full of kiters, like Dawnshroud.</div></div><hr />
