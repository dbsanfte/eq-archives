<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Anonb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I hit 20 in FoB yesterday with my Iksar Shaman, with barely anything on me. So I went to ec, and sold everything I had, and was actually given a Slime Coated Harpoon. So this is where I'm at, 800pp and a Harpoon. What would be my best course of action from this point about equipment? I was looking into the Scaled Mystic, may do those. But any suggestions would be great. Thank you again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">banded armor and the highest ac/hp rings and the best shield you can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mutkuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I suggest Scaled Mystic for every slot possible then get banded armor for the rest, so buy a full set of banded (about 100pp) i can make it for you if your on Solusek Ro, Then 5ac 55hp rings, about 200pp each so thats 500pp gone 300pp left, so do somthing like orc fang earrings, 50pp each 200pp left, how much do CGS sell for these days? anyways buy one of them if you can or mabye a Crested Mystmoore shield i saw a guy selling one for 50pp the other day, that would leave money for spells and etc.<br />
