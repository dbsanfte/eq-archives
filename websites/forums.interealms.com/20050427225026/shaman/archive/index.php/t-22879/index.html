<br />
I have read about every hunting guide on these forums but whenever I saw something in tier two and up I just skipped it.  Can any of you give me a &quot;quick and dirty&quot; list of places where, 1) I can solo, 2) I can heal a group, 3) I can go with a full group (with cleric and tank).  I will do some going back and reading the forums, but I want to jump in as fast as I can right now.<br />
<br />
Also - I am looking for a good site with maps of these zones.  Finally have new places to explore!  We went into BoT with a top group and got an aa in about an hour.  That is such a relief considering it had been taking about 4-8 hours depending on group in PoI Factory.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">3) BoT is the only zone that opens up at lvl 62+ for the non flagged<br />
There's a discussion about BoT here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=22611)<br />
<br />
1 &amp; 2) Lower Tier PoP zones that you've already been to. PoI, PoV, PoN, etc.<br />
Droga is still my favorite solo'ing spot.</div></div><hr />

I am planning on soloing the golemns tonight.  Anyone have onfo when looking at the Valor map from this site where they are and what to look out for?  I have read all the threads about how to deal with them, but not sure where to look for them, or what to avoid.<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The rock guys are all around the area labeled Wastelands.  Follow the route as depicted on the map, while avoiding the undead camp.  <br />
<br />
There are two typical group camp spots on the Wasteland side: East Wall and West Wall.  Sometimes the area by the &quot;locked&quot; door is camped also.  <br />
<br />
Be extra careful with spiders.  They are very MR, hit extremely fast, and procs stun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>janribet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The spiders sound like PoP Firiona Vie spiders.  Thanks for the info, I really appreciate it.  I will let you know how it goes.</div></div><hr />
