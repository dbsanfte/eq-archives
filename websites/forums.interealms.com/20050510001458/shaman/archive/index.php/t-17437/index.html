<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, <br />
<br />
  I've been noticing something terribly annoying since the last patch. Unless I'm getting beat on at the time, I'll usually hit Cann5 then quiessence. It's always worked perfectly but since the last patch unless I wait a about 2 seconds after casting cann5 and my spell gems refresh, I'll get that annoying 'spell recovery time' message and my Quiessence won't cast. Anyone else notice this or am I missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've also seen it a lot before the 30 min maintainence they did Friday Morning. Haven't seen it much after that, but then again, haven't played much since then either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It just occured to me that I also got Quickbuff 2 at around the same time, about a week ago, so this is the first time that my casting time is down to 3 seconds on Quiessence. Dunno if that has any impact on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its a bug with QB. I am not sure when it came about but was at least 9 mounths ago or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This has been happening to me since i finished QB3, so it's been there many many months.  Nothing new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yep, been happening forever.  Cast Q first, then hit can5.  Slightly safer that way anyways.  Been happening at least since I got qb3, about 8 months before I retired (and ldon went live).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its a bug with QB. I am not sure when it came about but was at least 9 mounths ago or so.<br />
<br />
Not just a bug with QB, it's with casting too fast in general.  I have 30% beneficial spell haste from item, but no QB AA, and I get this all the time</div></div><hr />
