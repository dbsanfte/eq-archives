<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't participated in the betas and also haven't read much about them. My question to those of you that have is which will you be playing? <br />
I know I'm going to end up playing one or the other eventually, and any advice or opinions would be appreciated. <br />
<br />
here's where I'm coming from as far as EQ goes...<br />
<br />
I love the shaman class, but hate how they have been 'nerfed' (through not being balanced appropriately with newer content) and reduced to a less than desirable group member. Example, our initial utility was based on one ability, slowing, which other classes (ench, bst, to some extent bards) have to a near equal ability, w/out beefing us up in other areas. Follow that with mitigating slows to the point that there is no practical difference between the effectiveness of the slowing classes. This pretty much limits the need to have a shaman in lieu of the other slowing classes, any of which bring more to a group than a shaman does (cc, mana regen, superior dps, etc). This has been posted here a million times, and all of you know this, so I'll drop the rant.<br />
<br />
anyway, I have a lot of doubt regarding EQ2 based on my experience with SoE over the years. is that misguided? are they building something with promise, or just more of the same? <br />
<br />
and for WoW.... does it look like a long term game, or a fly-by-nighter? many MMoRPG's have clamied to be 'the one' to topple EQ, but all have failed. is this one different?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">WoW is going open beta next week, try it out for free.  Decide for yourself.  That said, at the end of the day EQ2 will ultimately be run by the same company that shot your dog and slept with your sister, so it doesn't take a genius to figure out what it's going to end up like.  Honestly, only you can make the decision for yourself.<br />
<br />
I've got many friends who have tried out WoW and I'll be joining them.  Most seem to love it and I suspect I'll not only be playing the horde, but going PvP as well when I sign up.</div></div><hr />

Just depends on what you want, I just got a 2nd ST account as my g/f won't give up the first one, and preordered 2 copies of wow.  I don't think I am gonna be disapointed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was able to get into the EQ2 beta and I think its a good game.  The difference between the EQ2 and EQLive dev teams is night and day.  Durring beta test so far the Dev team has accomplished a LOT in a short time.  They are constantly communicating with us and get the issues resolved.   However, even though they have been doing a great job the game would be so much better if they just held off a month or so for release instead of shoving it out to beat WoW to the shelves. <br />
<br />
I haven't been able to play WoW yet, but I have heard a lot of good things about it.<br />
<br />
Good luck deciding which one you will play, I'm sure they will both turn out great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With respects, this is because they have a deadline to release... and initial reactions from many beta testers, and reviews may influence box sales.<br />
<br />
The NEED to get a lot done, so people won't say the release is crappy.<br />
<br />
Once the release is done, and a few patches to show some love, you can probably expect the same standard Sony care for your product.<br />
<br />
Personally I thought the game was good, but the server stability was pathetic for a game to be released in a couple days - even after the last &quot;stability&quot; patch.    I have virtually no faith that they will get it fixed... EQ 1 still has loads of disconnect issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly don't know why people bag on the brightly coloured graphics of WoW. I've been in the beta for a quite a while, and I can assure you, while the game characters may have a 'larger than life cartoony' type look, the scenery, sounds, and ambience are excellent.  I still find myself going through some of the zones and just stopping to look at something because it just looks cool.  <br />
<br />
I've played the EQ2 beta, and while they have technically excellent graphics, it feels far more sterile than WoW.  Additionally, don't base your impressions from screenshots, because they honestly don't have anywhere near the impact of playing the game.  The Stress Test is on right now, with the open beta to follow in a few days I believe; why don't you download it and try; you might be pleasantly surprised!<br />
<br />
If you're worried about stability, Wow is leaps and bounds ahead of EQ2.  They have the occasional glitch still, but they are nothing compared to twhat EQ2 was going through only a week or two ago.  While I've heard that EQ2 stability is improving, I still don't think it's up to WoW standard, or will be by release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">WoW.<br />

With Blizzard screwing over their euro customers and SOE's All Access thingy (yeah I still play EQLive) I really cant think of a single reason not to play EQ2.</div></div><hr />

Although I haven't played WoW, I agree about the EQ2 graphics being sterile.  For all their technical quality, they didn't evoke much of an emotional response from me.  I don't want to criticize EQ2 too much because I really didn't go very far in beta, but almost everything was a disappointment.  Maybe my expectations were too high after hearing that the game was supposed to be the most immersive experience this side of a holodeck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am currently playing in WoW beta and am really enjoying it.  It is a refreshing change from the long exp grinds of EQ and the world is absolutely huge.  My character is an undead warlock and even at low levels he never has downtime.  Mana and health regen are very fast, mobs are plentiful, and the amount of quests you can do at any level is fantastic.  In fact the majority of my exp has come from quests.<br />
<br />
 The graphics are very nice, I have had zero lag problems and the game seems extremely stable.  I have seen a few very minor bugs, but that is it.   I have not played in the EQ2 beta but I think WoW will give them a run for their money.  Having said that I will most likely buy both and see if one can hold my interest like EQ1 did.</div></div><hr />

Are you expecting Blizzard to be any different?  If you are, what are you basing that expectation on?<br />

There are still many large outstanding bugs in Diablo II.  Obviously, this is not a money making endevour for Blizzard at this point and fixing those bugs would take development time and money.  It looks, to me at least, that Blizzard are just as driven by the bottom line as SOE.</div></div><hr />

afreeman and Jalelin you have no clue.  D2 was a &quot;turnkey&quot; product, meaning that it was a ONE time purchase for the software.  Complaints about D2 play (on-line - which is where 90% of the problems have been) HOLD NO WATER.  Why?  Because it's a bloody FREE service.  So no, of course it isn't a money maker.  <br />
<br />
Attempting to cite ANY sort of issues with D2 or WC3/TFT as examples for why WoW will have the same problems just doesn't have any merit.  WoW will be a paid for monthly service just like EQ so support for WoW will be quite good long after release.  This isn't some cut and run operation.  They have a vested interest in maintaining strong revenue from the product and one of the best ways to ensure that will be to continue to develop, tweak, and expand on their product and content.  So yeah you are right about being driven by the bottom line.  Name ONE company aside from a non-profit organization that isn't.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Out of the two I preferred WoW, but really I have little urge to play either when they are released.<br />
<br />
Firstly, eq2 is very much UNLIKE eq, it is based around quests which I found not very enjoyable.  Graphically, its very nice but quite challenging on probably a lot of graphics cards. Eq2 is not for the powergamer and is especially focused around the journey rather than the destination. Its much more group biased than WoW. Classes are very strongly template based with little variation between certain templates until much higher level, although there were plans to alter this. Combat requires little thinking compared to WoW. Some nice graphics of a Vox raid in the eq2 forum, endgame looks to be about raiding.<br />
<br />
WoW is artistically very nice but offputtingly warcraft/cartoony. The quests I think have much more variation and are much more fun than eq2 but in my opinion are perhaps too linear. The game is much more smoother than eq2. Its much more custom for people to be soloing than grouping.  Grouping dynamics are probably not as strong as eq2 but that lack of certain structureness can be kind of nice.  Combat is probably more tactical than eq2. End game is a kind of pvp which I did not get to try out but what I am speculating would be pretty enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought the same thing before i played it in the beta. It works once you play trust me. I would highly suggest you try it before you decide. just think back to D&amp;D and ZMUD and all the games that have text or crap graphics and how much fun they are. Its the imagination thats tapped into that makes it fun and WoW does a good job i think. Its not impossible that you wont like it, but if you openly try it without prejudging it, i think you will enjoy it, until EQ2 atleast if thats your desired path.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a *company* it may be new territory for them but they have people who are intimately familiar with what they are doing, i.e. Tigole form EQ LoSteel seems to be exclusively involved in developing content.  And if not that don't think that a lot of these people have not studied if not played EQ's high end conent first hand, regardless of knowing who they are or not.<br />
<br />
I recommend visiting the main WoW Beta website there are a couple of really good articles that discuss some of their intentions about how they are approaching high end/raid content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EQ end game sucks, unless you enjoy needing to put aside 8 hours at a time for raids. If WoW can do any sort of end game entertainment without someone needing to rip 8 hours out of RL in one big chunk thats a selling point for me.<br />
<br />
Thats what killed EQ for me. I played EQ for over 4 years straight, and the end game sucked, except if you were a jobless no hoper who could afford to spend 8+ hours doing their stupid raids.<br />
<br />
If WoW makes it so you can have fun in 4 hour stints in the high end game then they have a winner.</div></div><hr />

For release eq2 will not be ready, it`s a simple fact. Soe`s we set a date we get it out for then attitude means it will be buggy,laggy and to see those ok graphics need a powewrful machine. for me i wasnt really that impressed, as someone mentioned &quot;sterile&quot; is the word. There was just nothing to keep me really interested, or even to explore that much.<br />
<br />
I hope to get on open wow beta and try it, but just from the description of classes and what poeple have said makes me think it will be much more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The WoW endgame is not exclusively PVP.  The endgame will be PVP *and* Raiding.  As it stands now Blizzard is dedicating MORE servers to PVE environments than PVP.  They know that most MMO gamers prefer non PVP, so they have to have content to support them.  Granted you are missing out on all the game has to offer if you don't choose PVP, but PVP simply is not for everyone.  I'm sort of a fence sitter as far as it goes personally.  Also of note is that even if you are not interested in PVP the PVE servers will still have optional PVP by way of the Battlefields.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend this article for PVP info:<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
Well he is stating the LOGICAL choice.<br />
<br />
To quote DUBYA:<br />
<br />
&quot;There's an old saying in Tenesee I know it's in Textas Probably from Tenesee that says: Fool me Once......Shame on.........Shame on YOU. You fool me can't get fooled again&quot;<br />
<br />
You see 2 major mmorpgs are being released this month. One is run by the people who have brought us amazing quality games for 10 years. No they are not PERFECT games but damn near perfect. They are known for good customer service. GASP . They also explain why changes are made when a patch is released.<br />
<br />
The other mmorpg is made by the same people who took EQ1 and all it's glory and turned it into a crap game. The same people that segregated the player base with flagging. The same people that told us everythign was working as intended when in fact POP was rushed out with an unfinished plane of time zone. The same people that never reply to the REAL questions players ask and the ones that don't care to fix content that is obviously broken. <br />
<br />
His attitude is right. He has also played WOW and we have also read enough reviews as to how much eq2 blows.<br />
<br />
In the end the choice is your but the choice is clear for many many people. SOE's attitude towards its gamers is not likely to change LOL i mean jboots to the buyers now? Soon they will sell us items for RL cash. <br />
<br />
Wow reminds me of a story book. It haas that magical dream look to it. It excites the imagination.Eq2 is dull and plastic like.<br />

LOL, SOEs customer service is GODDLY now compared to Verants in the &quot;old days&quot;. Verant would literally watch your corpse rot, even if you lost it to a bug (boat bug, inside a tree bug, whatever). <br />
<br />
People seem to remember the &quot;Golden Days&quot; of EQ with a grand fondness, but they forget how HORRIBLE the game truly was, from a purely bad-code/CS POV. The bugs were incountable and the CS was almost completely non-existant. The reason the game succeeded was because it was SO DAMN IMMERSIVE. Nothing can re-create that quality in a game, so now we are reduced to judging all new games by the &quot;current&quot; standard, a 5.5 year old product that, despite its problems, is still fairly polished overall. <br />
<br />
All 3 games, EQ1, EQ2, and WoW will probably be solid. What all 3 need to do is find their niche target audience, and develop the game around them. I think one of the probelms EQ1 is currently having is they are trying to appeal to TOO many &quot;styles&quot; of play, and as a result, they do all of them in a mediocre fashion. EQ2 is going to be far differnt from EQ1, and WoW is going to be differnt than both. Saying one is better than the other is like saying you like apples better than oranges, and then berating the person who like oranges simply because he prefers a different kind of fruit. <br />
<br />
Play whats fun, people. Do some research. Don't pay too much attention to the fan-boys or the detractors of any game. Check it out for yourself. If the game &quot;style&quot; seems to appeal to you, try it. Worst case you have spent 60 bucks or so for a couple months entertainment. You cant take a date to dinner and a movie for 60 bucks, so its not like you are pissing the money away completely. You WILL get a measure of entertainment for your dollar, no matter what. If you dont like the game, dont keep playing it. Its not rocket science.<br />
<br />
One of my biggest bitches about the detractors of EQ1 is they keep wanting to change the game into the style of game THEY wish to play, without even considering the huge amount of people that like to play EQ mostly the way it is. Hopefully, EQ2 and WoW will fill the void that these types of people are looking for. At least now, I can say to these people &quot;Go try EQ2 or WoW, maybe THATS the game your looking for&quot;.</div></div><hr />

So was Quake. How long did iD release updates for Quake and Quakeworld after it was off the store shelves?  Hell, they ended up hiring Zoid to work on maintanence of Quake, Quakeworld and, later, Quake II.  Those were all free services.<br />
<br />
When was the last bug fix release for Half-Life online play released?  Valve was still supporting a &quot;turnkey&quot; product five years after it was released.  Why shouldn't we look at Blizzard's lack of support of their existing products when trying to predict what kind of support we'll see for their future product?  <br />
<br />
Attempting to cite ANY sort of issues with D2 or WC3/TFT as examples for why WoW will have the same problems just doesn't have any merit.<br />
I have no clue?  You sound like a juiced up fanboi.  Putting the Blizzard name on the box does not automatically make the program bug-free, the game play experience perfect or bring about the second coming.  Equally, putting the SOE name on a box does not automatically mean that the programming is crap, there is no content and the apocalypse is going to start at 5pm.  Blizzard do have a good reputation as far as software quality is concerned, but to expand that mean that their long term support is going to be perfect is a stretch, to say the least.<br />
<br />
WoW will be a paid for monthly service just like EQ so support for WoW will be quite good long after release.<br />
Is this an article of faith, or do you have something to back it up?  Also, how do you define &quot;good&quot;?  Everquest support has been continuing since release.  Bugs have been fixed and content has been updated on an continuous basis.  A lot of people don't seem to like the direction many of these changes have gone, but, again, what leads you to believe that Blizzard are any better equipped to take their game in the direction that will keep the masses happy (especially if those masses include the DII hordes)?</div></div><hr />

You do know Furor works there now right? Something tells me their end game will be just fine.  And depth ? Due to the quest system i would say it has MORE depth then EQ right now.

I am not a PvP fan at all but for beta i figured i would try the PvP server. I have to admit I was really surprised how fun it was.

<br />
I do believe that Blizzard just released the 1.10 patch to D2 just a few months ago.  It wasn't just bug fixes, but also gameplay enhancements and new features.  So that would mean that they are still supporting a 4 year old game.  Hmmm...seems to go against what you are saying about them.<br />
<br />
Let me say AGAIN (because people don't listen), that there is a HUGE difference between a client based game, like Diablo 2 and Doom 3, and a server based game, like EQ and WoW.  8 year olds can hack a client based game.  To make Doom 3 unbelievably easy, all you have to do is change a few numbers in a text document.  On server based games, it is much harder to hack and keep using that hack because people are paying 12-15 dollars a month for developer support.<br />
<br />
If anyone believes that just one game will be the perfect game, then you need to put down the drugs and just step back into reality.  Every game will have bugs.  No company will offer perfect CS.  No game will have every feature or be able to accomodate every game play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">&quot;Why shouldn't we look at Blizzard's lack of support of their existing products when trying to predict what kind of support we'll see for their future product?&quot;<br />
<br />
As I already stated previously it's a service that is paid for monthly and they have a vested interest in continuing to provide support.  Just the same way that any monthly subscription MMO does.  You are attempting to compare apples to oranges and it simply has no merit.<br />
<br />
There's no point in trying to argue about what qualifies as &quot;good&quot; support because it would just range into terribly subjective territory for the most part.<br />
<br />
The truth is that Blizzard has a rabidly loyal fanbase.  And there is a reason for that.<br />
<br />
lol @ calling me a &quot;fanboi&quot; though...  I've played EQ for the last 4 years.  I've tried many other games.  Just this time around I see the light and it's time for a change.<br />
<br />
I have been playing the WoW beta and based on both  objective and subjective criticism I believe that it is a good game.  There are some factors that are just far too subjective or intangible to account for and ultimately come down to a matter of personal preference for what someone will find good or enjoy.  However, as compared to SO MANY other MMOs that I have tried WoW is already a vastly superior game in terms of flushed out content, balance, and over all polish.  It's just more complete than any MMO I've ever seen enter the market.<br />
<br />
I'm not jumping up and down screaming that WoW is the second coming of MMOs, far from it.  But I do enjoy it and I think it's a well put together game that should have a very strong future.<br />
<br />
And compare that to my alternatives of a 5th year of EQ or EQ2?  Well it's an easy choice for me!<br />
<br />
&quot;Blizzard do have a good reputation as far as software quality is concerned, but to expand that mean that their long term support is going to be perfect is a stretch, to say the least.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also lol @ that because I sure as hell never said &quot;perfect&quot; anything.  So thanks for putting words in my mouth!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I do believe that Blizzard just released the 1.10 patch to D2 just a few months ago.<br />
If you by a few months you mean October 2003 then yes, they did release 1.10 a few months ago.  In any event, it's more recently than I thought it was.  I will admit that I don't play DII anymore and only played on Battle.net for a very short period.  From what I have read, there are major flaws in the system that existed before 1.10 was released and weren't looked at.  I would agree that it is correct to say that the incentive to fix major flaws is significantly higher with a subscription based product over a one time sale type product.<br />
<br />
Let me say AGAIN (because people don't listen), that there is a HUGE difference between a client based game, like Diablo 2 and Doom 3, and a server based game, like EQ and WoW.  8 year olds can hack a client based game.  To make Doom 3 unbelievably easy, all you have to do is change a few numbers in a text document.  On server based games, it is much harder to hack and keep using that hack because people are paying 12-15 dollars a month for developer support.<br />
A client/server architecture does not inherantly make things more secure.  It is easy to cheat in Everquest because the client is sent far more information than it needs at any given point.  A lot of the new features are written in such a way to minimise this effect, but it you look at a lot of the original game code, it is less secure than QuakeWorld.<br />
<br />
The Everquest servers don't validate movement information.  You can warp all over the map if you want to because the server will just take the client at it's word as to what location it is at.  The Everquest client knows where every object on the map is located (as opposed to just the PVS) allowing cheating by letting the user see more than he is supposed to.  Falling damage is calculated client side and it is the client that desides if the character dies or not.  Hopefully the WoW developers have taken some of these issues in to account and made their application much more server heavy.  I would expect that the EQ2 team have learned a lot from ShowEQ and Macroquest.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't Battle.net hosted games more akin to QuakeWorld?  If I understand the architecture, the battle.net servers actually hosted the game state and all the clients acted as true clients with none of them actually having the master copy of the game state.  The game is only going to be as secure as the server when you are playing with untrusted clients.<br />
<br />
If anyone believes that just one game will be the perfect game, then you need to put down the drugs and just step back into reality.  Every game will have bugs.  No company will offer perfect CS.  No game will have every feature or be able to accomodate every game play style.<br />
That, my friend, we can agree on.<br />
<br />
I'm going to stick with EQLive.  I'm having fun with a few old friends who have started playing again.  If EQLive shut down tomorrow, and I had to choose between EQ2 and WoW, I would probably pick WoW (or maybe just play City of Heroes more).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">My concerns about WoW, which i've never found a decent response about:<br />
<br />
1. Blizzard's very dumb decision to implement regional restrictions. I have no idea if i can even play the game in my country, or if i will be lumped in with China/Korea or somewhere else. It looks like i will not be able to play with friends. Stupid.<br />
<br />
2. Another criticism i have of WoW is over testing. Yes, it may result in a less buggy game, but at the cost of everything being &quot;spoiled&quot;. Maybe more testing ensures a more stable/better game, but if i can't get the feelling of playing something brand new, i'm not really interested.<br />
<br />
3. Last one is my fear that WoW will be plagued by doodz.<br />
<br />
For EQ2:<br />
<br />
1. Under tested. Undoubtedly EQ2 has been rushed out. Having played beta, i know of several bugs that can probably be exploited for cash or exp gain. Although the ones i saw may be fixed before live, i am pretty sure there will be other exploitable game mechanics that could end up causing serious problems.<br />
<br />
2. Stability. Even in the last few days of beta, when you would expect the game to be running pretty smoothly, i experienced crashes to desktop, LDs, and log on problems. It wasn't out of control, but if stability is not better in live, it will be a serious detriment to gameplay.<br />
<br />
3. SOE runs it. No need to explain, i guess.<br />
<br />
As for gameplay, i'm sure both WoW and EQ2 will be fun. I prefer the EQ2 theme of Qeynos/Freeport more than warcraft, but probably because i'm more familiar with it. It also brings back memories of my favourite times in EQ1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Jalelin,  what you said is only true to a certain degree and veiw point. EQ still has a lot of bugs that have never been fixed, though the day to day customer service probably issnt as bad at soe as some make up, though the lack of listen to classes and seemling inability to balance classes high up is. <br />
<br />
now it`s true to say that blizzard have no prior form to go on for this type of game and might make the same mistakes, but then again there is nothing to say they will. <br />
<br />
i beta tested eq2 and i can tell you the same problems with patching and breaking almost everything still exist, as such it puts me off playing eq2. Will wow be different? i dont know but just reading the feedback from poeple playing it it seems likely that it will be. I just take my veiw from the majority of post saying wow is good, and alot saying eq2 is ok but could do better. Just because someone might be a fanboy, doesnt mean thats he is wrong, and i am sure alot of poeple will like eq2, but out of the 2 i believe wow is leading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I've beta'd both WoW and EQ2. I think ultimately I'll go for WoW as It just more fun for me and my now casual playtimes.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I am.<br />
<br />
Long experience with WC1-2, SC, etc., convinces me that Blizzard takes their users more seriously.  Probably not as seriously as some of the smaller games like CoH and friends, but I think they will be better than SoE.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are still many large outstanding bugs in Diablo II.  Obviously, this is not a money making endevour for Blizzard at this point and fixing those bugs would take development time and money.  It looks, to me at least, that Blizzard are just as driven by the bottom line as SOE.<br />
<br />
I see your point, and you may be right.  However, they have a good enough reputaion that I am willing to give Blizzard a shot at wallet.  SoE, on the other hand, would have to walk on water to convince me that the overall 'experience' in EQ2 will be substantially different.</div></div><hr />

Packets take a certain amount of time to travel a certain distance.  Longer distances mean higher latency.  While you can deal with this to some degree with technical tricks, lower latency is always better.<br />
<br />
There are also practical concerns to think about: many guilds have had to deal with scheduling issues to accomodate users scattered across numerous time zones.<br />
<br />
Are these reasons enough to justify forced segmentation of the player base?  Well, that is a different question...<br />
<br />
Suffice to say, however, that a reasonable person could look at these justifications and appropriately conclude that segmentation is necessary.</div></div><hr />

Well, but only until you see that the Australian and Newzealand players are allowed to play on the US servers. Which just means that all the &quot;latency&quot; and other technical reasons are simply bogus.<br />
<br />
No, the segregation has simple departmental reasons between sections of Vivendi. For me it means that I will not play WoW most likely because it releases in February and most people I play with are from the US. Of course who knows what will be in Feb, maybe I am fed up with EQ2 at that time and just thirsting for something different.<br />
<br />

I have a ping of about 170 ms from the Netherlands to the EQ servers. I think there are some East-Coast 56k users who would love that. Or someone from Alaska even.</div></div><hr />

Should there be separate servers for players in the US or elsewehere with 56k dial ups?<br />
<br />
There are also practical concerns to think about : many guilds have had to deal with scheduling issues to accomodate users scattered across numerous time zones.<br />

Why should that be a concern of Blizzard? Are you suggesting players in the US who work shifts should only be allowed on Korean servers?<br />
<br />
Seems to me you are looking in the wrong direction for your &quot;justifications&quot;. I expect Blizzard will announce partnerships with local operators for server hosting/CS in different parts of the globe, particularly Asia. They probably need to offer an exclusive geographic operating license. <br />

Although I found your response to afreeman to be slightly hostile, I'll respond in the hopes of maybe providing you with an adequate answer.<br />
<br />
1) My friends are choosing servers, I have one friend playing on multiple servers in different time zones.  This is second hand knowledge as I'm not playing yet, but take it as you will.<br />
<br />
2) During BETA most of the high end content was CLOSED as in you couldn't zone in and test it.  They tested the technology in a limited number of zones and applied it elsewhere.  BETA players will not be given access to the full game and will have to wait for the retail release, unless they open it up in open BETA.  There will still be mysteries, for all the time it takes for someone to level up and document it and post it on the web.  The same can be said for EQ2, EQLive, or any game.<br />
<br />
3) Almost all of the people I loved playing with in EQ are in, or will be in WoW.  Obviously, I can't say for sure one way or another who will and won't play this game, but so far the community rocks (of course it does, I'm getting this info from my friends who want me to play so they have a vested interest and it seems more appealing to me because they are my friends).  Blizzard has tried to do stuff to limit griefing, from the quest structure, to exping, to the guidlines submitted to online CS reps.  There seems less here to draw the doods.<br />

<br />
Have you ACTUALLY read the stuff related to WoW? E.g. some data about raiding in WoW, like is written here ? As far as I can tell, WoW Dev team is focussing on raiding quite well. More raids are added for different levels and there will be raids for more 'casual' guilds/groups, as well as for 'powerlevel' or 'uber' guilds.<br />
<br />
You can't judge on something you haven't read much about, or even tried :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: and those who throw out the &quot;oh WoW has cartoonish look, bla bla&quot;, bleh, drop it. WoW look is very Warcraft'ish and fits in perfectly well. And chars actually do look quite cool, especially as they progress and get better and better gear, like armor, weapons. Basically, they look very cool, fit in perfectly.</div></div><hr />
