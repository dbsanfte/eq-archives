<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail all,<br />
<br />
Saw this in USA Today Tech Section: http://www.usatoday.com/life/cyber/tech/review/2002/7/11/spotlight.htm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Eh<br />
<br />
Another pointless EQ article IMO.<br />
<br />
Atleast it mentioned CS, my other online addiction ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Next time I hear about that 'tard that killed himself....I'm going to kill myself!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Must have been a slow news day.<br />
<br />
To say Shawn Woolery had &quot; emotional problems &quot; is like saying the Pope is &quot; sorta religious. &quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, anyone else catch the disclaimer that appeared during log-in a week or so ago for people with nervous disorders?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The disclaimer has been included in instruction booklets for home consoles for quite a while now.  It's not new to the video game industry.  As a matter of fact, it first started appearing (although in very a limited fashion) shortly after people started finishing Sinistar in the arcades, back in the 1980's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think video game companies should provide a one shot 22 caliber pen gun in each box with a label saying &quot;please, if you are such a loser as to kill yourself, let us help keep the gene pool clear&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Losers, people try and blame games, TV, etc, it is bad parenting and just lazy, loser people that do things like that. Video games are fun, are they not?<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill the returned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mill is back ! Yaaaa !<br />
<br />
Mr Sensitive, Mr Politically Correct, Mr tee-totaling, Mr America is &quot; ok &quot;<br />
<br />
I am of course KIDDING. <br />
<br />
WB Mill. Let er rip buddy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is true though.  Every time someone does something stupid instead of blaming the person they try to find what in their life might be considered  different or not typical.<br />
<br />
A person that plays D&amp;D kills himself or another and it is the game obviously.<br />
<br />
Person commits suicide playing EQ and it is the game obviously again.<br />
<br />
Of course this completely overlooks the other hundreds of thousands of people that do and have played these games and have not done anything bad.<br />
<br />
I would be willing to bet that the suicide and felony rate for people that play games is, on a ratio, less than that of the population as a whole.  Hmmm could it be because these people have found a creative outlet to enjoy themselves and make them happy or just release frustration in a controled way?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At least the article did mention that kid had emotional problems to begin with, rather than choosing the more controversial &quot;The devil made me do it&quot; scapegoat that is so common in lazy journalism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">People have wasted themselves while getting laid, maybe we should put a stop to that too ... nm ... *** am I saying?!?  I'm sure there will be morons who'd think that was a good idea, right up until the species goes extinct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rypt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did they say her EQ name was 'Nin'? I thought EQ names always had to be at least 4 characters long?</div></div><hr />
