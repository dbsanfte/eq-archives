<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm finding mixed info.  On person as telling me that the first person in sets the level of the dungeon, i.e. if you want an easy dungeon send in the lowest member first, harder dungeon but better exp send in the highest member.  Other posts here indicate that the level of the dungeon is based on the average level of the group.  Has anyone ever tested this to confirm one way or the other?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's based on the average level of the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I once joined a pickup group with a lvl 59 paladin and we got the normal 65 dungeon, 51 pts for completion on normal.<br />
<br />
Some theories suggest that it is based on the level of the group leader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The number of points you get at the end of the adventure is based off your level. The paladin in Boinshar's group would have gotten fewer points than Boinshar did. However the difficulty of the encouter is based off the group's average level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The number of points is also based on the difficulty/level  of the dungeon.  My enchanter is level 57.  On one dungeon, our average level was lower, dungeon was easy and my enchanter got 19 points.  On the next dungeon we switched a few people around and ended up with a higher average level.  This dungeon was more difficult (though still &quot;normal&quot; difficulty on adventure settings) and I got somewhere between 24 and 29 points for it (I forget exactly).  I did not level during either adventure and was level 57 for both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In my experience it's based on average level.<br />
<br />
I was in one group recently that wanted lower levels to go in first...and having done 80+ adventures and never hearing that before it made me kind of nervous.  I was thinking, oh no, these people haven't done LDoN and I'm gonna die, but we crushed it easily.  :)<br />
<br />
I've never heard rumor of it being based on leader level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have a lot of friends between 58-63 so I do lower level average groups a lot. It becomes very necessary to do the math when your friends are spread out in level so much. Under 63 average we can be pretty easy going on who we have in our group. 63+ we need to be more picky on who we have.<br />
<br />
That being said I always do the math before setting the group just so we know what to expect. So I can confirm 100% it's based off group level average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BluntDoctor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mob level is based on the average of your group.  I believe points at the end of the adventure is a combination of both average group member level AND your level.  The average level determines the total points awarded. Your level, in comparison to the rest of the group, determines your share of that total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The dungeon difficulty is assigned when you get the mission and accept it, and is based on the average level of your group.<br />
<br />
Point award value is either based on average level at the END of the mission (I got level 65 in a dungeon and got the 51 points instead of 49 you get for being 64), or it assigns points based on the level YOU are and the difficulty level of the dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i believe it's based on the lvl of the person that accepts the adv. when i make it, all the mobs are dk blue. even named are. when we had a 56 (or so) make it, all were at least white and we got destroyed cause assassination boss was red, so it was really high lvl. just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dont think first in has anything to do with it.  It seems they create the instance when you request adventure, not when you enter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Its definately based on average level and anyone that thinks its based on first in needs a reality check. Its been said numerous times the dungeon is created when the mission is offered, hence the delay when a mission is declined for cleanup. <br />
<br />
A group level of 63 regradless of who takes the mission will always yeild the top level dungeon. My bro usually got us the missions even when he was 61 the rest of us that were 65 got the full 51 points. <br />
<br />
There isn't a point pool total thats split among the players. If you're in a group of all 65's all will get 51 points. If you're in a group of five 65's and one 61, only the 61 gets the lower ammount. If you're 65 and get in a mission with an average less then 63 you'll get whatever the next lowest cap is (don't know exactly how many, never done a mission with an avg lower then 63).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">34, went through a normal mission today where I botted my sk and a friend botted ranger/cleric and another aquaintance joined us, levels were 65/64/65/58/58 =&gt; average level of 62. My friend took missions with the ranger, level 65. The mobs were easy, few slow resists, and in the end my sk got 32 points (lvl 64) and I got 34.<br />
We did this twice, same results.</div></div><hr />
