<br />
In thinking about that, it really is a testament to the remarkable durability of this game.  There's been nothing remotely similar to the interest this game has generated for me.  I've dabbled with a couple of others, but they seem sterile and empty.  I didn't last.<br />
<br />
This is without any periods of quitting or taking a break, although for the past few months my play time has dwindled considerably.  Only natural I suppose.  <br />
<br />
It's possible I'm just naturally bored after all this time, but I think it's PoP.  PoP is a flawed masterpiece.  It's partially terrific, but with enough structural problems that make it too frustrating for guys like me.  I don't get into twinks, and I don't want to rehash levels I've done.  <br />
<br />
I like Gart, I like playing a shaman, I like being level 65 with some stuff and some spells.  I like dominating stuff that I remember used to destroy me over and over (ahh, Mistmoore, payback is a b*itch...).  <br />
<br />
I understand that obstactles and barriers are necessary, because it's overcoming challenges that give a sense of &quot;accomplishment&quot; which makes the game engaging.  I think the key for EQ's success has been, in part, in making things hard and frustrating.  Recently, for me, they have gone too far - although many things are so much more easy now than they used to be.  It depends on where you are in the game.  <br />
<br />
I also recognize that's my subjective call, and others feel differently.  They should, because for some and their playstyle, it is different.  The game will be designed as designers see best for the game.  It may be that vision purposefully excludes folks like me, which much of PoP certainly does.  <br />
<br />
I want to do the &quot;cool&quot; stuff, but I can't invest the time to even get there.  So it is what it is, and I'm at where I'm at.  I'll keep scratching away and perhaps over time pick up some more flags.  There should be a gap from the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have-nots&quot;, but I feel the gap is too large now.  But I still subscribe and have some fun, and that's really the bottom line.  <br />
<br />
I am what Tudamorf once described on these boards as a &quot;frustrated powergamer&quot;.  I want to do what the powergamers do and get what they get, but lack the time and energy to get there.  A game designed to accomodate me probably would not be fun and worthwhile to the powergamers that do have the time and energy.  Clearly a difficult balancing act.  And given the success EQ has enjoyed, it would be hard to argue they didn't make the right call.  <br />
<br />
I've seen so many guilds come and go, comets flashing by.  Lately I've noticed a lot of really old-time guilds folding their tents on my server.  I've also seen so many players come and go.  They suddenly appear, play a crazy number of hours, soar beyond me, and then quit, angry at the game for some reason.  <br />
<br />
It's funny to reflect on all the changes in this game over the past 4 years, through the expansions, and the introduction of new gear, skills, levels and spells.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm just rambling a bit.  I've heard others chiming in /gu that they have also hit their 4th birthday, and it is clearly a testament to the original design that folks stay and stay and stay.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure tons of folks are also hitting their 4th birthday.  I never would have imagined when I first signed up.  I had no idea what an on-line game was about, and had no idea what these 10 or so different servers meant.  I lost my first couple of characters because I didn't understand I had to go back to the same server (I didn't know they were &quot;world&quot; servers).  That server concept was entirely new.    <br />
<br />
I still remember zoning into Greater Fay for the first time, with 120 people in the zone, and hearing all the death cries of little wood elves as they fell off the Kelethin platforms.  Ahh, good times!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">happy birthday! rjay had his bday in july of last year. but I hadn't been playing him for about 6 months at the time, and I just recently started back up.<br />
<br />
there are many reasons this game holds interest, but I forgot them all now :-P</div></div><hr />

Was just thinking about how well done EQ is overall.  Rush jobs and spotty (if not downright nonexistant) quality control and testing notwithstanding, EQ is easily the most complex computer game around.  (Still not as complex as pencil+paper 2nd edition AD&amp;D... but then, even the Bible ain't THAT complex).<br />
<br />
What do most people tend to notice?  Stuff that bothers us.  Stuff that doesn't work.<br />
<br />
One of the cool things about EQ is that there are times in game when I've stopped and just LOOKED.  My first PC was a dwarven paladin.  He lasted all of a few hours, but I remember 2 things very clearly<br />
<br />
(1) landing outside and seeing that HUGE stone dwarf standing guard over the entrance of Kaladim.<br />
(2) remapping auto-attack off of the &quot;a&quot; key.<br />
<br />
I'm with you, Gart.  I wanna do the cool high-end stuff, but I just do not have the time to invest to get there.<br />
<br />
But still, there are places to go and things to see, and not a week goes by that I don't say &quot;wow!&quot;</div></div><hr />
