<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xequecal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm writing this guide mainly because I'm frustrated. Frustrated with people who obsess on leveling and completely neglect their gear. It may be hard for some of you to grasp this, but your gear is what makes you in this game. If your gear sucks, so do you. I don't care how good you are or think you are. Playing skill pretty much only determines who lives and who dies when the **** hits the fan, something that does not happen very often anymore with today's gimpified XP MOBs. 90% of this game is standing in front of a MOB and letting the random number generator do it's thing. If you are level 50 and still wielding Icetooth Claws, a Crystal Fiber, Banded armor, and no haste item, then this is directed at you:<br />
<br />
STOP LEVELING! STOP RIGHT NOW! YOU ARE THE REASON EVERYONE MAKES FUN OF THE RANGER CLASS! Rangers are THE most gear-dependent melee class. Paladins, SKs, and Warriors have higher AC on their gear, more hitpoints, and a higher Defense skill that will compensate for below average gear. Rogues get a Backstab key that adds so much damage that even with crappy gear, they will still outdamage most anyone. Rangers do not have either luxury, so you MUST have better weapons to stay desired. Rangers are GOOD tanks in most situations if they've kept their gear up to par. <br />
<br />
Now that the mini-rant is over, here is my advice:<br />
<br />
- Panic Animal. Never, EVER use it. Why? Animals do not drop loot. If you can't solo a blue MOB with straight melee, then you need to farm plat until you can. People say Panic Animal was an amazing improvement to our class. I disagree. It lets any idiot get to 60 without any skill at all, and wearing some pretty abysmal gear. The only exception to this rule is gryphs in Jaggedpine or in NK/EK at low levels, or snow griffins in EW, because they drop money. It may be fun to get 10 levels in 3 days off rockhoppers, but you'll have gained exactly zero platinum doing it, and chances are your defense skill is 30 points behind.<br />
<br />
- Hunt in places that drop large amounts of loot. Even if the XP is below average. Go to Crystal Caverns at level 30 and don't leave until level 39. You'll have made at least 3k in that time, more if you managed to get into the geonid camp on a regular basis. At 39, go do Hill Giants. Do them for at least 2 levels. Yes, it's boring. Yes, the XP sucks. But you'll get 10k doing this pretty easily, giving you a large equipment advantage over everyone else your level.<br />
<br />
- There are a lot of places where you can get tons of loot, yet are largely unexplored. Oggok is a great example. The bouncers inside are easy to pull singly, and you will get 1-2 FS weapons from EACH kill. That's in addition to the platinum you will get. There's a non-KOS merchant right at the zone that you can sell to. Get a friend, and hunt here for a few levels. Sol A is another great plat farming location, especially if you're level 50 and are wearing crap. You can massacre this dungeon and sell all the fine steel to vendors in the zone.<br />
<br />
- Don't be passive. If you are in a group and someone else is looting everything, call them on it. Don't try to be nice and just hope that he/she will stop on their own.<br />
<br />
- Recognize what items are valuable to players and hoard them. For example, the small pieces of velium that drop in crystal caverns are very valuable to players, because they are required for trade skills. I collected 40 at one point and sold them for 400pp to a player. Also know the rare spawns and rare drops in the area you're hunting, and constantly check Track for them. Direct your group to these spawns when they appear so you have a chance at getting a nice item to use or sell. Winning the lotto on a Quillmane cloak will solve all your money problems, as high level mages will pay 50k or more for the multiquest rights to this thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Putting the emphasis back on gear is a good point, but it applies to all melee, not just Rangers. Lately I've been running into 50+ melee with no haste, including warriors with under 950 buffed AC. That's ridiculous, I don't care how good plate damage mitigation is if you can't even break 1k AC with full cleric, shaman, and ranger buffs on. Too many people will pay 10k to get that 1dps increase out of their weapons while ignoring AC and haste. Idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Venture</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is a polemic, not a guide, and I disagree with the thesis.<br />
<br />
Which I hasten to add, is pretty much unsupported.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it depends on how you look at it.  Your level will obviously make more of a difference than your gear if you are talking about a level 12 and a level 30 both hunting in Crushbone.  But as you level up, people within the same level range will hunt the same monsters, ie the level 30 wouldn't be hunting in CB.  So based on the fact that the same levels hunt in the same ranges, the gear makes the bigger difference because differences between levels are relatively small.<br />
The difference would be, at the very top of the level range where a level 60 and 50 could be hunting in the same area, and with AAs coming into effect, level differences could outway gear benefits.  <br />
That said, I would have to agree with much of what was posted, though I don't think panic animal is at all bad so long as you don't recklessly neglect your inventory and defence skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Northerner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I agree completely although this is hardly a Ranger-only issue.  Seeing level 63+ 'tanks' using Venomous axes and wearing paper for armor tends to make me sad (and often dead).<br />
<br />
Levels are the most important thing in determining effectiveness *given equitable gear* but they are not everything.  I would also add that AAs are not a thing to think about at 65, they are something new 60s really will want to work on before moving on.  Flame me if you wish but that is my opinion.<br />
<br />
A level 65 Ranger is far more effective than a level 60 Ranger against Mob X.  The trouble is when you join my group fighting Mobs Y and you may well be completely ineffective due to having the same gear you got at level 50.  I'm a Rogue and I tend to know I am only as good as my skill, my weapons and my armor.  I'd be fooling myself if I thought it was really in that order also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gear is important. Levels are important. Obviously a near naked 60 will not preform as well as a well equipped 60. As far as panic animal, yeah it is nice to have, and I use it. I DO hate that animals in general do not drop cash, but what are you gonna do.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is you DO have to make money somehow. If you can keep your grouping skills up to par, can fearkite animals for exp most of the time, somehow make a killing in the bazaar to make money, more power to you. <br />
<br />
It is generally true in my opinion that soloing as a ranger is for two things, usually mutually exclusive. You can either get exp (fearkiting or soloing underconned blues), or you can make money (farming greens). Sure sometimes you can do both at once, but not often (griffons in Jaggedpine offer at least a little cash and a rare chance for a sellable drop). Most of the time however, it seems if you can get exp from something solo, it isn't going to drop much cash. <br />
<br />
I like to solo for exp, generally when I don't have anyone playing that I know that I want to group with. I tend to find strangers somewhat unpredictable for my tastes, and I hate being on someone elses timer. By that I mean for instance the only healer in the group has to leave 5 minutes after I get there, and I spend 20 minutes waiting for a replacement, or the tank/puller/chanter you name it has no clue what they are doing and end up killing me for the 10th time in an hour. My favorite has alwas been the extended AFK. It can almost be like a game: &quot;How long can I get away with going AFK before someone boots me out?&quot; I just love soloing for the pure time to experience ratio. I can AFK on my time, I wait for nobody, if I die I only kill myself. I start and stop when it is comfortable for me.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love to group, I love to raid, and I do it whenever I can with folks I know in my guild, etc. But for pure exp grinds when &quot;I want to get to level ## ASAP&quot; I solo and do the fear-kite no money thing.  <br />
<br />
I have done pretty decently in tradeskills, and that is how I have made up for my lack of funds from grouping in Seb/Velks/name-your-lousy-group-zone-here.  I have grouped in those zones to be sure, but usually only with people I know. Like I said, I raid/group all the time, but for me soloing is great.<br />
<br />
 My gear is not WONDERFUL. I wield a Tox Axe, LSoEE and BFT for weps for example (Still working on epic with guild, getting there :)  ), but it is definitely on par with others in my guild, and I drop soloing and go on raids and epic hits for others whenever they come up. I know a bunch of people in game and usually do not have trouble finding a group when I want to, which is usually for fun, or for taking out larger kills, or both :)<br />
<br />
Anyway gear/soloing etc can be done a number of ways, you just have to find what works for ya!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taylia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree mostly, with this sentiment.<br />
<br />
I think that on a PvP server, the argument that your gear determines how effective you are, is very prevalent. <br />
I was fighting a green con Ogre Shaman awhile back, which drove me to the conclusion that level is not &gt; all. He was some evil’s twink whore, as he was decked out in gear that someone his level could not attain on thier own. Although he was very cunning and knew how to play his Shaman well, it was not that alone which turned the battle in his favour. Through the course of the fight, I was Malaised, blinded, rooted and DoTed, while I tried slashing him. His AC must have been extremely high as I could barely land a hit on him and the ones I could, were quickly recovered (a fungi tunic I suspect). If it were not for a passing guild mate, I would have surely suffered a humiliating death at the hands of this Ogre.<br />
<br />
Due to geography and territory control, I would say that the majority of “Goods” are ill equipped. I can’t walk into Oggok and fight Bouncers, as I would have Evils from all adjoining territories on thier way to kill the “Goodie” Ranger. Making money is not that easy for me on Sullon Zek; my options are very limited. The majority of my current gear, much to my chagrin, has had to be purchased off of Evils or Neutrals, who seem to dominate the market for equipment. Buying from them only funds them in thier quest to better equip themselves so they can kick my arse more effectively....thus the vicious  cycle begins.<br />
<br />
I have seen well-equipped players walk into a zone and completely own it by themselves. Thier important stats are through the roof as well as key items such as pumice, heal potions, DoT potions etc are at thier disposal, thanks to the goods who fund them.<br />
<br />
After all is said and done, the number crunching machine that is EQ will always favour those with the numbers to come out on top.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree Taylia - I finally broke down and sold some bonechips the other day on Sullon, knowing full well that it was almost guaranteed that a necro or SK would be them. I suppose some Good looking to level quickly in Kaladim could have bought them, but you're right - evils and neuts have most of the money.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I'm trying to picture my Good Ranger going to Oggok to fight Bouncers! Doubt he'd even make it to Innothule, much less inside Oggok.<br />
<br />
Right now, I'm hunting in Everfrost and Perma, fighting the urge to go back to Paludal for a couple of quick levels.  Coin has been pretty good so far, even if the experience is (comparatively) so-so.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as far as territory goes on Sullon - it's gotten worse with PoP.  Lowbie evils have been PoPorting into EF, looking for other lowbies to gank.  Problem is, there are more evil lowbies than good lowbies, and there are so few zones we can hunt in as it is.  Very few safe places now, apparently.</div></div><hr />

I think it’s only a matter of time before we loose our hold on Everforst. Where to then? Greater Faydark? GF has been under constant attack, more so than before the release of PoP.<br />
I have stopped leveling for the past week, trying to do my part to keep the hunting grounds of our young free from the scourge of Evils and Neutrals. It has been very trying.<br />

Sorry - not to hijack, but I have very few places to talk intelligently about Sullon (my guild's board is broken, for now).  I'll stop now.  Well, except to say that I feel like I've stopped levelling after zooming through four levels in Paludal. Have gained a little more than one in the same amount of time in EF.  Got four tusks last night, however.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, because level has no effect on damage mitigation, base hitpoints, ATK rating, AA accesibility, damage from AE's, disciplines or anything else.  Please.<br />
<br />
If you want to be a level 8 in full Tolans, good for you.  But do not make outrageous and ridiculous claims like &quot;gear &gt; level!&quot;<br />

<br />
Knowledge of your character is what makes you in this game.  Gear has 2% to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is less a guide and more a bunch of unsupported estimates and opinions.  I agree with a previous poster that gear is important, as well as levels.  Completely neglecting gear in order to gain levels will definitely leave you at a high level with gear so abyssmal that you can't function.  However, telling someone to forget about leveling is just plain silliness.  You talk about 3kpp from 30-39.  If you wait until 45, you can just go and solo in CC and make all the money yourself (which is what I did).  Hill Giants for 2 levels making you 10kpp?  That seems like a rather liberal calculation.  I've farmed Rathe with both my 60 ranger and 57 necromancer (both extremely well outfitted) and can make, at most, 1000pp per hour.  That's in the dead of night when nobody else is around, fear-kiting 4 at a time with the necro or just laying waste with my Ranger.  In a full group, with pulls like that, you'd be making barely 200pp per hour.  50 hours for 2 levels (10kpp over 2 levels, 200pp per hour)?  Seems like a waste of time.  Bottom line, everything in moderation.  I've seen gear-hounds, level 35, thinking they're cool for having a Wurmslayer and an FBSS or something (at the time, this was good).  I've also seen those gear-hounds 18 levels later, with better weapons, but the skills of a newbie because they spent all their time farming non-threatening, non-challenging mobs that drop some pp.  Skill first, levels next, gear comes in time.  It worked for me.<br />
<br />
P.S.  50k for a quill cloak?  I have one I can't get rid of for 7k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SolipsisSaVatar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Instead of taking forever to lvl up because you focus kills on loot instead of XP, why not XP hard and take a day now and then to farm loot and rare named spawns. <br />
<br />
Having some levels under your belt makes farming for loot much much easier, and also gives you access to zones where loot drops that you will use instead of sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Knowledge of your character is what makes you in this game. Gear has 2% to do with it<br />
<br />
I disagree 110%, if you are lvl 50+ in Ivy armor useing weapons worse then Centi SS/Wurmy combo you are NOT going to be effective, IMO if you go 1-10 in the n00b garden then 10-27 in PC (makeing maybe 300-400pp) then fear-kite to lvl 60 in the gear you obtained with that 400pp + some lvls of Mammoths you are gonna get laughed outta zones. This isnt hard to do ethier, like the org. poster said pharm or kill in CC/Dungeons. Fear-kiting is SOOOO boring that anyone who FKs 22-65 must have no life and no concept of the game.<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sarlyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Full Ivy and wielding Yak/EBW at 50-55 is fine in many zones. Yes, such an equipped ranger will not be up to PoP and arguably ME and UP, but it hardly makes him/her useless. Kunark was designed around those equipment levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Perregrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have played beside characters in excellent equipment with no clue about some of their abilities.  I have also seen clueless individuals in terrible equipment.  A truely excellent player shines because he know his class so well (he or she).  Not cause he has a wurmmy/centi or an FBSS or any other shiney weapon.<br />
<br />
I don't care how great your equipment is, unless you understand all of your spells, their effects, and utility you are not a ranger.  Till you understand why, when and where you would use your different tracking filters you are not a ranger.  You are not a ranger until you understand all facets of of your class.  Yeah equipment means you live longer, or add some  extra dps or have a bit more mana but equipment does not make you great it just helps you.<br />
<br />
In a group I would rather have a poorly equipped ranger that knew his stuff over an uber equipped ranger that has never had to sweat when heading in to a battle.  That is not to say that that uber equipped ranger with uber skills would be turned away.  But equipment does not make the class.  It just make the good better and the ****ty passable.<br />
<br />
Hell with 2 rusty weapons you could fear kite your way in to any equipment in EFP  you just need patience and time.  Right now I make about 100pp per night solo and I get to practive my casting and weapon skills and I can chat with my guildies.  I can even kill the red con corrupted mammy if I am patient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gandilain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Its true, levels are more important than anything.  Get to 59 or 60 in the gear that you can get, maybe taking a few trips to kael or PoF to get armor. As long as you are getting good xp, you are in good enough gear. The 3k you made in crystal caverns lvls 30-39 you can make in one day later levels.  Levels, more than anything else, make you more powerful. Dont get me wrong, you shouldnt be in newb quested armor at lvl 40, but if you can get to 60 in barbed ringmail, do it.  No matter what you will have more ac/hp than the guy who is five levels lower than you in a PSC.  It is a good idea to take a break every now and again for a Kael raid, epic stuff, PoF raid and such, but dont live in those zones.  The gear you get there will be considered sub par once you get high enough anyway. Just get what you need to get by, and get those levels!</div></div><hr />

I just thought the beauty of EQ was that you could do whatever you want. <br />
Want to lvl? Go ahead.<br />
Want to farm pp? Go ahead. <br />
Want to make a million pp in bazaar? Go ahead.<br />
Want to make it to lvl 65 using fearkite? Go ahead.<br />

Aye guides are good... but following them all will shape you in to a cookie cutter player... (anyone remember the javazons or the static field/ice orb sorceress in Diablo 2?)<br />
<br />
The most important thing is that you have fun. doing what you want to do. In time the high lvls and the crappy gear will come to an equilibrium (sp?) where you cant advance much more in your current setup.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Quorrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I dont think its as &quot;cut and dry&quot; as the initial post states.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Frustrated with people who obsess on leveling and completely neglect their gear. It may be hard for some of you to grasp this, but your gear is what makes you in this game. &quot;<br />
<br />
-  First, you shouldnt be frustrated by other people in the game unless they get you killed through inept playstyle.  I think you're trying to say that craptacularly outfitted Rangers who are too lazy to pharm plat and buy some decent gear are giving the class a bad name... I disagree.  The Rangers out there who are decked out in Tolans (or better) but cant manage aggro or be bothered to keep a mob off the Cleric/Chanter wihle grouped in DL are the real issue. <br />
<br />
&quot;If your gear sucks, so do you. I don't care how good you are or think you are. &quot;<br />
<br />
-  I disagree, but I think I see the point you're trying to make.  At higher levels, gear definitely is important.  However, everyone has been alongside an overly well equipped player who couldnt play their class well at all.  Chanters who couldnt control a &quot;crowd&quot; of one add, the tanking Bard who only plays heal song throughout the fight, Necros who chain cast all their DOTs and then wonder why they keep getting summoned...  They might be wearing some badass gear, but I dont care how much perfume you put on a pig, its still a pig.  A friend of mine plays a high level Wizard, and knows that class really well.  He's one of the most fun people Ive played with because he knows his role and plays it to perfection.  However, he pimped himself a Bard alt to the teeth with all kinds of shiny colorful Bard gear, and man, he sucked.  Despite all the gear he had, he never could learn how to play a Bard well (a very difficult class IMHO), and gave up. <br />
<br />
Gear tends to be dictated by playstyle, I think.  If someone is a casual player who enjoys soloing, they'll take a long time to put together a set of decent gear, may never bother with a resist set or haste item.  Someone who plays the game for the social aspect will likely put together a decent sized friend list, make it into a guild and have an opportunity to get their hands on some decent items.  Then there are the players who play very aggressively, looking for groups or creating their own, and grinding as often as possible.  They would likely be the ones who end up getting into or developing a guild that allows them access to the better gear.  I dont think any one of these players is better than the other, its just how they want to play.</div></div><hr />

I've got 1000ac self buffed at 52, not bad at all I'm told, was grouped in KC last night and had a full 200 ac more than a bard a level higher than me, and equal to a paladin 2 levels higher than me. Sounds like they need to buy better gear, and they don't get panic animal :P<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Roneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I remember hitting level 50 wearing banded armor...of course that's because rubicite was too hard to get.  Equipment does not make the character.  In the best of the best tournaments I saw that.  People with lesser ac, lesser equipment as you put it,would beat people with better equipment, simply because they were better players.  <br />
<br />
Just because your opinions state that you hate people in lesser equipment, don't tell people how to play.  They pay the same amount as you, unless you play on stormhammer, so they have every right to play in whatever they desire to play in.  Maybe they don't troll message boards hanging on every little piece of equipment dropped in every zone, maybe they play for fun?  If they are having fun and not encroaching on your equipment dependant world, leave them alone.  <br />

I have a hard time taking you seriously when you whine and whine and then state: &quot;Playing skill pretty much only determines who lives and who dies when the **** hits the fan, something that does not happen very often anymore with today's gimpified XP MOBs. &quot;  If this is what you believe and a rarity, your whole post is inane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sembrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I think whoever wrote this is prob a lvl 35 ranger who hasn't even experienced the higher lvls.  Gear is important yes.  But spending all yer time out farming is less time lvling, less time to have access to the good stuff.  FArming CC is nice and all, but i'd rather get an exp group in ME or something and get actual loot.  You want cash, loot, AND exp, go lvl in seb.  The higher lvl you get the better loot you CAN get.  Too many people forget this, their loss.<br />
<br />
Panic Animal is one of the best spells we have.  Too bad you don't know this.  If ya REALLY wanna farm cash, go fearkite Rockhoppers and sell the pelts.  I made ROCKIN exp on these guys and had pelts galore to sell.  I gave em to friends, but you can sell if ya want.<br />
<br />
I agree that walking around with a Crystal Fiber or some such at lvl 50 isn't a good thing, but you take yer gear-mongering to the extreme.<br />
<br />
Go out and get some levels. lol<br />

<br />
I do have to agree that fearing is for the most part useless.<br />
<br />
I use a Wurm/centi ls  and have a lammy in stock waiting for another, but that dosent matter. HASTE MATTERS even if you use a crystal fiber, your damage output goes up as well as your chance to interupt spells with some kind of haste gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I have to say that I think people should chill from leveling some times I think there are far too many people these days who have missed alot of what EQ has to offer by living in places like PC try exploring the world, remember part of being a ranger is knowing exactly how to get to any zone in the fastest time without getting lost (or at least without letting anyone know you were lost on the way hehe).</div></div><hr />
