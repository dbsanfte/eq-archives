<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>noober</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi i heard that its best to do 11 before 61 but i know a lvl 62 shammy doing rats at POD with around half blue per kill in aa! <br />
Anyone experiencing this good exp at 62 for aa or is it better at 60? thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ROFL! if shaman is 62, pass the trial and get a group on PoV...you will do 1 AA in about 2h in a good group, or 3h if your group is not very good...of course you will wipe if your group is crappy or if you are trained (happens too often to my taste)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Enkidu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Passing the trials is not easy for some folks. As shamans are all about damage over time and debuffs they are rarely sought out except for pre trials buffing. Add to this not everyone is in a large or high level guild. I would consider soloing rats and small spiders in PoD and trees in PoN a viable source for solo AA XP. Of course my opinion and some silvers will only get you a rusty dagger... :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would see it as being a vialbe source of AA for a CT shammy possibly. I some time solo these back at 56 or so usin my panic animal necklace. I imagince a epic shammy with 61 pet  could probaly kill these with little down time.</div></div><hr />

Since a rat in PoD gives me 2% aa exp (sometimes 3%, I think) at lvl 61, I'm having a hard time believing someone at lvl 62 is getting more... they're already blue after all.  Maybe this is some OTHER kind of rat than the swamp or disease ones.  /shrug<br />
<br />
I tend to avoid the rats.  No outrageous exp, and they hit hard as hell compared to the goos and flies that give similar exp.<br />
<br />
From what I've heard, don't go past 61 unless you're flagged.  You're just going to #@%&amp; your aa exp right up the bunghole.  Lvl 63 peeps in my groups at &quot;good&quot; exp camps in pon get about half the exp per kill as I do.</div></div><hr />

First off, I don't bother with the roaming rats.. I usually kill the static ones in the north after doing my normal worm clearing... <br />
<br />
AA is 1% a kill in 62 at 100%.. Level XP.. well let's not even bother..  It's a tad hard to single and the wretched pusling loves to make it a fun fight till you break that area..<br />
<br />
Only reason why I still kill in this zone is to pharm worm fleshes..</div></div><hr />
