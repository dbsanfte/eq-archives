<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Found Nedaria's Landing.  You can get to it through Jagged Pine forrest, the zone in is in the north eastern part of the zone, across the river near a bunch of water ladies.<br />
<br />
Inside, its a forest type zone, with a few rivers and waterfalls.  Its sparsly populated with various animals, all green to 65.  I killed a bear that agrod on me when invis dropped, no faction hit, died in 2 ticks of Blood + melee.<br />
<br />
Theres a large cliff that divides the zone, only way up it is the small grassy hill in the northern part of zone.<br />
<br />
There's a wayfarer camp, with Morden Rasp and one other guy, they elude of things to come, but offer no tasks or quests.<br />
<br />
Large ocean, will be for the boat that will most likely sail to the new expansion.<br />
<br />
Might want to check it out with a lowbie, see how good the exp is, otherwise no reason to come here at this time.  Next post will contain map.<br />

<br />
Looks as if they are making a new continent for the new expansion, and so the plot thickens hehe<br />
<br />
There's more to the wayfarers than meets the eye so it seems, I'm eager to see what unfolds over the next few months. With Alan Van Coovering having confirmed the new graphics engine is indeed in the works, it looking like a new expansion may be out around christmas or new year with a new graphics engine included.<br />

edit: wee! i'm an Initiate now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cool, a new zone to explore.  I’ll head there as soon as I get home from work.  Thanks for the maps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, in Skyfire, is a globe of the world (near the druid port).  On the globe, you'll see Antonica, Faydwere, Odus, Kunark, Velious and a yet unnamed continent.<br />
<br />
From the map, it seemed Odus or Faydwere are the best launching points for the new lands.  But I guess Antonica will work just as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From Jaggedpine Forest, it's more like the North East corner of the zone. The tunnel to Nedaria's Landing is around loc pos 1060, neg 2190.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You're right, NE part of zone, edited post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just FYI you cannot click the gem in Jagged Pine forest at the town and go back to Surefall Glade. If you click the one at town it sends you to Nedaria's Landing. The Gnoll cave gem puts you into Blackburrow like it should. Gonna /bug this</div></div><hr />

&lt;horror flashbacks to Luclin&gt;<br />
AIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!<br />
Let's hope it takes them longer than just Christmas... more like summer. Or next fall. Just ONCE take the time and do it right out of the box!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Top end guilds would cry and go blow up SoE's offices if they didn't add in new raid content until next summer or fall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Cool, thanks for mapping the zone, I'll go check it out!  <br />
<br />
On a side note, was that the only new zone added?  I haven't patched yet, but the article on mobhunter seemed to imply more zones went live that weren't announced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they went live, they didn't download the zone files  :D . Nevadaria was the only zone downloaded in the patch.</div></div><hr />
