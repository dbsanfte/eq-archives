<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got the idea that I needed a lot of hp and ac gear but somehow I don't seem to have that or decent wis gear :(<br />
Pretty broke too although I'm willing to farm HGs, already getting my 56 spells pretty cheap which is something so I have a bit more time to farm.<br />
But I haven't got a clue to farm for what!<br />
Help :)<br />
Edit: Forgot the magelo ;) http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=168007</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nulaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just thought something should be added to your post. She's a one team dark, which means that she can barely get a full group of 55+ people together without announcing it a week ahead, so think of that when you guys give ideas for her gear.<br />
<br />
Talk to me in game Haly, I'll probably have tons of advice as always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Bumped b/c I always hear Nulaal's advice :p and I want to hear some others ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">for better ac...<br />
<br />
spider fur belt<br />
totemic leggings or (is shissar scale shaman equipable?)<br />
totemic helm<br />
<br />
none of those are expensive but all are ac upgrades to your stuff.  I didn't really pay attention to what you would lose by putting them on, but I'm assuming you'd lose some wisdom since most of the gear i saw on you had wisdom on it.  The tot helm has 5 wis on it though so that will help with the loss a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ditch the Mushroom veil for either crystal spider eyes or something better. Basically, there are a lot of things with about 35 hp and 3 wis... veil fo the executioner, for example. <br />
<br />
Total gain: 35 hp and 3 wis.<br />
<br />
Get the Earring of the Solstice. It adds hp and wis, and ft1. It will cost about 7-10k depending on the prices of your server to buy the parts, but it is one of the best earrings out there. Replace your forest loop. 55 hp, 5 more wis.<br />
<br />
Total Gain: 90 hp, 8 wis<br />
<br />
I'd replace the Froglok BP with a Tin Mail Shirt, those run 3.9-5k on my server, and have 10wis 25 hp 7 sta, which works out to 46 hp. Also slightly better ac. This gives you 5 more wis, 46 more hp.<br />
<br />
Total Gain: 136 hp, 13 wis<br />
<br />
Replace your Nathsar bracer with a Coldain Military Wristguard - easy to MQ. Gain: 2 wis, 3 ac, and a nice focus effect.<br />
<br />
Total Gain: 136 hp, 15 wis<br />
<br />
For yoru range, You can get a griffon's eye for 10 wis (at the cost of -20 cha), those go for 2-3k, drop off of Griffons in jaggedpine. Gain: 5 wis.<br />
<br />
Total gain: 136hp, 20 wis<br />
<br />
It's a start. To go better you need more money (for instance, the girdle of mithandrael has 10 wis and 55 hp and 10 sta), or quest, or get velious armour, or get no-drop from the plane of storms. (Rain travelers overcloak, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Any Rune Crafter's, Worlf Caller's or SS gear you can get.  All have good ac plus stats.  <br />
<br />
Shadel Bandit Ring<br />
<br />
Goranda Idol from ME.  sp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hers a few ideas:<br />
Ear: Replace Forrest loop with Earring of Cleansing or Earring of Purity or Skull Charm<br />
Neck: Get 2 friends and cap Yeldema to get Yeldema's Talisman (i am 55 and been doing this with 55 druid and 57 Pally, easy)<br />
Face: Crystal Spider Eyes or Death Mask of the Elysians<br />
Head: Camp KD arena with a few friends for Runecrafters helm?<br />
Fingers: Consider Upgrading to Shadel Bandit Ring and Circled Toe Bones<br />
Wrists: Do the Coldain Military Bracer Quest NOW! Also, Jarsarth bracers rot in KC. Try to get a Braclet of Sense or Fortitude, or a Dragon bracer from WW dragons<br />
Arms: Barbed Ringmail would be nice<br />
Shoulders: Elder Wolf Hide<br />
Chest: KD arena for Runcrafters<br />
Back: Lodizial is pretty easy to kill if you have 1 good group including a good tank, a shaman and a CH cleric<br />
Belt: Chitinous belt<br />
Legs: Kromriff Military leggings quest is v easy. Jarsarth legs are quite good and drop/rot from jailer in KC<br />
Range: Howling harpoon is better than slimey, and v cheap. Ceremonial Smudging stick is easy solo camp. Gantru Charm is nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you have PoP a cheap range upgrade can be the Beginner's Magic Manual, 7ac 6wis/int 15hp/mana for an item that can be bought in bazaar for under 300pp.<br />
<br />
Also jsut check on some PoP drops selling in bazaar, chains of the accursed(might have name wrong) is 14ac+stats bracer that selling for 1500 right now, or you may just be able to go solo for it in PoJ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm planning on saving for the totemic helm (or maybe questing) as it looks a decent upgrade and bought the crystal spider eyes now. <br />
<br />
I'll keep trying for the other stuff, hitting PoG as much as possible and KD arena etc. <br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />
