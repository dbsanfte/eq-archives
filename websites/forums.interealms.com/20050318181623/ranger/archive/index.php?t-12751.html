I haven't bought PoP yet, but I'm thinking about it.  But I'm wondering if there will be enough content for me to justify it.  I've read about a lot of cool stuff to do, but most of it seems to involve needing lots of people at some point.  I'm pretty much a casual gamer at this point, and I just run around EQ with a small group of friends (4-6 of us, level 55-60).  So I'm wondering if it's worth us to invest in PoP.  <br />

Thanks, <br />

<br />
PoK and PoT are non-combat zones, and have a lot of quests and vendors in them.  The other 4 are combat zones.<br />
<br />
Innovation your group could grind in easily.  Just follow one of the paths from zone in and move onward down it, and fight back when you want to leave, or evac if you have a porter.  The repop rate is such that you are fine if you just move forward as they spawn, and then when you want to leave just reverse the process.  You won't be able to do stuff like the escort quest, but since fun items have a chance of dropping off almost anything, its a neat zone to grind in.  Most (read, all but Archaic that I have fought so far) are slowable, snareable, mezzable, etc.<br />
<br />
Justice has a LOT of background info in it.  Its fun just to wander around talking to all the prisoners.  I have heard (but I cannot personally confirm) that there is no faction hit for killing the normal guards who wander the halls.  Some of the prisoners will be agro on you as well, but I don't know the faction on them.  Again, a single group could kill most of the &quot;yard trash&quot; non-quest related stuff in this zone.  There are also trials, and these are actuallly limited to one group of 6.  They are rough, but they are needed for further planes (including Plane of Storms).  They seem to be set up for the 62ish level of groups, but if you are good and have high DPS, your group of friends may be able to do them as well.<br />
<br />
Disease is... well, just really really gross.  Its also an okay place to grind.  I have not hunted here as much, so I can't say for sure one way or the other about it, but it seems like an interesting place, and I'm gonna explore it more myself with a group.  Just not right after eating supper. :p<br />
<br />
Nightmare I have only been in once.  I got really whomped when my group ran to zone in and I didn't notice.  Got back to camp with two gnarled treants going &quot;uh, guys?&quot; and then got ported to bind.  It looks like a neat spot as well to grind, but I'll need to explore here more myself.<br />
<br />
All of the planes are flagged outdoors, and some have animals in them.  Your group of friends should be great to go for those 4 easily, and if you work at it, you may be able to get the trials done for the flags to get to Plane of Storms and Valor with your friends, depending on the make-up and playing style you all have.</div></div><hr />
