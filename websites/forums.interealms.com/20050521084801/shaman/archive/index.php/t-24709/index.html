<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okie i'm confused and i admit it. I'm in lair of trapped ones. Trying to get the Pockmarked Aegis to drop for my pally and maybe a stone for me. I kill my 15-20 mobs and ph pops up in first hallway. <br />
<br />
The cofusion is ive read/seen people get the ph to pop. If its ph they leave and get another expedition. If its the named course would kill it. However ive yet to get a named to pop regardless how i do it. If a ph pops should sit and camp it like a conventional named spot or just keep doing them over?<br />
<br />
Rigara the Lost is the named i am referring to. I know a sludge eating fly can spawn someplace and a type of larva. Ive had so little luck with these just started to question how i'm doing these lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They changed it so NO named will be up at the beginning of expeditions anymore... so you have to go in and pop it yourself. In same cases this means named pop on their own after x amount of time and in other cases you have to kill the ph to pop a named. Not sure what the case is here but I am pretty sure you will never see the named up on instance creation.<br />
<br />
Guess they didn;t like people farming them by creating instances over and over :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was actually asking if once got the PH's to spawn if one could sit and clear the ph's to make them spawn named or if it was better to start a new exp After ph's showed up. I had read the other threads on this and wasnt a whole lot about it. <br />
<br />
For what its worth. I did finally get the named to pop. I was starting the exp killing 20 mobs. Checking hallway if ph was up would leave. After 3rd restart the named ghost popped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I may be wrong but pretty sure you can get named by killing phs and then waiting for respawns... I think the respawn rate is faster than the initial delay for the named phs they added too though it may be the same amount of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the replies Solemn =). I was just having that kinda luck where you start questioning the existence of named at a camp/exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ive done countless sewer runs, mostly involving the crematory.<br />
<br />
I find that I kill a certain amount of mobs while progressing into the 2nd or 3rd room, then there is a pop.<br />
<br />
After so many times I now recognise what are normal places for mobs and where they appear when the pop appears. They seem to be different spots so there is no actual PH for the names.<br />
<br />
Therefore when pop happens (about 20 kills in) I search all the likely spots with an eye of zomm looking for the named, If I do not find it within range I presume it has spawned much deeper in the sewer and it is in fact quicker to get another expedition than try and find it. I have found 5 or 6 different spots now where the names appear so camping a PH is not going to work I don't think.<br />
<br />
This is contrary to solemns advice tho. There is another post on this topic under L60-65 hunting grounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You could be right, though if so it was a change. I know the nameds in the sewer trials used to have phs... perhaps they only pop at the one time and only that one time now per expedition :o I would have to go back and see to be sure &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The last time I did a sewer trial you have to kill XX amount of mobs to get the named to spawn. The easiest way to get this done is duel a mage/wizzy and kill the eye of zom XX amount of times.( yes they count as kills) Then the named or Ph's spawn and you dont have to worry to much about getting far into the exp to find nothing.<br />
