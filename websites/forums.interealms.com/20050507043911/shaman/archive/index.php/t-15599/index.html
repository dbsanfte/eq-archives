<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Over the course of the last few weeks, I've been playing my beastlord alot (every once in a while you need a change to keep the game interesting). <br />
<br />
During the course of this time, I've realized that my mana pool, as a beastlord, is feeble beyond belief.  While I was slaughtering the evil, fould, murderous guards of katta for fun and profit, it occured to me that I might want to take a page from my early shaman strategies and see if other classes could benefit from the canni-dance (without actually having Canni, mind you).  <br />
<br />
As it turns out, they can.  A soloing beastlord can fight for a few secodns, sit (to receive the full meditation bonus) and then stand up and resume fighting for a few seconds.  It's most useful when the mob is fleeing (since you do not have to back out of range to sit) but still useful in other circumstances.  I've found that with a minimal loss of DPS, you can actually get your mana back at a much more attractive rate even if you do this very sparingly.  <br />
<br />
Why post here instead of the beastlord forum?  Well, mostly because I'm curious if others have done this and I'm also curious if there are other shaman strategies that have made their way into other classes?  Or have you adopted some other classes interesting approach and applied it to the shaman?</div></div><hr />

While on a horse I would turn off autoattack right before the click hit so that I could get the horse med advantage.   Worked lie a charm, but was a pain in the butt too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do people really do this??<br />
I am trying to picture this in my head, and I can't help but laugh my ass off.  The funniest part is, I am sure this works the way you have described!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well...  I wouldn't do it constantly throughout the fight, but if a mob runs at 20 percent I can usually get about 3 ticks of meditation in before my pet finishes it off.  Anything that reduces downtime seems good to me.  <br />
<br />
But to do it constantly.... no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is a well-known version of &quot;cannibalization&quot; used by mages. They have a spell that gets rid of their pet and turns it back into mana. Under certain circumstances, the mana they get back from the pet is larger than the amount of mana used to make it. So, they create, then destroy pets repeatedly to restore their mana pool.<br />
<br />
I can't think of too many other specifically &quot;shaman&quot; techniques. Root-rot, aggro-kite, tank in TEH FACE - those are all pretty well used by everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For maximum efficiency, yes it takes a few AA's : Quick Summoning 3 (18 AA, though level 2 for 12AA is almost as good), and Elemental Pact (5).<br />
<br />
Even w/o AAs it works out to about 50-60 mana/tick (at a cost of 1 malachite every 2 tick cycle).</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah thats right its lose of DPS from the pet(a major point of their class).  Mages and beastlords wish they could canni like shamans or had something like necros.  <br />

<br />

That's what suspend minion is for.<br />
Suspend current pet.<br />
Cannibalize new pet to get back mana while waiting for the pull to come in.<br />
Release suspended pet to kill target.<br />
It's gross.<br />
I've seen it in action.<br />
It's just plain gross.<br />
<br />
And you don't really need a huge number of AAs.<br />
All you need is the right click kill pet item from Temple of Sol Ro, and level 65 pet.<br />
Quick Summoning just speeds up the process.<br />
The 65 pet I've been told by a mage that does this all the time does not need gems to summon.<br />
<br />
The reason it works is because the amount of mana returned is based on the hps of the pet, not the mana cost of the pet.<br />
Because the high end pets have so many hps, when they cannibalize it, they end up getting more mana than they used to summon it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, its not gross, and no you don't see this happening in a chain exp group. EVEN WITH SUSPEND CRAP MINION.  You know why!??  <br />
<br />
A. It take unnecessary time even with quick summoning.<br />
B. during the time as I said above too.  There is no pet doing &quot;ANY&quot; dps.  HELL, during the time you don't have a mage doing any spell DPS.  What does it take to canni once?  A Canni V a second maybe Canni IV 2.5?  And heres the BEST PART nothing has to be toggled!!!<br />
<br />
Better yet what does a necro do to gain mana oh yeah stand there.<br />
<br />
And you don't really need a huge number of AAs.<br />
<br />
yeah a mage kinda does need a lot of them to make it profitable to them.<br />
18 AA points for Quick summoning level 3<br />
requirement 12 AA points in Caster Archetypes (Level 55)<br />
requirement 6 AA point in General Archetypes (Level 51)<br />
Suspended Minion with weapon about 8 AAs<br />
Improved Reclaim Energy 18 AAs (with the quick summonings same requirements)<br />
Elemental Pact 18 AAs (with the Quick summonings same requirments)<br />
<br />
Total amount of AAs points to make it profitable: 80 <br />
<br />
sorry but 80 AAs just to get a good form of canni LOL no thank you.<br />
<br />
Quick Summoning just speeds up the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;lose DPS from pet&quot;<br />
lose DPS from mage<br />
a lose of DPS from the Mage regardless of quick summoning or not.<br />
65 pet does need components unless you get another set off AAs or an item.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haakim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I used to do an &quot;inner fire&quot; dance with my baby BL. Just like cann, just heal with inner fire in between ticks. Inner fires good ratio and always getting meditation bonus sitting speeds things up nicely. Yes, 20 health becomes negligible after a while, but this can be done with upgraded heal spells as long as they cast in under 5 seconds or so. Also my baby ranger does the same with his crappy heal spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>ellementz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">k, first thing mages dont use improved reclaim energy because it doesnt go off of the pets max hp, but instead it uses the pets mana cost. This of course has its pro's and cons. <br />
Now, i challenge you all to read this http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=3882<br />
and you will see that a good mage will use this ability to its fullest.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh forgot to add in, summoning efficeincy and summoning haste items negate the need of those AA's.<br />
<br />
E</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kylianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'd like to clear up something about Mage Cannibalization.  Most mages call it Pet Canni.  It starts being useful at level 49 using the Shovel of Pons quest item from Sol Ro.  <br />
<br />
Using the spell reclaim energy cast free from the shovel, mages get between 1 mana per 8 to 10 hp (the experts disagree which) of the pet.  Since the 49 earth pet has 3150 hp, this nets approx 115 mana after the casting cost.  Add in a summoning focus item and you add more mana gained.  Add in specialization (assuming the mage is conjuration specialized rather than evocation) and you add another 20 mana per cast roughly.  This is all at level 49 with no AAs.  Total cost is one malachite, figure 5 silver.<br />
<br />
At level 56, when you begin adding in Specialization Mastery, Quick Summoning, etc, it creates a huge increase in mana production.  Typically, the more AA's involved, the more mana.  However, someone above mentioned the AA Improved Reclaim.  What this allows is the ability to gain a set amount from each pet regardless of it's current life.  Testing has shown that this decreases the amount gained per pet used for Canni purposes, but adds significantly for pet chaining, where the mage reclaims the pet when it's near dead and summons another.<br />
<br />
Being only 62, I can easily gain 225 mana in 2 ticks (10 seconds plus or minus my own lag).  I understand that 65 mages with the Son of Rathe (65 earth pet) and the focus item for post 60 pets are gaining around 302 mana per cast with no monetary cost.<br />
<br />
In a chain pulling exp group, I have never once had a group that begrudged me the time off in taking a single pull with no damage done to go from OOM to FM. <br />
<br />
I hope this explains things a little.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Pet Canni is great. :)  65 mage in my guild uses it all the time (before he had the 65 pet, he used MS2 pet instead).  He can nuke constantly with this, and it adds greatly to his dps.  Going 5 ticks without any pet, which enables the mage to nuke another 4-5 times, is more than worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't bothered to buy a horse for any alts but I can see this working very well.  Unfortunately I doubt any player besides a canni-dancing hardened shaman would be in tune enough with the ticks to get it to work efficiently :)<br />
<br />
...sometimes I wake up at night and my leg is cramped cause I've been canni-dancing in my dreams.  /shudder ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">No mages wouldnt use that in a chain pulling grp but they would use it solo or during down time which is when we use canni the most<br />
<br />
/agree<br />
<br />
yep, and since groups produce most exp.  I fail to see any major advantage to pet canni.  <br />
<br />
Oh and I have read the issue on Magecompedium they glorify it but any 65th in a chain pulling group does not see the mage in the group take 5-ies saying &quot;hey guys I am just to going try to get all my mana back over here you all continue fighting.&quot;  To just canni their pet producing a lost of DPS for all of the group to see.  Via lose of pet DPS and lose of a mage casting a conserved planned rain.<br />
<br />
Yes, Summon haste items and regant items help but why pick and choose why not specify what the Magecompedium is raving about which is at least &quot;bloodie 80 AA in a canni ability inwhich they need to toggle summoning their pets and kill the right one without the weapons sufficently.  Personally, in a mage's case I see Casting Fury and Fury of Magic much more worth it than to spend your AA towards...Quick summoning, Suspended Minion, Improved Reclaim Energy or Elemental Pact all to sufficently get the most out of pet canni /boggle.<br />
<br />
<br />
In posts on magecompendium it all looks fine and dandy and seriously OVER glorified.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kylianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You fail to see the relevance of gaining 50 mana per tick or up to 150 mana per tick with the proper AA's?  /Boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You fail to see the relevance of gaining 50 mana per tick or up to 150 mana per tick with the proper AA's?  /Boggle<br />
<br />
The sad part is it is nothing like that amount of mana and not all done in a tick remember there is time needed to toggle and summon and canni the pet.  &quot;And lets not forget the UNGODLY amount of time to get all the AAs to begin with./roll eyes&quot;<br />
<br />
Lastly, the ability I hardly see used and never seen used in chain pulling groups at level 65 (and lets face it this is where a lot of exp is and not soloing).  Most of the time the wasted amount of AA's put into pet canni could have been put into something more profitable to the group and the mage.... like casting fury or fury of magic.  And personally to see the pet DPS taken out of commission and the missed opportunity for a rain to be casted is =-Frowned-= upon by the group.  <br />
<br />
No sorry, both you and comphendium over glorify this crappy &quot;SOLO&quot; ability.  (ever seen a 65 mage try to solo in PoP Tier 3 planes other than BoT or even Tier 4 planes its great LOL).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm. We have lots of experience in using it. We know exactly how powerful it is. We even have solid parses to back it up. You have no data and only your own prejudices toback up your claim that it is crappy.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but you are a clueless [expletive deleted] on this issue.<br />

Not only have I seen it, I've done it. Quite successfully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It sure seems like a good idea to me. I don't see anything crappy about regaining mana faster than you normally could. So what if the mage has to take a few second off or even a mob off every now and then if it increases thier overall dps, lets just say that in an hours time they spend 5 minutes doing this, but get 20% more effecient the other 55 minutes (purely made up numbers, I've never seen this done) thats a net of roughly 12% more dps out of the mage. Any group complaining about this is stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But when you consider that Quick Summoning 3 is going to be high on every mage's list anyway, and the other abilities are extremely useful in their own right, it seems a little more reasonable.  They are spending 80 AA's for a whole boatload of abilities that INCLUDES a nice form of mana regen as well as lots of other abilities.</div></div><hr />

6 base AA's<br />
12 AA's for Spell Casting Mastery<br />
8 AA's for Suspended Minion<br />
Add one VT item and the 65 Mage is ready to canni for full production.<br />
<br />
You're adding in the 6 and 12 cost for base and general AA's 3 separate times (Quick summoning, Caster Archtype and General and Improved Reclaim).  Quick summoning is nice but with a QS item, only 1 or 2 levels are really an improvement.  Elemental Pact is meaningless as it saves a componant, which Son of Rathe doesn't use.  Improved Reclaim hurts pet canni rather than helping so you can't really use that as a factor because it's used in a different skill.<br />
<br />
Really, only 26 AA's are needed to maximixe things, but 0 AA's is almost as good.</div></div><hr />

Where to begin:<br />
<br />
Rathe's Son... not Son of Rathe is on average 14K to buy.<br />
I've seen rathe pet as low as 14k price, the guy had 6 copies at the time and wanted to unload them.<br />

(interesting Rathe's Son can be as high as 40K even some popular servers)<br />
<br />
Rathe's Son does take a component so Elemental Pact is useful and mentioned as the part of the most efficient way to gain mana in this fashion.  Tack on another 18 AA points please:<br />
<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=2026&amp;Page=1<br />
(sorry was stuck looking a lucy raw data as to where component variable was went with castersrealm :rolleyes: oh well.)<br />
<br />
Rathe's Son without Quick Summoning takes 10 seconds to cast plus a recast time of 2.3 seconds.  In total 12.3 seconds.  So yes 12 extra AA points into Quick summon as Mages on MageCompendium are stating in their precious post are very much needed for the -&quot;most&quot;- efficency.  Else with nothing what-so-ever, your going to watch a mage maybe gain 50 mana in what summon + reclaim + recast time of every 16 seconds if he is toggling like crazy with suspend-&gt; summon -&gt; reclaim -&gt; recast.  No thanks I will take ONE Cann IV  (82 mana) or even Canni III over that.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Improve Reclaim Energy (its where the really mana regain comes from) it is very much needed to the mage with out your VT item.  Serious your talking about VT, I still have Mages in my guild crying for Dark summoning gloves and your raving about how EASY VT items come by.  Excuse me need to go to East commons and buy my VT items from the Inn keeper.  Sorry to brake it to you dreamful mage, but VT items are pretty much scares not because of their rarity really but because guilds especailly high guilds have moved on from Luclin material especially from a lot of luclin key and ring required events *yuck.  So Tack on another very vital 18 AA points and lets hear it for the common mage who need Improved Reclaim Energy.<br />
<br />
So yeah your view Kylianna is really looking at mage canni as a totally unreal situation inwhich you believe &quot;every other mage&quot; must have 26 AA points, Average price of 14K Rathe's Son, and a VT item for maxium reclaim.  You also believe they have an endless supply of malachite and amazing quick summoning items that cut down 16 seconds wasted. Where they their pet could be doing damage in the group or the mage could be casting a well conserved and placed Rain.<br />
<br />
Or are You looking at what the magecompendium states where the average Joe shmoe mage can get the maxium amount of mana regeneration in the least amount of time with no needed components bloodie fooken 80 AA points.<br />
<br />
Oh don't worry about Casting Fury or Fury of Magic go the long road to most optimal mana regeneration it equals out ..... um... not really.<br />
<br />
And after all that AA point saving, this pet canni ability is used the mostly in soloing.  Soloing where I see even a Halls of Honor where I watch a mage fall flat on his ass because chain summon just don't cut it.  Where any class that can root has it pretty much made there.<br />
<br />
No, thanks sorry not my cup of tea and sounds like a waste of time.<br />

BZZT. Wrong. No component. Castersrealm is worthless, and basing your postion on their data is terminally stupid. The 62+ mage pets are componentless.<br />
<br />
Improve Reclaim Energy (its where the really mana regain comes from) it is very much needed to the mage with out your VT item.<br />
<br />
Not even close to true. Improved Reclaim reduces the mana recovered in a pure pet-canny situation.<br />
Reclaim w/o IRE gives 1 Mana per 8 or 10 HP (there is some doubt as to which, but it there is a slow accumulation of data shoring up the case for 8).<br />
Reclaim with IRE returns the summoning cost.<br />
<br />
Using Rathe's Son. Specialize Conjuration. No SCM. No Mana Preservation of any sort. Summon Ring for 15% spell haste. This is a basic zero AA, no special equipment, no recurring costs pet-canny.<br />
<br />
W/O IRE : Summon Cost = 400 Mana base, 360 after spec. Pet has 4800 HP. Going with the 1:10 conversion ratio, Mana return is 480 (if 1:8 is right, the return is 600). 480-360 = 120 Mana.<br />
Cast time = 8.5 secs (10.0 base - 1.5 from the ring)<br />
Now, if the mage is doing &quot;suspend,summon,reclaim,unsuspend&quot;, you are right on the 16 second aspect.<br />
<br />
With IRE, the mage would get 360 mana from the reclaim, for a pitiful gain of 40.<br />
<br />
If the mage does have Spell Casting Mastery 3, thats another 40 mana per cycle. And only a brainless twit with no concept of what AAs are good would think this is an AA investment soley (or even primarily) to improve Pet-Canny. Anyone who would chose Fury first doesn't care about efficiency in the first place.<br />
<br />
Else with nothing what-so-ever, your going to watch a mage maybe gain 50 mana in what summon + reclaim + recast time of every 16 seconds if he is toggling like crazy with suspend-&gt; summon -&gt; reclaim -&gt; recast. <br />
<br />
Stop pulling numbers out of your ass...<br />
<br />
<br />
No, thanks sorry not my cup of tea and sounds like a waste of time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Wow, quite a lot of hostility on the Pet Canni issue...  :)  <br />
<br />
I can certainly see the value of the pet canni technique/ability.  It does seem somewhat overpowering to me (a mage is one class which I would not characterize as suffering from a terminal lack of power or flexability) but it isn't my place to poo-poo on the mage's party.  Good for them if they get some nice mana regeneration; that only makes me more likely to group a mage (which I'm already likely to do anyway, considering the boat-load of other abilities they bring to the table). <br />
<br />
Regarding the use of pet canni in groups....  I wouldn't care if the mage sat out a fight now and then to do his thing.  It basically boils down to the same reason I wouldn't care if a ranger sat out a fight -- he'll be more effective in the long run.  During the fight that the mage is relaxing, I'll just work a little harder.  In the end, it will all work out and everyone will be pleased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Pet canni is a trick I've seen pre-60 mages with few AA use, I can only assume it must work because they were doing it.<br />
<br />
I just read the article in the Mage's Compendium. Interesting reading - I'd suggest reading it before ranting about how ineffective this technique must be.<br />
<br />
It works, it gives back mana, even with no AA. AA, focus items, levels, specializations, these all help, but that just improves efficiency. The downsides are loss of a reagent, (which can be negated with AA) and loss of the pet.<br />
<br />
Loss of a pet isn't a minor thing for a mage - it's not just a &quot;5 seconds out of the fight thing&quot;. If that were all, more mages would pet canni even in chain pulling groups. Typically a mage pet will have a few buffs cast on it, and a few summoned items given to it which represent a large mana investment much greater than the simple casting of the pet in the first place. Many mages refuse to canni their pets for this reason. Suspend Minion 2 is the way around that one. Suspend the buffed, equipped pet and canni away on a new one.<br />
<br />
I've seen pet canni used between pulls on raids, in exp groups, and when mages are soloing. It's effective pre-60, pre-AA, but much more effective with items, AA, and higher level spells and gear. A high level mage with the appropriate AA has mana regen that surpasses shamans or necros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Cleric goes AFK, group takes a med break, mage suspends pet and goes to town.  Sounds reasonable to me.<br />
<br />
Somebody spending a lot of time doing this during continuous pulls is probably going to be a drain on the party, but it all depends on how much melee output you have without the pet.<br />
<br />
I don't see why Gagner67 feels the need to &quot;prove&quot; a technique is useless to him when he's not even a mage.  Hats off to the mage community for figuring it out and using it even after they have gotten used to sitting quietly to med for lo these many levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Bazza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Ok just to set you right about pet caining <br />
<br />
I can completely refill my mana pool in 60 seconds<br />
<br />
I  can debuff chain nuke in “fast pulling group” pass out the mob rods like candy (on off the only things that can help some keep up) and over a hour of “fast pulling” I can keep a 220 to 250 dps without KEI. Do you care if I sit out on every fifth mob with only a rain nuke or 2 going in and still probably doing more damage per mob that other caster out side of a wizard if it means I chain nuking the rest of the time? Ask your self next time you group with a good mage how many nuke for how much damage did that mage cast per mob while his pet beating the hell out of that mob v the nukes from the other caster classes.<br />
<br />
And in your mythical fast pulling group I bet you my left nut that the cleric runs out of mana before I do and need down time. <br />
<br />
Pet caini has a big down side though I am pressing my hot keys like a mad thing to get best results.<br />
<br />
You also don’t need a but load off AA to pet caini but it just like every other AA skill out there the more you have the grater your power and for mage mana regain is what lets us keep up DPS.<br />
<br />
As for soloing in the 3 tear PoP zone yes it can be a bitch and we mage are not the uber solo class we where but we can still solo (if with some difficulty) but we are better in groups.<br />
<br />
Mage though still for all the dps we can produce can’t handle an Add worth a dam no real utility other than DS and CoH we do only on thing and we do it well when played well and that damage.<br />
<br />
One last point I like to make sadly as with every other class out there in EQ there are players that know there class and how to get the best out of then and there are them that are happy to just go with the flow. Player skill and not one uber spell is what make a good mage or a good shaman not the “I have this spell so I can root rot in tear 3 PoP zones” just the same as I use to against moss snakes aren’t I uber.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep but others would make you believe that it only takes at most 26 AA to pet Canni with the most effiecency.  <br />
<br />
Seriously the mage that had a hissy fit above (NOTthe quoted poster) has no clue THAT without the right AAs your looking at 16 seconds in summoning-&gt;reclaiming-&gt;recasting just to get some mana not even equivalent that which can be cannied.  There was no data necessary it says its right there in the code of the spell the length of casting and recast.  Especially without quick summoning as they would lead you to believe is not necessary to invest in for this techinque/efficency lol.  <br />
<br />
And the toggleing of buttons to do this inorder to regain full mana even with the maxium amount of efficiency has been claimed to take 60 seconds.<br />
<br />
Sorry the fact is that at least 62+ AA points spent are what the magecompendium are raving about in that article.  And they are speaking about VT items.  Plus toggling for maxium mana effiecency.  For a group I look at that as wasted time, as just a waste where the pet could be doing dps and mage could be using well placed/mana efficent/timed Rains.  <br />
<br />
Finally, how can you state it is more important to go down the road for maxium mana regeneration but to not invest in Casting Fury or Fury of Magic first.  /boggle<br />
<br />
Pet Canni is still best used while soloing. As for a chain pulling exp group I have seen group members as well as myself frown upon its use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Kylianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">This arguement really puzzles me.  Some of you are so dead set to prove that it's worthless...<br />
<br />
I'm a level 62 completely non-uber mage.  According to Magelo, I have a little over 3800 mana and using pet canni, it takes me 5 casts of the 49 earth pet to regain a bar of mana.  Currently, my total AA's are limited to Run3 and Suspend Minion1,  just the basics for survival.  That number is elevated by using a Summoning Efficiency3 item.<br />
<br />
Regarding spell haste:  There is a 50% cap on spell haste.  Any mage out there should have at least 15% from the summoned ring, leaving 35% to be gained by bard songs or AA's.  Having that 35% would be great, but I don't know too many of us that are so anal that we have to spend the additional 9 AA to get from level 2 to 3.<br />
<br />
As far as componants go, the pets above level 61 don't require them.  I believe you have to have one on your person, but it doesn't expend it.  I have tried to use the 62 water pet for canni purposes but was unable to gain any mana from it, perhaps if I had a summoning efficiency4 item, but with no AA's and no items, I was only able to remain even.<br />
<br />
Actually from what I've read, it's more efficient to get Casting Subtlety than Casting Fury for a mage.  It allows us to nuke more and since mana isn't usually a problem with the canni option open, it creates more DPS overall.<br />
<br />
Regarding the VT gloves of dark summoning.  Yes, i'm sure it's helpful.  I'm sure it's cool.  But it can be done without them.  Whether it's as efficient or not is something I'll leave to the ubers.  I'm just a normal person with a job.  I solo, I group and I canni and it makes me happy to be able to contribute more over time by doing so.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, its not 62 or even near 62 AA for pet canni to be efficient, and if you want to bitch about AA...think about this, FOR MAX EFFICIENCY WITH CANN FOR US IT TAKES 24 Gen \ MC3 \ Cann + 20 SCR \ SCRM + 18 QB3 + 12 SCM (for a total of 74 AA) for us to MAXIMIZE our efficiency with Cann.  <br />
<br />
24 for general, MC3, and Cann5 cause you gotta have cann5 and MC3 \ 6 in general is req for cann5.  20 total for SCR \ SCRM cause with those your quiescence \ torpor lasts a few extra seconds, resulting in less mana to heal yourself up from cann.  Need 18 in QB3 so you can cast Qui \ Torp faster, reducing your casting time so you can get more canns in, I would say QB2 but it seems that VT AND OTHER FOCUS ITEMS ARE UNPOSSIBLE TO GET, OH NOS!!!  And ya need the 12 in SCM cause SCM makes all spells cost less mana which in turn makes you use less mana on quiescence \ torpor, again increasing effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Now shut the **** up please, you have no clue what you are talking about, it doesnt take 62+ AA for them to max effectiveness on that, just like it doesnt take us 74 to max effectiveness on canni.  Sure some of those AAs help, but the amount they make it better is too small to count, and EVERYONE should have at least some focus items, making some of those AAs useless.<br />
<br />
I swear, I dont even know why I still come her sometimes, theres so many people with their heads so far up their asses, they think that Shamans are the best class in the game and anytime anyone else gets anything they have to find a way to prove its not true CAUSE NOTHING CAN BE BETTER THAN SOMETHING A SHAMAN HAS OMG!  Look, pet Canni has been around for quite some time now, and it IS faster than our canni, it just is.  Does that make it better?  No, our canni is faster cast, and we can cast it between dots or debuffs or whatever if we have to, they have to step back from the fight, which does take away from their DPS somewhat, but is our canni better?  No its not, even though we can canni during fights and just keep going, after they step out they can get their mana back much faster than us and overall it does improve their dps \ efficiency more than ours does us.<br />
<br />
Ok I'm out, but one last thing, Gagner67, you are a dumbass and a ****ing insult to good shamans everywhere (I say shamans cause I assume your a shaman, if your not, feel free to correct me, I can change that to whatever other class you need!).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Bazza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">One thing I would like to ask about shaman caining do you ever agro the incoming mob or mobs in camp becouse of low hp agro. If so how do you deal with this issue? <br />
<br />
I tend to pet caini on the pull and for the first few seconds a tank is gaining agro as it about the only way the tank will keep the agro once I start chain casting and holding off a few seconds for good tank agro keeps me alive as I can in no way tank like a shaman.<br />
<br />
So what do GOOD shamans do when  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">To avoid low health agro, you typically don't canni down that far. The only time I found that I got low health agro when I wasn't careful was around level 58/59 when I was using Kragg's Mending to heal myself without having cleric/druid buffs.<br />
<br />
Basically, don't canni down that far in the first place, which is easy enough if you're using stoicism/torpor/quiescence to heal and have reasonable HP for your level. It's slightly harder at 58+ if you want Kragg's to heal as much as it can.<br />
<br />
By the time you get Canni V and don't have so much choice about how far you canni down (1924 is a sizeable chunk of HP), you should aim to have reasonable HP such that you can Canni V from full with just your own buffs on without low health agro. 2000 hp unbuffed isn't a bad goal for level 60.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, just pick your moments. Wait between pulls or until a mob is running. It's a bit harder if the group is chain pulling, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Asheran Mojomaster keep some composure swear up a storm changes a thread from discussion to flaming.<br />
<br />
Canni V was not the subject.  But I must admit there are times due to my personal insane regen, that an unfocused torp. or Qui. is more than enough to recover.  And Canni V is extremely fast and a lot of mana and much different than:  <br />
<br />
1. To first Susphending Minion (requiring the cost of AAs)<br />
2. Chew up your pet (for best results, you need Improved Reclaim Energy which is more AAs), <br />
3. casting a new pet in 10 seconds (without Quick Summoning AAs)<br />
4. Then there is recast time to figure in<br />
<br />
To get past many of these stipulations AAs are require or as even mentioned perhaps an occational VT item.  To speed up the process to canning pets The MageComphendium naturally takes the best scenario which ADMITLY IS A BIT OF REQUIREMENT FOR MAXIUM Efficency and now compare that to the easy given to shamans with a line of spells or abilities like Canni.<br />
<br />
Lets not forget Asheran Mojomaster, even you admit with what I have been saying all along Pet canni in a chain pulling group takes away DPS.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the chance for a well placed, conserved Rain.<br />
<br />
Juujuu, beside your 'childish name calling.'  Mages are known for their DPS over time and they have been known for that even before pet canni was found.  You need to realize removing pet DPS and spell DPS from a class (like Mage) in a chain pulling group especially when that class is known for to being picked up in group for their (mages) DPS and then just to sit there for 3-4 fight to gain all your mana is frowned on by myself and group members.  <br />
<br />
A. Pet canning is a (LOT!!!) different in time wise (especially with out the AAs to make it quick and efficent) from the fact a shaman can taking a quick second to hit Canni V every 3 mins or Canni 4 (which takes mind you a couple seconds) for mana.  <br />
<br />
B. Remmeber, Shamans are not picked up in a group primarily for their DPS like mages but for their slows and buffs in MOST cases.<br />
<br />
You or other mages come here and feel indifferent to how some shamans or individuals preceive the way classes take up their time in a chain pulling groups.  But remember Asheran Mojomaster and Juujuu their is no reasons to mock shamans especially with flaming words.  I personally take you points about shamans with a grain of salt.  But there is always something to be said about being proud about the class you play.  So if some of the forums on this site make shaman look DAMN good (*slick back hair*) don't forget after all.... this is a shaman forum.</div></div><hr />

See for yourself what it says about the various posters in the current discussion, hehe.<br />
<br />
Slightly on-topic: my magician uses pet canni when in exp groups that require maximum performance. Tactics pit is one such place. There may be people that frown on pet-canni but I haven't met them, and would be unlikely to repeat the encounter if I ever did. And I assure you I would not feel any loss at all.<br />
<br />
In practice, I spend more time working on Canni as a shaman than I do as a mage. I don't have Canni5 yet, though, so I'm not really qualified to comment on it. (Tip: it is good to talk about things you know.) I can say that my mage never spent an AA point on anything intended to improve pet canni. Her pet canni ability has improved as a side-effect of her overall increasing power. She didn't waste any plat on it either. The level 49 pet spells work just fine, and every mage has a reclaim-pet device, quested from Sol Ro. Having gotten 3 copies of the 65 pet from turning in runes, she of course uses it now...and still doesn't have the lvl65 nuke.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, I have been using canni for 35 levels. My mage couldn't start until level 49, but she didn't need any AA to get started. I'm looking forward to getting level 60 and going 100% AA to get canni5 now, in the same way my magician couldn't wait to get level 60 and work for /pet hold. (Just my preference to do AA after level 60.)</div></div><hr />

Essentially what you are saying is that you would rather the mage sit on his ass for 10 minutes to get full mana by meditating and keeping the pet dps.  <br />
While pet dps is nice, i doubt that the mages contributed dps is higher meditating than it would be pet canni'ing.<br />
<br />
Lets assume the pet does 100dps (i have no clue what it really is, i figure somewhere around there) and our mage has a mana pool of 5000.<br />
I am not even going to calculate specialization in.<br />
<br />
no canni dancing:<br />
<br />
lets say our mage has 70 mana per tick regenerated (looks a bit high for an xp group without a bard but whatever)<br />
<br />
our mage would take around 7 minutes to replenish his mana pool just sitting on his ass.<br />
<br />
damage over 7 minutes:<br />
pet damage  = 42,000<br />
mage damage = 0<br />
<br />
canni dancing:<br />
<br />
since the mage canni's the pet his dps during the first minute will be 0.<br />
after that minute the he is full mana and has a pet to do damage.<br />
mage dps is calculated by using sun vortex (375 mana 1550 dd) without any mana saving abilities.<br />
<br />
damage over 7 minutes:<br />
<br />
pet damage = 36,000<br />
mage damage = 20,600  <br />
<br />
<br />
Call me stupid but thats almost 20k more damage over the course of 7 minutes, <br />
and the mage doesnt take 6 minutes to unload his pool so in theory he could canni again before the 7 minutes are elapsed.  <br />
If you add in specialization SCM and various focus effects the difference will just be even bigger.<br />
<br />
The numbers i chose for pet dps and mana regen may be a little off please correct me and i will calculate it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Your estimate of pet DPS is a little high, but not too far off. 70-80 is more typical. 90+ is possible with the water pet if it is kept in &quot;rogue position&quot;. That means either a good tank is keeping the mobs turned so the pet is at their back, or the mage is running around to position the pet. If the tank does it you might even reach the 100 DPS you mention. If the mage is doing the positioning, he isn't medding while doing so.<br />
<br />
It is a nit, but you meant &quot;damage&quot; where you wrote &quot;dps&quot; for the totals, I'm sure. Good mages can sustain 150+ DPS without pet canni (and that isn't max). No one gets near 20600 dps ... :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not True.<br />
If the mage is level 65 as they were stating.<br />
<br />
KEI or VoQ and horse are more than enough mana regen for 1 to 2 well place rains in a chain pulling group.<br />
<br />
I believe rather than -wasting- tons (62+) AA points to get the optimal mana regen from Pet canni (which the Magecompendium is raving about in that post on compendium) is not worth it.  It is not worth spending those AA points on those AA abilities first to get the most efficeny out of pet canning, compared to instead putting those AA points into casting fury and fury of Magic.  If in fact one 'garanteed' rain with THREE waves can land in the given time a chain pulling exp group allows a mob to stand.  More bang for your buck (crits) is what is necessary and NOT SITTING OUT OF THE FIGHTS PET CANNING.<br />
<br />
To see a mage blasting ways his mana with single 2K nukes inwhich he can't land crits and then only to see that 'mage AND pet' sitting out for 3-4 fights to pet canni -=IS=- frowned upon and not just by me.  <br />
<br />
Removing the pet DPS and regular spell DPS is something to think about especially from a DPS over time class, such as a Mage.<br />
<br />
Pet Canni is most optimal for a soloing mage.  But soloing does not rear as much exp.  Plain and simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gagne57:  <br />
You seem fixated on the mage sitting out for &quot;3-4 fights&quot;.  Why?  It is not really that long; a typical fight lasts about a minute.  When you factor in pull time, maybe a little more than a minute.  In that amount of time, the mage can get most (or all) of his mana back.  Even if you assume that the mage only gets half his mana back during that time (lets say the mage has no AA points at all) then the benefit is still there.  <br />
<br />
More mana = more mana.  There is no law that says a mage must pet-canni to full mana if time doesnt allow.<br />
<br />
Regarding the AA points, as many have pointed out they simply make the processs more efficient.  I personally wouldn't bother unless I had suspend minion (5 points, total).  I would also prefer to have a quick-summoning focus item (which, I imagine, a mage could probably summon or purchase very cheaply). <br />
<br />
Should a mage get these points that make the process more efficient before they get the spell casting fury/spell casting mastery lines?  Probably not, but it really depends on the play-style of the player.  Crits are random, as you are no doubt aware.  If you know you can get an extra 5 nukes in every 10 minutes, perhaps pet-canni is the way to go since it would be constant DPS.  I'm pulling numbers out of the air, by the way -- it could be 10 nukes, or 8 nukes, or 3 nukes; ask a mage.<br />
<br />
In any case, I think you are over-reacting.  If the mages feel they get significant benefit, even without AA points, good.  If you doubt them, parse it.  It isn't hard to measure the DPS of a mage pet, a mage, or both.  Group with a mage and ask him not to pet-canni for 20 fights.  Then ask him to pet-canni at will during the next 20 fights.  Will his overall DPS go up or down during that time?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Kylianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Gagner seems to have it set in his mind that mages are wasting the &quot;62+&quot; or &quot;80+&quot; AA's instead of getting SCF and FoM.  In actuality, the prefered path for pet canni includes the 6 general (which noone gets out of).  12 used in Spell Casting Mastery (which makes those same rains he's talking about cheaper).  Spell Casting Haste (which makes them faster to cast).  He then goes on to tell us about a bunch of other AA's that we don't really need to do it.  Frankly, he's looking at the ideal pet cannibalist quoted on the Magician's Tower, but many of us don't have those AA's.  For my mind, assuming I had 62 AA's, I'd be using pet canni AND have SCF3.<br />
<br />
Basically, the whole arguement seems to boil down to a linear examination of the AA's as useless or not and the only ones that passed muster according to Gagner67 are SCF and FoM.  We're a damage class, so anything else is a waste.  &quot;Why did all of you mages waste 3 AA's getting Run3?!  You could have gotten SCF1!!&quot;  Short answer, it saved my buns many times when I didn't have a sow and it was required to get SCF and SCM.  It's like asking why shaman make a dog in a group, you're not there for damage, so why are you getting in our way?  (That's a joke, don't quote me).<br />
<br />
I do have one question for you Gagner67:  Have you played a mage?  I have a year played on mine and I still have the occasional question about it.  I've played a shaman up to 50 and I wouldn't dream of questioning someone else's AA choice.  It's not like we're spending those 80 AA on Innate Lung Capacity.  We're choosing things that increase our capabilities, increase our overall damage in any situation, and increase our survivability.<br />
<br />
One last thing, there is a 3rd way we do damage: Damage Shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, Nameless, Selous 65th.  In chain pulling group mobs last about 27 to 35 seconds.  One well placed rain, KEI, horse, SCF, and pet is all that is necesary.  All else is add or wasted time.   I know what I can an I can't take especially HoH.</div></div><hr />

See, this is one of the biggest parts that you dont understand, yes Improved Reclaim Energy makes you get all the mana it took to summon your pet regardless, if you max it out, BUT if you use the lvl 65 earth pet you get MORE mana than it takes to summon in the first place.  Without Imp Reclaim mana the mana ya get back is based on HITPOINTS, not how much the pet costs to summon, and the 65 pet has enough to make it give you quite a bit more than it cost to make in the first place.  Please, quit running you mouth about **** you dont understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Reysa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">LOL<br />
<br />
I've been in HoH groups where the mobs lasted about 20-30 seconds. Great exp! Of course, none of the mages were using pet canni. There was no need. But then, neither of the two mages were actually IN the group, hehe. They both, along with an enchanter, were being duo'd by group members and were just there for added DPS. (I got all of level 58 in a couple hours in such a group.)<br />
<br />
There are times to use pet canni, and there are times it is silly to even think about it. I think most mages only use it when it is needed. Likewise, I bet shaman don't hit their canni5 button unless they actually are low on mana.<br />
<br />
IRE is, IMO, an anti-AA. It sounds great but when you realize it actually lowers the efficiency of pet canni you understand it is a mistake to get it. Hope you didn't make that mistake...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Since I play a mage and a shaman I'll put my 2 cents in:<br />
<br />
For maximum DPS it is highly suggested that a Mage choose SCM over SCF. I personally chose SCF because I wanted flashy crits, but I did so knowing it would effect my DPS downward. Basically, conserving mana on a cast is worth much more to a mage than a 7% chance to double the damage of a nuke. Yes we have calculated all the numbers.<br />
<br />
Improved Reclaim Energy is an AA designed to improve the mana used when chain-casting pets. Using IRE you can chain cast with no mana loss whatsoever. IRE has been proven to negatively effect Pet Canni however so mages must make a careful choice before training it. I won't ever train it. You can still Pet Canni with IRE, but it is not as good.<br />
<br />
My first AA was Suspend Minion - both for Pet Canni and for the countless other options this skill gives me.<br />
<br />
I have used Pet Canni since level 49. The mana regen is unreal and only gets better with AAs. I will buy Quick Summoning 2 (QS2 + Spell Haste 4 + BoR = spell haste cap). I am purchasing this to lower the time it takes to CoH people (try CoHing 70 people by yourself). That it helps pet canni is only an added benefit.<br />
<br />
I use Pet Canni in chain pulling groups. I typically dump mana on 3 pulls and sit out for the forth to get back to full mana. I have never had a negative comment about this as they can clearly see the number of times I get to nuke on the other 3 pulls.<br />
<br />
AoE Rain spells have a very high chance that at least one wave will be fully resisted. This makes their use about the same as a nuke and I rarely use them. I have the math to back this up if you care.<br />
<br />
The only time I don't Pet Canni is when we are using my pet as the MT (and that is quite often). In that case Pet Canni would disrupt pulls for the entire group so I don't use it.<br />
<br />
I don't see many Mages Pet Canni at any level. Everytime I ask the reason turns out to be they either A) Don't know about it, or B) Are too lazy to bother with it.<br />
<br />
NEVER EVER TRUST CASTER'S REALM.</div></div><hr />

You are assuming that the description of IRE is accurate. It isn't. Do you also believe the description of Spell Casting Mastery? Do you think specialization is a 'check' and not a fixed amount?<br />

Conclusion:<br />
I have Reysa above posting me how even in a 3 person chain pulling group agreeing that kills last from 20-30 seconds.  That the two mages in the group weren't using Pet Canni and could constantly kill.  -=It is called managing your mana with well place spells and the use of your pet's DPS (not eating your pet for 60 seconds)=-.  And I will have to agree.  Think about it, it makes sense too rather sitting off the side toggling buttons.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Fury and Fury of Magic allows crits.  And a well placed rain and pet every fight with some crits is a lot easier.  And, I would wager and know is a lot more effiecent than blowing all your mana on 2K nukes that don't ever have the chance to crit for a couple fights.  Then with (for Kyliannes sake: 26AA point and VT item) 60 seconds to gain all the mana back for the next fight.  Pet canni is a solo tactic, seriously.  Pet canni is best used while soloing.  I have said that all along in this thread.  But I find it a waste of time, DPS and effort to get the AAs &amp; VT items, to loose the Pet DPS &amp; mage spell DPS, and to toggle buttons in order to pet canni.  Now I do have a 65 mage, 65 shaman, and hee hee hee a level 2 druid.  I personally beleive from my experience that shaman have it much better scenario's inwhich canning can take place.<br />
<br />

Pull it apart?  Sure, that says its not an AE, has no duration, or AE duration (rain), its usable at lvl 127 for all but mages, enchs, and necros (in other words, not usable), only works on pets, its beneficial, it is inneruptable, its unresistable, it uses spell animation 89, spell icon 89, it has no pushback, or pushup (doesnt pull it in your direction, or push it away), costs 5 mana, has 100 range, works at any time of day, works anywhere, gives off no light, the fizzle adjust is 25, and its deletable, anything else ya wanna know?<br />

Thx reading comprehension, if you actually read all of Reysa's post you would notice that those mages were 2boxed OUTSIDE the group, as in they werent main characters, just extra dps someone brought along.  And yes, in HOH mobs wont last long, ESPECIALLY with 2 EXTRA dps gimps being boxed out of group.  Thats not the case in all POP zones, go try Ele, mobs usually last at least 60 seconds there, and thats where the good exp is. <br />

<br />
What is so confusing? There are two seperate discussions going on in this thread at the moment. One regarding the posibilty of clerics doign a 'yaulp-dance', and the one where we keep pointing out how clueless you are on the mechanics and details of pet-canny. Instead of making 2 back-to-back posts on the two seperate issues, I made one and clearly delinated which part each section was for. <br />
[note : see my earlier comment on reading comprehension ]<br />
<br />
But, yes I was being childish. That isn't abnormal when dealing with a petulant child (they tend to find it easier to understand).<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, on to your woefully deficient math skills.<br />
<br />
18 AA points for Quick summoning level 3<br />
requirement 12 AA points in Caster Archetypes (Level 55)<br />
requirement 6 AA point in General Archetypes (Level 51)<br />
Suspended Minion with weapon about 8 AAs<br />
Improved Reclaim Energy 18 AAs (with the quick summonings same requirements)<br />
Elemental Pact 18 AAs (with the Quick summonings same requirments)<br />
<br />
Total amount of AAs points to make it profitable: 80 <br />
<br />
While it is true that 18+12+6+8+18+18 = 80, it relys on certain underlying assumptions that make the number meaningless. <br />
<br />
You see, you appear to have either pulled the numbers out of your imagination or gotten them from some completely worthless information site.<br />
<br />
I shouldn't have called your math skills deficient, and for that I appologize. It is your research abilities that deserve that label.<br />
<br />
<br />
The actual cost of the AAs listed is:<br />
6 : General (it is rather silly to count it, since it is required for ANY useful AAs but I'll leave it in anyway)<br />
12 : Archtype (Spell Casting Mastery)<br />
18 : Quick Summon 3 (QS 2 is just as good if you have a cleric to cast blessing of reverance, btw)<br />
8 : Suspend Minion 2<br />
3 : Improved Reclaim<br />
5 : Elemental Pact<br />
=============<br />
52 : Total<br />
<br />
You are only off by 28.<br />
<br />
If you cut the list down to only what is needed for a level 65 mage to have maximum efficiency with the 65 Earth pet, it becomes :<br />
<br />
6 : General (see comment above)<br />
12 : Archtype (Spell Casting Mastery)<br />
18 : Quick Summon 3 (see note above)<br />
8 : Suspend Minion 2<br />
=============<br />
44 : Total<br />
<br />
Now you are off by 36. EPact was removed because the 65 earth doesn't use malachite. IRE was removed because it reduces efficiency when used on 49 Earth, Monster Summoning II, and 65 Earth - the three best pets for PC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of those 44 AAs, 18 of them every mage is going to buy them (every caster, really). That leaves 26 AAs whose 'primary' purpose is to help with PC.<br />
18 of those 26 (QS) are usefull to mages who don't PC. It makes chain-casting pets easier. It makes all item summons faster. It makes CotH faster. It doesn't help grouping efficiency all that much, but it is very usefull for soloing and raiding.<br />
The other 8 (SM2) are of moderate utility value, but in most cases don't really help with XP/Raiding.<br />
<br />
That means : 18 AAs you were definitely going to buy anyway, 18 which usefull even if they don't pet canny, and 8 that are of moderate utility to a non-PC mage.<br />
<br />
I have changed my opinion of your insistance on IRE being required from annoyance to amusement. So far not one thing you have presented actually disproves the absolute fact that it reduces the mana gain from reclaiming the pets that mages normally use for pet-canny.<br />
<br />
Asheran missed one little detail in derailing your attempt to post Lucy data... you posted the data for the Level 1, been-in-the-game-since-BETA, spell Reclaim Energy (a spell which, btw, is available on 24 items - many of which are insta cast). The very spell we use to do Pet Canny in the first place. Not the the AA Improved Reclaim Energy. There is no Lucy data for IRE. Why? It isn't a triggered ability. It is a permanent, passive ability. Such things aren't found in Lucy - tried looking up Lucy info for Natural Durability or Mental Clarity?.<br />

Just one last thing:<br />

<br />
At level 57, I pet canni. No, I do not need hordes of AA. I dont even have focus items other then my summoned ones. My equipment is actually pretty bad, I barely have the mana pool for mass rod (2750 I believe). Even in chain groups, even when I have to take a fight or two off for pet canni, I still increase my DPS rather then lower it. It isnt by any vast amount, but it is still increased.<br />
<br />
AA points, focus items and all that shiz are NOT needed to pet canni. All that is needed for pet canni is the reclaim energy spell (level 1) and the level 49 earth pet.<br />

<br />
Funny, in all those insults in those threads.  And on a die hard mage board where pet canni should be irrefutably defended, since after all its their technique they are raving constantly about.  No doubt many are going to defend it there BLINDLY.  <br />
<br />
And out of all that you still get the following post on MageTower.<br />
<br />
<br />
Serious question though... DO you guys usually use pet canni in exp-grind groups, or is it more for soloing/raiding? Not to restart the shaman board flame war, I'm just curious what the majority of folks really do in the daily grind... <br />
<br />

<br />
and<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with Gagner67, <br />
<br />
I think Pet canni has been played up by the mage community a bit. Who wouldn't play up an awesome way to gain mana that a class never was intended to experience? <br />
<br />
But how much in a chain pulling group such as in HoH in which mobs are dying sometimes in 20-30 seconds intervals is it worth it for you and pet to step out of the fight and then use your spent AAs on pet canni'n for the next possible 3 fights to get full mana? <br />
<br />
What I mean, is: Is it worth it to spend AA's to best possibly get the best chance to more often crit in the one possible rain you get off in those 20 second fights? And is that one rain and pet more than enough DPS for each fight? I know give me KEI, and I am all set in most cases especially in a group. <br />
<br />
I guess, is there a difference in DPS with a mage slinging timed rains with the possibility to crit? Compared to the mage and pet that steps out, of the next three fights in a chain pulling group to gain all his mana and then blast like crazy with non-crit nukes again. Has anyone even done the parsing? <br />
<br />
And if you read the whole thread, Phantasmagorical, some did agree with Gagner but it is just towards the end of the thread turned into a troll sling contest. <br />

Asheran Mojomaster and Zyphyr (mage) don't bother, I am still ignoring your posts.  Set in the userCP here on shaman crucible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Gagner, your arguments have now made me actively look for a Mage who pet Canni's to duo with. Your Logic is structuraly flawed. Your using fluff and adding pointless facts ( Which, funny enough are wrong half the time from your use of Castersrealm. ) to try and beef up your arguments. Although I think your having a good time with your gibberish, but please stop giving shamans a bad name.<br />
<br />
I think we need to conduct an experiment. Lets put Bracy and Gagner in a closet, with a tape recorder. We shall give each of them a 5 page argumentative essay proving the writer's point about 2 seperate topic's, and let's see how long it takes them to realize they are arguing about seperate topics. I give it 3 hours, and another 6 hours before either will admit it. =P<br />

I'm sure your now going to insult me, as insulting me will prove your argument to everyone.<br />

Actually no.  My main is a Magician and on the Mage Compendium there is a page about this one, so I came to see what all this was about.  Samyen &quot;Elementia&quot; is a Magician.  Speshol Won is my level 41 Shaman alt.  Thanks and sorry if I came off as being rude.<br />
<br />
On the side note... I'm having some trouble timing when I have to sit when I try to canni dance.  Should I just buy a horse and just cast it as I please or learn how to do it (for dungeon crawling purposes).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Learn to Canni dance properly, learning timing with ticks will make you a better player besides just canni. Helps with timing of everything, always nice being able to sit between swings of that mob and get the med bonus every tick.<br />
<br />
Canni Dancing takes a while to get used to it, keep practicing at it. you'll get it down, try counting the seconds to yourself. I'd just say try to keep practicing, you'll get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">The exact timing is relatively hard to nail down, but if you get yourself a UI that has some numeric indicators, you'll be fine.

<br />
Yea I was just trying it and I know when I did it right because I can see the bar move.  I know when I didn't cause it didn't move.  I need to get a Custom UI with %age.  Can I have custom UI for each character without having to change it everytime I log in to each character?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Bazza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">After reading Gagner67 post all the rebuttals and counter arguments I have cone to two conclusions.<br />
<br />
First Gagner67 dose have a mage possibly even a level 65 mage but just like with every thing there are good players and bad players and he is a very bad player that feels gimped becouse he whent out and got improved reclaim witch reduces the efficiency of pure pet caining for mana. <br />
<br />
Second Gagner67 dose not have a mage and probably doesn’t even have a shaman but dose indeed have a level 2 druid.<br />
<br />
<br />
The failure for one person to see the benefit of a DPS class any DPS class keeping a sustained DPS of well over 200 (while debuffing and handing out mod rods) V a DPS of 100 to 140 is just sad. <br />
<br />
And I still hear him calling out “use a well timed rain or two” and this is against mobs you say die in 20 to 30 seconds and are constantly been replaced.<br />
<br />
Already agroed/slowed and debuffed by the EQ fairy no doubt. <br />
<br />
This is when maelstrom of thunder takes 6 seconds to cast and has a 12 second recast timer.and if you have ever used a mage rain you will know that I cant land on a mob below 10% health.  And you’re of course never going to break mezz pull agro off the tank or get every wave resisted are you (I probably should not use sarcasm against the hard of thinking). <br />
<br />
I really really hope you don’t have a Ebayed mage (the only way you could get one with out getting at lest a little idea about the class) because I would hate to have you representing the class I play in the fashion you have been here in the massage boards in the game.<br />
<br />
BTW the only comments I have ever had about my pet caining was on how dose it work and how are you keeping that DPS up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Samyen Elementia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">Well, I'm a level 65 Mage/41 Shaman and I feel gimped because I don't know how to canni dance.  My Mage doesn't even have SM2 (I have SM1) because I stopped training it to do SCM (I have SCF3 and MC3 [messed up when I got MC3]).  Usually, I just pop on my Velious leggings and use Burnout III to buff my pet because I don't see the use of having to summon new armor and all that other crap for it everytime I want to canni (which is why I got SM1).  My DPS parsed on our last raid;  178.  I think that's good enough for me giving I don't have all my AAs trained to where they should be for max efficiency.<br />
