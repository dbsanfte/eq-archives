<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After the millionth time of getting agro after casting a dot on the mob when it is at 60%, I did a bug/petition.  After about 2 hours, I got a response that <br />
<br />
'it is a known issue and we are working on it'<br />
<br />
*** does that mean.  They know it is messed up, has been messed and are working on it.  THEY LIE!  They know it is messed up, but are doing nothing about it.  I can say this with some certainty because if they were working on it, it would be fixed by now.  It isn't a class balancing issue, there is something BROKEN.  Two tics into a dot, I shouldn't be ripping agro off people that have done thousands of HP's.  I do 600hp's worth of damage and drag agro away from a taunting warrior?  <br />
<br />
Has anyone else done this /bug /petition?  I'm sure you have.  What has your response been if you have gotten one?  I'm just tired of the few times I can contribute some DPS in a raid being summoned after the second tic.</div></div><hr />

They can completly remove it (or almost remove it) but not bring it back to acceptable levels.</div></div><hr />

poison counters are currently bugged is my guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They can fix it though.  I don't know if other classes get anything like the berserker skill, Confusing Strike (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4936&amp;source=Test), nor do I know how well it works, but something similar for DoT classes would be a type of fix.  <br />
<br />
The end-of-tick aggro calculation is very strong.  I've had only Bane running on a mob and at the end of each tick the mob would turn on me even though the tank would have its attention for every part of the fight except the end of each tick.  70-80dps is pretty pathetic.  Chain casting VS starting immediately after I slow pretty much never gets me aggro, even though I'm doing more dps than Bane does.  The only difference between the two scenarios, besides dps, is when the damage happens.<br />
<br />
Wizards get Concussion, why can't DoT classes get a concussion DoT?<br />
If shamans could use DoTs to contribute on raids, we would stack much more.  In Time, we usually only have 2 shamans. One would suffice, but we have 2 for MGB in case we wipe.  The only exception is on Quarm, we have 3 shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">personally i hoping theyll redesigen dots completely anyway. Anything longer than 30 secs is too long anyway for short fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Breath of Ultor, Pox of Bertoxxulous and Plague of Daluda are the only high-level DoTs that last longer than 7 ticks.  You still have Bane, Anathema, Blood of Saryrn, Ancient Scourge of Nife, Bane of Nife and even Odium.  Anything less than 30 seconds would require them to make it more damage per tick, and thus gives us more aggro because of flawed aggro calculations.  If you take it to the extreme, you concentrate all the damage into one tick and that's called a DD spell.<br />
<br />
There's not really much in the way of redesigning a &quot;damage over time&quot; spell.  Seriously though, they just need to test out an aggro reducing DoT.  That would probably solve most problems we have with DoTs.   They already have a paradigm for that in the berserker skills, it wouldn't be hard to try out as a spell for us and necros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Another DoT spell to reduce agro is just another spell gem I already don't have room for.  And knowing SOE, it would have an enormous cast time, won't be focusable, and will use about 600 mana.  Making it as useless as most of our DoTs.<br />
<br />
Fix DoT spell agro - it's indefensible in its current state.  I don't buy the argument that they can't fix it.  They just haven't chosen to.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">well, it's probably going to get fixed around the same time they check the 20% resist rate on rains.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they shouldn't work on or realease ONE NEW THING until they fix so many things that are messed up with the current game.  How many bugs do each of us know about and just live with.  In time, it just becomes the norm.  If they can't fix it, they should all be fired.  I'm serious, it can't be that hard.  If they can't fix it right, remove all agro from DoT's.  That sounds extreme, but it shouldn't be us that is punished by their lack of knowledge.  On raids, if we could stack a reasonable amount of DoT's on the mob, we could actually contribute something.  I mean it isn't hard at all to get over 1k per tic worth of dots on the mob and keep them on the entire fight.  That might warrant agro, but getting agro with 300-400 a tic well into the fight isn't right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's never going to happen, nor should it. If aggro is removed from all DoT's all DoT classes can simply DoT every mob and never get hit--EVER. Necros/Shamans/Druids/Shadowknights wouldn't even need to root or snare a DoT'd mob, nor summon a pet because it cause NO AGGRO. C'mon, now, think before you speak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm..usually when I two-boxed my pally and me, I can cast 2 DoTs - bane and Blood and my pally could still hold his aggro.  Didn't realise it's such a big problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've never really had a problem with DoT aggro.  Doing a lot of damage (snicker) should cause aggro.  Poison DoTs have been known to cause a lot of aggro and should be used with caution (or with root).<br />
<br />
The (LDoN) curse DoTs typically induce very little aggro and are nice due to a short duration.  However I've found that I get a bit of DoT aggro now that I have a BA4 aug - seemingly more than I used to get.  It's not a big deal though.<br />
<br />
To reduce DoT aggro:<br />
- Group with tanks that have superior aggro causing methods, like SKs with snare/DoT, paladins with stun, BL's with slow/debuff (I group with a BL who can hold aggro better than most other tanks), or warriors that are skilled.  Sadly warriors have to have great gear and a lot of skill and sometimes luck to hold aggro.<br />
- Use the LDoN curse DoTs - they seem to cause little to no aggro especially if resisted (compared to poison it's very noticeable).<br />
- Try the spell casting subtlety AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">um BoS does 300ish per tick, generates a ton of agro and deals out under 3k total damage.<br />
wizzy strike of solusek with a crit can deal out over 4k in an instant and generate almost 0 agro.<br />
<br />
I say 0 in comparason. if the tank has good agro the wizzy wont have any problems nukeing and nukeing hard, where as I Always have problems dotting due to agro. I have posted it before, on Seru I can get as many as 10 dots stacked, but even with 0 previous damage I will get summoned before I have dealt more than 3 or 4k total damage. thats the issue, Dots generate agro by the ton while nukes hardly generate agro at all even though the damage is compressed all into one burst. <br />
think about it from a game perspective, if you are exping and the puller brings back a wizzy mob and a shaman mob who do you kill first? you kill the wizzy before he empties his mana bar on the puller with 1k+ nukes, and when it comes to wizzy mobs its all out dps, you want his ass dead fast due to the incredible damage hes cranking out. the shaman mob will just piss you off when it pells.<br />
<br />
for some reason the mobs are programed in reverse, they ignore the massive nukes and go after the guy who cant kill them in under 5 min.<br />
<br />
no I am not calling for a nerf on nuke agro, just fix dot agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The way dots and nukes are set up now is complete and utter bs.  This whole mentality of, &quot;oh it's broken, they'll never fix it&quot; needs to end.  If we want changes, we raise hell until somebody wakes up at Sony and does something.<br />
<br />
The idea that a poison dot, which deals ~2k damage, will out agro a ~6k damage nuke is absolutely absurd.  If anything, the roles should be reversed.  Since our damage is spaced out over time, we should have the insanely low agro, while wizards who deal an insane amount of damage at once, get the high agro.<br />
<br />
Problem with our dots:<br />
-disproportionate agro compared to nukes.<br />
-mobs don't last long enough to take full duration of damage.<br />
-crit aa for dots is not up to scale with fury of magic.<br />
-shaman dps is both nukes and dots, and as such, we are forced to spend aa on both nuke and dot crits, further dividing our power.<br />
-similarly, our focus effects are divided into dmg and extension, again dividing the power of our dots.<br />
-not as stackable on raids as nukes.<br />
-not affected by scs, and even if it was, scs still costs more for priests than pure casters, again castrating those of us who can't farm 8 aa per night.<br />
<br />
Everytime I log on, I report this as a bug.  It's complete crap.  Bane went a ways to solving this, but it doesn't even begin to address most of the problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bane definitely has aggro too, just less than poison.  A paladin can hold aggro, but will need to restun several times during the fight when a shaman is stacking 2 dots.  Just 2 dots... that's less damage than 2 druid nukes.   A warrior can barely keep aggro vs bane, 2 dots and the mob is glued onto you.<br />
<br />
I do highly agree this is something that ought to be adjusted.</div></div><hr />
