<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RangerDave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks.<br />
<br />
I've spent most of my career (now a lvl 39 Ranger) soloing in outdoor zones, but I recently joined a guild and will be going on my first dungeon raid on Friday. We'll be heading to Lower Guk - Dead Side, and I'd like to be sure I know as much as possible about what a Ranger's indoor group role is. I've read through a number of posts on the subject (the Don't Be A Bad Ranger thread was great), and I've summarized what I know below. If anyone cares to read it over and let me know what else I should keep in mind, I would appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Ok, so here goes. Important indoor group tactics for Rangers:<br />
<br />
1) Buffs. Prior to combat, I should hand out all the buffs I can, unless better buffs are available in-group. Damage Shields for myself and MA are most important. However, I should not use Riftwinds if we have an Enchanter in the group because it will overwrite the Augmentation buffs.<br />
<br />
2) Mob control. If we get adds, I should peel them off and park them with root. If any mobs go after the casters/healers, it's my job to grab aggro and, again, park them out of the way.<br />
<br />
3) Snaring. I should snare everything, even if we have a Druid in the group, so he doesn't accidentally grab aggro. I shouldn't snare until the Mob is at half health though, so that I don't grab aggro away from the MA.<br />
<br />
4) Melee. Once the Mobs are engaged with the MA, I should step in and hammer on them, from the side or rear if possible, to maximize damage. If I start drawing aggro, I should back off for a second so I don't become a mana-sink.<br />
<br />
5) Offensive Spells. As I mentioned, I should use snare and root pretty religiously, as well as the occasional DD spell for damage purposes, but I should not use any DoTs if we have an Enchanter, because it will break Mezz.<br />
<br />
Ok, so that's about it. As far as specific questions go, I'm wondering if I should let the Druid do the parking, since he has Ensnaring Roots and I only have plain old Grasping Roots. I also want to know if there are other spell-stacking issues I should be aware of. Other than that, I would appreciate any comments or advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance everyone!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>RangerDave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh, btw, I didn't include Pulling on the list of duties, because I figured that tracking and archery are of limited use indoors, so it's better to let the MA do the pulling and thus grab aggro right from the start. In outdoor zones, obviously, Pulling would be one of our major duties. Everyone agree with this analysis?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds good to me, course I'm level 39 too, and have never been on anything resembling a raid :D<br />
<br />
At 39, we have two sweet DD's (Careless lightning and flaming(?) arrow) that can be used in tandem.  So in groups I often don't bother with the dot, regardless of whether or not there is an enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Two things about rooting.  If there's an enc handy, rooting shouldn't be really necessary.  Just make sure that you snare before the MA breaks mez, and that the MA knows to taunt a bit before breaking mez.  Also, because of the damage component of the druidic roots (which we, as rangers, get) they will break mez; the roots used by the other classes (wiz, enc, cle, pal) do not break mez.<br />
<br />
There is a root that has no damage component, and thus is mez friendly, but its a very high level spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maian62</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds mostly ok to me.<br />
If there is a Druid - the only buffs you will probably be able to offer are the ones they don't get like Riftwinds and Feet Like  Cat, and your self-only buffs for yourself of course.<br />
<br />
If you have no druid or mage - your most powerful buff is probably your short duration targetable damage shield - always keep it on the MT. Do yourself as well so you know when to refresh.<br />
<br />
Check with the chanter if  you have one - about whether they are using Augmentation or Haste.  Riftwinds will stack with Haste.<br />
<br />
You wont be able to nuke much unless you have at least Clarity running, otherwise save your mana for snaring and peeling.<br />
<br />
You'd probably let the chanter handle the adds - unless they have major resist issues in which case you or the druid may have to root park them.  Your root spell should be fine, and you can take hits better than the druid.<br />
<br />
If you have no mezzer - then you should be trying to handle the adds or split a bad pull. In those situations teamwork with the tank/puller really helps - if they can stop a little short of the camp while you root the adds, stepping back after each root.  Have a social for root and snare that tells the group what you are doing.  Try to root the non-casters, not much help rooting a wizard.<br />
<br />
Its nice to snare any rooted or mezzed mobs if you can.<br />
DoT's dont just break mez, they make the mob unmezzable, which is why chanters really hate them.  Your root will break mezz but the mob CAN be remezzed afterwards, which is not so bad (except for wizard type mobs who can still stand back and nuke you).<br />
<br />
Tracking has its uses indoors - and sneak pulling with bow can be useful if you have no FD puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">#1 Apart from all you have said, ALWAYS do what your Raid Leader tells you too.<br />
#2 Apart from all you have said, ALWAYS do what your Group Leader tells you too. he should give you specific roles, if he doesnt tell him your intentions and ensure he is ok with that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and tracking is very useful indoors, you cant tell up from down but you can figure it out in most places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gyre of FV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some good stuff here.<br />
<br />
Also, always try to maintain situational awareness.  Don't just stare at the critter's arse as you swing.  Hit your 'Change Point of View' hotkey a lot.  Watch for adds, critters on the cleric, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>PhyrexDarkmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm...let's see.<br />
<br />
1.  Buffing.  Depending on what classes are there you won't need to give out many buffs since a bunch of other classes have better buffs than yours.  Str, DS and such are just a few.  And since at lower levels buffs have shorter durations and are a real pain to keep casting, focus mainly on the MA, SA and any chanters or clerics that need them.<br />
<br />
2. Mob Control.  This should be left to the chanters and only really done by rangers when it gets out of control.  Since our root has damage and breaks mez you can get in trouble here especially now that you can tell who breaks mezz.  Though snaring a mob and getting agro without attacking while a chanter is trying to mez is very helpful.<br />
<br />
3. Snare.  Every ranger and druid should be snaring.  A resist or someone just forgetting can cause a wipe.  Better safe than sorry.  Just have all snarers make a hot key announcing when mobs are snared so others can stop casting.<br />
<br />
4. Melee.  First of all make sure you use assist and that you have autoattack turned off when assisting.  Then wait till the MA calls everyone to engage after they have agro and reassist making sure the MA didn't switch targets since you first assisted.  If you get agro and don't have jolt yet, turn attack off, don't back out.  Backing out could start the mob ping ponging which is bad.<br />
<br />
5. Offensive spells.  You shouldn't be rooting during fights unless its necessary, otherwise they will not turn and run when low health.  DoTs are fine once you have begun fighting the mob, but usually DoTs cast too slow and aren't worth the missed melee.  Stick to fast casting DDs if you have clarity to keep you from going oom and missing some snares.<br />
<br />
Other than that as Tat said, listen to your Raid Leader all the time.  If they call Camp you better well get out.  Take your time and you will learn what you need, sometimes by making mistakes but just be patience it will come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>nekoken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm parroting what other people have already said but it can't be stressed enough in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Always snare.  I've seen too many raids get wiped due to a bad ranger or druid not snaring or only having one snarer who happened to get eaten earlier in the fight.<br />
<br />
Always /assist MT and wait until they've broken mez before you engage.  It seems like there's always a hybrid or melee damage dealer who screws this up on a regular basis on every raid.<br />
<br />
Stay in the back arc of the mob to avoid ripostes, frontal AEs and other nasties.  Don't get in the rogues' way though.  I like to leave about a 60 degree arc straight behind the mob for the rogues and stay between that and the mob's side.<br />
<br />
Be prepared to emergency tank for a few seconds if the s*** hits the fan and a wipe is going to happen.  Being able to camp out a cleric or have them succor will often mean the difference between an easy second attempt or a wasted evening doing CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Talan Eaglestrike DoD</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you have to go afk.. target the person who is elast likley to wander off (most times the cleric) and do an /autofollow.<br />
<br />
Don't take anything said already to literal.. there will be times when you have to grab ago.. (healer getting beat on and cant heal.. Chanter or Caster overnuked and tank cant get it back on himself). <br />
<br />
Always always always have fun. DOn't take loot too seriously and be glad even for the other guy if you don't get any phawt lewtz.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Philby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Turn /assist off (I think that is the command). This way if a mob is killed, you can quickly target the mezzed mobs to snare them without turning autoattack off.  You will then have to hit autoattack to attack a mob. <br />
<br />
If the enchanter has some mobs to mez, you can turn autoattack off and then snare the mezzed mobs. This is especially useful if your chanter uses AE (Area Effect) mez - which only lasts 20 seconds or so. It is useful as well because mobs can be Sowed. Tangling Weeds also works if you forget to snare or get a resist - it casts fast.<br />
<br />
If your chanter is lower than you, you can snare, root and have him tash/mez thereafter. But it is generally a better idea for others (shaman, cleric, necromancer, paladin) to root.<br />
<br />
Paladins can pull if they want as well. They have invis v undead plus they can stun the casters.  Cancel magic is nice to pull with as mobs are often buffed/sowed and spell is a low agro one to cast. <br />
<br />
Don't kill the live frogs, this way if you have to run to zone you won't bring live ones as well or if you want to go afk in Upper Guk, you won't get killed.<br />
<br />
Have a cleric bind at zone-in.<br />
<br />
Enjoy, Lower Guk is one of the best designed dungeons in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sabrar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I dunno.  I've never been happy in a support roll situation, unless it's in tier 2 of PoP or on a big raid.<br />
<br />
For me, in indoor zones, I pull and tank and do crowd control.  Most of my buffs are bettered by other classes (excluding ranger only buffs of course), and even with average equipment, my durability was never in question.  The great thing about tanking is that with snares and smart use of roots, you never lose aggro.<br />
<br />
I think the best advice is to do what you feel helps the group you are in the most, and makes you enjoy the game the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Re: snaring mezzed mobs.  It's also a good idea since it has the chance to put you higher on the hate list than the chanter... so when mezz breaks it wont cut through the paper-thin chanter.  I usually use Tangling weeds.<br />
<br />
Also, more than once (in SolB as it turns out) snare was resisted without me noticing due to all the battle spam.  The mob runs but before a re-cast can complete it turns a corner out of range.  This of course led to it getting its friends, pulling a train, causing a party wipe or near-wipe.  It was at that point that I discovered the wonder of Tangling Weeds (and shortly after discovered the glade).  Virtually insta-cast, it should nab any runner that went unsnared preventing a train wreck.  Also, it should be your primary mob-peeling-protect-the-poor-caster spell due to it's rapid cast.  With that spell, I can get chain-complete-healed in PoI and the mob never touches the cleric, or the slower.<br />
<br />
There is a point where Druids get ensnare while we remain stuck with snare until 51 or so.  At that point there are times when the druid should do the snaring with the better snare.  However they do not get Tangling Weeds so that should be memm'd at all times.</div></div><hr />
