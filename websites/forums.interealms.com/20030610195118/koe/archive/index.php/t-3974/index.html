As rhumf pointed out it looks like a mino axe ( I guess, never seen one heh) looks good as an off hander, small axe graphic with some rusty detail to it.  Thanks again guys, oh and gratz Humf on giantsbane spell :) <br />
<br />
*EDIT* Everyone give Ghuurbuk some loving for me, at the Kael raid a Defiance dropped, he won the loot and then handed me down the Lamentation that Defiance replaced.  I know he's not in KoE so this prolly won't reach him, but that was extremely generous of him since I had never met him and that blade is quite expensive. :)  If any one remembers what guild he was in please PM me, wanna post a thanks to him on his guild board.</div></div><hr />
