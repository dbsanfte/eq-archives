<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A while ago I encountered a link to an article in which someone who liked math ripped apart the Everquest combat engine, and came up with the formulas used to calculate maximum, and &quot;sweet number&quot; damage for shamans and warriors, thus concluding that as melee damage goes (not the number of misses though) both of the classes function with the same formula.<br />
<br />
The article also had a bunch of nifty diagrams, statistical stuff, and observation about the effect of strength buffs and pure ATK buffs on the damage output.<br />
<br />
I've lost the link to this article, if anyone knows what the heck I'm talking about and has the link to (or a copy of) that article, I would be most appreciative if you'd post it here :)</div></div><hr />
