<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Theres two copies of this in our Guild Vault at the moment.<br />
<br />
Only being 53 I'm wary of grabbing one, thus denying other people of their use. Even though I'm one of only three shamans in our guild over 50.<br />
<br />
How rare is this spell? Is it worth me grabbing one anyways?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Anyone know how much Canni 4 costs in the bazaar?  I was SHOCKED last night on Saryrn when i looked and found 3 copies for 10-13k.  Is this spell really supposed to be that much? Or are these sellers just on crack?<br />
<br />
I would say if canni 4 costs anywhere near what it seems to run on my server - get a guild copy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My personal view on it:<br />
<br />
Leave it in the Guild Vault until you get 58. If you're first or second to 58 and claim the spell fairly, all well and good, but it would be unfair on one of them if they both beat you to 58, and you were still 55 but had a copy from the Guild Vault? That's not how Guild Vaults are supposed to work.<br />
<br />
How would you feel if both of the other shamans claimed a copy each just before you, but weren't ready to use it yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's not vendor trash like Cannibalize III, but it's not rare either. I see prices between 100 and 3000 pp. Check bazaar often, and pay the lowest price you come across. No, you don't need to grab it out of your guild bank that early.<br />
<br />
If you check Bazaar often, you'd learn which spells are rare and which aren't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On Karana you'll see several copies of canni4 selling anywhere from 150pp to 3k+. Have patience, it's not that rare :)</div></div><hr />
