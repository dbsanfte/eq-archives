Mammoths in Everfrost probably still give some experience at 30 and drop tusks for 10 plat a piece if you can't get a group in Rathe Mountains <br />
<br />
Oh! yeah!.<br />
<br />
I did those from 28-32 with my Shaman husband, while watching track for a quest NPC to pop for him. Between track and panic animal these are cake! The tusks sell for 9-10 plat each. You can sell to Starn Bearjumper on the platform out there if you sneak up behind him, so you don't have to worry about weight. Just sell every 2-3 tusks and you won't be encumbered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rainkng</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everfrost is a must at your level.<br />
<br />
Not only will you rake in the plats from the tusks (make sure to pack your CHA gear    ;) ) but you'll still be making xp at a very respectable rate as downtime is minimal with the mammoths (that's as long as you can find one's that aren't camped).<br />
<br />
After Everfrost, head to Sol A.  You'll need to be grouped but it is well worth the effort.  I went to Iceclad after Everfrost (around lvl 32 or 33) and I wish I would've went to this dungeon instead.  Iceclad was great xp and soloing there was simple but nothing compared to being in Sol a (which I still go back and farm when waiting for a group in Sol B.  Lol )<br />
<br />
Not only is Sol A great xp but the loot there is awesome and you can probably get the Heart of Fire for you Ivy Etched Sleeves if you haven't already.<br />
<br />
That's my 2cp.  Hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tetsuo</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At what level do you think a ranger could solo HG's(I'm 47), and what would be the best approach?  Root/Swarm/Arrows?  I don't think I could straight up melee one to death.  Or is there something better?<br />
<br />
I've got about 800ac approx. the same atk, and 1700 hps.<br />
<br />
I can totally sympathize with being broke.. haven't ever found a good system to make decent cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rainkng</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure all HGs (and SGs for that matter) are the same but...<br />
<br />
I've been soloing SGs for the last couple of levels and just recently started soloing the HGs in NK.  Like I said, I'm not sure if all Giants in the &quot;Old World&quot; have the same hitpoints and do the same damage so I can't comment on the Rathe Mt HGs.<br />
<br />
As far as my technique?  I usually start by casting root, snare then DoT (stinging swarm).  I then start plinking arrows into them like there's no tomorrow all the while keeping my distance and the above spells casted.<br />
<br />
Once the giant is down to about half life (or I run out of arrows -whichever comes first    ;) ) I start in with melee.<br />
<br />
If my health gets down to about half I will re-root, back off, and heal myself (this usually finishes off my mana though).<br />
<br />
Now, keep in mind that this is not a fast thing to accomplish.  It usally takes about 10+ minutes to take the giant down and then another 15 or so to regain health and mana.<br />
<br />
The only reason I even started to bother with soloing giants was to get my Sands of Ro off an SG.  Since then, I only do it to pass the time in between dungeon crawls, quests and/or guild functions.<br />
<br />
As far as plats go - SGs don't drop all that much but the HGs in NK usually drop between 20 and 45pp each time.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.     :)<br />
<br />
btw I'm level 45 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trelad</div><div class="date">03-26-2002, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HG's are the same in all the zones just about.  Same with SG's and the SG's are slightly harder than HG's.  With a tolan bracer they are so easy.  At 49 with my centi LS's i can brign 1 down to about 1/3-1/2 health ez and then arrowkite the rest.  Also once you get your epic(which im 1 piece away from yay) it will become dramatically easier.  13/21 with 40% haste worn is awesome, actually to good for our own good, hehe.  You gain agro in a second with those.  Shouldn't be too hard. <br />
<br />
Also for the money making thing.  Go to netherbian lair.  The things there are really low lvl and drop 3-4pp on average per kill and i can kill like 3 in a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pliskin</div><div class="date">03-30-2002, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 30 you'll probbly need a partner but I'm find Stonbrunt Mountains (SBM) a Ranger's paradise and making excellent money there (better than when I group for HG's). This is at 38-40 though, so like I said. You'll need a partner or to level a bit first.<br />
<br />
It's a Ranger's paradise because it's a large outdoor zone and everything is fearable. It's also very quiet so no one around to interfere with your kiting. Tracking is a must especially if you want to kill panda, and you want to kill pandas<br />
<br />
To make money... kill Pandas. The more senior the better. Many of them drop gems or rings that sell from 50-80pp to merchants. In between you can collect components for the Wak of Frozen Sky quest (which you can sell for several hundred plat or keep as it's a rather nice weapon).  You can also keep an eye out <br />
<br />
I made about 1K here over the course of about 8 hours total. I may have been a little lucky though.<br />
<br />
There are downsides. It's a long way from a bindspot and from civilisation in general. It's  long way to zone. Until you get lev at 40 you'll get a lot of falling damage. And the adds.....<br />
<br />
This is the worst place I've ever been for adds and I end up having to abandon every second fight. As long as I have SoW up I'm ok though, but it can be frustrating having to run and camp over and over again.<br />
<br />
As well as the documented Wak and Swiftclaw Sash quests there are a lot of other interesting drops in the zone that don't seem to be part of any documented quests yet. Becuase of it's remoteness it is an underutelised zone and I really think there may be some other undiscovered quests there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tathagata</div><div class="date">03-31-2002, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">mammoths are easy in everfrost. You will get exp until about 35 and they give great loot, if you dont make about 100pp every hour or so you are not trying.<br />
Get yourself a large or deluxe sewing kit (1 - 2pp from vendor at halas ramp) and fill it with tusks, with str on you should be able to hold 10 tusks and be about 30 over your weight limit and still ok. at that stage i am usually about 40 health and mana and will then run off to sell. <br />
Try to get some cha gear, but the vendor woman in the halas magic shop sells to me with cha of about 85 for 9.6pp per tusk.<br />
<br />
Even when its busy i can walk away from an evening not playing hard with 200pp and I dont play for long each night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raeber</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have to recommend the Froglok Beserker cycle in the Swamp of No Hope.  At 30 you can get exp and some great plat/jewels.  You may need invis to move around, but the mobs are fairly easy.  The other night I looted a Blue Diamond, a Ruby, and about 250pp(including vendor trash).  This is a very fast way to make some plat.  I am always the only person in the zone as well, and since the starting points for the mobs are randomish, only tracking classes can do this effectively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asgeir</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have hunted Mammoths and absoluely love Everfrost - I climbed from 24 to 30 there with the help of my wooly friends and made a lot of money in the meantime - but I believe that I have found the real Central Bank in Luclin these days in Netharbian, which is generally easy to solo in the 30-35 range.  The problem with the Woolies is frequency and competition - in Netharbian, you are pulling 2-3 pp right off the greens and 5-6 pp right off the blues (forget going to market) and there is almost an endless supply of mobs so you can keep a very rapid pace going - and score a substantial stash over the course of an evening.  Sometimes I just divert myself there for an hour and without working hard move on a hundred pp or so richer.  The other advantage is that it is right next to Dawnshroud and Marus - two excellent zones for xp at the 30-35 range (and Dawnshroud can keep you going to 60).<br />
<br />
Just my two pence !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asgeir</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also agree with Pliskin above that Stonebrunt is great for the 25-25 level Ranger.  I made a LOT of money there without realizing it .  And I DID complete the swiftclaw sash quest and proudly wear that today - it may only give me 15% haste but it took a month of trial and failure to finally win that one (once you have the goods collected, you get either the sash or a booby prize in a somewhat random allocation - took me a couple of tries but some people were well over a dozen before they got it).  Nothing there sees through invis (I don't think) and just staying down by the zone boundary with the orcs can be pretty profitable until into your 30s.  Pandas are the big draw though, although I only ever killed babies at 30 or less solo.  You are also right next to Warrens, which is a fun diversion if you get tired of Stonebrunt.</div></div><hr />
