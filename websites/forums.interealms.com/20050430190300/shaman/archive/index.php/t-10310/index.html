<br />
Got Run/Regen 3<br />

Got Spirit Call<br />
Got ND 1<br />
Git Healing Gift 1<br />
<br />
What now?<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure?  Virulent Paralysis?  I'm not a soloing shaman, mostly grouping.  Any suggestions?  Buff Enhancements?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">reinforcement and mastery are both good, finish up ND, finish up healing gift if you heal lots, quickbuff, healing adept, combat agility.<br />
<br />
they're all great, just pick something that looks good and go with it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Finish ND.  After that, I would go for SCRM or SCM3.  Healing AA's might be good but I don't have any yet so i can't testify to their usefulness.<br />
<br />
Do they effect kragg's?  I forgot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">have torpor? i am working on the QB line followed by SCR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tossyndar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ND complete.. Then SCF !! shammies who score Crits on DD spells are good for the humor value..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">HA/AHA affect Kraggs, so they are worthwhile imho.<br />
<br />
VP really is a soloing tool, not the best of group aa's to go for, radiant cure only really gets useful at level 2 imho, what to go for next depends on what you do the most really.  If you heal lots, go for scm/ha/aha, if your mostly buffing, scm/qb, if your more into dotting and blasting, again scm/nd/ca are probably the best choice.<br />
<br />
If you have torpor or haste lots, scr3/scrm would be a wise choice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SCR3 is nice. I am 3 points from SCRM... found out that SCRM is 8 points not 5, I was a bit upset at 2 am on Sunday after grinding all weekend to get the 5 points for it...<br />
<br />
But I can buff an alt and play him in another window during a raid. Regen lasts 30 minutes, haste 25, focus and sta last a good long time. Useful :)<br />
<br />
Looking forward to scrm.<br />
<br />
Then I'll get either QB1 or Pet hold to get my elder title, then double back and get the ND series with maybe 1 point in SF for sheer humor value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I love qb2, cuts torpor down to 4.5, and good clips off haste and other buffs too.  SCRM would probably also be good in that case, casting them less often is also handy.<br />
<br />
Other things to think of:  ca3, avoid hits more often.  scm3, around 10% less mana per cast.  and scf, because seeing a crappy shaman nuke crit is always funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>foolbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">After sinking some points into rabid bear and spell/caster fury 3 how much are you hitting for now?  I was just curious as to what kind of damage bonuses you were getting while in bear form and crits on spells/procs.  If any1 has done this could you please post what self-buff spells you used, what weapon, and what your str,dex, and attk was.<br />
<br />
Sorry to be asking this, it would appear that no one has done it yet.  Well at least done it and posted it on the net.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Next in line for me:<br />
<br />
Scr3<br />
Scrm<br />
qb2<br />
nd1-3<br />
<br />
as main ones, may cram rc1 in before starting scrm/qb2.<br />
<br />
Magelo is up to date, except I have a few more points banked for scr3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep, quickbuff utterly rocks, I was content with qb2 for ages, but the spell refresh delay on loading buffs that was added recently finally pushed me to get qb3, worth every point imho =)</div></div><hr />

Rabid bear does not grant any crits/procs on spells.  It raises atk and enables a shaman to duel wield for 5 minutes and refreshes every 2 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe it's double attack, not dual wield.  That would require you to find a secondary slot usable weapon every time you went into rabid bear mode.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">get scm3 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>foolbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">ok i'll be more desciptive and to the point.<br />
<br />
The BL's boards are lit up with everyone talking about how Spell Casting Fury 3 allows your procs to crit.  With that being said let's now look at the stats on Rabid Bear.....<br />
<br />
This ability allows the Shaman to transform into a Bear increasing all of their melee skills.<br />
It has the following bonuses: <br />
<br />
Increase ATK by 200 <br />
Increase Attack Speed by 99% <br />
Increase Strength by 100 <br />
Increase Dexterity by 100 <br />
Increase Cold Resist by 50 <br />
Add Disease Proc - 35 Direct Damage, 25 damage per tick for 10 ticks. <br />
<br />
So if you use this and any other buffs that stick with it your melee stats should exceed well over 255 (dex, str, agi, and sta...assuming your an ogre and spent some aa pts in Planar Power).  Hell you could even see if another haste would stack on you :D<br />
<br />
Your attack rating should be well over 1300 by then, str 255+causing a lil' extra damage, dex 255+ which will allow you to proc on every other hit, and you have a 99% haste to go along with it.  Now add on top of that SF3 and you have a chance with critting on all your procs.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to know if this has been tested, or will I have to find out for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Does rabid bear and avatar stack ?<br />
200 atk is not that much (ferine = 140)... <br />
With ranger buff + ferine I already got 1388 atk (for what it worth).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">255 dex doesnt make you proc on every other hit at all, its a noticable increase, but not that huge (I hit 280 dex with RB, not got planar power)<br />
<br />
With a primal brawl stick my max hit is 189, I find I do far more damage during rabid bear swinging the 2hb than my reif.  How well I hit pretty much depends against what I'm fighting, on low ac stuff and greenies I can get some stunning strings of 189 hits (I think I've got a screenshot of getting 7 or 8 189 hits in a row against a frog in sebilis), if the mob has any real ac (IE ssra) I just miss loads with the occasional hit in there.<br />
<br />
Of the top of my head I can hit 1400ish atk with Rabid bear and ranger buffs =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Oh and I'll add, rabid bear is pretty much a fun toy and not much else, against raid level mobs its near useless due to ac and possible ripostes, pop limits its use due to horse med ticks being more useful, the only time I tend to use it now is either for giggles or just for when I need to plow a bunch of greenies down quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>foolbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">do you mind if I email you or if you email me, have a few questions for ya.  I realize that this aa is never going to be used in raid type settings.  Just wanted to find out if it would help me soloing or a two person group help with their aaxp grind.  Just using the old spells rage and HoS allows me to keep most mobs stunned (using a 2hb) while we melee in fg.  My str is 255 and dex is 233 with those two spells.<br />
<br />
I'll leave my spam mail account on here if you'd like to email me; if you do I'll email ya my real one.<br />

just don't want to spam this thread with needless talk :)<br />
<br />
thanks for offering some 411 on the matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Got Run/Regen 3 <br />
Got MC 3 <br />
Got Canni V <br />
Got MGB <br />
Got Spirit Call <br />
Got ND 1 <br />
Git Healing Gift 1 <br />
<br />
I would get, in this order:<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure 1  (this so owns, gets rid of a ton of debuffs and AE's, well worth 2 points)<br />
ND 2, ND 3<br />
SCM 3<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
QB seems a waste to me early on,  with Blessing of Reverence and any Beneficial spell haste item you are nearly at 50% reduction anyway.  Sure, get it later, but other AA's give you much more for the points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When did disease spells or procs start getting affected by scf?  Or is this a rabid bear only type of thing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just wanted to find out if it would help me soloing or a two person group help with their aaxp grind.<br />
<br />
Not an any particular order:<br />
<br />
* SCR/SCRM - longer lasting buffs, especially short duration buffs like regrowth and haste are wonderful while exping.  Torpor that heals for 1800 instead of 1200 is also a huge power gain.<br />
<br />
* virulent paralysis - need to get that mob off you and lose aggro/get the situation back under control?<br />
<br />
* spirit call - a shaman friend compared this to a mana free 3K nuke every 12 minutes<br />
<br />
* SCM - huge mana savings, more mana = good!<br />
<br />
* RC 1 - super cheap, but so handy in a lot of different situations<br />
<br />
* ND - more hitpoints are always good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">i have nd 1 and was going ot get nd 2 but decided to go with combat agility 1 and combat stability 1.  with pop mobs hitting for 500+ getting missed once or mitigating 500 hp down to 300 hp is better than 100 hp's(high guess)  with nd 2 imho.<br />
plus its nice to get somewhat of a defensive skill since the only defense upgrade i got since lvl 40 was ac. :)<br />
<br />
also, virulent para is awesome in grps or solo, get 2-3 resisted slows and use it to get mob off you unless you have an awesome taunter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">According to its description, combat stability doesn't help mitigation at the level you're thinking of.</div></div><hr />
