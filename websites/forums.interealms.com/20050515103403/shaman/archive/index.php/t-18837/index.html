<br />
As many of you know, we are currently conducting an internal Alpha test for World of Warcraft. Our goal for this Alpha test is to provide the best possible experience for players when the Beta launches in early 2004. <br />
<br />
In order to accelerate the testing process, we recently allowed a small group of external testers to play the game. During this process, a collection of files was leaked to the Internet. While these files contain alpha content from the game, they are not fully playable and therefore do not convey the experience that World of Warcraft will provide when it is released. <br />
<br />
We are currently investigating this matter and will take serious action against those involved. <br />
<br />
As always, we appreciate the interest and enthusiasm that players around the world have for World of Warcraft, and we look forward to delivering a massively multiplayer game unlike any you have ever experienced. Until then, we ask that you refrain from sharing any content that doesn't come directly from Blizzard Entertainment. <br />
<br />
Lastly, we would like to announce that sign-ups for the World of Warcraft Beta test will begin at the end of this month. Stay tuned to www.blizzard.com for further details.</div></div><hr />

Still no telling when the actual beta will begin. Could be months knowing Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Even so...it's still progress, so I don't want to sound too jaded. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Blizzard takes their sweet time with everything... they remind me of those old &quot;We will serve no wine before its time&quot; commercials.  Still, it's nice to not hear another &quot;beta delayed&quot; announcement. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I'd imagine that WoW beta sign-ups will be massive...and if they're at all serious about getting quality beta testers it could take them a while to process the thousands of applications they'll be getting.  Not quite the same as a different company that's following a more pay for beta path!  :P</div></div><hr />
