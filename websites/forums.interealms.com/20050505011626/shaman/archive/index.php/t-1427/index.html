<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rhysen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was grouped with a shaman in SK last night and besides buffing me with some very nice Shaman buffs he also made me big (me wood elf rogue)--I think he made me Ogre sized. And I just wondering just how long it lasts? He made me such at 8pm and when I logged at 2am. I was still the same size. I was very surprised at that. When will this spell wear off.<br />
<br />
As much I like the novelty of being big (has its advantages) I would prefer my little wood elf to be his normal size again. Anyone know the time frame of this spell? Also is it the same deal with the spell that makes one smaller?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We have 2 size altering spells, Grow and Shrink. Duration is until you zone or log.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Works the same as a shirk spell. It will last until you zone log or die. It can also be reversed by the shaman. All he has to do is cast shrink on you while you are big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rhysen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow that was quick :D Thank you. And well that means my size was normal when I zoned into NK on my way to Qeynos. Lol. I must have been so tired I didn't notice. I could have sworn I was higher than those human guards.<br />
<br />
That teaches me that it may not be wise playing 'dead on my feet'.<br />
