<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drakony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm on the step after Test of Wisdom and before Test of Might. I turned the gem into the Spirit in EJ. I was about half-way thru the script of conversation when I got jumped by 3 mobs and eventually had to gate out. My question is: Can I just go kill the Dire in Mistmoor and continue on, or do I need to get another gem from the Wandering Spirit in WK and do the turn in again and actually finish the conversation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First of all, conversation does not have to occur immediately following a turn-in. You can converse days or years after the turn-in, as long as you know what to say.<br />
<br />
Secondly, conversion is usually just background info and therefore completely optional. Exceptions are when it's necessary as a trigger to receive an item or start a script. Since you don't need any item from the Sentinel before handing in Black Dire's pelt, no conversation is necessary here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had difficulty getting that spirit (yes, it was the correct one, no, I wasn't invis) to respond to me.  I'd turned in Dire's pelt, got the boots, but got jumped before I could finish.  Interestingly, the Spirit ended up in the melee somehow, also.  Tiger or some such killed him if I recall rightly.<br />
<br />
After collecting my body, his respawn wouldn't talk to me, no matter how I tried standing next to him, targeted, non targeted, etc.<br />
<br />
But no, you should be able to just do Dire and turn it in.  Make sure you have enough company to let you finish the conversation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depends what you say Shandy. If you just Hail him, he won't say a word.</div></div><hr />
