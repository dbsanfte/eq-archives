<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There have been Dev names on items since Vulak. What im getting at here is that Rytan has a bad reputation amongst shamans right now.<br />
<br />
My all time favorite dev named item is the Nerf Bat (tm) ie Abashi's Rod of Disempowerment. :D<br />
<br />
Stench of the Dump sounds cool btw :)</div></div><hr />

Some of my favorite &quot;Abashi's&quot; of all time:<br />
<br />
&quot;Let's not view this as those getting there late as being unfortunate, but as those getting there early being fortunate.&quot;<br />

(In response to the now standard nerfing of items / drops, the above was in reference to Kunark)<br />

I always got a chuckle out of this one myself.  It's such a cop-out answer, it's pathetic.<br />
<br />
BTW, didn't someone have that quote in their sig at one point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess, but don't be so sure that becoming a Customer Service manager was the summit of Abashi's &quot;Peter Principle&quot;. <br />
<br />
He left that job to become a developer for SOE.  <br />
