<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First of all, thank you, Henora, for allowing me and others with stories to tell this opportunity.<br />
<br />
Basically, my only rules are these:<br />
<br />
1: As a creative writer, censorship is a touchy subject for me (as it may be for you), but please respect the language filters set in place by Sunmoon (as this is his house).  On a related note, please also try to keep the subject of your stories appropriate for a public forum (i.e. keep your work &quot;work safe&quot;).<br />
<br />
2: Please respect the authenticity of others' work.  In other words, do not plagiarize!  If caught, the theft of intellectual property can result in major legal issues. <br />
<br />
That's really all I can think of at the moment, so enjoy your stay here! <br />
<br />
Also, if you have some original work of shaman or EQ-related fiction, please share your work with the rest of us -- don't be shy! :)</div></div><hr />
