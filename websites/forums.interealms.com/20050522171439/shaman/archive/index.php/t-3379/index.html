<br />
The first poster took a good chunk of his life to accumulate all this information. Now, all of you, print it out and put it to good use. One example would be to wipe your ass with it... I don't dislike many druids, but the one that posted saying druids needed both these abilities was just not with it at the time. I didn't have time to read all the replies, so it may be a joke, but with druids...who knows? /boggle <br />
<br />
Some of the replies were actually constructive though :).<br />
<br />
One person said: &quot;Instead of whining about druids getting CH and manaburn, you could be leveling a cleric or wizard. A druids a druid, giving them some of the more powerful abilities of other classes is not the way to make them more needed. If you spend all your time wishing your druid had manaburn or CH, then you really dont want to be a druid, so please reconsider your playing class. I hope this was a joke, because if it isn't, I can hear the people in charge of class balancing laughing at you right now&quot;<br />
<br />
I liked that post, but not these:<br />
<br />
&quot;Since Luclin I have honestly thought druids should get a healing spells that heals 2500 hp for 375 mana and a 9 second cast time.&quot; <br />
<br />
Yes yes, let's give them a torpor that heals almost twice as much, for only 125 more mana than torpor costs. AND, lets remove the bad effects that come with torpor! I realize they can't cannibalize, but still, clerics were supposed to be the UNDISPUTED best healers in the game. I feel that the closest thing to CH is torpor, and torpor is a heal with a DoT effect, a snare, and an attack speed debuffer. Only very good guilds can get melees over 4k HP, from what I have experienced. The heal that that druid requested is slightly overpowered IMO. I could go for maybe a 1k heal if it'll shut them up once and for all :)<br />
<br />
These were my opinions, now post yours :). Flame me, agree with me, whatever you wish, I just want to know what you all think about this.<br />
<br />
--Edit: Had to fix the link--</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Give them whatever spell they want, but make it a quest spell.  To get their spell, they must find 4 individual scrolls and combine them in something.  These 4 individual scrolls will be rare drops off of kunark dragons, guardian wurms, juggs, and emperor chottal.<br />
<br />
This would make me very happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In all honesty, though, druids and shamans could both use an upgrade to their healing spells.  However, I think removing the 10% penalty (which I hear is already lifted on test) would be all the upgrade we need.  A 400ish point group heal spell for them to help with AE damage, I wouldn't mind either.<br />
<br />
Asking for a 2500pt heal for 375 (or even 700 mana) is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
In the very very end game, maybe these changes would make sense, I dunno.  However, 90% of the level 60 druids on my server are not helping kill AoW, are not killing emperor, are not in VT, etc...   They are in guilds like mine that are still having fun in and being challenged by ToV (and not even north tov).  Giving them healing spells this powerful would replace clerics.  A druid with a 2500 point heal would function just fine as a replacement healer at my stage of the game.  Maybe not as good as a cleric, but it would make them unneeded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not 60 and I'm not in an uber,uber guild but we have done Velk, Gore, Vindi, Draco, Treah and more of that level of encounter, so I guess that counts for something, but I love having attitude adjusted Druids on raids and grouping.<br />
<br />
By attitude adjusted I mean ones that know they aren't going to be THE healer or THE nuker but are going to make the raid flow smooth and make life so much easier for everybody. Group regrowth, SoE (yes cast it now not drive-by), snares, buffs, Shaman down, no chanters in a group, call the dR00d and have him kite the adds, HE KNOWS how to do it. Alert Druids can save the group. Man I love Druids and Necros too.<br />
<br />
I don't know everything higher level Druids can do, I really haven't had them in that many groups but when they are there with the right attitude they are a blessing as far I can see.</div></div><hr />

Try grouping with druids instead of hacking on them, and you might be surprised. I see more shaman on these boards giving stick to druids than i ever see druids doing the same thing to shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you know, it's kinda interesting.<br />
<br />
90% of people assume one ****nut who posts on the druid boards (who has less than 40 posts btw) represents the druid population. then i get to go to all the nice message boards i read where i go try to make nice positive posts helping people with questions, and hear<br />
<br />
&quot;the druids are whining again&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
now, are you whining about druids whining?<br />
<br />
&quot;the shaman's are whining about us asking for stuff again&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
all in all, we don't need CH and manaburn. that was a ****ed up idiot who doesn't represent the druid population. unfortunatly with no bigger heal, and no heal over time, the druid class is the only priest who can't heal.<br />
<br />
you can take a shaman with torpor for a decent exp group. he can do just fine between torpor and slow, no one has the slightest chance of dying.<br />
<br />
you can take a cleric for a great exp group. CH is god.<br />
<br />
druid? oh. they get the least mana efficient heal out of any priest class (including paladin and necro) no slow...and people tell us our DS makes up for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
hahahahhahahaha<br />
<br />
<br />
i honestly think druids need some kind of healing upgrade, not with a bigger heal, but a damn better mana efficient one. you shammys are all used to torpor, which is 6:1 healing. Nature's Touch is 2.2:1, and on a big tank, if he's at 30% hp, i can blow thru half my mana bar just trying to get him to full.<br />
<br />
simply being put, we are the only priest who can't heal, and some people are very pissed about that. some try to work out answeres logically, and some ****nuts ask for CH and manaburn.<br />
<br />
<br />
hope people try to take time to <br />
<br />
1. look at the problem<br />
2. look at the poster as a person, not a whiny druid.<br />
3. shut the hell up, if you can't do 1 or 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You do realize that torpor is not a vendor sold spell right?<br />
<br />
You also realize that at least on my server, the local uber guild is paying 150kpp per copy of torpor?<br />
<br />
Druids are always talking as if torpor is THE BOMB.  It is, but its rarity is unbelievable.  Shammys easily solo with Torpor, its a group only spell, and damn its nice.  Its also one of the rarest spells in the game and I would rather do 15 POTC quests then have to go through getting torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think it's too simplistic to just say Druids need a better heal and everything is all better. Classes need to be taken as a whole. Keep in mind Shaman only get Torpor at 60 and it's rare as hell too, no one usually hands you a copy. There is a lot of game before 60. Torpor is unuseable outside of your own group, unuseable on a main tank, and you want to use it sparingly on your melee in raids, and it can be dispelled by ae dispelling mobs. In a normal exp group it rocks. It definately has it's place. The Druid heal is ok in exp groups and you can use it on melee on raids and MT and it can't be dispelled. No you won't replace a cleric, but then neither does a Shaman. I think Druids suffer perception problems more than the class really having problems. There are a lot of Druids out there, there must be something making the class appealing.</div></div><hr />

imo druid get better ds, nukes, manaregen, ports, snares, ae's, storebought nonrootbreaking dots.<br />
<br />
and shamans get buffs, heals, slows, better pet, canny, higher dmg dots<br />
<br />
we all would like better spells, but in all im really satisfied, only a firebased nuke (400-500) or higher poison/cold nuke (800) would be nice for raids with more shaman.</div></div><hr />

Snare.  Darn fine spell.  Succor/Evac many times helpful.  Oh hell I am not going to list what they can do they should know or they should play a different class.  Druids rock because they can do so much even if not perfectly.<br />

Must have missed the shaman petition.  Or the thread where we asked for more DD spells, or a cool wolf form.  Or the ability to dual wield or teleport.<br />
<br />
We've bitched about alchemy, and the pitiful drop rate of Kunark spells.  Maybe a bit about our AA skills.  <br />

give them a rez....except one that takes their own life.<br />

give them much better healing....long cast times and small mana.....but make it group only like ours...and blinds the target and snares it or somthing.:)<br />

put their nukes on the same resist and damage table as poor mages.<br />

Try:  Xican, Karaethon, Minadil, Iquredash, Nionailz, Xaviel, Tenil, Jentriken, Kinare, Lech, Mendiyen, Yasbysia, Duffer, Jillie, Jermari, Relbeek (ok, it's keebler backward, but screw you anyway), Chitlin, Tweil, Sorrun, Livonya, Cassea, Gavick, Tetrian, Quelm, Qmonium, Batou, Exedor, Rehjeir, Corinth, Deneldar, Aidon, Xanthe, Loralin, Ellendilh, would you like me to continue naming them?  I'm sure I could name atleast a thousand off the top of my head...<br />
<br />
- Oh, and if you think a Druid can farm, you're quite possibly the stupidest mother F*cker to ever walk this earth.  Being as Druid's are useless solo in dungeons.  But, we know all that &quot;uber&quot; outdoor loot that's soloable 55+  right?<br />
<br />
&quot;By attitude adjusted I mean ones that know they aren't going to be THE healer or THE nuker but are going to make the raid flow smooth and make life so much easier for everybody.&quot;<br />
<br />
-This is the problem.  In a pinch an Shaman can be taken to say...Ssra, or The deep, or *even* just deep Seb camps.  They'll do an adequate job for main healer.  They'll have buffs and slows to help aid the process.  While a shaman won't be giving cleric's a run for their money, they can still fill in.  Would you trust a Druid to the same?  I certainly hope not...Being nuker?  I think we can fill that role currently in most groups.  But healing we can't cut it.  Assuming there's no other priest, would you trust a Druid in a Seb King camp as only healer?  Would you trust a Shaman or Cleric?  That's the bottom line for most Druid's.  Our DS arguably makes up the difference in a prolonged fight.  But if the tank dies 30 seconds in the DS doesn't do a whole lot.<br />
<br />
In any case, people are becoming far too critical of The Druid's Grave.  It's an open public forum.  If I started a post on the Crucible saying &quot;We need CH, Manaburn, Lay Hand, Harm Touch, Death Touch, Aego, PoTG, C3, Mez, Charm, Dire Charm, Canni 6 which will be a 3 HP damage for 4k mana, Death pact, 3k HP per tick, 40 tick DoTs unresistable of course, dual weild, plate armor, bonus 3k mana, and 12k HP, and snare.&quot;  And the Grave put up a thread about &quot;Shaman's being greedy morons&quot;, what would you guys have to say?  Here's my sweaty ol' boots.  Take a walk, then judge me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Just a note here...<br />
<br />
Highest possible Druid nuke with all AA = 2300.  That's supposing they crit, and hit for full damage.  It's also a very often resisted spell that druid's can't debuff for.<br />
<br />
-Highest possible heal = 880 (with current 10% reduction on live servers).  With crits etc.  it's 1760.  That's for 400 mana!  Lets put this in to a very blunt healing formula based on ratios...<br />
<br />
Druid best heal ratio: 2.2:1 with Nature's Touch.<br />
<br />
Shaman: Torpor: 6:1 over 24 seconds.  <br />
<br />
Cleric: Cheal:  25.6:1 instant.<br />
<br />
It's clear to see that even with crits where the Druid one is 4.4:1, it's still 1/3 of torpor, and only has (with all AA) a 15% chance of critting.  Granted, it's instant, and doesn't snare/slow the tank, that is both it's bane and gift.  Anyhow...Just thought I'd try and put the healing abilities of the priests in a more clean-cut fashion.  Not too many people actually realize just how unbalanced it is.<br />
<br />
It's kinda funny, but the next best ratio for Cleric Heals is 3.3, with Celstial Elixir which, like torpor is over 24 seconds.  But nearly half the ability.  Makes me wonder if Torpor of CH was the mistake.  Ah, well...People will always find reason to complain about EQ.  I'm going to bed.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Forgot to note that the ratio is HP:Mana conversion.  Stupid me.  =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Stop comparing your easy to aquire heals with Torpor.<br />
<br />
Torpor = probably the rarest kunark spell in the game(maybe sunstrike gives it a good run)<br />
<br />
Torpor = only castable on group, is a heal over time type, it SNARES you, it SLOWS your attacks. <br />
<br />
Im fine with druids getting a healing upgrade.. believe me.. but ONLY if it follows the same restrictions as torpor, and has similar downsides, and is JUST as rare as torpor.<br />
<br />
I can canni, druids can port.<br />
I can slow, druids can dd<br />
<br />
Druids buy their nearly unresistable dots from merchants, I get mine as rare drops and they resist *lots*. This is balanced by the fact that I can dot for more at once *shrug*<br />
<br />
If druids want more healing power thats fine, but make it a kunark 60th spell, on the REALLY REALLY RARE table like torpor and sunstrike, and have it restricted just as badly as torpor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's split almost identically 50/50 between evocation and alteration.  In prior expansions, it was probably slightly in favor of alteration, as some druids now are switching to evocation from alteration, due to the fact they are more competent with their nukes at higher levels than they are at healing.</div></div><hr />

Hahah too funny... Here, maybe if we give you a spell like this you'll stop bitching... then again if you SPECIALIZED ALTERATION instead of evocation for your ubar nukage for quadding, you'd be a lot better off mana wise when people asked you to actually throw a few heals around<br />

<br />
it aint torpor that keeps the tank alive it is turgur's.<br />

Torpor is just a mana regen spell.(most of the times)<br />
Torpor is very rare<br />
Torpor is so many things but then what else to be expected from the only class i know that always want to have it all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Mind if a cleric chimes in?<br />
<br />
As much fun as being in a Ch rotation is, there are a few things that are imperative to balance the cleric class:<br />
<br />
Ports - we are one of only TWO priest classes which don't have ports. This is an outrage! Not allowing clerics to be self-reliant is horrible. So give them to us, with some idiotic penalty. I'm not sure what we can make it, how about making the spells cost 25 mana more than druid ports?<br />
<br />
Manaburn - a cleric not being able to manaburn the mob being killed makes us useless. USELESS I SAY! We have plenty of mana, what with druids/shammies healing us and mages giving us mod rods, I see nothing unbalancing with cleric manaburn. Let's put in some penalty as well - how about, we can't manaburn a mob until after a wizzie landed a MB on it?<br />
<br />
100% exp rez - time and time again I see clerics get passed up for rezzes because a GM can do the same, and better. This is simply a horrible omission on Verant's part, and should be corrected ASAP.<br />
<br />
Increase 2HB cap - warriors, sks and pallies don't *HAVE* to be the only tanks. Of course, we don't want to unbalance clerics, so there's no need for the skill to cap at 255. We'll settle for a 250 cap on 2HB... for now.<br />
<br />
Now, I realize some of these sound unreasonable, but I'll have to get some druid opinions on the penalties. They came up with the VERY REASONABLE 2.5k heal for 25 mana less than a cheal (with a quicker cast time to boot!), which leads me to believe that if they can balance that, they can balance anything.<br />

<br />
We've bitched about alchemy, and the pitiful drop rate of Kunark spells. Maybe a bit about our AA skills. <br />
<br />
Honestly, the most bitching we do is about each other's Magelos&quot;<br />
<br />
i've seen threads where shamans ask for better DDs. hell, go look at the post here. i see at least 1 person asking for a better DD.<br />
<br />
i see shaman's whining about bear form all the time, mostly whining to make it cooler. <br />
<br />
guess what, you can teleport. go buy yourself a damn spiritstone.<br />
<br />
oh, deian, i suggest you look into faithstones. i know high elf cleric one is killer, and ports somewhere i would kill to :D<br />
<br />
<br />
ok. if shaman's dont' want me to talk about torpor, that's cool too. i know it's a rare as hell dropped spell. but pleast don't talk about my uber nukes. my best one is also a dropped spell, albeit less rare than torpor. i'd appreciate it if you don't talk about any of my dropped spells, including SoE, because that's just not allowed!<br />
<br />
either way, with chloroblast and superior healing, shaman's heal better than druids anyways. when goin on about our bigger heal, you shammys forget something. nature's touch has the same ratio as chloroblast.<br />
<br />
the difference in healing is slow. shaman's can slow, and spot heal with chloroblast all day in an exp group, and be totally fine without torpor.<br />
<br />
<br />
that's all that's on my mind at the moment. think about it please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Originally posted by Jentriken Aspenbark <br />
that's all that's on my mind at the moment. think about it please. <br />
<br />
I thought about it....<br />
<br />
Druids can spot heal just as well as a shaman.  I don't see your point.  If your in a group with a chanter or a melee with a slow proc weapon (most groups have one or both of these), you'd be just as effective.<br />
<br />
Torpor is good against mobs... if they are slowed.   With a mob that can't be or hard to slow, waiting 24 seconds for torpor to take full effect, isn't going to do much good if the tank is getting hit for 200's+.  Not to mention I myself, could be put in jeapardy on slow resist agro.  So I'd guess I would be chloroblasting along with torporing, which means I'd be using a lot of mana.  Don't tell me about cannibalizing, 'cause when I'm doing that, I'm not healing.<br />
<br />
Let's say all I have is Torpor to heal and a druid Chloroblast.<br />
In that 24 second time I heal 1200 hp, Chlorblast will do 3080 (actually a bit less, due to a fizzle and re-pressing heal key).  With mana usage set aside, Chloroblast is the winner. <br />
<br />
Nature's Touch may have a tacky ratio, but that larger instant heal will save someone faster from death or allow the tank to taunt off a mob from someone you healed easier,  than repressing chloroblast twice (not to mention any crit heal kicking in, which seems a lot of druids I know put points into).<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, with the high-end game, secondary healing can be frustrating, but don't think you (druids) are the only ones with the frustrations.  The most request shamans have asked for better healing,  is to remove the side-effects of Torpor.  Seems pretty reasonable.  Still the same mana/hp ratio.  It'd sure help healing a cleric using mod rods, or the mage mod rodding to make the mod rods, and any hybrid that backs out of the fight, ALOT easier WITHOUT having to be grouped.<br />
<br />
And as far as shamans whining about wanting a cooler bearform and improving alchemy (which has in fact,  been stated by Verant a few weeks ago, it will get looked at... someday), don't you think that's pretty damn minor?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Druid group damage shields should have an additional effect...reverse Mark of Karn.  Whenever the person with the buff gets hit, he's healed for a certain amount of damage.  I'm trying to think what would be a good number.  I believe it should be calculated on the level of the player and damage done by the mob.  Would help make it a little scaleable and prevent powerleveling.  Using the upper level group ds, a level 60 player would get a base heal of 15, plus dmg / 100 * 2, up to 250 damage (5 extra for a total of 20, at max).<br />
<br />
Numbers probably need some reworking but I figure about 500hp healed per minute * 6mins = 3000hp is about what the spell should do against a non slowed standard exp mob.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think of that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll get three feet in to Lguk before getting a beat down.  Undead aggro (assuming it's the undead side), and chain aggro in there is enough to have 6 mobs beating on me at any given time.  Leather armor, and low HP, unless you're a channeling god and can root all six, and still manage to get away from them in time.  Then you have to think...&quot;Gee, with all that porting and rooting, do I even have the mana to finish two or three let alone all of these off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gate to BB, run to Dagnars - check Bilge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bilge Farfathom has a PH, so you need to be clearing stuff to get him to pop in the first place, more mana, more time wasted.  Add in the rarity of his showing up.  Now chuck in the rarety of him dropping the totem.  Now, just for fun, decide how many people still would use a totem in this game.  It's void of everything but wisdom.  Truth be told there's much cheaper, easier items, that are far better out there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gate to DL, run to FM clear cycle.&quot;<br />
<br />
- I utterly despise Kunark, so haven't a clue what the FM cycle is (or on my server we call it something different?  I dunno).  So, for the hell of it I'll assume with the word cycle, it's atleast 4 or 5 mobs.  Take in the port and kill mana for consideration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bored with Cycle, gate to SRO, track AC&quot;<br />
<br />
- Who the **** buys Jboots anymore?  Everyone that had a use for them now has the much easier option of Run3.  The other's probly didn't have the cash to front such an expensive item MQ.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ho-hum back to Kedge, check on minor MOBs. &quot;<br />
<br />
- I dunno how you plan to solo in kedge, as a Druid.  When in water, if root breaks you're so incredibly screwed.  Risk and Reward make this a worthless endevour.  But, I'll assume you died four times, and wasted more mana on the porting there, to get your corpse, died a few more times trying that before finally paying for a summon.   You're now out a couple thousand pp for the coffins (and if you're polite the necro's time).  <br />
<br />
&quot;Gate to Lava - run into SOl B, check on Harvestor. Make sure you're porting others when you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
- You forgot fight your way down to harvestor, killing the PH's, and killing all the mobs in your way.  With caster mob rebalancing that's level 45-ish Shaman a good bit of the way.  Then assuming Harvestor is up, kill him.  You've now managed to get one peice of loot for 12 hours of porting around mindlessly, and it's made no difference because of the Kedge advent where you didn't get to some corpses, lost three orange bubbles of exp, and couldn't sell your one peice of loot to make up the 2k cash you spent for a necro to summon your worthless tree hugging ass out.<br />
<br />
What did you do?  Wasted twelve hours of your life.  Probably lost a considerable amount of money, then lost even more exp in comparison to the money.  Then, to top it all off, you have to sit around for three hours actually trying to sell your one peice of loot, and not being able to find a seller.  Then you run in to the problem of if you can actually sell your one peice of loot for a good enough price to break even, from the money you spent summoning.  You've not only wasted the day you spent trying to farm items, but the day you spent grouping in Seb, or Velks, or HS, or Chardok to actually get the money to pay for your rezzes/summons in Kedge.<br />
<br />
*Sigh*  You don't think people have tried a similar cycle as this?  Do not forget all the old world loot is pretty much moot.  List stuff more up-to-date atleast.  Things people might want.  Oh, wait...That's all from dungeons!  Otherwise, with every other f*ckin' port bitz Druid that lazy people make, you would end up with such disgustingly massive MUDflation, the likes of which Verant will thankfully never see.  Oh, not to mention most Druid's won't last thirty steps in to a Kunark + dungeon on their own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Druids want to solo <br />
Druids want to port <br />
Druids want to nuke <br />
Druids want to be raid material (Oh the joy of taking a quad kiting druid on his first raid to ssra and she all the tricks he does) <br />
Druids want to heal &quot;<br />
<br />
- First off, why are you taking a quad kiting druid to Ssra?  He's already effectively useless.  He thinks quadding = more exp., this doesn't understand the true strengths, or weaknesses of his class.  He's quite obviously a tool.  Why he'd be with you is rather evident, though.<br />
<br />
Take my ports!  I'll give you my ports right up with my anal virginity at a chance to be on par as a priest class should be for healing.  Go right the **** ahead!<br />
<br />
- Raid material?  What class doesn't want that?  Every other class (even Bard's the omni-present jack of all trades) bring something unique to a raid, and have a level of desirability.  Druid's do not.  It's not fun being left out.<br />
<br />
- Want to heal?  Oh ****...We're such ****in' incompetant useless bastards!  How the **** can we walk with our heads held high, as a priest class when we have ambitions of healing!?  What the **** were we thinking!?<br />
<br />
- What it boils down to is this:  Druid's have been left out over the last three expansions.  They've been ignored, completely.  We want to be able to do what we could in EverQuest, the original.  We want what was ours at one time, but was taken away from us at the advent of &quot;new content&quot;.  Whereas the rest of the classes have only strived forward with this new content.  We have been set back.  The only way to fix us is to raise our ability to that of the other classes, or reasonably on par...Or we could nerf every other class back to three expansions ago, and then give everyone a shot at NToV, Ssra, and VT.  I'm sure those 3k buffed HP warrior's will love the concept!<br />
<br />
Grizlor, very nice idea.  Oh wait...I just remembered!  Naturally every druid is specialized in evocation.  That's why we have all those one-sided, in favour of alteration?  And if porting were so great, and we got such use out of it alteration would naturally be the first to become a specialized skill, it is after all alteration.  The ones specialized in evocation?  The twits that want to get to 44 ASAP, so they have their port bitches ready when their main, the 55 Shaman needs it!<br />
<br />
&quot;60 druid in my guild got herself a full set of Umbral Plains armor by herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
- A shaman can do the same.  It's not hard.  It's very time consuming, and not profitable at all.  NO DROP armor isn't exacly farming in my books.  Especially considering Chanters, bards, Druids, Shaman, and any other good solo class can get it.  Even easier for a Shaman in my mind.  A shaman naturally has much higher damage output than a Druid with less mana conservation.  Doesn't need to worry as much about summoning, which is a problem there.  Also being that with epic, bracer, Winged Death, and if you wanna waste mana Breath of Ro, the Elysian skele's still take 15 minutes to kill ONE at a time, and then the med time.   It really evens out.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many of the druids bitching about mana ratios actually spec'd in alteration back at 30?&quot;<br />
<br />
- See my above list of Druids, exluding Nionailz.<br />
<br />
&quot;Im fine with druids getting a healing upgrade.. believe me.. but ONLY if it follows the same restrictions as torpor, and has similar downsides, and is JUST as rare as torpor. &quot;<br />
<br />
- Are you daft?  There's three times as many active level 60 Druid's per server than there is Shaman.  That means naturally if you have a spell of the same rarity, while it's REALLY rare for Shaman, it's three times as rare for a Druid.  So &quot;REALLY rare&quot;  turns in to &quot;Extremely reatardedly, on a level beyond comprehension by any mortal being, why the **** did Verant do this to us&quot; level of rare.  You have to take in to consideration the number of the class playing.  Level 60 shaman are significantly more rare (though the curent alt-twink fad) than level 60 Druid's.  You can't implement the same rarity of a spell for two different classes, when one so heavily outbalances the other.<br />
<br />
That said, I'd preffer your idea to nothing, which is what we have now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I may be wrong rounding up too high, but I know that a druid in my guild critical hit Vindi for 2930ish yesterday. Possibly because of focus items and such. Also have seen some rediculously high heals, but again I may have rounded up too high.&quot;<br />
<br />
- Hmm...Moonfire is our strongest non-ancient spell.  It can only hit for 2300 with a crit.  Are you sure it wasn't 2390 that you saw?  Or was it an ancient spell your guild Druid might have been using?  I can't say as I've been to up-to-date with ancient spells.  But, if I'm not mistaken Starfire of Ro or something was a 1250 nuke.  With a crit, hitting for full, and a Mage summoned item, I could see it hitting for that much.  But that's an *extremely* rare case, as well.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, trying to convince the Shaman community that Druid's might actually be justified, in anything they do, is simply not going to happen.  I'll continue to check this thread, and laugh at some of you, but don't plan to post any further.  Have fun.  It's your rite.  Just like it is to hate and despise Druid's without actual method to your way of thinking.  Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

EB &amp; Lev I will ignore<br />
Foliage Shield - Not amazing but still useful<br />

Mask of the Stalker - at least the mana regen on it is nice<br />
<br />
Oh, and the Jentrik - can really you compare Shamans asking for a different colour Bear Form and slightly better thought out AA skills, maybe a better nuke that is still worse than a druids (we have asked for around 900) to druids asking for Complete Heal and Manaburn?  Dont really think that is a good comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">This thread is a waste of space.  Just a bunch of ranting and dick-waving.<br />
<br />
I think everyone here and most rational druids will agree that most of the things suggested by that thread were unreasonable and poorly thought out.<br />
<br />
However, I think most people could accept a few minor upgrades to the druid class.  In my opinion, druids are not there to make a drastic difference on a raid.  I'm sorry, but it just isn't what you're made for.  You don't have a big glamorous role, like slowing the mob or healing the main tank (the latter of which is really not that fun).  What druids are there for (at least in my opinion) is to make everything easier.  Their buffs and spot-healing don't make or break a raid, but they certainly make it easier and more enjoyable.  If they recieved some minor and convenient upgrades in these departments, I would be all for it and happy for them.  The proposed changes, though, are absurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I'm interested by this idea that druids are no good at farming, as this is not my experience: a little story.<br />
<br />
A while back I'd just got enough pp (21k) for a fungi for my shaman when Verant had one of their nice little whims and changed the Fungi drop rate.  Obviously prices were going to skyrocket: so I took the day off work, got out my 49 druid (not my 55 shaman), and made 5k in a day, buying a Fungi that night for 26k.  Coincidently, one of my kills was Bilge.  <br />
<br />
So if a lot of druids can't farm, I'd say its down to their competence, not their class's capabilities.  You see a lot of them killing HGs in Rathe Mountains: thats a real waste of time for a character that can port and track.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>TetrianBrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Main problem right now, is that we dont have the mana ratio needed to keep people alive in most situations, we simply run oom faster than a cleric trying to use a naked ranger as tank would - to describe it in another way, our level 60 heal, heals less than a bub of hps on a warrior(1.2bub on a caster) for the same mana cost as complete heal, its also not what you could call an upgrade in anything but a bit of cast time, from cloroblast - the poor ratio also means that the damage output we might have on paper drops like a rock if one of our group members takes just a bit of damage.<br />
<br />
While we should be behind clerics in healing ratio, we should atleast be up to par, or maybe even better than shamans in healing, to outbalance the slow a bit.<br />
<br />
Im glad to see that a few of you supporting us treehuggers btw :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Few comments on the spells you mentioned :) - my own personal opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking 49+:<br />
Protection of Nature - nice group spell at the time<br />
Nice spell, group versions of stuff is good, though i dont have much use for it at 60 - im pretty sure it would have been one of my favorite spells at the level. but even though im not affected by it due to my level, wouldnt it be kinda useless if you look at the lower level versions? (i dont care, but just looks a little sad for the small ones)<br />
EB &amp; Lev I will ignore <br />
Foliage Shield - Not amazing but still useful Foilage shield is useless, its one of those...maybe once every blue moon i can use it because i just happened to have it memmed while a non see invis roamed close to my group, but generally, normal invis is a better option for travel purposes due to the mana cost for recast if it breaks, should be fixed duration(imo - would, be a very nice utility spell if it was.) <br />
Spirit of Eagle - Same as above its the best spell besides moonfire we got in luclin. <br />
Ro's Smouldering Disjunction - Very nice debuff I see used a LOT  I cast it on all the bosses i get close to, only problem is im not quite sure what it does, sure it has a little fire ressist debuff to it, sunder does too(and it costs alot less mana),  but aside from that.. it doesnt seem to have an effect? much like the incredible stat buffs you guys are always complaining about.<br />
Circle of Seasons - Used on almost all raids I attend  i agree, this spell is nice, saves 1 buff slot from circle of fire/cold, now im just wondering why i didnt have it while i was raiding ToV - wheres the fire / cold AEs in luclin?<br />
Protection of the Cabbage - Nice spell and very nice earring from the quest i agree, nice spell - we really needed that single target version of our glades spell so we dont have to use 1100 mana to buff 1 person all the time cause AE aegolism overrides it on those who wanted it it.<br />
Moonfire - V nice DD I agree, bout time they fixed it(had a ****ed up ratio before heh), pretty much the best spell of whole of luclin, also the only real &quot;upgrade&quot; we got in my opinion, no comments there, this spell is what makes druids right now.<br />
Mask of the Stalker - at least the mana regen on it is nice <br />
<br />

<br />
Now, The difference, and note that its the ONLY difference, is that <br />
Mask of the Stalker is castable indoors and costs more mana to cast - What im wondering, would it really be so overpowering to slap an extra mana regen or two on it, and actually make it an upgrade to the old one? - They basicly made the old spell what it should have been from the start, and tried to pull it off as an upgrade.<br />
<br />
So 2 good upgrades(a nuke, and a upgrade to sow/levi), 1 that makes us all wonder why they didnt just change the old spell, and some &quot;we dont know what to give them so we made up this&quot; spells.<br />
<br />
Care to list the cleric and shamans spells that came with luclin also - and try listing the effects they had on the usefullness of druid spells?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Harnessing of Spirit - Was nice at the time (i.e. when you could stack on it).  Past 55 used only for twink buffing<br />
EB &amp; Lev - same as for druids<br />
Disinfecting Aura - 2 spells we have put into one - not used a lot either<br />
Plague of Insects - only mob I have used this on is the Captain in the benevolance quest (oh, and to grab aggro on 9th ring)<br />
Regrowth of Dah Khura - Nice spell - save me hassle - nothing new tho<br />
Acumen of Dar Khura - no comment<br />
Talisman of Epuration - 10 more disease resist on Jasinth - woohoo<br />
Khura's Focusing - saves me casting focus a lot.<br />
<br />
Non of these have changed the usefulness of druids in the slightest - why? becuase we got sweet FA new and no real upgrades to anything.  The closest we got to a new spell was the disease based slow.  I would anticipate it probably has some use on an Uber mob somewhere, but I sure as heck dont use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">ok.<br />
<br />
first things first. i specialized in alteration back at 30. my spec is still alteration. so you can just shut yer mouth about that one.<br />
<br />
secondly, the highest theoretical nuke a druid can get with focus items, SCF3 etc is slightly under 2650. 2950 is not impossible.<br />
<br />
<br />
now ranhorn. the thing is that while we can heal more hp faster with chloroblast than torpor (you used it! no complaints that i'm using the same example) druids have FAR more downtime as a healer. if a tank is gettin beat down and i'm healing 3080 hp healed as opposed to you throwing torpor on, healing 2-3 times, and cannying when you can, you will be in a far better state of mana than i am, and ready to go much much sooner.<br />
<br />
i really wish it was a simple explanation. priest classes are quite unbalanced, and i'm glad VI is lookin at the whole situation. i don't think shaman's don't need anything, i'd like to see you guys get a natures touch esque heal. i'd just like to see druids get something that can make us viable healers and get back the 70% of cleric heals we had for the first 45 lvls of our lives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">This Druid thread is reaching insane proportions really.  I replied on the Cleric Board (http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008869.html) with my ideas though its just waste of breath as people do not want to hear it.  For some reason people put on blinders when it comes to their class and what they want for it.   Hopefully the original topic will die soon or later when things get tweaked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics have issues.<br />
Druids have issues.<br />
Shamans have issues.<br />
EVERY CLASS HAS ISSUES.<br />
<br />
BUT hopefully the game developers understand that you cant take all the skills from one class and give it to another without there being MAJOR unbalancing. This is a difficult task I am sure. We have to have some small measure of faith that they are up to this task.<br />
<br />
Wanting priests to be equals is like comparing apples to cars.  The ONLY thing they have in common is the ability to heal and that they are lumped as priests.  Nothing else compares.  You cant judge a rogue vs. a bard in only one common factor, like say damage.  Because the classes are MORE then just the one factor.  When balance is looked at the WHOLE picture of not only that class but ALL classes is looked at, not just the one factor.  <br />
<br />
The game has evolved to a certain extent not how the designers wanted it to, but how the players played it. If we didnt develop strats like the CH chain, mobs wouldnt had to have developed the way they did. We, the players, have molded and shaped this game into what it is. If you want to cast blame on someone for &quot;messing up your class&quot; go look in a mirror, because you are just as big a part of it as the other person behind their monitor playing OtherClass03.<br />
<br />
Until we are all happy as can be with our classes just try to live with what you DO have, not lamenting about what you DONT have.  <br />
<br />
Namaste,<br />

<br />
There is no doubt, we have less downtime.   But I was talking from a pure healing perspective and pointing out that we have the exact same thing we can use.   I'd rather be able to heal the guy to live and not worry about downtime.  Otherwise, if the guy dies, and no rezzer... well, there's going to be plenty of downtime.    <br />
<br />
I still wonder to myself if healing the MT with chloroblast is even worth it.  I know the saying, &quot;Every little bit helps&quot; but I feel with clerics DL'ing and CH'ing it &quot;erases&quot; my efforts.  Chaining a 385 heal (or even 423; but better still!) on someone that's getting hit for double/quad 3-400's, is not my ideal of helping.   <br />
<br />
Luckily, there are other areas healing can be useful on a raid.  Such as the mod-rod group, or hybrids (well the paladin can heal just fine).  I would gather Nature's Touch would be just as useful as Torpor on mages or on clerics mod-rodding, and it's not as instense as healing the MT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having a druid, that's what I have found.  In nearly every group, I can't think of a spot that a druid takes up that wouldn't be better filled by someone else.<br />
Secondary healer...shaman<br />
Secondary nuker...mage or wizzy<br />
Evac...wizzy<br />
Damage shields...mage<br />
<br />
Honestly, my druid life went a lot like this...port somewhere...&quot;52 druid lfg&quot;  no one answers, port somewhere else rinse and repeat...then go quad kite somewhere.<br />
<br />
Everyone has trouble finding groups, but how often do you honestly see a group looking for a druid?<br />
I've seen groups looking for rangers or sks, monks, rogues, wizzies, shaman and of course the holy trinity, but I have NEVER seen a group go out of their way to get a druid.  Sure, they'll take them if they HAVE to, but before 60, druids aren't that great to have around.  <br />
<br />
They would be better accepted, and more useful to everyone if they had heals at least on par with shaman.  I believe nature's touch has the same ratio as chloroblast, what the hell is the point?<br />
Yeah, torpor is tough to get, and yeah it is a heal over time blah blah...but the ratio is insanely good for anyone other than a cleric.<br />
Without a chanter or a bard, druid's who nuke and dot will burn through their mana with almost no way to gain it back indoors.  They won't have any mana for their heals, which are the worst of the priest classes anyway.  <br />
I don't thnk any of their wolf/tree form stuff works inside, where as shaman can canni any time, not to mention take hits almost as well as a pally.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, what I am getting at is that the 10% removal is a great thing, it is the kind of thing the priest classes should work on together.   We should leave the druids alone, they are in the same boat as we are for back up healers, and I'll bet you dollars to doughnuts that a shaman will get picked for a secondary healing spot 9 times out fo 10 faster than a druid.  <br />
<br />
If you're pissed that they can quad, go solo Lodi and shut up.</div></div><hr />

&quot;I'll get three feet in to Lguk before getting a beat down. Undead aggro (assuming it's the undead side), and chain aggro in there is enough to have 6 mobs beating on me at any given time. Leather armor, and low HP, unless you're a channeling god and can root all six, and still manage to get away from them in time. Then you have to think...&quot;Gee, with all that porting and rooting, do I even have the mana to finish two or three let alone all of these off?&quot; <br />
<br />
if you can't single pull green stuff indoors at 55+ you deserve to be dead :p Hell I just run past em in lguk now... And you can have a maxiumum of THREE mobs beating on you at once... if you can't handle 3 greens hitting you for 40 damage long enough to cast an upheaveal and wipe em all out in one spell... it's time to work on that defense skill you haven't touched since level 5.<br />
<br />
Bilge Farfathom has a PH, so you need to be clearing stuff to get him to pop in the first place, more mana, more time wasted<br />
<br />
Lumi Staff? hell even your ES Vambs.... use your clickies and med.... but oh no I have to cast my super nukes since I specialized evoke and don't want it to go to waste.<br />
<br />
Add in the rarity of his showing up. Now chuck in the rarety of him dropping the totem. Now, just for fun, decide how many people still would use a totem in this game. It's void of everything but wisdom. Truth be told there's much cheaper, easier items, that are far better out there. <br />
<br />
Sell it to some druid.<br />
<br />
I utterly despise Kunark<br />
<br />
So now he's going to complain about outdoor zones too!<br />
<br />
Who the **** buys Jboots anymore? Everyone that had a use for them now<br />
<br />
Need to lay off the... Um... organic material. Jboots sell for 5k on 7th, I see 3 or 4 people a night on the auction channel trying to buy em. <br />
<br />
I dunno how you plan to solo in kedge, as a Druid. When in water, if root breaks you're so incredibly screwed. Risk and Reward make this a worthless endevour.<br />
<br />
Hey, we're forgetting a little thing called SNARE... you never get hit remember?<br />
<br />
You forgot fight your way down to harvestor, killing the PH's, and killing all the mobs in your way. With caster mob rebalancing that's level 45-ish Shaman a good bit of the way. <br />
<br />
Uh, just run in and zap the harvester.... god damn, sol B is almost devoid of mobs on a weeknight on my server.<br />
<br />
Then assuming Harvestor is up, kill him.<br />
<br />
Hey hey! first rational thing you've said.... hope you can kill a level 20 mob indoors, or did that 'outdoor druid only' thing bite you in the ass too hard? :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Oh, not to mention most Druid's won't last thirty steps in to a Kunark + dungeon on their own.<br />
<br />
So group? or stop complaining....<br />
<br />
Raid material? What class doesn't want that? Every other class (even Bard's the omni-present jack of all trades) bring something unique to a raid, and have a level of desirability. Druid's do not. It's not fun being left out. <br />
<br />
So go play another class. if it's so hard, then quit. Please.<br />
<br />
Want to heal? Oh ****...We're such ****in' incompetant useless bastards! How the **** can we walk with our heads held high, as a priest class when we have ambitions of healing!? What the **** were we thinking!? <br />
<br />
When you clicked on that character and saw LOW DIFFICULTY did you ever think you might have to pay for it sometime?<br />
<br />
That's why we have all those one-sided, in favour of alteration? And if porting were so great, and we got such use out of it alteration would naturally be the first to become a specialized skill, it is after all alteration.<br />
<br />
Stop complaining and go change your specialize. Really.  it's funny watching druids on raids and in groups. The nukers will blow thier entire bar of mana healing, and the others will calmly say &quot;70m&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Im fine with druids getting a healing upgrade.. believe me.. but ONLY if it follows the same restrictions as torpor, and has similar downsides, and is JUST as rare as torpor. &quot; <br />
<br />
- Are you daft? There's three times as many active level 60 Druid's per server than there is Shaman. That means naturally if you have a spell of the same rarity, while it's REALLY rare for Shaman, it's three times as rare for a Druid. So &quot;REALLY rare&quot; turns in to &quot;Extremely reatardedly, on a level beyond comprehension by any mortal being, why the **** did Verant do this to us&quot; level of rare. You have to take in to consideration the number of the class playing. Level 60 shaman are significantly more rare (though the curent alt-twink fad) than level 60 Druid's. You can't implement the same rarity of a spell for two different classes, when one so heavily outbalances the other. <br />
<br />
And so after THREE F'in YEARS this spell is still rare as hell... I really don't think you really understand this spell at all, you're handed your spells, then you see shamans that have worked thier asses off to get to where they are, and what they can do hurts you. Please, PLEASE...Shut up and put up, or give up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyhow, trying to convince the Shaman community that Druid's might actually be justified, in anything they do, is simply not going to happen. I'll continue to check this thread, and laugh at some of you, but don't plan to post any further.<br />
<br />

Considering I can buy an entire druid 51st to 60th spellbook for what torpor costs on my server, yeah.. your not allowed to bitch about dropped spells. Can also buy 3 or 4 51st to 60th mage or chanter spellbooks too.. or more like 3 or 4 dozen.

Something around 405 (yes, just so it's more than CH) for 2000 would be a huge addition to druids raid usefulness without giving them some insane solo ability.<br />
<br />
Druids need a hand, probably more than any other class, why not back them on it as long as they keep their requests in the realm of the sane.<br />
<br />
Honestly in the priest changes that are/maybe coming, I'd like to see both shaman and druid get new larger more efficient DD heals but even if we both do I believe druids should get the better heal.  I'd also like to see clerics get more 'utility' healing type spells.  Damage reduction per hit (no, nowhere near a max of 250 per hit), possibly an avatar like buff (no F'ing component verant) that increases mainhand damage 10% or something.</div></div><hr />

Okay, just to clarify.  The G in /tgb stands for GROUP, like group buffs; buffs intended to affect a whole group, like group sow, or group agi or group focus.<br />

That's kind of a silly list when three of the spells on it are shaman spells too.  I've personally seen more copies of Remove Greater Curse drop than I've seen copies of Torpor drop, the Luclin spells aren't nearly so rare.  As far as componentless EB and lev, everyone knows exactly which mobs they drop off of, go get em! They aren't that hard to get.  Verant obviously decided not to take the &quot;too rare for almost anyone&quot; Kunark expansion route to spells again.  One of the guilds on my server that hits Sraa often is trading Moonfire for Orbs of Glowing Luclinite, so I anticipate it will soon start hitting the market for an affordable price.<br />
<br />
Anyway, your argument is specious, since Karelan left out the important qualifier for hard to get level 51 to 60 shaman spells Kunark.  I had every Luclin shaman spell except componentless EB and lev within 2 months of Luclin.  In contrast,  I was level 60 for months before I finally found a copy of Malo for sale and I finally got my level 56 Bane of Nife and level 57 Tigirs long after that.<br />

My problem is that a lot of druids want the best of everything.  Most people I know play druids because they can do most things, they can solo very well when they want to or they can go group for a while.<br />
<br />
I see no problem in upping druids desirability, but imho (and this is thing) they have to reduce their abilities to solo, and they have to make sure that they dont just end up having another classed dumped on the 'cant get a group' pile that doesnt have the solo ability.  I agree with the statement from someone above that said that if you choose the lowest difficulty character you have to expect to not get the same rewards at the end of the game, or else you will get virtually none of the hard chars and everyone will play a druid.<br />
<br />
I would have no problems with druids getting a Torpor type spell at 60, same kinda mana ratio, group only, maybe cripples and stuns the tank instead of snareing and slowing for 4 ticks.  If you do that then give me their damn highend nukes tho.</div></div><hr />

Instant travel and the graveyard in rumoured in SoL takes the next step, removing our semi-unique ability to port, and more importantly, the need for evacs, at that point we are nothing but crippled shamans without the ability to cast slow and canabalize.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I do think that at the high end, druids do need a bit of a healing upgrade. I group a lot with druids and in the high 50s they can't heal even a half-assed group without a slower. The lack of good mana regen, relative uselessness of Damage Shields at high levels and no slows is a killer. <br />
Personally, I'd like to see lvl 60 druids get a 1200hp heal for 450 mana and shaman get a heal over time at 60 that's somewhere between Celestial healing and elixer. I've always seen druids as better at quick damage/healing and shaman as masters of the long, slow fight. But that's just a personal preference. Heck, I'd be happy if I just had a reasonable shot at getting torpor &lt;g&gt;. <br />
<br />
As to why everyone likes to flame druids, it's because most of them come across as uninformed idiots whenever they start a balancing thread. If I recall, last time with the druid petition they wanted a lure based Dot better than anything a shaman/necro gets, a more efficient direct heal than anything a cleric has (outside of CH), Torpor without any side effects, and nukes on par with the best wizard nukes. This time it's CH and manaburn. Every time druids ask for an upgrade the threads show that most have no idea about balancing or even what the other classes are capable of. It's a me-first mentality that tends to rub people the wrong way. Druids have always been their own worst enemy when it comes to public relations and things still haven't changed in that regard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Are you daft? There's three times as many active level 60 Druid's per server than there is Shaman<br />
Now just why do you think that is?<br />
<br />
I play on Inny and to my understanding it's one of the older servers... or at least everyone on Inny likes to complain that it's old. ;)<br />
<br />
Since they introduced the channels (thanks Market Channel!) I have only heard of one copy of Torpor for sale, and heard it went for something like 70k. For comparison sake when KEI first started dropping it was worth around 100k. <br />
<br />
Torpor at the moment is probably worth around about the same as 2 Fungi Tunics, FT3 booties, CoF or probably a little less then a Manna Robe. That's just the market channel though, so it could be as reliable as the Indian rail system. Bought a JBB for 14k yesterday too. They run about 12 - 15k I think. I've also seen a fair few vendored copies of Moonfire.<br />
<br />
So yeah... on a server that's been out since servers had been out (as far as I know), Torpor still costs more pp than it'd take to buy a small chunk of Luclin.<br />
<br />
And I don't cvare if Shaman get nerfed back to Kunark. One of the things Shaman complain about so much is the lack of new stuff since Kunark.</div></div><hr />

Yay shortages of Torpor on Brell are solved.  If you can get a copy of Torpor for yourself (apparently its an easy camp) then there's no reason you can't get several.  Given how much you can sell it for you'd be mad not to.<br />

You do realize shamans have had the hp regen line ever since the beginning of the game, right (not to mention we get each single target version at lower levels than druids)?  I'd go as far as to say, it's more of a core spell over druids.  Why?  Because it's an essential spell to our mana gain (canni).   I found it a slap in the face when shamans didn't get a group regen way back in Kunark.  It took Verant getting a stick jammed up their butt by us, to finally give us a group regen spell two expansions later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.) Resistable manaburn....make druids into mini wizards. Both classes have DD, snare, root and ports. Make all druid spells indoor usable. Remove one line or both lines of DoTs.<br />
<br />
2.) Mini-cleric....give druids a 1500-2000hp heal with a moderate cast time and a moderate ratio. Make the spell drop or quest only. Remove one line of DoTs or the AoE dd line. <br />
<br />
3.) New Role....damage shield master. Give druids better damage shields that either do a percentage of damage taken or heal a small percentage of damage taken back to the tank. Damage shields cap their usefulness with RoK mobs. They need an increase damage output.  Remove AoE DD spells in exchange for solo druids being able to porcupine mobs.</div></div><hr />

I can probably afford 2 sets of these spells for what torpor costs on my server(last copy of torpor I know about went for 40k and a cloak of flames). None of those spells approaches the rarity of torpor by a an incredibly longshot. No druid spell AT ALL comes within anything remotly close to the rarity of torpor or sunstrike(wiz spell).<br />
<br />
Druids kited through the old world, kited through kunark, kited through velious getting spells handed to them for virtually no cost or effort. Some druid suggests they receive a torpor quality heal spell. Im fine with that. Im totally 100% on board with druids getting a torpor quality heal spell. Hell.. fackin give druids TORPOR for all I care. In fact.. yes.. lets give druids TORPOR. Up the drop rate to druid style spell drop rates and give druids TORPOR. Sounds like a helluva plan.<br />
<br />
In fact.. this is my new druid healing upgrade stance from now on.. Ill crusade long and hard for the druid community to give them torpor! They need a healing upgrade.. we need a drop rate increase.. it works well for EVERYONE! This gives them some options.. direct heal with no side effects and large manacost.. heal over time with no side effects for lesser amount and no side effects.. or very mana efficient heal over time with snare/slow side effects.</div></div><hr />

An Idea that I really liked is to Give druids a new damage sheild line. Make is a nice useful spell like avatar. (Cackle) <br />
<br />
3 minute refresh, 6 minute duration. Emerald component. 300 mana. But for the next 3 minutes They do 20 point of damage per hit to the monster and 20 points of damage per hit of the monsters damage is absorbed. (Upper level spell only of course.)<br />
<br />
They would be preventing 20% of the total damage a monster puts out Just like a slow Stops the damage. And dealing damage as well.<br />
<br />
That would allow them to heal in a non standard way just like shaman do with Slow. (Prevention is more efficiant than a heal anyways)<br />

Just an Idea. What do yall think.<br />

Half the time I feel like I'm watching Jerry Springer when I read those posts, the rest of the time I'm torn between feeling like a masochist for not pressing the little 'x' in the upper right corner or find myself agreeing with the flickering spark of rational thought most people are ignoring or pass over. Some people bring up valid points I agree with, most do not.<br />
<br />
I don't know about every class in the game, but as a raid leader I do as much research into the classes as I can, so I know how to effectively place/use them in a given situation/event/raid. I will never know every class intimately, nor do I claim to. So don't presume I am or I will label you incompotent and further look down on you, as I will explain a little later.<br />
<br />
Druids do need a boost. I have one in my regular EXP group and I can tell you that when I can channel through a heal for the same amount a 56 Druid can as a 57 Paladin, there's a serious problem there. Paladins are Hybrids, PART healer. We shouldn't be healing comparable to a Priest Class of the same level. Our group heal is one thing, we needed a generic beneficial raid ability other than DS/BMB, but direct heal is something else. Know what makes it even more pathetic? We get Superior Heal at 57 but get our previous healing spell, Greater Heal, at 39. We have to wait 18 levels for our next heal, which is then followed by the best group heal in the game a level later and the level after that with a great HoT spell. When Paladins get shafted for a healing spell for 18 levels and get one just as good as a Druid's of equal level that's pretty sad and speaks volumes for the necessity of a Druid revamp. (I made this comparison so that people could get an UNDERSTANDING of how badly Druids need their heals fixed not because Paladins need to be nerfed, as I'm sure more than one person was thinking about as they read this.)<br />
<br />
If you want to fix them, give Druids a HoT that stacks with all other HoTs (Cleric, Paladin, Shaman's Torpor ... notice that this is a new fresh idea? Creativity does wonders in this day and age and it gives merit that you're not just ripping something else off out of jealousy but looking for ways to improve YOUR class). Give them the best DS in the game--by a long shot. Give them the best group/single target regen. Give Druids the option of coming up with a list of new ideas and look it over to pick something out ... but unfortunately because of a few, this is never going to happen. Druids have shot themselves in their collective foot. Again, I will elaborate on this in a moment.<br />
<br />
I have to apologize here, but if Druids want to be a Priest class then why are they calling for a better nuke? The last time I checked Priest Classes weren't supposed to have super nukes because they can heal. That's why Casters get all the good nukes. They can't heal. It's called Balance. (Before some triggerhappy reader decides to flame this comment because they skimmed the post, take the time to read the entire 'essay' or just read the previous paragraph and let it sink in, then try and take this all in context.)<br />
<br />
Go ahead and flame me, but before you do, think about this: with as many druids rallying behind the CH/Manaburn post do you honestly expect to be taken seriously? You're asking for two spells/abilities that are class-defining. If you want your class defined, think up something ORIGINAL and UNIQUE to your own class. Don't ask for Manaburn and then call it Scorched Earth. Don't ask for Complete Heal and then call it Tears of Tunare or something else equally cute. And before you flame this, there was nothing to label the CH/Manaburn post as sarcastic or something to be taken as a joke. <br />
<br />
I'm not tyring to be mean, but logical. As an English Major and writer, if someone came up to me and said, &quot;Hey Jack! I want to be able to write like Tom Clancy, Orson Scott Card, Isaac Asimov, Robert Jordan, Stephen King and J.R.R. Tolkien; the best of all worlds!&quot; I would immediately label them daft, never take anything they said or wrote seriously again and would give them the 'Editor's Treatment' of reading the hook line and not wasting my time by going further. Any writer worth anything writes the way THEY write, not like some other writer. That makes you an unoriginal hack. That's why I detest people telling me I write like PKD, Jack O'Connell (sp?) or K.W. Jeter.<br />
<br />
Here's another example, in case the previous one didn't make sense to you: have you seen the insurance commercials where the Plumber is walking up the stairs as water is running down, tracking it into a flooded apartment with people floating around on the furniture? The Plumber says, &quot;Guess I'd better get to work&quot; or something to that effect and the renter retorts, &quot;Before you do can I get your price and the price of three of your leading competitors?&quot; You know that dumbfounded look the plumber gives the kid? That's exactly the way people are looking at you now because of that one post and the way it's being handled.<br />
<br />
Yes, Druids need a revamp.<br />
<br />
You are going about it the wrong way.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for those of you flaming Druids or the Druids flaming back: grow up. If you want to see who can come up with the better one-liner or wave the biggest dick, have someone pick up and wave Rush Limbaugh or Howard Stern or that screwed-in-the-head psychiatrict woman who had(has?) her own talkshow. Because right now you guys have gone from cute to 'Carrot Top Live In Las Vegas' annoying.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of positive on this board, and that's why I'm coming back every day to learn more and more about the Shaman class and that contributes more to my wanting to play mine to up 60 as a secondary 'Main'. I frequent the Paladin boards because I haven't seen a 'flame war' there in ages. I love the little class communities where people are sharing information, being informative/helpful and having fun. The Shaman community's relaxed and 'at home' feel comes from all you Shaman out there, you're real class acts. That said, is there any real reason to get so ugly over this?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>DohDoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">I think people are looking too deep into the issue. Take a step back, and look at the general roles of the three priest classes.<br />
Generally:<br />
<br />
 Cleric:<br />
   Offensive Power: Mediocre<br />
   Healing Power: Great<br />
<br />
 Shaman:<br />
   Offensive Power: Moderate<br />
   Healing Power: Moderate<br />
<br />
 Druid:<br />
   Offensive Power: Great<br />
   Healing Power: Mediocre<br />
<br />
 There are three basic archtypes to the healing class, each one balanced differently. You simply cannot expect to get another classes most treasured ability and call it even. <br />
<br />
 The odd thing is, druids do complain about their offensive capability anyway. Us shamans have our personal perks - We can solo juggs, we can solo a dragon once in a while. But very rarely does the issue of pure druid offensive capability come to the table in these quirky class wars. <br />
<br />
1. Druids at 60 do have the capability of kiting 15+ mobs at a time, using upheaval, and getting great exp. I've witnessed this one, as weird as it may sound. Tally one up for the druids. <br />
<br />
2. On a raid (non-ToV/DB) against a large scale mob, a druid can roughly rack in right below a wizard - doing around 50k against the THO for instance. No other non-wizard can do that type of damage in that amount of time. <br />
<br />
 I believe that druids are roughly where Verant would like them to be as far as their general archtype of spells shows. Every class has its bugs that need to be fixed, but posing a solution that treads on another classes speciality is just too risky. <br />

<br />
Anyone else see something wrong in alot of what they &quot;believe&quot;?<br />
<br />
One one hand you have Druids saying we need a raid defining ability, and eventually it breaks down to we want a better raid ability AND we want to be able to group better for exp.<br />
<br />
You have one school of folks saying:  &quot;My druid heals just fine in exp groups.   I can't do places like SSRAA temple, but alot of other camps are well within my means as a main healer&quot;<br />
<br />
And the other side is saying:  &quot;We can't keep up healing in exp groups.  Our groups are dying&quot; - Thats just so stupid I want to smack the person.<br />
<br />
I have news for those folks.  If you are in a place with a druid as the main healer and you are dying, LEAVE.  Its simple.  Chances are, places that are causing groupmembers to die with a druid as main healer, are going to cause one of my groups to go down as well.  I'm not lvl 60 (lvl 54, ignore sig), and without torpor the Healing per second that I can do is less than what a druid could do.  Its not the nice single pulls that wipeout groups, its the 4 adds and chain healing the chanter until you ar OOM, and 4 adds means no individual slowing.<br />
<br />
Factor in that alot of Shamans (like myself), don't have 200 wis because of HP/AC gear, and our mana pool, until we get some time to Canni back mana, is smaller than a druids.  <br />
<br />
It bothers me to have a class come across saying &quot;We're so useless&quot;, when kiting, farming, tracking, exping, and shooting up to 60 in record time is so easy.</div></div><hr />

In fact they generally tend to piss off anyone else in the same zone, thus making fame go down even more. <br />
<br />
The real issue is that people who play druids feel they deserve to be &quot;the hero&quot; and are upset that this is hardly ever the case.  <br />

You seriously need to check out the necro boards. A recent conversation there was 'we're gods from 1 to 59, it's not fair that we can't be the gods on raids too! Everyone who plays necros knows that they are the best class and the only one worth playing and would never play anything else, so necros should always be the best'. Unlike this druid conversation, everyone seemed to agree with him. I felt like trolling with 'shut up, sit down and take loot that others earn for you', but I just let it fly. It was scary cultist stuff, though. And unlike Homer Simpson, I don't want in. ;(<br />

I quoted, well, cross-posted, your post on the cleric boards at EQCleric. Gave you full credit. I just thought that others needed to see it. :) Hope you don't mind.</div></div><hr />

I believe this is a fair accessment.  The key problem is the number of HPs tanks can achieve vs the amount Shaman and Druid can heal.  If you give us a way to make a significant dent on a Raid Buffed tank, it unbalances Exp groupage.<br />

No, sir. I don't mind at all. Thank you for giving me credit. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>DohDoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Taladaen, Go back and read my post. My point in making that post is that druids spells are more offensively alligned than any other priest class and as a result, get lesser healing powers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">Funny. <br />
<br />
From the day I started Everquest.. being part cleric I always thought paladin should heal better than other priest class.<br />
<br />
Tell ya what. Remove or nerf some of these: TP, SoW, DS, Nuke, Dot, invis... and we'll talk about better heal, ok?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">DohDoh:   Yes, I get your point, but Shaman and Druids still need a healing increase.  This isn't first hand experience because I'm not an Oracle yet but the only way a Shaman is going to make a dent in a raid buffed tank is Torpor.  Shaman are asking for some type of upgrade because of the limitations Topor has.   Druids also are asking for some type of upgrade and I do think they should get it, only because they can't effectively do healing on the same tank.  Based on your comparison between the 3 priest classes, Druids should still lag behind Shaman in overall healing ability but it needs to be upgraded to make a significant difference.<br />
<br />
Once Shaman and Druids get that healing increase, however, it will still slant exp groups, and I think that's a bad thing (TM).  Wizards got Lure, Dragon and Giant spells for raids, how to give the secondary healers a limited use, raid-level heal?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">&quot;druids do complain about their offensive capability anyway&quot;<br />
<br />
I agree with that statement. I have a 51 druid and a 50 shaman. My druid is massively more efficient offensively in a solo situation. Root rot as a druid is mindlessly easy and always works especially now that root and snare stack. The drones of doom line is almost unresistable and stacks with the 50+ version of the spell. I spend 90% of the fight medding and actually end up with more mana/hp after the fight than my shaman does. <br />
<br />
In group situations its a total reversion. My shaman hardly ever casts any offensive damage spells. I debuff/slow and then backup heal. A 70% attack slow is greater than any damage I could contribute. My druid can back up heal and DD but so can anyone else. Snarers are common. DD/damage is easy to come by and damage shields lose their luster post 51. No one needs sow any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">&quot;massively more efficient offensively in a solo situation. &quot;<br />
<br />
You got your cookie, live with it.  I'm sorry but I just have a hard time feeling for you.  You cannot be &quot;massively more efficient&quot; solo _and_ be cried after when the group is missing you your entire life.  I'm sorry that this sounds like a flame but druid's have a lot of advantages, grouping in high level situations isn't one of them.<br />

&quot;I get your point, but Shaman and Druids still need a healing increase&quot;<br />
<br />
  I don't think the shamans necessarily would want another higher level heal. I agree that at pre-60, healing with a shaman is difficult - I remember vividly. <br />
  I think you are pointing out a different problem, not seeing the point I am trying to make. Your trying to say that shaman - as defined by my little chart - need a moderate level healing spell pre-60 to continue to be &quot;Moderate&quot; level healers. Good point though, a mini-torpor pre-60 would make us fit into the category better. <br />
<br />
 As far as the druids, I think the problem lies in people not knowing the class roles in the upper level end of the game. I've heard a newbie druid say, &quot;well my brother heals his group with his lvl35 druid, so we're good healers&quot;. Well end game sceniero... thats just not the case. And until people understand that, we'll continue to raise a generation of druids that grow into ignorance, and finally into &quot;whiney, complaining&quot; people. Who don't know their classes role, and just how powerful they really are.</div></div><hr />
