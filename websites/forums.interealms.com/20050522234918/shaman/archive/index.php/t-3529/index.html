<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Of course it had to be at the worst possible moment . . .<br />
I was naked and standing in the pot room waiting for my corpse to be dragged and rezzed in NTOV.  <br />
This robed erudite came running down into the place trailing this wurmy thing and he zoned out immediately.  Then I had aggro and got meleed some and hit for 500 dmg (AE i guess). <br />
My 1205 naked unbuffed hps didn't go so far, but I acted swiftly and clicked on Freeport pot.  Made it with 100 hps to spare woohoO!  <br />
<br />
Anyway, Fay is pretty nasty but survivable even if you are in a pretty bad way already when you meet him.  I don't see how I could have been any less prepared, but I lived anyway.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else have a great Fay escape story? <br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Last night after getting trained for the 3rd time in FG, i decided to head to Nurga to work on my Chardok faction... Popped into TD on top of the spires and my 55 necro died almost instantly.  Before the words &quot;W.T.F.&quot; had time to formulate fully in my mind, my shaman was down to half health &amp; my fresh aego and kei were stripped :(  I made it to the grob pot with 300hp to spare :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think one key is to bind right next to a safe pot, and that way you can turn and click on it very quickly. It still might not save you if Faydedar is chewing on your naked butt, but you have a much better chance than if you're not sitting in the middle of the room wondering which pot goes where when he jumps you. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Fay was up last night on Fennin too. Shame my lousy EST guild was all asleep. Still need VoB and Pox :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh, he looks more like bait than a sea monster doesn't he?  I always thought he should be bigger.  Kelorek Dar is the same graphic but appropriately dragon sized.  <br />
<br />
Unless the spawned one is bigger than the triggered one.  Never seen the real thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You have to wonder if this is a coincidence.  Few people have ever reported seeing regular Fay, now Verant puts a mob in the Firepot room warning us about binding there and several people get clobbered.<br />
<br />
Maybe he's going to spawn more often?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think it's a coincidence - remember that yesterday was a server reset meaning that the &quot;natural&quot; Fay popped randomly at some point yesterday on most servers.  I've encountered Fay once before, and some unfortunate soul acted as an elven speedbump while I escaped to the safety of Cabilis :)  If memory serves, that previous encounter was also not long after server downtime.<br />
<br />
People didn't run afoul of Fay much prior to TD being bindable again because there weren't many folks in Fay's path.  That changed &amp; so they added the new NPC there as a warning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Hrendra An'ei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My thoughts are that with the exponential increases of people being in the Firepot Room, they're doing this as a warning to people who aren't aware of the Faydedar spawn as an attempt to cut down on the number of people /bugging and /petitioning that some crazy, wacky dragon came and killed them and got them stuck in a death loop.<br />
<br />
From my understanding there's a triggered Fay spawn, but also a 1-6 day spawn in which he floats around TD for awhile before the Iksar Grandmaster engages him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aammon Aammonite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just wanted to compliment you on your sig pictures Hrendra, very nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Been caught by him once (lived), and helped people killed by him do CR three separate instances.  My only problem with random clicking is I'm almost universally hated in the port cities!  Usually I try to shoot for Halas or Cabalis, the two places where I know I won't be killed on port in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've survived Fay a couple of times with Eoin, both clothed and nekkid. Of course, when my monk was doing her shackle quests and hit the pots to get back to Cabilis, Fay ate her quickly. Had to call in the Shaman CR Team. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">was in a small fay raid once....everybody said to start healing the MA....<br />
<br />
when i say fay i thought to myself &quot;why am i healing a MA for some kinda of newbie worm?&quot;<br />
<br />
after the first AE i realized i should heal after the MA droped.:)<br />
<br />
i then proceeded to gate.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">When you bind, you return to your bind point facing the same way that you bound, so be sure to bind yourself while looking at the appopriate firepot -- then you won't have to turn to face it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When you gate, you appear at bind facing the same direction you were when you gated.<br />
<br />
When you die, you appear at bind facing north, same as when you appear in the game after camping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Indamus Mahendra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">on a side note fay is w/o a doubt in my mind the best source of hard spells<br />
<br />
guild has killed him twice<br />
<br />
1st time - malo x 2, lure of ice, some other good spells<br />
2nd time - pox, torpor, lure of ice, others<br />
<br />
its just sick :)</div></div><hr />
