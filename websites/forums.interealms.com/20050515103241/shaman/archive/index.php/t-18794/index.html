<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm going to post this here and on the Ranger's Glade. I've been approached by two companies, both of them offering me money and commission for having advertising on my sites.<br />
<br />
The advertising entails a link or sponsored by message at the top of each forum page (I don't think it's obtrusive at all,) and a banner on the static pages at http://interealms.com/ranger/ and http://interealms.com/shaman. No popups/popunders, no flash things or any of that.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't affect any other aspect of the site, no new admins, no new sign up procedures. I still have all rights and priveleges and still my own server.. this is simply an advertising offer. None of your registered emails will be accessible or anything like that.. simply advertising. I wouldn't have to have any more donation drives, no more groveling for money :)and I personally think it's an attractive offer.<br />
<br />
The money is enough to cover the cost of the site each month and enough to give me about 200 dollars a month in my pocket. So, I ask you seriously, what are your thoughts on this. This is a very serious thing to me, so please offer up any feedback/issues in a mature manner. I am not making a decision until I put it forth to the community and hear your feedback on the matter.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time!<br />

Question: Do they give you a trial period to see if the community minds it? <br />

Question 2: Are we allowed to know the nature of the advertisments before they appear?<br />

<br />
Yantis offered to buy this site outright and the Rangers, but no way I would do that. The guy at IGE seems a bit more straightforward and only wants advertising space.<br />
<br />
This is why I'm bringing it to you all, to get feedback. If there is that much of a problem or animosity with going with IGE, then I'll gladly drop the whole subject.<br />
<br />
It was just cool to think I might actually make some money on it ;) Thanks for the feedback thus far and now that you knwo the company involved, please let me know how badly it affects you.<br />

Also, for anyone with non EQ advertising options, I'd gladly entertain those offers as well.<br />

Thanks as always!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Isn't IGE another plat selling company? If so, I could never support them, in any way.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to read an interesting perspective of how plat sellers hurt the economy recently, this was posted by Mr. Bodie on my server board (in reference to the recent plat duping/shark farming):<br />
<br />
&quot;You guys don't seem to realize how big of a business this thing has become. There was a small team of hackers that got ahold of a packet hack, and were able to basically command line create platinum for two or three months. One of them was heard to brag that they had been paid over a million dollars, and that was like 30 to 60 days before it finally got fixed. Being in the position that he is, Yantis and IGE are the only ones that can really truly take advantage of such a huge influx of cash, but even we were able to make many thousands of dollars due to price fluctuations, and we didn't even have a hack or a macro.<br />
<br />
In a move I doubt most of you heard about, Sony banned hundreds, perhaps thousands of mule accounts belonging to Yantis and anyone who had provided him with platinum up to that point. That's why so much of the EQ seller community is so sorely pissed at him. All the people who were more the honest type platinum farmers got burned, and Yantis told them to **** off. Then he posted literally tens of thousands of auctions for platinum in an attempt to spam the rest of the community off of playerauctions. Once platinum sales started to die, he bought up all the gear. Pretty smart if you ask me. Only recently was this hack fixed, and hundreds more accounts banned. That was the incident you read about. At this point platinum is slowly starting to creep back up from as low as $40 per 100k on some servers.<br />
<br />
Yantis and IGE both have 50+ employees now, and they both keep their main headquarters in foreign countries to avoid taxes and high wages. They make it hard for someone who was giving it an honest crack at it, but we hardly blame them. I mean, my god, hardly anyone even knew that these guys had become multimillionaires from such an unlikely source?<br />
<br />
Make no mistake. Yantis is smart, and he is honest for the most part, but he doesn't give a flying **** about most people. I think his move to buy up the various communities is really clever. It has nothing to do with being able to control the posting, though god knows he can do a lot of damage control if someone was to try to spread the word about a hack or something. I also think these communities are only going to get bigger and bigger as they go along and assimilate more games that come out. They even may become viable businesses. Regardless, he now pays nothing to advertise on them. He pays Playerauctions over 10 grand a month alone for advertising on their site, so who can say how much he saves just to buy the sites outright, maybe consolidate them on his own server, etc.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Grendel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If you can find a way to add some adds to the sight that aren't popups and aren't too abtrusive (they are adds - I suppose they have to be at least noticable  :p ) I certainly don't see any problem with that. If it makes it easier for you to keep this FANTASTIC resource alive and under your control, then it's wonderful news. Even better if you make a little bonus money on top!<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd much rather it NOT be Yantis. But even that I certainly wouldn't begrudge, within the framework you laid out. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all you've done!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Yantis vs. IGE = lesser of two evils really.<br />
<br />
Advertising for any site that engages in activities that hurts the overall game and that a large population of the player base is against...not a good thing.<br />
<br />
This site generating revenue from advertising for sites, companies, or services other than the type listed above...not a problem. It's an honest way of generating some $$ that you deserve.<br />
<br />
Just an opinion. Your site, do with it what you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The way I figure it... if it's Yantis/IGE... I'll configure Mozilla to block it, just like the rest of those ads, or I'll just stop visiting site with those banners on them.  I realize there are costs involved in maintaining a web site (I've done it myself, with a web-based strategy game), but resorting to blatant violations of another piece of software's terms of use to do so, to me, is ethically wrong and I REFUSE to support anything of the sort, even remotely.<br />
<br />
If there's &quot;nowhere else to go&quot;, I simply block the ads entirely (AdBlock for Mozilla is a great plugin). If there is, or no reason to stay, I don't bother returning.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I am against it. I hate advertising I get enough already. One of the reasons I like this site so much is no adverts. And saying it's unobtrusive is a slippery slope. It may start that way but once they have a foot in the door it never ends there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Thank you everyone for the feedback thus far. I'm definitely leaning towards not doing it due to all of the feedback, I jsut hope the donation drives can continue to sustain us.<br />
<br />
It REALLY sucks having to ask for money all of the time. I hate doing it.. it makes me feel pretty crappy to do so. But it is a necessary evil. Bandiwdth and a server don't come for free and I certainly can't/won't shell out the money each month to keep these sites alive. I love doing this, but not at the expense of my own wallet :)<br />
<br />
It wouldn't be that bad if the donation drives were doing better. However, each drive it gets harder to ask, fewer people donate and it takes longer to get to the goal. I can't blame anyone, hell, there are a few people who make very big donations everytime and ask to remain anonymous.<br />
<br />
It's just a tough situation and I really dislike being in the situation of having to ask for money. I'm still all ears if someone has some non EQ related advertising they can throw my way ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Normal image ad's... no flash, no popups, no tricky javascript stuff... come on everyone, they don't hurt at all.    I've been lurking and rarely posting on this site since I first thought shamans were cool... a few ad's on the pages doesn't change a thing.     While some of us have donated (honestly, I have not) to keep the site running, Sunmoon has to keep asking for it and/or running out of his own pocket.<br />
<br />
The key is non-obtrustive ad's.   And damn there are a lot of bad ad sites out there... ad's that interrupt me from seeing what I want to see.   But just a plain simple image at the top of the page?  Come on everyone, what do you really care?    It won't affect anything except put a bit of pocket money (and not rich by any means) into Sun's pockets, and make sure the site is looked after.<br />
<br />
As for who the advertiser is?   Really... what do we care.   If everyone here is against plat sellers... you simply won't buy the plat... let Yantis go ahead and spend his money to keep the Glade and Crucible alive... if no one buys his plat, it's his money he's spending.<br />
<br />
Random &quot;normal&quot; advertisers probably aren't too interested in a specific EQ class theme board... maybe they should be, but I don't see many. <br />
<br />
In the end do what's best for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I can understand why people are against buying plat and whatnot, but I guess I'm kind of a pragmatist...  Those that want to buy plat will buy plat regardless of if there's a banner on the top of this site, and having said banner on this site will make it free for us and will reward Sunmoon for all of the work that goes into running it (and hopefully he'll occasionally buy the mods a beer or something, too ;)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Gah... I knew it was just a matter of time before Yantis came sniffing around here.  :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Lets be honest here, you should just sell the entire site.  The simple fact that you even brought up the topic means you dont care any more.</div></div><hr />

I'd say it's just the opposite...  If he didn't care, he would've just sold it without asking.  As it is, he's asking for the community's opinions on not even selling it, but for just putting up some ads.  /shrug  I don't think the ads are a big deal personally, but if they're voted down, I'll gladly keep donating when that time comes around again.</div></div><hr />

You MORE THAN deserve a little money for doing this.  I am not a big fan of Yantis, but, really, it is absurd to deny yourself a well-deserved reward for the years and years of hard work you have put into the community just because a few puritans would be offended.  People who are selfish enough to deny you a little reward for all you have done can go make their own board and ban ads there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Whether or not we have a banner up top for any type of plat selling site I will still continue to use the Crucible. We're a great community, and as Glori's post tells us, we aren't going to really hurt Yantis but not putting up a banner, seeing as how they're already very wealthy. I'm not farmiliar with IGE, are they as &quot;out-spoken&quot; about their plat selling as Yantis is?<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think this should be a decision where those who have donated in the past get the deciding vote. No, I haven't ever donated, so I'm not trying to hoard any sort of power. They're the ones who have kept The Crucible running in the past, and I feel their opinions should be the most respected ones.<br />
<br />
I think all this ranting and raving about Yantis that goes on across the boards actually gets him MORE business anyway, not the banners. If someone makes that big of a ruckus among the playerbase it would be a clear sign to any Ebayer that he'll do the job right, or whatever. I still think he's a prick, but the more everyone talks about him the more his name is spread...if there actually ARE people in EQ who aren't farmiliar with him already.<br />
<br />
I know one board has his name edited, so it comes out bleeped like any other &quot;bad&quot; word. It kinda works out, since Yantis and sh*t are pretty much the same thing. Er, excuse me: Since ****** and **** are pretty much the same thing :rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />

That's got to be worth something, folks. It is in my book. IMO, advertising never bothered me. I hate it, so I simply ignore it. Advertisers don't get real far with me. I'd REALLY like to see you get some offers from companies that don't sell plat and items ... that sort of thing rubs me the wrong way. But if those are the only people making offers ... hell, take them up on it. You bust your ass to keep this site (and the Ranger site) up and running, you more than deserve a measly $200 per month for your effort. If I have to put up with a dinky ad at the top of the screen in order to have access to this site, the information on it, and the folks here ... meh, I can do that. If this site is ever sold to Yantis ... let me know about a week before the sale goes down ... it'll be /copy-paste good_threads_and_info, and buh-bye.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I understand the vehement hate for yantis.  I really do.  But some other people have said it correctly, he gets more advertisement on this board from people complaining about him than any little banner add will accomplish.<br />
<br />
If someone is dead set on buying plat, they are going to, and finding yantis online is pretty easy even for the most retarded of web surfers.  Banner add isn't going to change that.  If people are considering buying plat from Yantis and are not sure, I honestly think the little add at the top is not going to be the straw that breaks the camels back.  In fact, I am willing to bet that seeing the banner go up will cause about 40 &quot;yantis ruined the world by doing x and y&quot; threads and will help deter more of the fence sitters than the add will attract.<br />
<br />
Regardless, Sun has asked the community when it is his hard work and his time that has made this board.  Other people belly upped and SOLD their entire site to Yantis without mentioning a word (was really shocked to see EQdruids take that route.  The board leader there was a really good guy, but I guess it was getting too costly to run).  Sun is actually asking our permission to make a little money off his site and ensure the site's longevity.<br />
<br />
I have never had more respect for a board moderator as I do for you now man.<br />
<br />
I personally think (though I have not yet donated, a problem I plan to remedy come my next paycheck) If taking a banner add from Yantis and his ilk gives the moderators enough time to post even one more informative thread instead of spending that time asking for money (a painful and thankless job) then it is of more benefit than harm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Anything that makes this board less effort for you, that makes it take less of your time and resources... well, that makes it more likely you'll be willing to continue to keep the Crucible up and running.<br />

Absolutely rediculous. If you you think the economy was screwed up by plat dupers, then you must take a stand against this. Selling plat for money only has a negative effect on the game, there's no other way to look at it.<br />

If ads from IGE, or any other plat selling site, start showing up here, I for one would be gone. I refuse to support any site affiliated with them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">&quot;Yes, he's the number one plat seller in EQ. What it looks like he's doing is this: buy up EQ class sites. Use ads on those sites to drum up more business, to pay for more takeovers. In addition, take anything written on &quot;his&quot; sites and use it in play guides, which he also sells. Since he controls the sites, he can easily delete the information when he's ready to sell the guide. In that way his business can be slowly transitioned away from shady, high-risk plat sales to steady, no-risk information sales, with all the actual work being done by the posters and contributors to his web sites.&quot;<br />

<br />
This boils down to a moral dilemna for you.  It is a decision for you to make as the owner of course.  I wouldn't say anything at all, but you asked for our input so I'll open my big bear mouth.  :D  IF you accept a buy-out or advertisement deal, will you be proud of yourself when speaking to someone of your actions to someone 'in-the know' (EQ savvy) after the fact?  I personally would not, though I know many who would jump at the offer without a second thought.  That's my ethics litmus test.  If I explained the whole deal (what the advertiser represents, not just the profit margin) to my parents, would I be proud or just a wee bit ashamed of myself?  The latter would be true for me.<br />
<br />
Condoning the buying/selling of platinum and items for Everquest by allowing banner ads promoting that service (in direct violation of Sony's EULA) on this site for personal profit strikes me as mercenary &amp; insensitive to the bulk of the EQ playerbase.<br />
But it is your call.  If you limit it to a non-flashy banner ad, I would probably still visit but be very disapointed.  An extra $200.00 a month for essentially very little work/time is a very attractive offer.  That's half a car payment, would pay for a week of childcare, etc.<br />
<br />
Where you draw the line in the sand for the end of your personal morals and the beginning of your financial advantage is a different point for different people.  You have poured your time and energy into this site and the Ranger's Glade for a very long time, with very little personal renumeration.  You have taken tons of flak, protected us from hackers &amp; been a very modest &amp; benevolent board owner, putting up with tons more crap than 99% of the posters probably ever realize.<br />
<br />
I know this isn't an easy decision for you.  This is going to sound trite, but I recommend you rent the movie &quot;Its a Wonderful Life&quot;.  Up until this time you have in my book always been one of the few &quot;George Baileys&quot; of Everquest.  <br />

That being said, though, I wouldn't like having their banner on my site.  They'd have to pay me well in order for me to feel good about doing it.  From what you said, though, it sounds like they are paying you extremely well :)  If they are giving you enough money to run the site for free and have an extra $200 a month, I would sure as hell go for it.  <br />

Ok a lil hippy flash back, but you get the point.<br />

One small banner ad at the top is a small price to pay for such a great site.  If you use the Crucible and object to it, just don't click on it.  Ignore it, is it really that hard?  As has been said, if someone is going to buy plat online, not having the ad here isn't going to stop them.  <br />

From a business sense I have to admire their strategy and tenacity and their initiative to open the market to what it is today.<br />
<br />
Many of the other message boards that I frequent have banner adds as a part of the presentation.  I 'might' be able to name the company that supports them, but probably not.  The adds dont make that much of an impact on me.  If you want to generate the money needed for the upkeep of the site by adding a banner add that I'll not notice or pay attention to, go for it with my blessing and support.  <br />

As long as it is as described in the first post (Banner only on the main interealms/shaman page, no pop ups) then you have my support.

<br />
Frankly, if it takes the load off your mind as far as financially maintaining the site(s) then I figure go ahead.  Most of us here have the will power to ignore an add... hmm, unless they get all cunning and it has hypnotic flashy things that draw the eye until you're mindlessly clicking BUY BUY BUY and entering credit card details... ack!  I've scared myself now.<br />
<br />
This isn't a 'do I support Yantis/IGE' question, it's about relieving some stress off yourself with respect to maintaining these sites.  That's how you should look at it.  Asking for our thoughts just shows how much you do care about it still.  I say go ahead and do - if people can't help themselves from suddenly buying plat because they saw an add, I shudder to think what their credit card bills look like.</div></div><hr />

I bet that if the products being advertized were really important violations to SoE that they would have been shut-down by Sony's HUGE team of lawyers ages ago. This makes me think SoE doesnt care much about it - maybe they even see it as beneficial in some ways. An EULA is still only a general means to give companies an option to deny service or prosecute certain people if they violate the EULA. Companies dont have to do anything about violations if they dont want or care.<br />
<br />
And people saying they wont visit here anymore if you start using IGE or Yantis ads kinda confuses me. Do you people also refrain from buying newspapers with ads for tobacco or watching TV channels with ads for alcohol? Because those 2 things - while certainly legal - ruin the lives of lots and lots of people every year.<br />

Heck, google for everquest and the first thing you see is an add for Yantis. If Sony doesn't care enough to do anything about them, it isn't your job to police it. <br />
<br />
If we were talking about Yantis, I'd be up in arms against it. I don't like the way he buys up web sites, sucks em dry and uses that money to buy up other sites. ... but we aren't talking about Yantis. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, if you can look yourself in the mirror in the morning, that's all that matters. Go for it if you don't want the hassles of having to ask for money continously to support the two sites. I'd rather have a crucible with adds than no crucible at all.</div></div><hr />

I have donated to the Crucible in the past (albeit a very small amount), and I can definitely say I wouldn't donate again if the site was supporting cheaters. However I wouldn't need to, presumably.<br />
<br />
How about a pragmatic solution, like Sunmoon takes the ads (he has put in a lot of work over the years and I think we all agree he deserves something for it) but puts a disclaimer above the banner saying something like &quot;We do not condone any services that violate the EQ EULA&quot;. I'm sure I saw another site that had taken this approach recently, it might have been EQ Traders, although I'm not certain. On the other hand this could be seen as a cheap attempt to disown responsibility while still taking the cash.<br />

<br />
 He has said it would be a simple banner ad - no popups (my browser blocks popups anyway)<br />
 They are not buying 'The Shaman's Crucible', but are renting a 150x75 (just guessing) spot on a page that we will all probably ignore.<br />
 As some folks like to throw in the face of people asking for questions... Search would be able to find information on buying accounts/plat just as easily as a banner ad.  Everyone who flames Yantis and the other plat sites already are aiding them in getting new customers.<br />
 Everyone who states they will go elsewhere if the ads show up, ask yourself if you donated during the last drive.  I did not.  I'm lazy.  I have no problem with the ads.<br />
 <br />
<br />
In no way should Sunmoon have to pay for this site out of pocket.  Allakhazam's went premium, Magelo auto-synch is premium, and I think a couple more are, as well.  Would that be better?  How many people out there use Caster's Realm to look up spell lists?  They have IGE ads.  The same goes for EQGUI (as someone has already posted).<br />
<br />
Here are some other sites that you may or may not go to that have either Yantis or IPE ads or other &quot;morally questionable&quot; ads:<br />
EQ Stratics<br />
EQLinks - ad for a macro program<br />
EQ'Lizer<br />
PlanetEQ - ad for PowerGuides who now sells plat<br />
EQPrices<br />
<br />
Are there alternatives?  Sure.  Crucible could go partial ads.  You get ads if you don't have a subscription.  Different ad providers.  Google ads (someone mentioned above) don't pay unless there are over 20 million page views per month.  I don't know what the pages views are (or if it could be added up across both sites).  There are also the &quot;contextual&quot; ads you can do with Google, but they look like they only pay when someone clicks on the links (aka see Crucible and Amazon ads on MobHunter).  EQAtlas has banner ads via Value Click (www.valueclick.com).  Of course, they do not post what they pay, but the ads on EQAtlas don't appear to display any &quot;morally questionable&quot; ads.</div></div><hr />

That said, I think majority of us aren't questioning Sunmoon's integrity. I question the integrity of his potential sponsors. As someone else said, plat sellers and dupers work together hand in hand. They've ruined EQ's economy with their plat duping hacks and turned it into a business where they make millions of dollars at the expense of the players. To affiliate with these companies, in my opinion, is 100% unacceptable. I said it earlier in this thread, I'm okay with advertising. Banner ads are fine, supporting plat dupers, cheaters, and hackers is not. I make a point to avoid any EQ websites that run ads by Yantis, IGE, or PlayerAuctions.<br />
<br />
To those who would stay after something like this, I'll say this again, you can never speak out against cheaters, hackers, or plat dupers and hope to have any sort of credibility.<br />

Sunmoon has made his decision on the advertising issue.</div></div><hr />

I've been on this site since the days of Mung too.  Does that matter?  Maybe, maybe not.  Organ measuring aside, I agree that most are not questioning his integrity, but you seem to have missed a large portion of my point.  Donations are just barely there.  What happens when they no longer cover?  Who is to blame for that?  Should Sunmoon make up the difference?  Absolutely not.  If his back is against the wall, I say do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Go for it. Anything to make your life easier and if you can actually make a few bucks for the years you have selflessly run these boards, then thats a great thing!<br />
<br />
edit:  thats what i get for not skipping to the end and reading the last few posts.  ignore me &gt; )</div></div><hr />

Hey sunmoon,<br />
<br />
instead of accepting advertising from places like yantis, IGE, et al.  why not do us this:<br />
<br />
Instead of doing say 4 donation drives in one year, how about you come up with your cost for a years worth of bandwith, server maintenance costs, beer fund etc... On the next donation drive state that you are trying to get it all for one year, set up a paypal account or something silly like that and we can better budget for one huge donation instead of 4 small ones.<br />
<br />
Just my thought, I'd be more than happy to do one large donation because my income fluctuates so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">I just wish some software selling company or Sony themselves would have bought the advertising. Heck, even porno ads would have been better then a plat selling company.<br />
<br />
I understand &quot;WHY&quot; it was done, everyone needs to get paid for their work. Donation drives suck, I can understand why anyone wouldn't want to have to rely on that.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER....<br />
<br />
Sony wont post here now or read this site.<br />
This community in sony's eyes is now tainted and the advertisements is against their rules.<br />
<br />
It's my opinion that something could have been done besides this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">All you have to do is remind us that if we don't pay up on the next drive, we get ads from Yantis. The cash will flow. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Advertise away.  Banner adds are fine with me.  I absolutely loath popups/popunders/popovers/etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks for maintaining the site!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Go for it, My web browser automatically removes ad's anyways using a filter. I'll never know the difference. :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">That is my opinion. Honestly, I will never see the ads anyway, since I use ad blocking software either in my firewall or as a separate executable on any computer that I spend significant tmie in front of.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">The problem is not just obtaining the funds to keep the site going.  Sunmoon indicated in one of his posts his dislike of having to ask for donations.  Fund-raising is a major pain, and one that never goes away.  Perhaps those who feel so vehemently about advertising would be willing to take on the fund-raising activities for Sunmoon.  It's all very well to point a finger and offer an opinion from high moral ground, but if you really feel that strongly about kind of advertisers featured on this site, back up those feelings with some action.  Donations are good, but they are transient.  Nothing says &quot;commitment&quot; like volunteering to take on an onerous task; fund-raising is about as unpleasant a task as I can imagine.  If you want to show your dedication to your values, don't just sit on your duffs and press the Paypal button to contribute $10 to the site.  Do some work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Galnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Actually, sony is lessening up on that don't visit boards with plat sellers links on them, heck monkly business even has a couple people there visiting quite often, now that absor is gone from that part at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">All I know is that i won't support a site that aligns itself with someone that is bad for EQ. I understand when money gets involved peoples greed really shows but anyone that can say that a company selling items/PP isn't hurting the game or you directly is just fooling themselves. Sorry to say but I've been a visitor here since it started and I am now deleting my link. Guess no info is better than supporting these tyoes of organizations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Real content is the only thing of real value on the internet and the Crucible certainly has lots and lots of content. I think it is entirely appropiate that Sunmoon gets at least a small payment for providing all this content.<br />
<br />
If people feel so strongly against ads then I suggest an annual/quarterly/monthly payment of XX$ to be able to access the board or maybe just to be able to post. I already pay for premium access to Allakhazam and think thats a very good deal. I dislike donation drives because they are too &quot;fluffy&quot;.<br />
<br />
Maybe required payment could weed out some of the more annoying people too.<br />
<br />
PS. Have you nay-sayers considered that if Yantis is paying to advertise here and none of us buys anything from him then we could actually be helping putting a stop to his business? :)</div></div><hr />
