<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what classes seem to be the most in-demand at higher levels? (63+) Clerics and Shaman I know are, have both of those, but was interested in making something that would be desirable to higher end guilds besides what I already have.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Enchanter and Bard id say , bolth have mana regen abilities , bolth have charms and mezzes and bard and stack AoE resists with each other i believe. You can never have enough of either of those classes on a raid if you ask me plus you just dont see alot of bards so they are usualy welcome in any XP group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bards and ranged dmg dealers (wiz,rng,mage) for my guild at least.</div></div><hr />

Wizard !! best type of dps class for raid, more is better and never too much, most guild set higher quota for wizard and cleric and warrior; shaman/knight/bard maybe lease desirable after number filled up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i agree with wizards, high end wizards are amazing for raids and you can never have enough as nukes stacks.<br />
<br />
guilds need few shaman. one to slow etc . i left a guild were i was the number 6 shaman (IT WAS BORING AS HELL. i had nothing to do). the other five shamies were all level 65 and only 2 of them actually buffed etc. the rest of us shamies were wizard gimps and just nuked durring raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ranger damage is also insane once the get AM3. but that requires a lot of aa points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">p.s. clerics and chanters, without a doubt, are the most in-demand classes at higher levels.  i disagree with there being a shaman shortage , especially since PoP came out. on my server you can't run anywhere without triping over a shaman over level 61.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Chanters can always be useful, but I'd have to say Bards and Clerics. You can survive without an enchanter on a raid, but no clerics, and your pretty much goin no where. Bards seem to taper off towards the higher levels, and the numbers decline from Carpal Tunnel.<br />

<br />
Clerics: you never have too many ! stacks 100%<br />
Wizards : stack 100%, the more the better !<br />
<br />
Ranger: i dont agree on ranger DPS. On certains condition, you cant use a bow (you wall the mob, or not enough space to use a bow), so they arent that great. Not saying they are useless far from it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm surprised no one mentioned BLs.  Beastlords have some nice mana regen buffs, and most guilds have at most one or two.  BLs are usually desired.<br />
<br />
Clerics--well, duh.  You always need clerics.<br />
<br />
Wizards--good on raids, but few people seem to want to group them.  Prepare to solo a lot.<br />
<br />
Chanters--well, lots of em out there.  Anyone can make a chanter, but playing a chanter well is a different question.  It's really not that easy a class to play well.  I have had chanters I just told to nuke and KEI.  I am better at crowd control than a lot of em. :/<br />
<br />
Rangers--rangers have a lot of really nice abilities, but most require a lot of AA.  One you get a high AA ranger, he's a NICE addition.  Bows can do major damage (if ranged attacks are an option for the mob in question as pinning mobs on walls can block arrows).  Though it almost always requires a suicide by the ranger, weaponshied is vital to helping pull and position mobs properly (level 60 ability).  I LOVE having rangers that can do it.<br />
<br />
Bards--there are never enough high level bards.  Resists, mana song, AC and damage shields on the MT (for certain really uber mobs).  A lot of raids are just not possible without a high level bard, and there aren't that many of em.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">BL's are an interesting class. i duo with one all the time and they are great to have around. BL's can pull with there 30 or 50 percent slow, which makes landing turgurs so easy. i see so many low level BL's and so few high-end BL's. the high-end BL's pets i have logged on eqcompanion are absolute monsters! they bring the pain, and tank nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i agree, not many high end bards out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bards are always good.  But really if you play a lot any class can almost get used imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>harowen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Almost every guild site I've seen on my server or off server has Bard - High, those that aren't High have it at Medium.  Most of these guilds have BST at Low or (more usually) None.  <br />
<br />
I would have to agree that high level bards are the rarest class out there and have the highest demand for most guilds that are raiding constantly.  They will normally already have a large number of clerics already but you can never have too many clerics, so those are always decently placed on the demand curve too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, let me rephrase.. <br />
<br />
something that would be desirable to higher end guilds besides what I already have. <br />
What is a higher end guild now? A AoW capable guild? EP farming guild? <br />
If it is the second I would say that rangers make difference. Bards are ofcourse important also. Wizards, well yes. Their dps is great ( but they tend to afk to much without anyone notice ;)  ).<br />
bst, 2 would be enough imo. They have 2 very good buffs that is great. They do good dmg and all, but in a raid situation they are not a vital class (still my opinion). Clerics: Well, this class is always important for success but guilds who are already breaked into e-planes have probably atleast more than 10 clerics already who plays alot. But I would still want more rangers, to wall a mob or not, rangers can melee good too. I have yet seen a walled mob in eplanes that cannot be prevented.<br />
<br />
As I said, this differs from guild to guild. On AB shammies were most desirable a couple of months ago. Now there are other classes.</div></div><hr />
