<br />
Kromzek Captain is listed as disease slowable so wondering if with the PoP 40% slow this is going to be a possible fight as a shaman/mnk duo - we are both 62 and reasonably equipped.  <br />
<br />
Does the slow land fairly easily after insidious decay? Any thoughts/experiences are appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah was tough to slow with POI at 60. But with levels and whatnot, who knows, give it a shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
pull him slowed to the tank ... should be doable. But will be a very long fight .. he has some HPs.<br />
<br />
Edit: Slow with Grummus of course :-)<br />

So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have done Cappy about 5 times. Only once did I ever land a Turgurs on him after malo, so don't count on turgurs. When I was level 61 with grummus I didn't have much problem landing it on him. I was resisted about 50% I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ohh I remember the day when the Kromzek Captain was considered a &quot; touugh &quot; encounter and young guilds and their respective Shaman rued trying to slow him.<br />
<br />
Yes he is duoable, he has about 55k health. We're doing him unslowed in our 'guild' (10 toons - 6 people), with 8 or so - 57 Ogre Warrior, 61 Monk, 53 Cleric, 58 Cleric, 58 Shammy (* THINK * he got disease slow to land), 57 Druid.<br />
<br />
WITH the new 3k heal and WITH a disease slow, I think a well equipped Monk (that would be NOT me) can solo him. I think you would need Torpor, Can V because even 40% slowed Captain can put out some damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aragos Innoruuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I tried him last week or so.  Debuffed his disease resist and blew my whole wad trying to grummus him without success.   Ended up failing the attempt because 2 velium hounds were hitting me and they were below the world so I couldn't land spells on em. <br />
<br />
We would have won even unslowed if not for them hounds attacking us from under the world.  <br />

   What new 3k heal ?? It have been removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">did you have the new disease debuff?<br />
<br />
with the new disease debuff my luck has greatly increased.  Landed both slows, first time I did not have grummus yet... on the first cast.<br />
<br />
There is no 3k heal for shaman - we have Kraggs Mending and that's it.</div></div><hr />
