<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">On the advice of a more senior shaman, Veranon if memory serves I decided not to bother with the Reebos line of spells until I had my first piece of Spectors armour and all three slots filled.<br />
<br />
But then in 2-3 adventures after all was complete we checked chests to find blue fog, to be honest I've not come accross any other kind.<br />
<br />
So I bit the bullet for the sake of the group and gated, got the spells, zoned in coh'ed across and copen a chest.<br />
<br />
It was full of coins, I gt excited.<br />
<br />
I looted it, 2 Immaculate crowns and 10pp<br />
<br />
Whoopty ****ing Whoo! We got ripped, 180 points for three spells for 10pp I was pissed.<br />
<br />
I knew this was a gimmick but I didnt realise it was this crap, I'd be better off killing the rest of the mobs in the dungeon and be able to get aa and more loot than this, maybe even aug's.<br />
<br />
Praise be to Veranon, next time I'll write his advice on my monitor in black permanent marker so ensure I dont change my mind in the heat of the moment.:P<br />
<br />
What have you looted from chests? Anything better than a warm fart and a day old twinkie?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scrav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The best I have seen is the equivalent of a Type 1 augmentation dropped form regular mobs, this is in about 20 to 25 chests.  Most of the time it has been trash loot.<br />
<br />
I have heard someone &quot;claim&quot; to have received a All Type Vengeance 2 augmentation from a chest in a normal dungeon, but I seriously doubt it myself.<br />
<br />
As I said in another forum, I would rather see chests set up this way:<br />
<br />
Item loot moved from nameds to chests, with named loot replaced with Type 1 augmentation drops.<br />
<br />
Common chest loot: Trash loot, like was mentioned in the first post.<br />
Uncommon chest loot: An item a named would usually carry.<br />
Very Rare loot: A type 2 or Type 3 augmentation (different to what the merchants have)<br />
<br />
At least that way I would get excited about seeing a chest.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The last 4 chests I've opened have had money items in them.<br />
I think they were Blue Diamond, Diamond, Black Sapphire, and some other money item you routinely find on mobs.<br />
My points have been nearly evenly among all the camps, so I'll probably have about 8000 points minimum banked before I have the 1492 cap at each camp.<br />
Spending 180 points now is a drop in the bucket compared to that.<br />
Spending 180 points is barely anything when you are looking at spending about 5000 points for a single item with all it's augments.<br />
Spending 180 points has netted about 1500pp in gems and coin in the 20 or so adventures I've done so far.<br />
No regrets at all in getting the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, just IN CASE you ever find  a chest with something nice, you should get the PICK LOCK spell, and ONLY that one.<br />
<br />
<br />
  The sense traps is only so that your disarm traps will work.   The disarm traps is just to avoid getting hit by a trap.<br />
<br />
  Blood of Nadox and RGC are to cure every effect a trap can toss at us except drunkeness.<br />
<br />
  Just pop the top and cure the trap afterward.  Screw disarming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So far I have gotten a blue diamond from one chest, and 11pp from another.  Yay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The very first chest a rogue popped open on my first adventure contained a Regen II chest item, since then all I have gotten is diamonds and crap though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scrav</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The very first chest a rogue popped open on my first adventure contained a Regen II chest item, since then all I have gotten is diamonds and crap though. <br />
<br />
Hmm... maybe there is some truth to that Vengeance 2 augmentation then.  What Type was the regen 2 augment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Last night we got some nice experience from a chest, but I've never seen any items other than trash loot worth no more than 11p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally I got a +Hp augment from a barrel in MM and have seen other simular type augments in chest. Haven't seen any items yet but at 180 points it really isn't much especially if you spread your adventuring around any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Guildie of mine also had an all slot regen 2 drop for his group in a normal adventure. We probably haven't started to see the possible drops in objects yet. My guess is this will be one of the few sources of type 1 augments for existing gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
I got the 3 spells in question but I think there's still something I'm not getting. Every time I've tried to use these spells on anything I just get a &quot;This spell can only be cast on Cursed objects&quot; and the spell doesn't cast ... Having Detect curse give you this message is particularly entertaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ssti, allways use /inspect on the chest first, if there is 'blue fog' in the text its one for a shaman...or duid I believe.<br />
<br />
There is a LDON spoiler in the medicine chest that has a very helpfull blurb on chests.</div></div><hr />
