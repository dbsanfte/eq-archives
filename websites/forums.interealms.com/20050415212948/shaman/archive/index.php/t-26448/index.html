<br />
I can confirm 100% that the re-cast time of Spirit of the Panther and Spirit of the Leopard spells have been increased to 30 seconds.  <br />
<br />
No more testing for me, it's not fun to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is absurd.  It had better not stay that way.<br />
<br />
The spell was ONLY useful because I could cast it when I had time, or when it was needed.  If it has any recast time at all, that seriously negates its ability to deal damage, A) when you need it, and B) when you have the time to cast it.<br />
<br />
Since we don't haste a raid... is it really that overpowering to let us provide dps via this already annoyingly high mana, high maintenance spell?<br />
<br />
How much dps do Enchanters add to an entire raid with 70% haste for over an hour?<br />
<br />
God damnit, this... ahh.  I can't even type.<br />
<br />
So... each shaman in a raid can put panther on 3 people?  Thats actually ok.  300dps. fine.  whatever.  Let enc's almost double a raids dps with their haste.  I don't care.  (Well I do...but..)<br />
<br />
If they want to limit us to 300 dps, just give us a dot that does 300 dps, with a resist check and a recast exactly the same as panther or something.  Why tie our dps to yet another rotation?<br />
<br />
Grouping... you mean I have to do a fargin rotation on a spell thats ~ 1:30 duration?, that if I break that rotation do to heals or emergencies, that it seriously screws the dps of the cycle?  That I can't cast this on mob inc if it happens to be greyed out? <br />
<br />
These moves to take decision making, reacting to the environment, out of the hands of the shaman, and instead put them into the hands of artificial rotations/timers, is what will drive me from this game.</div></div><hr />

So with this nerf what does this mean now?<br />
<br />
Where's the list of folks that will no longer &quot;seem to like these new spells&quot;?  I'll sign.  Being able to cast when there's time to is what made them better than dots.  Made the new spells able to replace dots.  Having to load this along with 3 other spells in order to keep damage up makes them awful.  Someone spotted the big problem already, shaman make a career out of dealing with chain crises.  Missing one cast on the spell in it's new mode will straight-up cost us like 10k damage and throw us right back on our old damage modes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Incredible to put this on test just 12 hours before patch time.<br />
<br />
Almost as incredible for them to talk about how the proc rate on pets is too high, have shamans debate whether that is correct or not, and find that there is some kind of broad perspective that says &quot;Yah maybe the proc rate on pets needs to be reduced to match the proc rate on players&quot; -- and then for SOE to suppose that the way to fix the problem with pet proccing code is to put in a 30 second refresh delay.<br />
<br />
And also pretty bizarre is for anyone at SOE to think that adding another buff timer could add to the playability of the game, after it has become so clear that Ferine Avatar -- supposedly one of the most powerful spells in the game -- is hardly cast anymore, because maintaining an exacting rotation on that buff timer is so incredibly annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Wow...just wow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Very disappointing.<br />
Someone must have pointed out that adjusting everyone's pets to fix a bug, then adjusting every pet proc spell accordingly would have involved actual work.  Much easier to simply nerf 1 spell.<br />

<br />
And when you're done nerfing us, please get around to fixing those pesky elemental zones that keep crashing during raids.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I was always amazed that after we cried about FA duration and how we hated it (well, most of us) they would give us a 1.5 duration buff. I always thought it was a big middle finger pointed right at us. (Cry about a 10 minute buff, how about THIS). <br />
<br />
It was leopard's lack of a recast which made the short duration not a terrible hardship.<br />
<br />
With the recast and the fact it will be impossible to maintain on multiple players, I doubt I will ever mem it. I'd much rather spend the mana/spell slot on a nuke or dot I can control!</div></div><hr />

<br />
personally, I've been pretty vocal about always looking at the positives in every situation.. but honestly.. I just retired this spell to the back of my spellbook.  No way am I going to mem another FA type spell where I have to sit there and time casting it on people.  The added dps from it now no longer even makes it reliable to cast over top of our dots/dds, when I was easily able to do 300 - 400 dps depending on the fight before this change.  /mourns the retirement of panther</div></div><hr />

I have said it over and over, WoW, EQ for dummies, DAoC, CoH, Vanguard, etc will never kill EQ. EQ will kill EQ. Slow suicide.

<br />
Relative to pets procing too much, the fix there was to limit how much pets proc.<br />
<br />
I agree with the sentiment of this thread.  Previously, with a crap tank, I could not add more than one dot after slowing without pulling aggro and basically stood around at near full mana.<br />
<br />
Pre-leopard, with a strong tank. I could load up 3 or more dots and use my mana effectively.  With FAing melees/pets, doting and spot heals in a strong group I was continually pushing buttons to make more mana and could use it.<br />
<br />
Leopard allowed me to contribute dps to the group even when the tank could not hold aggro well.  I found myself watching for the canni button refresh and immediately pushing it. I was exhausted at the end of a session, feeling like I had really contributed, like I used to feel in distant times.  <br />
<br />
I like leopard.  Dial down the dps a pet generates, but dont destroy this spell with a 30sec recast timer.  That will add to my frustration.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Well, most people didnt have the mana to sustain the spell on more than one target for very long anyhow, so I doubt the change will have much impact on most uses. Even with the changes you can still keep it running on 2-3 targets, if you can sustain the mana output (I suspect that the vast majority of shaman cant). Thats fine for groups, and on raids against anything other than trivial targets, the chances are that shaman need to keep their mana for healing their groups and other tasks. There were two clear problems with the spell, namely the huge dps increase it gave to pets and the zero recast time on the spell, which allowed it to be cast rapidly on multiple targets. Those two things made the spell very powerfull, and it was obvious that would have to be changed eventually.<br />
<br />
The main benefits of the spell were and still are:<br />
1) A tool for assisting the MT to hold agro<br />
2) A zero agro form of damage<br />
3) A means of upgrading shaman pet dps</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I have to admit this sucks and I was one of the people saying the proc rate was broken on pets. 250 dps from procs pets was too much and I expected it to get changed which is why I was happy when they said they where adjusting pet proc rates to be more like players. To me that ment they wouldn't need to adjust the spell it's self in any other way. 100dps or so from panther on a player ISN'T unbalancing. Yes it's possible to do alot of dps with that if you've got a number of melee and pets around.<br />
<br />
Figuring max haste so 1.5 sec cast time plus recast time and time to switch targest we'll call it a nice 5 seconds total. Thats 12 people a minute or about 20 people max even with extension aa's and focus's. Ok so we can do 2k dps for 2 minutes thats all we're gonna last before we're oom. Just hitting all 20 people before the first one wears off would take 13k mana. Most shaman would be oom long before that even with our bag of tricks. We're not doing anything else and it's very limiting. You can't take 5 shaman and have them all do that kind of dps because it would take 100 melees/pets and probably mean a 150-200 mana raid. Even a 54 mana raid your probably gonne be hitting most of the possible targets with just trying to get that 20.<br />
<br />
30 second recast time is just rediculous. If they can't figure out how to make the spell useful with out being overpowered with out making it have an already short duration and a long recast time take it away and give me something else. I don't want it with a 30 second recast. If you must limit the number of people we can cast it on making it group only would be a much better option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There were two clear problems with the spell, namely the huge dps increase it gave to pets and the zero recast time on the spell, which allowed it to be cast rapidly on multiple targets. There has been a lot of talk about the problem with pet dps.  But adding a 30 second recast timer doesn't solve that.  <br />
<br />
With this spell on a raid, a shaman could create significant cooperative burst dps, at the cost of using up a lot of mana.  After the change, a shaman will no longer be able to do this.  Why do you think that shaman providing cooperative burst dps is bad, Tugela?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Those were not the main benefits of my spell in my opinion. It was:<br />
<br />
1) A way of adding meaningful DPS whenever I choose to. <br />
<br />
The fact that shaman pet DPS was upgraded because of this spell is a side effect. As is the other two. The fact that pet DPS surpassed any of our DoT's or nukes was nice, but clearly a fix was in place.<br />
<br />
Now, the CHOOSE to part. We all know that pulls don't come in one after the other and that sometimes there's a bit of downtime as the puller splits. The way  I CHOSE to use panther was to cast panther when the pull was incoming. So I'd just wait...then see the inc message, then drop panther on all the melee's. This way I know that at least for 40 seconds or whatever, it will be used. With this 30 second recast, I cannot do this. I will have to change my methods to a FA rotation, which will allow me to keep it up on three players. Also, it would be INEFFECTIVE over half the time because panther would just be sitting there doing nothing.<br />
<br />
No recast time allowed me to CHOOSE whether or not I want to panther now, or panther later. Removing these choices takes out the fun in the game. How would wizards like it if their spells were all on timers and that they HAD to open with ice, then wait 10 seconds, then fire, then wait 30 seconds, then a magic nuke? SoE is basically making the decisions for us and this takes out the creativity and fun of the game.<br />
<br />
This spell will be moved to the back of my spellbook. Thanks for the month and a half run SoE.</div></div><hr />

Leopard was THE spell for me. It was better than all my DoTs put TOGETHER. (Dont have the uber lvl 69 and 70 DoTs yet, guild doesnt really raid) I'm not *uber* by any stretch of the imagination. I'm good, around 8k hp fully buffed and 6200mana. But I'm EP level of gear with a few DoN and OoW thrown in for good measure. I could keep leopard on 3 pets, slow and throw spot heals in fast pulling DoN groups easily. Mana never got below 50% unless something went REALLY wrong. My guildmates loved it. We were farming SSRA and were able to keep floors 1 and 2 clear with 1 group. I always say that skill outshines gear. I know of shamans with over 10k hp buffed that are not as good most of the time. Skill counts and SoE has just taken all the skill out of it. I wont ever switch mains because I've spent way too much time on my shaman, but I seem to find myself playing EQ less and less..........</div></div><hr />

I'm normally post trying to be the fanboi looking at the positive side..... but ***?  I just now get DON today, check out the boards and BAM!  All this time of pre-planning on how i was going to use leopard to be the shammyknight <br />
I wanted to be, to solo with doggie like I used to, to add great DPS to groups, to be able to un-mem that other 30 sec DOT (Anathema)....<br />
<br />
ALL GONE. Thanks for nothing SoE DEV team.  I will definitely be motivating everyone I know on the Rathe to send /feedback to let them know how stupid a move to nerf the spell to a 30 sec recast timer.  Getting leopard was my main motivation for getting DoN.  Now that the most of the userbase have paid Sony, they yank leopard.  Bait and switch.<br />
<br />
Damn damn damn.  <br />
<br />
Come on DEVs!!!  Don't any of you play a shaman?!  Buffing is a pre-battle role, an outside job, not an active role...  <br />
<br />
The roles are PULLING, CC, TANKING, DPS, and HEALING.  Utility skills are just that, extra utility, NOT an active role.  SLOW is a weak form of CC.  Our heals are weak.  Panther/Leopard was DPS, but with a 30 sec recast timer it becomes a utility again.  Weak.<br />
<br />
Class re-envisioning?!  Envision this..../rude<br />
<br />
You expect us shaman to mem 3 different 30 sec refresh spells?....FA, Anathema, and Leopard?  Us shaman with the shortage of spell slots?  I was gonna un-perma-mem Anathema in favor of Leopard, but now with a 30 sec recast leopard's ACTUAL mana efficiency just dropped down the nerf-hole to come out LESS mana efficient than our other major form of DPS, a focussed Anathema...<br />
Blowing a chunk of mana on a used-to-be DPS spell while the puller is out scouting... yeah, that's efficient.  <br />
<br />
To the back of the spellbook, like that other novelty, Spirit of Cheetah.  Spirit of Panther.  Hmmm.  Spirit of Delete Account.<br />
<br />
This isn't thinking out of the box, SoE...this is thinking out of your mind.  A low-down bait and switch.  Dirty tactics.  <br />
<br />
If I didn't already love my shaman, I would definitely quit EQ.  EQ is killing EQ.  ***WARNING BELLS*** ......Hello, SOE?!!  Didn't you learn anything from the great GoD exodus?!  Are you TRYING to piss people off?  Is there maybe only one person really in charge of this, and who has a sadistic sense of humor?  Really?  Let me talk to the manager.  I've been coming to this establishment for over 3 years now.  The ad said &quot;all you can eat&quot; for veteran members.  I drive all the way here and now the server tells me &quot;sorry, only one trip to the buffet bar...&quot;  Crap.<br />
<br />

Daddy buys a new big SUV for mom on Mother's Day.  Mom and kids and friends are all happy for about a month, getting more done and enjoying the ride.  Then Daddy comes by and says, &quot;Sorry, honey, but you can only drive the new car on Saturdays now.&quot;  Damn, damn, damn.  Thanks Daddy for being such a mother$%$#@.  Time for a divorce.<br />
<br />
30 second recast.  Absolutely brilliant.  Give everyone in customer relations and the DEV team a raise....just be sure to take it out of their DON Christmas bonus...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is total butt-ream, and I fully support bitching about it now, but dont be a moron and think that SOE wouldnt have touched it if **I** hadnt said a thing.<br />
All I know is I don't see Blaaz posting lickety split like he usually does about how shaman are &quot;overpowered&quot; now.<br />
Another idiot. <br />
<br />
They screwed us with this change. That what you wanted me to say? We got screwed. However, its NOT live yet, and if I recall correctly, a LOT of our OOW spells were completely returned VERY shortly before release, and then changed into reasonably useful spells again.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you dont think that the shaman class is STILL very powerful, then re-roll another class, cause you really have no concept of this game. Dont mem the spell. Go back to a Curse and a Nuke. Shaman are STILL quite powerful. But we DID get hosed. <br />
umm.. blazz merely said that it was overpowered on pets, he said nothing about them needing to nerf the spell in any form other than on pets.  He also stated that if they did change it in any way, he would be right there with the rest of you fighting for it to get changed back.<br />
Thank you Val. And BTW, for the record, I am now FULLY behind the &quot;WE GOT BORKED&quot; side of the table. They went too far. If it goes live like this, I will be ALL OVER the SOE boards, this board, and any other board I can find, trust me.<br />

Just a quick drive by</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Now for some personal opinion. Obviously they couldnt control the pet-proc thing they way they wanted too, so rather than re-write pages and pages of code to fix it, they took the cheap and easy way out, they adjust our ability to cast the spell. <br />
<br />
At 30 seconds, its almost unmemable. Maybe if there are 2 pets in group (other than mine), but probably not otherwise. Not worth it, I will go back to a DOT. <br />
<br />
So lets see where we all stand. EVERYONE is pretty outraged by 30 seconds. SOME of us think &quot;instant recast&quot; is a bit overpowered. Is there a reasonable number we can take to SOE and sell? <br />
<br />
20 seconds still seems extreme. Even best-case, your looking at a spell thats going to be a PITA to manage. 20 seconds is the &quot;still sucks, but might use it more&quot; number.<br />
<br />
5 seconds seems still a bit too good. A 5 second recast would actually sorta help, in a way, we could Panther something, drop a heal or a nuke, and panther the next target. So I dont see SOE going as low as 5 seconds. I think they are trying to avoid the &quot;cast it non-stop with Channeling on a raid-boss mob&quot; scenario.<br />
<br />
10 seconds. 15 seconds MAYBE. These seem pretty darn reasonable. Actually, it seems a BETTER way to adjust the Raid DPS without totally hosing the group DPS. Also much easier to adjust than trying to sort out &quot;what pets proc what spells and what rate&quot;, which just sounds like a coding clusterfroak to me.<br />
<br />
So can we live with a 10 second recast, if the proc-rate isnt changed? How about 15? I like 10, but would accept 15. But 20 and 30 are NOT acceptable, IMHO. <br />
<br />
And all your people about to jump out your windows or those of you with the gas on and your heads in the oven, and ESPECIALLY those of you who now think &quot;Shaman are worthless again&quot;, remember we STILL have a very viable class. Yeah, this takes us down a couple notches, but mem the DOT and Nuke combo again, remember that BEFORE this spell we were pretty darn reasonably good. Not &quot;awesome&quot;, but not &quot;sucky&quot; either. <br />
<br />
In the meantime, I think we can &quot;rant&quot; about this, and make our feelings known, WITHOUT sounding like a bunch of lunatics, and without sounding like a bunch of 1st graders who just got told they wont sell chocolate milk at lunch anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">With this spell on a raid, a shaman could create significant cooperative burst dps, at the cost of using up a lot of mana.  After the change, a shaman will no longer be able to do this.  Why do you think that shaman providing cooperative burst dps is bad, Tugela?<br />
<br />
The reason should be obvious, you just need to look at comments like &quot;It was better than all my DoTs put TOGETHER.&quot; to see why that is. Do you think that it should be &quot;better than all my DoTs put TOGETHER.&quot;? Creating that level of zero agro burst dps will have a dramatic effect on encounters, especially single group named encounters. It has the potential to make entire raids that previously were unwinnable suddenly trivial. Is that right, should one new spell be able to do that? The effect at the top end is less obvious, but at mid to lower levels it is huge, and the spell is not supposed to provide that sort of power, it should not. From my own experience duoing Yella and Mokara I can see the power of the spell, it allows me to do things I couldnt even dream of doing before. Is that right? Is it balanced? IMO no. Yeah, I really like the spell the way it is, but for the health of the game I understand why it needs to be changed. I like it for selfish reasons and not for communal reasons, and theres the rub.  And I bet allmost everyone here does too, and if you cant see what that tells one, I'm sorry for you.<br />
<br />
We hear all about how unbalancing things like CH, defensive, 75% slow are, and how much they have screwed up the game over the years. And yes, for the most part those views are correct but with the really old stuff we have to live with it. We saw the effects of manaburn and modrods and rampant charm and swarm kiting. It's funny how when other people exclusively get dubiously powerfull effects it's &quot;unbalanced and unhealthy&quot;, but when you get it, its &quot;perfectly reasonable&quot; (not YOU specifically, but the generic &quot;you&quot; ;) )</div></div><hr />

I accepted the thing about reducing pet dps, because honestly, pets were proccing madly.  It was great that they were and loads of fun, but my expectations were set that this was going to change and pets were going to be probably same as players.  <br />
<br />
This change is **** for shaman.  It adds management.  it's FA all over again, and worse, with shorter duration and shorter recast.  <br />
Needs way more of my attention to manage it.<br />

Balancing mana expenditure vs panther casting, vs renew time vs heals was fun.  This stopped it being fun.  <br />

If this is true then I am just going to stop posting and reading this board, because I cant justify acting that way. I refuse to bitch and moan when things are reasonable. Even now, the sky isnt TOTALLY falling. They may as well have never bothered coding the spell at all. We are now at &quot;pre-DoN&quot; strength, which, IMHO, isnt sucky. It aint GREAT, its pretty damn mediocre, but it aint TOTALLY sucky. <br />

I am guessing. I think the pet proc thing turned out to be a major snafu in the worst way, and they decided to just go back to the original pet-set ups and nerf the spell this way. If they do both, then I will probably just stop bothering to post anything at all, because obviously, common sense and basic reasoning are not a part of SOEs vocabulary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
seriusly though  in ref\gards to the imminent nerf I  got leopard about what 2 weeks after Don came out I think it was and love teh spell so do my guildies even if I have to canni more often. This spell  as is is great for the dps it does  I, like a lot of my other shammy brothers and sisters, actually feel useful in a group/raid situation instead of just being a buff/slow whore and I don't even get paid for that  ( good thing on that i suppose would be i don't have to pay a pimp a percentage of any earnings lol)   I could use with a  longer duration  time so I wouldnt have to Canni as often but still i actually like being able to  stay on my toes so to speak   hell i even cast it on myself and help add in some DPS  now with that spell and My Monk just can't get enough of teh spell  xp goes a hella lot faster with it now and that grind isn't too bad now. Nextt ime i log on with The Purple One (yes i tinted my armor to be the appropriate color for when someone says they are gonna squash me like a grape =P and no people I'm not talking about  Prince  or the artist formerly Known as Prince or whatever he is going by nowadays either)  I am gonna /feedback as often as I can to help get this spell to something thats gonna make us all happy. hell I'd rather just keep it as it is and hit that canni v or pained memory as often as necessary so all my melee companions can keel faster<br />

Jumpin Jesus on a pogo stick you know nothing about me.  You may have been an advocate in the past, but you have become a fanboi for SoE on the nerf of the panther line.  I have stayed quiet far too long myself. I am just as much to blame.<br />

<br />

I am an advocate now. An advocate of balance. I felt that the original incarnation of the Panther line was FAR TOO POWERFUL. I didnt ask for it to be nerfed into a back-of-book spell, man. Do I need to go quote my own posts? Maybe people need to start understanding the difference between &quot;nerf&quot; and &quot;adjustment&quot;. I felt an adjustment was in order. Instead, they nerfed it. <br />
<br />
Say what you want about my attitude toward this spell line, but honestly, the whole &quot;OMG the sky is falling&quot; attitude is just so weak. Are you saying your character is unplayable now because a spell you had for 2 months is now pretty sucky? Come on. Who needs to grow up. Got Ancestral Aid? Got your Epic? Got Call of the Wild? Got Channeling? Can you still Panther your own pet and turn him into a 200 dps sustained source of damage? <br />
<br />
I read this thread, and I saw a lot of &quot;thats it, I am done&quot;. DoN hasnt even hit the 2 month time-frame yet, has it? Did you get +10 stats, +300 hp/mana, and access to a bunch of solid augs? Yeah, our spell got bent. Unmem it, bitch with the rest of us, and move on. But some of you seem so caught up in this crap its almost like you feel like someone broke into your house and took . . . something.<br />
<br />
The nerf bites ass. Its FAR too severe. If they also nerfed the proc rate, then its TOTALLY worth pumping some energy into letting SOE know we are pissed. But stop taking it personal, and stop letting this type of thing TOTALLY ruin your fun. The previous 6 years had a lot of fun, yes? The last 2 months have been great with Panther/Leopard.  Now its over. Wanna work toward making it a reasonably playable spell? Cool. I am in. Wanna make this into the &quot;worst thing ever&quot;, then sorry, I will go see if I can get those Qvic arms I have been after a couple weeks now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">I've always stated in the past I'm not for, or against SOE. I may not like what they are doing, but I have to accept their final decisions they make or I quit playing their game.<br />
<br />
I never believed Panther was overpowered. it made alot of spam and that made alot of people scream. I didn't like the idea of it getting nerfed at all, but I'll accept it. when this change goes live, the maw line of spells will take a place next to FA for the rare melee who has the &quot;massive endowment&quot; to ask me for it.<br />
<br />
in my opinion the shaman class had its glory days back in Velious, since then its been &quot;nerf by omission&quot; as it was put. we've slowly been left behind by many classes, and some classes were put further behind than we were.<br />
<br />
OoW was a boon for the shaman class, its very nice to see &quot;cap-busting&quot; buffs, but these were only marginal increases. it was an inch in the right direction. DoN came along with a very nice new spell line that provided alot of group desirability for our class. now this spell line is getting drastically altered to the point that it is not the same spell, and because of this, all positive effects are null. I will not be able to provide this spell on melees because of the refresh time. I will be better off casting curse DoTs in groups as before.<br />
<br />
I do not like where this is headed, and that is my simple opinion. I won't quit the game over it, though I'm sure many will. but, I will ask every melee to /feedback every time they ask for this spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">I will ask every melee to /feedback every time they ask for this spell.<br />
Melee + pet classes man. Mages, Necros, BLs, even Chanters, Druids and SKs got hurt by this. Hell, Boo Boo was FIERCE with Panther on.</div></div><hr />

This is not the way to fix panther, this is not the way to balance the game, this is not the way to make playing our characters more enjoyable, this is not the way to increase group desirability. This is nothing but lazyness on the Dev's part, and I won't stand having my chair pulled out from under me everytime the Dev's give us a new cushion.</div></div><hr />

Blazz has been asking for balance. He's been asking for an adjustment, much like the pet proccing was. Perhaps a slight mana increase even to make it more of a choice whether or not to use it. HOWEVER, he is NOT asking for a NERF! This is what this the 30 second recast is.<br />
<br />
If you put potential DPS before and potential DPS after as a ratio. I bet that this nerf will outdo ALL OTHER NERFS IN THE HISTORY OF THIS GAME. Yes, even the necro delay trick from vanilla EQ. Even the charm DPS nerf. This is why it is absolutely ridiculous. There is NO reason for it! I'd say change the mana cost to 750 or 800 and be done with it. Sure, it makes it harder to maintain, but that's what gear and focuses are for. The more you get, the more powerful you become.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">well, there really is no point to getting angry with anyone on the boards, because you don't have to agree with anyone. I personally have my own opinions, and I don't get mad when people don't agree with me, if I find myself getting mad with anyone on a messageboard, I take a step back, because that means I've gotten too involved in simple words.<br />
<br />
I think some discussions go much further than what they should, and I find myself dropping out of discussions that get too heated, simply because they get overrun by emotional and irrational people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">If this discussion is going to be about what we'd like to see done to Leopard/Panther instead of SOE's hare-brained idea of a nerf, that's great. If we are going to sit here and give Grimbear some solid stuff to take back to the SOE people, that's great too, and this thread is worth something. But if folks are going to continue to be idiots and attack Blazz, this thread should be pushed the way of the worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">For some reason you are thinking the pet proc rate will stay untouched. Maybe I missed something, but where did they announce that?<br />
They've not rescinded the changes to other classes pet procs on Test, so it's a safe bet that the proc rate for Leopard/Panther on pets will be lower after the patch. If they were to abandon the pet proc &quot;fix&quot;, you'd see Spirit of Irionu and the like lose their 150% proc rate mod.<br />
<br />
I've seen mention of a 6-second cast time from some posters, but it's a timer ID 6 - the cast time remains 3 seconds. The timer's there to stop you twisting Leopard and Panther, as presumably on a document somewhere there's an edict saying &quot;Shamans should do xxx dps in yyy situation&quot;.<br />
<br />
From a personal point of view, a 30 second recast timer won't affect my soloing much at all (and that's what I spend much of my time doing). The only difference is that I won't be able to have every wolf from Spirit Call proccing away like mad and that will make a difference to taking down big targets. <br />
<br />
From a group point of view, it's darned inconvenient. I used to Leopard two or three players when a mob was incoming, then canni back the mana during the fight. Having a 30 second timer means there's less scope for popping Leopard on someone just as the fight starts and DPS will lower as a result.<br />
<br />
Raid wise, luckily people seem to realise Leopard is a privilege, not a right - and one small advantage is it'll give additional shamans something to do on the raid!  :p However, it means we'll lose the ability to &quot;manaburn&quot;, ie dumping all our mana on Leopard/Panther'ing every melee and pet in sight to burn down a target.<br />
<br />
Until now the Leopard line has been an absolute blast, but I've said before it's a little unbalancing on pets (the DPS/mana ratio was insane). I'd happily have accepted the proc rate adjustment on pets, as I've posted elsewhere I still expect them to proc more than players. But that 30 second recast leaves a sour taste in my mouth, as it's changing the utility of the spell rather than just toning down the damage slightly - we're forced into an &quot;xxx dps at most&quot; role rather than a choice of &quot;xxx dps sustained&quot; or &quot;xxxx dps if you blow all your mana&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'll certainly be /feedback'ing it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">I am guessing. I think the pet proc thing turned out to be a major snafu in the worst way, and they decided to just go back to the original pet-set ups and nerf the spell this way. If they do both, then I will probably just stop bothering to post anything at all, because obviously, common sense and basic reasoning are not a part of SOEs vocabulary.<br />
<br />
I am sure common sense and basic reasoning are not a part of SOEs vocabulary. There is only one thing in their mind - Time sink.<br />
<br />
If something consider to be too powerful, they will nerf it to BALANCE the game. <br />
<br />
I will never understand why people are not happy with a spell when it helps the group/raid kill faster. They are jealous because only our class can cast the spell? Everyone can now sit on our butt longer when killing a mob and feel happy because the game is now BALANCED?<br />
<br />
Soon or later SOE will double all the mob's HP to balance the game I am sure.<br />

You aren't trivializing any content I currently do by allowing me to cast this spell on as many pets/melees as I feasibly can control with my mana pool.  In Anguish, in MPG one group trials, in Txevu, in DoN dragon progression, in the &quot;nest&quot;, you have given me a home and an honorable place within my group/raid to reside.<br />
<br />
In August you will be introducing another expansion (big assumption coming here) that should progress me farther with level caps, new content, increased mob encounters.  Encounters that will require increased dps - and where this spell line will be seen as needed in it's current form.<br />
<br />
Yet you are repeating history by &quot;not&quot; looking to the future and rushing to do a knee-jerk correction to a spell line that has been received as a step in the right direction to balance the shaman class.<br />
<br />
So what if it is deemed over-powered in some older content? Today's level 65 shaman is soon to be level 70 and above.  Looking at the npc dmg provided in the higher end zones of today's EQ, I would hate to guess at what they will output in the expansions of tomorrow.<br />
<br />
So let me have fun with it for the next 4 months in it's current form.  Chances are after August, I will be coming back here to cry &quot;foul&quot; and demand an increase in the proc of Panther.<br />

If you need to balance the power of a spell, that is supposed to be used regularly in normal everyday situations (not like emergency or special situation spells), tweak the mana costs or dps or whatever. But leave the recast time alone.<br />

Sigh, i don't even have the spell yet and still get upset with that kind of ignorance.<br />

I thought the idea of a fricken test server was to actually *TEST* stuff ... <br />
<br />
If this spell had come to us with a 30 sec recast time, we would have shrugged and put it in the back of the spell book, but the fact we have been given the spell, then had it totally screwed on us burns ....<br />
<br />
I say the day it goes live, every Shaman cancel your accounts, even if its just for the one night ..... at least that way they will get the picture ....<br />
<br />
There are many ways they could address the issue, but a fricken recast time is just f%^ked ....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">I am amazed. Seriously. I never expected stuff like this to be possible, not even given SOE's track record. Words fail me to describe how much wrong was done in a single nerf. Not only did they fail to adress any of the possible issues with the spell, they also managed to get rid of nearly every positive aspect of the spell in the process and on top of that they turned it into a more annoying version of a spell we have already complained about for several expansions.<br />
<br />
Let's see.<br />
1. The spell might possible have produced too much DPS. The new version still does.<br />
2. The spell caused disproportionate DPS when cast on pets. The new version still does.<br />
3. The spell caused buff slot and buff order issues. The new version still does.<br />
4. The spell was annoying to keep up. The new version is more annoying.<br />
5. The spell had to be cast in advance, thus you lost out on DPS. The new version has to be cast further in advance.<br />
6. Unlike a nuke the spell could be dispelled, costing you mana to recast it. The new version can not be recast before the recast timer has cycled.<br />
<br />
About the single redeeming value the spell still has is it causing no direct aggro. Expect that to change next patch. Simply casting the spell will aggro half the zone on the shaman. Yay.<br />
<br />
I guess I am to blame for how this turned out. I did not like this spell from the beginning. However, I never said it was not useful. Thanks for your support SOE, but you could have handled this more discretely. I would have been happy with other solutions too. Say, changing the Bane line to be unresistable and next to no aggro. Or slapping resist modifers on our nukes. Or making our rains unresistable. I and lots of other members of this forum have brought forth dozens of ideas on how to handle the shaman DPS problems. There really was no need to go this far to placate my dislike of this spell line. However, since we have gone this far, could you please implement some of my other ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

In that case replace that line with some version of &quot;why the heck did you nerf the entire spell when you already solved the problem?&quot;. I doubt SOE can code a universal NPC change without redesigning dozens of encounters that rely on procs though. That is, unless they break bards and SKs in the process.</div></div><hr />

Dont mem the spell. Go back to a Curse and a Nuke. Shaman are STILL quite powerful. But we DID get hosed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yes, let me try to maintain long casting, mana intensive dots and nukes where the mob is 3/4ths dead before either of those two types of spells land and the damage done is next to nothing,  if they do manage to land in the first place.... (this is the same reason I never bothered with a 9 sec cast time epic dot, sheesh!  9 secs where I can't do anything else, no canni, no slows, no ghetto cc, no nukes, nada... no thank you)  <br />
<br />
So, they give us a non-direct aggro proc buff that does decent dps for PCs and pets (post balancing).  Great!  Yes, the mana cost is high, but if I manage it properly I can still contribute decent dps.  What, a recast of 30 secs?  No, thanks, I don't have that kind of time to make it useful on these hard-hitting low hp mobs and wicked fast encounters.  So I go back to the pre-panther state in groups and raids....  /sigh<br />
<br />
Yes, we were powerful characters and that's why I made a shaman, however our power has dimished over the years when compared to the advances in the game events and our usefulness compared to other classes within the encounters added since PoP...  A person would really have no concept of this game if they do not see this or they are still raiding in Luclin and below zones.  <br />
<br />
Actually, thank you for your suggestion that we reroll.... I have indeed rerolled when sony did something similarly idiotic and distasteful to my main's class and I am glad to have many high level alts I can now work on.  I was hoping and holding out for the promise of class re-envisioning and allowing shaman a half-way desirable position in groups/raids instead of becoming buff bots...  there were too many shaman in my guild already and heaven forbid that my shaman could actually actively contribute something worthwhile to raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is they are not going to allow pets to proc as much as they use to so your 200 is now at best 100. We may be bitching but SOE deserves it at this point.</div></div><hr />

I agree. We need to be heard. We need to get this fixed. I am ON BOARD! <br />
<br />
And if you look at Retrons post on the other thread, its now about 150-170 DPS on pets, because they still have a modifier on pet-procs vs PC-procs. Regardless of that though, you are 100% corect. SOE deserves to be nailed to the wall for this, and I will help do it, trust me. <br />
 I doubt SOE can code a universal NPC change without redesigning dozens of encounters that rely on procs though. That is, unless they break bards and SKs in the process.<br />
I felt this way too Murtak. I thought that SOE had some universal problems with the pet-proc thing, so they went the other way and tried to limit our ability to actually cast the spell. Doesnt seem to be the case. As my comrade Karshak so eloquently put it, we got kicked in the teeth and knee-ed in the balls at the same time.<br />
...cause we're talking about pre-OoW, right?<br />
<br />
I see you've already gone back to your 'hey, this isn't really that bad' posts regarding this spell. At least you're consistent in not getting it.<br />
Can you read? I really dont want to get into a flame war with you man, and I doubt you want one with me, but if you want some, come get some, seriously. I am not in the mood for your back-handed insults.<br />
<br />
Vir, I am as pissed as anyone about this, trust me. We got TOTALLY bent and froaked without even so much as a kiss. They took a great idea for a spell line and nerfed it into a spell no one will ever mem again. <br />
<br />
So lets bitch. Lets try to get it changed. Lets work on something positive. But in the meantime, don't stand around on your pity-pot screaming &quot;why me&quot; because SHAMAN DO NOT TOTALLY SUCK. We took a MAJOR hit here. Panther put us in the &quot;Top 5&quot; again. Now, we are back to a mediocre, middle of the pack class. <br />
<br />
Remember too, we can get a LOT of support for changing this from other classes. You go-getters need to hit the Mage and Necro boards, and get them to come along, maybe SOE will listen. <br />
<br />
Hell, I dunno, maybe Giac is right after all. In order to get anything done, you cant use logic, you cant act like an adult, you have to become a ranting, raving, tantrum-throwing child and BITCH til the cows come home. Then, once you get something, BITCH some more in order to keep it.</div></div><hr />

It is amusing to see the kind of things Sony will do when EQ is on it's knees in it's twighlight years.<br />
<br />
If they nerf the proc rate - forget the spell.  If they enforce 30 sec but don't nerf the proc rate - BOX A SHAMAN - with your shaman P lol.<br />
<br />
Eitherway with the slow uprades of BST/ENC your shaman may as well not login.  To be honest encs don't do too much either.  Seems BST is the way to go and probably the winner at the end of everquest.<br />

(Did so 6 months ago) The writing was on the wall for shaman and EQ, I still Love EQ for what it was, but what is has become is a mockery of what came before.<br />
<br />
Sure they may be slow to patch but they also lack the sheer spitefulness of Rytan.<br />
<br />
Don't re-roll in EQ. Take a couple months off and play Worlds of warcraft. It is a heck of alot of fun. The newby feeling is alive and well over there, even if it is easier to play than EQ is, satisfaction for the hard fights and the newest widget of impending doom that I just got is great.<br />
<br />
There is choice now in online RPG's don't take it from Sony any more, if every shaman incensed by this took a month off and played Wow with a feedback before you went then they would get a clearer understanding of what you love about EQ, and honestly if they really love it at all.<br />
<br />
After six months in Worlds of Warcraft, I am still having fun every single day. The ease of the game means that replayability is always an option, and Alts are not nearly as crippling as it was in EQ. (Hard to start over when you have a 68 shaman with 450ish AA when I left.) <br />

I certainly miss the charecter of Snoww, I miss the feeling of shaman goodness, but I do not miss the spiteful mean-spiritness of Rytan and the rest of the goobers who are running Everquest into the dirt.<br />

<br />
Once again, they haven't just adjusted the swing of the pendulum, they've gone and rolled a critical move and jumped way the other side of this conclusion. Rather than make a minor adjustment, they went the way of Monk Nerf, Manaburn Nerf, etc. Instead of making a slow adjustment to see where the actual balance point is on the subject, they leaped from the top of the building and are suprised to have splattered across 1/2 mile of sidewalk.<br />
<br />
Lowering of damage output on the spell would have been FAR more acceptable and reasonable than this fiasco. Rather than read and listen and test, it's presume and assume and jump to bloody conclusions baised more on opinion than fact.<br />
<br />
Was it seriously powerful before? Yes. Was that partially balanced by the extremely low duration and high mana cost? Yes. Was increasing the recast time to HALF the damn duration a smart move? Pass the crack please.<br />
<br />
SoE evidently doesn't bother to consider the shaman response to Avatar type spells, and they have successfully made this the worst one of them all. I want a damn refund of my crystals so I can get a stat increasing augment, cause my stats are already maxxed out. <br />

<br />
I honestly do not like to be portrayed like this, nor did I say this. <br />
<br />
My &quot;bitching&quot; is justified in 99% of the cases. When I criticize something, it's usually sound, most people just do not realize it immediately. I am ahead of most people and can read changes and their effect better than others(usually anyway), because I have so much experience with EQ and dedicate a pretty high amount of time to this hobby of mine.<br />
<br />
What I want people to realize is that the pet nerf was largely warranted, even though I gave reasons for why this apparent imbalance could have constituted a much needed boost for Shamans to make us stack adequately when in a DPS role.<br />
<br />
When I say we should have screamed when they announced the pet nerf, it isn't because I think we would get them to leave pets alone, but solely to give a very clear sign that would have prevented them to introduce another change that could have further alienated our comunity.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to clarify that. When I mindlessly rant it's just when I have to argue with obtuse morons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>Bladefury~fennin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">See i think the reason why everyone is so upset is due to the fact that Sony developers think NOTHING through.... they just say &quot;Hey that would be a cool thing to give this class&quot; <br />
<br />
They never test things long enough to make sure it is balanced.  I have to use the word balanced cause thats the way sony thinks.<br />
<br />
Now if this spell would of became live being  30 sec recast we probably all would of thought &quot; hmm intresting spell with limited use like avatar&quot;  sure we would of had some peeps who would of shook there fists at the sky and said I hate you sony .. but it would of passed and we would of had a spell that wouldnt be in our main spell sets but if a certian set of circumstances arose we would mem it <br />
<br />
but NOOOOOOO sony had to make this spell like irresistable to us and have it be like a class defining spell... then SNATCH it away from us so fast and without warning leaving everyone in shock and very pissed off...<br />
<br />
So weither or not the spell needs to be nerfed ... to be honest guys we can solo better than any class with it &quot;as is&quot; and a little nerf is needed... but ALL of this hassle and everyone being upset could of been avoided by this spell being tested longer... Hell... DoN came out so fast after OoW i doubt they tested the whole expansion<br />
<br />
SO to sum it all up.... SONY ..stop thinking about how fast you can get something out and TEST IT CHRIST<br />

Fair enough G, my apologies. But I still think that bitching JUST so we can PREVENT being nerfed is a crappy way to try to accomplish our goals as a class. Maybe I am not inturpreting your other posts correctly, but:<br />
Way too many have been content with the class, hence this nerf.<br />
<br />
I'll say this once and you may think what you will: If people had bitched and screamed bloody murder over the pet nerf on this board, this would have never happened.<br />
<br />
Again, think what you will, but that's how EQ works.<br />
and<br />
Some of you need to learn that looking satisfied as a customer in EQ doesn't do you any good.<br />

How many times have they promised to reexamine their changes to game and then nothing ever happens.  That is why I am tired of complaining and will just walk away.  I am quitting because it is impossible to be heard.  3 accounts with montly billing, every expansion owned and every future expansion owned on all 3 accounts have been thrown away due to the carelessness of the developers in this game.  Trust me, Everquest is almost over with folks.<br />
On top of that, there are server mergers going into effect.  This is another reason they will lose accounts.  Add into all this the fact that other classes are getting upgrades to slows, heals, damage that will render our class obsolete.  <br />
Dont try to tell me we are getting upgrades too.  Panther WAS an upgrade.  You see how they nerfed that into oblivion.  Do you think our class reenvisioning wont get nerfed when BL's and every other class complains?  <br />

Back to WoW i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">Now here's the thing, changing the recast time to 30 seconds doesn't just effect shamans, it effects the whole tanking community. <br />
And the pet class community as well. Mages became AWESOME DPS, instead of Wizzie-Wannabes, when a Shaman was in the group. Necros had HUGE upside with their pets. Even Chanter and Druid pets were turned into little balls of DPS if there wasnt any other pets to drop Panther on in the group. 3 or 4 druids in my guild sent Boo Boo in on RCoD-Zun the other night, LOL.<br />
<br />
SOE just doesnt seem to like &quot;fun&quot;. This is just another page in that book. Remember when they made the DE Illusion mask &quot;must equip&quot;? Why? Cause people had fun with it? Bah, in those days I was a Paladin and I loved running around as a DE with my Soulfire or Firey Avenger, convincing n00bies I was &quot;an experimental class Verant is trying, DE Paladin&quot;, LOL. <br />
<br />
So many other ways they could hav adjusted this. Hell, since Shaman have nothing to use Endurance on, make it a Disk, that would prevent the &quot;Panther the Raid&quot; thing, and further limit its castability with another variable. <br />
<br />
Sigh. Bummin about this. What a froak  job. I am so disgusted. I have been a stout supporter of SOE since OOW came out, thinking MAYBE FINALLY they actually were getting &quot;in touch&quot; with their player-community. Now this. Talk about a feeling of betrayal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u165"><b>Srperro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p165">I don't see the problem here with a 30 second recast.  I'm not sure what everyone expects.  Shamans are not meant to be DPS machines.<br />
<br />
A monk friend of mine has been parsing panther.  His parser can't parse it straight up, so he just detects the spell message.  He just calculates number of spell messages divided by duration, assuming a low proc of 550 with no crits.  It generally comes out to 100+ dps on PLAYERS.  Not pets.  Low has been 80 dps and high has been 140 dps.<br />
<br />
Let's just take the low end.  Even at 80 dps and a 30 second recast, that is 240 dps. (3 players on panther cycle)<br />
<br />
My point of view:<br />
I'm adding 240 dps to the group with panther.  I'm adding more dps with champion.  And I'm also adding even more dps, because I am main healing/slowing, and can drop out the worthless cleric/druid for an extra dps slot.  Generally I don't panther more than 2-3 in a group anyways because I am main healer. (talking about non-stop riftseeker pulling here, or the likes)  I can see how having a cleric in group would bring downtime, so I suggest main healing yourself, throw some dots/nukes, or pull yourself.<br />
<br />
There are 2 situations only that will suffer with this nerf.  One is Named/Fabled/Boss fights in groups. (I generally panther whole group then)  The other is some raid scenarios such as Warden in Anguish, where I do nothing but cycle panther on 5-7 people the whole fight.  But even with the nerf, I'll still be adding a minimum of 240 dps, healing and slowing.<br />
<br />
At this point in the game, the only change I would like to see is faster heals.  Not more healing, not better slows, and not more dps.  I can main heal exp groups and raid groups (in Anguish/DoN) just fine.  But every once in a while, its just not fast enough cast time.  What else are we wanting here?  Main healing + best slow in game + 240dps minimum is pretty good to me.</div></div><hr />

When Shamans got Panther they forgot everything else that is still wrong with the class. Panther didn't solved a single issue from the top 10 list and it only did so because, apparently, since it's getting nerfed, was overpowered. <br />
At the same time it created a couple more issues, which include the fact that if the spell was going to become our primary meaning of dealing damage in groups, it would have totally ignored power gains through gear/AAs ect. throughout your total EQ career.<br />
<br />
We should have insisted on pushing for fixes for areas like Survivability a lot more, but since there was a nice chunk of meat on that Panther bone, we did not and now that it's getting nerfed we are left with nothing.<br />
<br />
So to respond in a more concise manner: Bitching and moaning without is not what needs to be done, but being satisfied when there are other pressing issues to be adressed still, because we like our newest toy so much, must be avoided as well, and when they announced the pet nerf we should have started a huge &quot;rant&quot; explaining why at least Shaman pets should keep their proc rate and that the first thing to adress a top 10 issue is already being nerfed ect.<br />

Would that have stopped them from nerfing pets anyway? Maybe not, but they would have not dared nerfing it further, trust me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True... for the most part when being very specific.  But a couple issues I seem to recall on top 10 list:<br />
<br />
1.  Aggro - (on DoTs, I know.) but why cast DoTs when Panth/Leop are working? - I never saw aggro.<br />
<br />
2.  Burst DPS - (wasn't this on the list?) - Can we deny it wasn't &quot;burst dps&quot;?<br />
<br />
3.  Add direct combat effects to spell(s) - (on list also?) - Just me... but a DD proc surely seems like a &quot;direct combat effect&quot;...<br />
<br />
IMO, 3 of 10 on top 10 less WERE being addressed with one (ok, two.) spell(s)....</div></div><hr />

When Shamans got Panther they forgot everything else that is still wrong with the class. Panther didn't solved a single issue from the top 10 list <br />
I think it indirectly solved a couple issues. Namely the DOT bug issue and the Raid stackability issue. Yeah, they didnt FIX the bugs with aggro and some of our DOTs, instead, it provided us an alternate form of DPS. I suppose I wouldnt mind if the aggro on Blood of Yoppa was fixed now, so I could stack Curse and Blood each pull, instead of 3 panthers, without worrying about the excess aggro, but Panther made those changes unnecessary. <br />
At the same time it created a couple more issues, which include the fact that if the spell was going to become our primary meaning of dealing damage in groups, it would have totally ignored power gains through gear/AAs ect. throughout your total EQ career.<br />
Not following this. Wouldnt more mana make the spell more usable in group situations? I have had groups where I couldnt Leopard one or two of the melee members, since I wanted to cast it on the available pets intead. With a larger mana pool and more FT, I could have kept it up on another target in that situation. <br />
<br />
But honestly, how does ANY shaman gain damage in groups through gear? There is what, 2 AA abilities that increase our DOT damage, a few that increase our DD damage (which, BTW, affect Panther when cast on ourselves) and thats it. Shaman are casters. Our power is in our spells. Our gear is an aid to increase our ability to cast those spells. <br />
We should have insisted on pushing for fixes for areas like Survivability a lot more, but since there was a nice chunk of meat on that Panther bone, we did not and now that it's getting nerfed we are left with nothing.<br />
Is something &quot;over&quot; here? Are we all done, as a class, trying to get things fixed? I dont think so. Maybe Panther made us more complacent about pushing for the other stuff, but IF and WHEN this nerf goes live, I think you will see a LOT more discussion about the rest of the &quot;list&quot;. I see your point, but you sound as if the whole thing is over, and we wont get Panther, and we wont get Survivability, and we wont get anything ever again. Half empty, G. <br />

I respectfully disagree. Yes, we had (and still have) other issues. Yes, its POSSIBLE that NOT admitting Panther was a bit overpowered and going on some rant about the proc-rate nerf would have made them think twice about the additional nerf. But seriously, if this is how we have to function to get things done, screw it, I am out. Its ridiculous to think that a ranting, raving bitch post can accomplish more than a calm, reasonable, adult one. <br />

I think he is saying that with a 30 second re-cast, he will be able to keep it up on 3 targets FULL TIME, so when the mob is incoming, all 3 will have it. As the gem refreshes, the cycle continues, and in theory, as it fades on each target, it will be recast instantly. <br />
<br />
Realistically, this probably isnt going to happen quite this way, but I dont see much more than a 5 second delay between Panthering each of 3 targets if your diligent. Before, you could sneak some time in between certain pulls, then quickly pop it onto 3 or 4 targets as INC was called, which meant minimal no-panther on some targets when the mob got to the camp, but it was coming. Now, its just veiwed as another buff and you refresh instantly when it fades. This buff, however, is on a 1.5 minute cycle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sad that you are maginalizing AA abilitites and finishing your point with, &quot;Our power is in our spells.&quot; Clearly you miss the significance of the additional power to those spells the AA's give you. Makes the case for your being clueless stronger.<br />

Blazz, you are the single best example that supports G's original point. &quot;Maybe Panther made us more complacent ...&quot;? Give us a break. Panther not only made you more complacent ... it made you totally complacent and even started the &quot;Blazz Wants It Nerfed&quot; threads. Now you are going to temper your reality with ... &quot;IF and WHEN this nerf goes live,&quot; then you have a perspective change. Well, frankly, that is just sad. It is folks like you who have led shaman from the point of strong, viabable and needed in the game to the whoredom of &quot;OMG I HAVE A BUFF TO CAST THAT GETS ME GROUPS!!! WOOHOO!!&quot;<br />
<br />
If you can't see the historical progression of the shaman class and the need for self-respecting shaman to stand up and NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE ... then, you are beyond hope. There is no silver lining in this cloud. There is no fortune in this cookie. This is a s***-sandwich and no amount of perfume is going to hide that fact. <br />

<br />
What you have missed ... forever ... is this: it doesn't work if you are civil, rational, logical or simply reasonable with SOE. That has been the downfall of the shaman community. Good people willing to find out what works best for the game ... working with a group that have no clue what works best, but a track record of finding balance on the backs of those who will effect the bottomline the least. Shaman are that choice. They keep playing and they pay to do so.<br />
<br />
I will give you kudos for being able to consistantly support the game time and time again after being slammed as a class. I say kudos because I have hope that you are just naturally a nice person that must look forever for the good in a situation. But there comes a point when even you have to step back and ask yourself ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u176"><b>redribbit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p176">I only have Leopard atm but I can honestly say it doesn't make us able to solo uber dragons/gods or kill mobs in High end content with ease. This spell merely aids us in taking on high level content much like any other spell out there. I will say this spell has boosted our dps (my 3rd Time raid proved this ten fold) The two groups that had a shaman Leopard enabled finished their trials first in Phase 1 but frankly that's the way it should be. It makes shaman as desirable as any other caster. If we can't get something that makes us desirable compared to say a beast or a chanter then what's the point of playing.<br />
<br />
They want us to group more... ok well if we can't find a group, that makes grouping rather difficult. Granted the server mergers may clear this up a little but it's like putting a bandaid over an amputated leg. Over time more will leave EQ, it's just the way it goes (people get bored and want to move on). How about making it so every class can survive solo and then work on their abilities to work well in groups. (EQ2 and WoW apparently do this). Panther/Leopard ROCKED. I just got it and I can't believe the money/time i spent to get it is going down the pooper. I will definitely be putting some feedback on this issue. I definitely don't mind that the pet procs the same as the character but 30 second cast time... for the love of jebus.</div></div><hr />

Know how to fix DoT aggro? Remove all counters from the Bane line. Done. Do you hear any necromancers complaining about their fire DoTs being instant aggro? Panther is a spell that solves one problem and creates others instead. That sort of thing is acceptable if the real problem is too hard to solve. But it is not. Fixing DoT aggro is exceedingly simple, yet SOE chooses not to.<br />

Still, your max DPS is set by the number of pets/melees, you hit a  hard cap on your DPS at some point, and most importantly you benefit from far fewer focus effects and AAs. A regular nuke benefits from crit AAs, nuke focuses, spell haste and mana preservation. Panther benefits from mana preservation and duration increases - both of which do not raise your max DPS.<br />
<br />
Its ridiculous to think that a ranting, raving bitch post can accomplish more than a calm, reasonable, adult one. <br />
I used to think that. Now, I am not so sure. I have tried to actively accomplish a little since late LDoN. I have seen the entire shaman community coming together to do just what you propose. We were ignored. Utterly, completely and repeatedly. Name one major shaman issue that was fixed since LDoN. I can't think of one. The thing that comes closest is the partial lowering of slow miigation in some zones. (Check that: partial. lowering. in some zones.)<br />
<br />
I think he is saying that with a 30 second re-cast, he will be able to keep it up on 3 targets FULL TIME, so when the mob is incoming, all 3 will have it. As the gem refreshes, the cycle continues, and in theory, as it fades on each target, it will be recast instantly.<br />
That is nice if you are actually fighting full time. I can seriously count the number of times that has happened to me on one hand. Once was in Chardok, once in Velketor's lab, once in a LDoN easy zone and once in Sebilis. In each case we usually had 3+ MOBs in camp. You simply cannot do this anymore. Keeping unmezzed MOBs around kills the group, keeping mezzed MOBs around kills the enchanter if you do not take the time to taunt. Even with an otherwise empty zone and chainpulling bards this sort of thing does not happen anymore. Realistically you are looking at 2/3 of actual fighting time. That is, when fighting &quot;nonstop&quot;. The only way to have more fighting time is barely controlled chaos - and that only works when everyone in the group can take a couple of rounds of max hits without worry.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I have no issues with buffs not providing the maximum benefit. But I do mind when I see these instant &quot;100 DPS, can keep up on 3 chars, 300 DPS&quot; calculations that only work if you forgo reality. Given pull times, assist times, time spent moving as well as the occassional lat refresh due to actually wanting to slow a freshly arrived MOB you are probably lucky to get half of the theoretically possible DPS.</div></div><hr />

There it is. Now you understand. Personally, I commend your honesty about the issue with Panther on pets (in your opinion...I don't agree 100%, but that's another topic or something), but the sad truth is the quote above.<br />

Another thing....everyone is just counting the proc messages and assuming it's 550 every singe time because of the resist adjust. Now, it might be close to this, but this spell DOES NOT hit for 550 every time.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine was using the OT hammer to gate out of WoS the other day and this is where I noticed this was not the case. He dueled me so he could proc out and I cast panther on him just for giggles. It was very brief, but I have a screenshot of a few procs on me before he gated and it didn't land for 550 on me a single time and I even managed to flat out resist it once. My resist average was probably in the 200 range. So the 240dps on pets is more than likely a fictional number anyway.<br />

I'll try to post this ss later, but it's really crappy quality (apparently .jpg didn't handle the blue text on black background very well).<br />
<br />
edit, here we go. It's nearly impossible to make out the amount of the DD in this shot, but you can tell that's it's not 550 every time. They were in the 3-400 range each time on me and you can see 1 total resist as well. I'm sorry for the quality. Really, I'm just posting this because I think it would be worth looking into this further.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u180"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p180">PVP nuke damage is mitigated, it almost never hits for full. Against mobs it almost always lands for full though. Against a high resist paladin I dueled the nukes only did like 200dmg instead of 550dmg. Against a much lower resist monk I dueled it was doing around 400 or more. PVP acts alot different from PVE. Negative 300 chromatic pretty much means most NPCs aren't going to resist it and it's usually going to hit for max damage.</div></div><hr />

Yes, and there are OTHER AA and gear items that make Panther stronger. Quick buff, spell haste, mana pres. Its a wash.<br />

I have a lot of AA into FoM. I have a lot of AA into Crit Aff. Big deal. The BIGGEST gear influence we have is + mana and focii. Panther is aided by these just as well as our &quot;other damage alternatives&quot;.</div></div><hr />

That sort of thing is acceptable if the real problem is too hard to solve. But it is not. Fixing DoT aggro is exceedingly simple, yet SOE chooses not to.<br />
Come on Murtak. Even you have to admit the possibility that SOE has such horrible code on some things that this &quot;simple&quot; fix just isnt worth fixing, and they found a different way to give us DPS, other than &quot;the ability to cast another DOT without increased aggro&quot;. I am pretty damn sure that IF they could have done it as easily as 1, 2, 3 they would have by now. After all, its been our NUMBER ONE bitch for years. <br />

Your missing the point. When Wunshi fades, what do you do? You recast it. If your standing there when it blinks, you re-cast it and have uninterupted continuation of the buff.

I am SO disappointed in SOE with this nerf that I had to walk away before typing this to calm down.  Only thing I can say is &quot;***!!!!&quot;  The PC proc rate was just fine and sometimes a little streaky on the missing proc end, pets were a little nuts ok, but when you throw on a 30 second recast timer, that's crossing the line.  I will refuse to mem it unless I'm 2 boxing.  And even then, I doubt it'll get that much play.  Why?  Simple and like everyone else has stated already.  It was available to cast WHEN we needed it.  I'm not going to go into a rotation on pets/tanks for a 1.5 minute buff!  No way in hell.  I'll simply tell people tough ****. <br />
<br />
So now our whole &quot;revisioning&quot; bait got switched and other than the little perks they throw in like poison dot agro and small VP resist mod I think we're now a dying class.  I'm not saying we're totally useless but it's all downhill unless they pull their heads out and wise up.  I agree with others in that they've set us back an expansion behind every other class (except maybe those who got the crappy snare...what was that?!).  And with alchemy post-255 completely useless in attempting, where does leave us except back to buff bots?<br />
<br />
True this is all depending on what they do in this &quot;delayed&quot; patch.  I'm personally going to feedback every day until the patch to express my annoyance.<br />

<br />
You have really outdone yourself here.<br />
<br />
Lets start:<br />
<br />
1: For your 2 sources of group heals you not AA's and Epic.  For most people in non-raiding guilds, epic is quite hard.  My guild can not kill that mob.  No way, no how.  If you are using that as a class balancing issue, try again.  I group in RS, MPG all over, but there is no way that I'll get my epic in my current situation...as well as SEVERAL other Shaman I know. <br />
<br />
AA's. How many times has it been said that you shouldn't balance around AA's.<br />
<br />
2.  Dual Wield on dog dog...I was probably the biggest pusher for this of anyone when they failed to do it in the patch they said.  However, this was a ANNOYANCE and an issue of them not doing what they promised to do.  If you are counting that is an 'issue' or a class balance..you are playing both sides of the fence, since I remember YOU saying I shouldn't worry about it.<br />
<br />
3.  Comparing this to Focus.  You have got to be freaking kidding me.  I'm glad you are taking a week off since you have friend your brain.  Focus lasts (for me and my meager gear) 132 minutes.  That is 2+ hours.  Spirit of (with my meager gear/AA) 1:38 (I think).  To compare keeping focus on to keeping this one is just stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u186"><b>Srperro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p186">This is the typical guy, who just found out how a calculator works and &quot;bam! 240 DPS!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Use your brain. People like you make it easy for SoE to **** us over and over. When a mob is inc and you buff your first melee, how much are the other 2 doing to that mob, considering it will only be on the 2nd melee after no less than 33 seconds and no less than 66 on the 3rd?<br />
<br />
The rest of the post is just the usualy garbage.<br />
<br />
<br />
I did use my brain.  Your little post there assumes the first casting.  Theres something in EQ called &quot;cycling&quot;....ie keeping the buff going on 3 players so it never wears off.  I guess instead of doing this, you just sit back and join the bandwagon of complaints, instead of actually trying to improve your playing with what you got.<br />
<br />
Has the shaman class been completely screwed over many times? Yes.  But panther was the first big improvement I have seen since nihil, and I actually don't mind casting it.  I expected it to get nerfed.  <br />
<br />
As far as people like me making it easy for SoE to screw us....you must be completely out of it, if you think SoE can't do simple dps calculations themselves, such as parses.<br />
<br />
And seriously, if you are picking out just the dps part of my post to poke holes in it, you really miss the point altogether.<br />
<br />
edit:  (missed a post, responding to it) Three players is plenty of time for error.  Cast panther, 30 seconds later...cast 2nd, 30 seconds later...cast last one.  That still leaves about 30 seconds before you start the next cycle with extended buffs.</div></div><hr />

Look, we know there are several DoT lines without our aggro problems, namely every single one without counters. We also know that shaman casting these very spells (via charged items, or the epic 1.0 clickie) do not have aggro problems. Conclusion: Removing the counters will fix the aggro.<br />
<br />
Yes, one would think SOE would take the easy solution instead of making up a complicated one. However, one would also think they would tell us why they can not fix our DoT agro if there is some special shaman problem, right? Until that happens I am going to claim they are indeed as moronic in regards to coming up with solutions as their previous track record indicates. It is not like they have not implemented needlessly complicated solutions that are worse then the easy solutions before (see: slow mitigation).<br />

You make a claim. I show where you are wrong. You respond with a hissy fit, telling me to not split hairs. What kind of debate is this? I used to think of you as a level-headed person. Are you going to plug your ears and keep yelling &quot;I'm right, you're wrong!&quot; now?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2 new sources of group HoTs didnt improve our healing? As a &quot;back up healer&quot; I rarely have to use any heals BUT Anc Aid and Epic Clicky. <br />
And of course we were fine as backup healer before. We asked for some kind of main healer ability, or, failing that, for some sort of emergency heal. Which we did not get.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Doesnt our pet have innate dual wield now?<br />
Umm ... major shaman issue? We gained exactly zero power here. What we gained was some backpack slots.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Call of the Wild and Channeling arent solid additions to our class line up of abilities?<br />
Call of the Wild might actually count as a shaman issue. I did not think of that one - we had quite a few complaints about not being able to rez the real rezzers back. Channeling is heaps of extra power, yes. But it did not adress a single shaman issue. &quot;Yet more mana&quot; was not exactly high on our list.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your missing the point. When Wunshi fades, what do you do? You recast it. If your standing there when it blinks, you re-cast it and have uninterupted continuation of the buff. Think of the 3 target panther that way. When your standing there, its on. When your fighting, its on. You dont have to be fighting non-stop.

And he is saying that when Panther fades, he will re-cast it. Mobs in camp, pulls per hour, etc, those arent a factor here.<br />
I am missing the point? Did you even read my post? When Panther fades, again and again and again, what do you do? You recast it, if you can afford to. If you are busy healing or slowing you dont. That is the first time you lose DPS.<br />
<br />
Then, regardless of it being always on or not, you are not getting any procs when you are waiting for pulls, your melee is moving or your tank is taunting a mezzed add. That is the second time you lose DPS. Lots of DPS. However, nukes do not lose DPS from sitting there waiting. Neither do DoTs. Labeling this a non-factor in comparing different types of spells is ignoring reality.</div></div><hr />

I am just going to quote myself here.<br />
That is nice if you are actually fighting full time. I can seriously count the number of times that has happened to me on one hand. Once was in Chardok, once in Velketor's lab, once in a LDoN easy zone and once in Sebilis. In each case we usually had 3+ MOBs in camp. You simply cannot do this anymore. Keeping unmezzed MOBs around kills the group, keeping mezzed MOBs around kills the enchanter if you do not take the time to taunt. Even with an otherwise empty zone and chainpulling bards this sort of thing does not happen anymore. Realistically you are looking at 2/3 of actual fighting time. That is, when fighting &quot;nonstop&quot;. The only way to have more fighting time is barely controlled chaos - and that only works when everyone in the group can take a couple of rounds of max hits without worry.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I have no issues with buffs not providing the maximum benefit. But I do mind when I see these instant &quot;100 DPS, can keep up on 3 chars, 300 DPS&quot; calculations that only work if you forgo reality.

<br />
Max extension possible is having Bulwark of the Dragorn + SCRM. This gives you 108 (60*1.8) second buff.<br />
<br />
A round of 3 players will take 99 seconds. This leaves you 9 seconds as error, not as close as the 30 seconds you quote. Factor in lag, and I think we're looking at 0 error. (edit. Actually it's 12 seconds lee way as I have assumed you also have Anguish focus for spell haste)<br />
<br />
edit: My bad, forgot to factor in 30% spell haste too. 30% spell haste = 2.1 second cast time. This means casting 3 times you save 3 seconds. Still nowhere near this 30 second figure you quote.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Under ideal conditions (being able to immediately cast the spell when it refreshes) a Shaman with the maximum beneficial duration could maintain  it on three pets/pcs.<br />
<br />
Anything less than maximum beneficial duration and you would not be able to maintain it on three, unless you also assume no fizzles, interrupts, stuns, and so on.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say cycling(maintaining) Panther on three players gives you plenty of time for error by any means.<br />
<br />
You have to consider what these changes mean to those that don't have maximum beneficial duration also.<br />
<br />
*edit* Yeah, it's late(early). I neglected spell haste. but the idea still applies. Spell haste isn't going to give you that much more time.</div></div><hr />

Panther = 550/tick (lvl 69).  <br />
<br />
Panther is noticably better than Yoppa, but not Sisslak.  However if we examine the recast times of Yoppa and Sisslak we discover than Yoppa is recastable at 2.25 and Sisslak at 30.  Ahhh, things now become clear as to why the proposed panther recast time has been increased to 30, it is being balanced against the DPS of an existing spell.  That's why it's set at 30 second recast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u192"><b>Hilgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p192">Hey guys, first time poster here and I just wanted to add my perspective to this mess as a long time shaman.  I have to agree with Blazz here, I have read some of his posts on panther and I must say that the doomsayers and the people threatening to quit the game if this change goes live are all being overly dramatic.  Take a look at your class before spouting off such tripe.  We can heal better than druids, we can still slow better than any class (although they do seem to be giving us the shaft on our mainstay ability) and our buffs are very arguably the best buffs in the game.  We are a very solid class even without panther in the game.  <br />
I had mixed feelings about panther as a new buff line in the first place.  We already had 2 buff lines to increase melee dps, focus /w the extended str/dex cap and the fa/champ +attack and % damage line.  Adding in another buff line just seemed to be a contrived way of fixing the biggest problem that our class was having without taking a look at a real way to solve the problem, which is being one of the lowest dps classes in the game.  Our biggest problem is the uselessness of our dots and nukes in exp and raid situations.  The cast time and damage of our nukes is so deplorable that most hybrids outdamage us with nukes.  Our DoTs have no resistance mods so the chance of landing them on raid mobs outside of GoD is outlandish.  In group situations only our magic dots are useful, and even then for them to land mobs have to be debuffed first usually leading to only being able to really get 1 dot to run its full length on the mob, lessening the damage to mana ratio of the spells.<br />
Then enter panther.  I have already established that we are one of the stronger classes in terms of healing(2), buffing(1), and slowing(1) - all the basis for our class.  I will admit that the slowing edge seems to be disappearing with every expansion and revision, and I we have yet to see if this new revisioning will make druids better choices in healers than us.  I'm still relatively happy with the oow expansion, it took us from the absolute worst buffing class in the game (bls and pallys were more useful than us by far)to probably the best one in my opinion.  Now panther.  If you can't see that its game unbalancing in its current form then you shouldn't be posting on these forums.  Easily being able to add 500+ dps to melee groups and 800+ dps to pet groups with panther alone is more dps than any one class... think about it a second.  Second best healers, best buffers, best slowers, best dps?  I don't want to play the uber class, I want a balanced game.  Consider the raid end of the spell which was even more dramatic - with spiritual channeling 2 shaman with 1 dedicated healer could keep an entire raid buffed with panther for 6 or 7 minutes... more than enough to destroy most any fight.  If you don't believe me let me give you a personal anecdote.  I play on FV, and there are only 3 guilds that are time plus on the server with a very limited pool of players to recruit from.  Our guild had been working on Uqua for about 3 weeks before DoN came out  and were having a tough time with it.  Being on the server FV means that everyone can only have one account... meaning that there is an inordinate amount of shamans/bsts/tanks and very very few true cc classes and true dps classes such as chanters and rogues and wizards.  Before DoN simply put we couldn't beat Barxt.  We didn't have the DPS to kill him before the 5 minute mark and we didn't have the CC to be able to handle the 12 mobs at once that he spawned afterwards.  We were in a catch 22.  Post leapord we annihilated him in less than 2 minutes, golem and all...  It was over a 300% increase in the DPS of our guild in a short term fight which happens to be about the length of most single mob raid encounters (not events)<br />
Now that being said and having established that this spell needed to be nerfed I would like to add that this nerf is simply not an option.  While SoE is improving most other classes they are adding absolutely nothing to our class, relying on the DPS increase of the panther spell to bring us in line with the other classes.  The 30 second delay makes the spell uncastable and really adds little dps over our dots...  They need to find a happy medium.  I would suggest lowering the damage of the spell by about 25% and making it group only and nerfing its damage on pets.  This would alleviate us being more DPS than any other class while still adding a significant boost to our DPS, and taking the raid abuse aspect of the spell w/o going to great lengths to abuse it.  <br />
I'm not sure if I like blazz's idea about setting the recast timer to 10 seconds though.  In my opinion I hate recast timers... I already have to watch champion/fa and my canni, and watching another would simply not be fun.  Worrying about fa and a panther rotation is simply ridiculous... worrying about buff rotations takes the fun out of the game, if they went this route I would ask that they take the line out entirely and work to improve our dps by giving us some worthwhile nukes.<br />
<br />
Anyways, to steal a line from o'reilly sorry about the bloviating...<br />

In one word - no. If you disregard panther we have our now-not-completely-useless stat buff replacements, the worst HP buffs in the game and a crappy haste. We outbuff rangers, outbuff paladins only if there is no haste source around, are at best tied with beastlord and are outdone by bards, enchanters and clerics.<br />
<br />
Then enter panther.  I have already established that we are one of the stronger classes in terms of healing(2), buffing(1), and slowing(1) - all the basis for our class.<br />
Healing? Tied for second place with paladins and druids. Buffing? Tied for fourth place. Slowing? First place, yep. Damage prevention? Third place at best. And whats with these categories? Is buffing a goal of the game? No, overcoming encounters is. Is it a direct means of overcoming encounters? No, added DPS and added survivability are. If you want to compare roles compare defense (damage prevention and healing), offense (direct and indirect DPS) and tanking. If you insist, feel free to also compare utility (out of combat stuff like rez, invis and the likes). But slowing and buffing are not roles. No more then &quot;making people run faster&quot;, &quot;feigning death&quot; and &quot;lifetapping&quot; are.<br />
<br />
So (without panther):<br />
Offense - direct: dead last<br />
Offense - indirect: tied for 3rd.<br />
Defense - healing: tied for second place, barely<br />
Defense - prevention: third<br />
tanking: too low to list, somewhere barely above magicians<br />
utility: above berserkers and beastlords I guess<br />
<br />
I'm still relatively happy with the oow expansion, it took us from the absolute worst buffing class in the game (bls and pallys were more useful than us by far)to probably the best one in my opinion.<br />
How? By letting us partly catch up to what clerics got with spell haste and vie? I still have not seen anyone being able to parse a difference with or without the avoidance buff, meaning it is probably right around the 1.5% actual in-game effect we predicted when we saw the spell. To match that a CHing clerics merely needs to get a 180 HPs bigger HP buff on a 12K tank.<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said, I agree with you about the form the adjustments to panther should take. There is no reason at all for the way they changed it.</div></div><hr />

Adding a 30 sec cast time on a spell that lasts 1 minute unadjusted makes it totally ineffective to use.  I would relegate it to very situational duty, just like FA.  The quick cast/recast time is what makes this short duration buff effective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A round of 3 players will take 99 seconds. This leaves you 9 seconds as error, not as close as the 30 seconds you quote. Factor in lag, and I think we're looking at 0 error. (edit. Actually it's 12 seconds lee way as I have assumed you also have Anguish focus for spell haste)<br />
<br />
edit: My bad, forgot to factor in 30% spell haste too. 30% spell haste = 2.1 second cast time. This means casting 3 times you save 3 seconds. Still nowhere near this 30 second figure you quote.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off panther lasts more than 99 seconds for me.  Second, all I said was your next cycle starts in about 30 seconds.  I didn't say you have 30 seconds after the cooldown.  Even if you don't cast it on time, SO WHAT????  If all you have, is to scrutinize simple dps calculations and poke holes in them, I don't know what is wrong with you.<br />
<br />
Assume all my calculations are all wrong and panther on 2 people only, just equals a rather sucking 100 dps.  We are NOT supposed to be dps machines.  We still heal, slow and various other things.  If you can't see that and need to pick apart dps calculations, then by all means, go ahead and cancel your EQ account.  Panther is still the best new addition to shaman class in a long while.<br />
<br />
Putting the 30 second recast on it, turns it into a non-agro version of sisslak/bane without resists.  I for one, (and i seem to be the only one) will still be memming panther over any dot.<br />
<br />
All the complaining in the world from us, isn't going to change SoE's mind.  You know why?  Because even though melee love this buff, most people in EVERY other class still complain that we even have this buff the way it is now, and how broken it is.  We can suddenly out-dps indirectly, every class in the game.  Oh sure, we can't heal when we do it and it will take all our mana, but the option is still there.  I can see why other classes complain.<br />
<br />
Imagine the opposite, if rangers (assuming rangers are a top dps class  in your guild/server like mine) had the option, to main heal groups, but it would take all/most their mana and they couldn't attack.  Would you not be complaining?<br />
<br />

Small sidetrack, rangers heals are getting a bump.  I've healed in wos with tnargs before.  With a good tank, a ranger with the 1100hp heal could heal in xp groups.  Not WELL, but it can be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dots are different then panther.  First there is the agro problem. Second you would have to switch dots out (mem diff ones) unless you are just nuts and have 6+ dots memmed at the same time.  Plus there are resists.  Still, it does not compare to panther, in part due to it only taking up one slot.<br />
<br />
The fact is, and this is not my opinion -- Any shaman who chain casts panther (in its current state), for example on a raid, will indirectly out-dps any class in the game until oom.  Of course we are limited by mana.<br />
<br />
Yes I know about ranger heals getting bumped up.  I guess that was a bad example being you don't see my point. My fault there.  I just about give up here on this subject.  So, I will go on having fun with panther in EQ, while the majority of you can complain and quit.  In the end, this is just a game.  Have fun arguing with SoE.<br />
<br />
And btw, I'm not misinformed.  I'm just objective and can see both sides here.  If you can't see that shaman weren't meant to bust out 800+ dps with buffs on the spot, then you are just nuts.</div></div><hr />

Guess I dont see the point, you said we'd be upset if rangers could function as a healer if he/she was willing to blow his/her mana pool.  They can, no big deal, so can paladins.  Dont think I've heard too many shamans upset about it.<br />

<br />
<br />
Why not?<br />
<br />
And, yes, it's actually a serious question. <br />
<br />
These spells were meant to do one thing and one thing only, add dps. I find it incredibly hard to believe that SoE didn't think we might cast a single target, zero refresh spell on more than one character. I find it even more unbelievable that they didn't realize that a well equiped shaman with channeling might be able to buff an entire raid force if he/she so desired. With the exception of the pet proc rate, these spells are pretty straight forward. Cast it on one character, you get an increase of x dps. Cast it on two characters you get ~2x, etc, etc. If SoE is so far out of the loop that they didn't realize the outcome of mana burn with these spells, then my friend, we're all in trouble. <br />
<br />
<br />
If the tone of this post is harsh, I apologize. Like Blazz, though for different reasons, I'm also in the 'toss things' stage. I find it inconceivable (and for the PB fans, yes, I do know what it means) that SoE is making any changes to the spells at all (pet proc's need to be addressed but that should be a completely separate issue). If the spells had some kind of hidden effect (eg: caused all proc's to be increased to 400) then I could understand the reason for a change. But again, adding a xxx pt proc at a 400 rate is about as straight forward as it comes. If it was too powerful it either shouldn't have gone live or should have gone live in a lessor form. Anything else is, well, nuts. :) <br />

<br />
I'm in the same boat here.  Why not?<br />
<br />
When I raid, if full buffs are called, I contribute ~680 hp and PR/DR.<br />
An enchanter contributes 70% haste MR.<br />
<br />
How much dps is 70% haste?  Way more than panther.  <br />
<br />
Why do the kings of melee buffing, on a raid, provide the least amount of dps via their buffs?  <br />
<br />
I guess I assumed when the spell was released, that it was intended to CHANGE THE STATUS QUO.  I now know that wasn't the intention at all.  The very first thing I thought of when the spell came out was casting this on 12+ melee in a row on a raid.  I guess most shaman that are furious about the change all assumed that Rytan and company put the spell out in that form for exactly that reason.  I guess they just didn't think of us casting it like that... <br />
<br />
Apparently, the &quot;class revisioning&quot; was about keeping the status quo.  Namely, shaman remaining the Jack of all trades, master of none.  <br />
<br />
So, in the end, I can now do slightly more dps than my dots (in an absolutely ideal group setup), but in reality, I'll be doing probably about the same damage, with 3-4x the work (from running a buff cycle perpetually).</div></div><hr />

I totally hate to be reduced to cast 1 spell non-stop on every melee char I see on a raid (or every melee in group). I see the potential of the damage, so I cast the spell. But that's the only reason.<br />

It's like holding a bone in front of a dog and when they finally get it, it turns to dust. Cute way to keep your fan base SOE :P. Leopard/Panther are the only spells in the new expansion that are taking a hit like this which is lame to say the least.<br />
<br />
Like others have said there is no reason this spell couldn't stay the same recast and make it group/pets only, or a number of other ways to adjust the spell without making another FA type spell. <br />

Panther makes a noticable difference in DPS.  Avatar doesn't so much once attack over 2200ish.  There's a lot of difference between tossing a buff you need 3 hours of parsing to find out if it changes anything and something that makes the mob die faster visibly.  Of course with the multiple nerfs of panther, its a lot more of annoyance now.</div></div><hr />

SOEs stupidity wasnt in the testing process, it was not being bright enough to say &quot;wait a sec, some Shaman can channel and cast this thing on 20 players pretty fast, that seems awefully powerful&quot; or &quot;hey, remember that stupid pet-proc bug code we never fixed cause its such a pain, is this new Panther thing gonna proc like 30 times a minute because of it? Thats like 250 dps!&quot;. <br />
<br />
The people who write these spells shuold have a REASONABLE idea of how they are going to be used, especially one THIS obvious. I mean come ON, first time I got Leopard I had the Druid summoning Boo Boo within 10 minutes. Not hard to see &quot;wow, 15 procs in that 30 second fight, hey, Chanter, get the floating swords out, and hey druid, wheres Boo Boo&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Consider that you might appear to be just a little frenzied right now and calm it.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing near 100. I'm also guessing that he says the exact same thing in every single post, just reworded a bit.</div></div><hr />

Na, Blazz is now the official word on what part of the spell is 'ok' to nerf and what part isn't.  Good to see he is trying to take the lead..yet again.  Let's just sit back and watch the fun.</div></div><hr />
