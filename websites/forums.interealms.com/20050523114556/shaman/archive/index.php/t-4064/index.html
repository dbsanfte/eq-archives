<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well whe i wanted to know how long i had for canni 5 to be ready,<br />
i just hitted the &quot;V&quot; key and it was very accuracy.<br />
now it's never shown the good remaining time.<br />
so now i hit the canni 5 hotkey to know the time remaining,to be able to cast torpor just before casting can 5.<br />
<br />
so i died because of the lag,i casted canni 5 but i was lagging at same time so i moved fast and hitted &quot;D&quot; button,and i died about 30 sec later,<br />
humm that s suck and i hope they will fix it soon,</div></div><hr />
