<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got my JBB (lvl 48) and spent one hour in the undead camp in DL soloing Dark Blue Skels, never resting never medding nothing....1 and 1/2 Yellows of exp and 90pp!<br />
<br />
How did I ever live without this thing?  I am amazed everytime I use it.  Here is what i am doing...let me know if I can improve.<br />
<br />
Pull mob with JBB, Root, JBB, JBB, JBB, JBB (Reapply Root when needed) JBB, JBB, JBB....thinking...this is too easy!<br />
<br />
WHOA!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">JBB doesnt break the root like every time??<br />
<br />
grats on gettin it tho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, I got epic at 51 for my shaman twink &amp; got jbb at 52...<br />
<br />
I feel like i'm cheating :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah, you ARE cheating :P Hehe, I spent 8 hours in PLA (crypt on some servers, I guess) yesterday with only 1 Arch Duke spawn who dropped.... a Yak Club. We did Emp too, whom we dropped 2 times (Mala and some necro spell) and blood of chottai several times. Was a lot of fun and good company tho, so I'm not complaining that much :)<br />
<br />
I know that the JBB is his ultra rare drop, but I'm gonna camp it and get the damned thing. Am I nuts to do this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Let's see, are you nuts to camp the JBB?  In a word: NO!<br />
<br />
I've been level 60 for months, and I still wear mine.  I still consider it one of the sweetest items in the game for Shammy's and the only time I change it out is when fighting Trak or some other dragon that's heavy into Disease or a completely MR mob.  This is any soloist shammy's must-have and I know of one shammy who actually soloed a dragon (non-fearing) with just this, Torpor and the Epic.  <br />
<br />
When you need to stop Canabalising for a little while and don't have the mana to spend on Bane and the like, hit this little beaty for 264 free hits damage every 8 secs, your party will thank you for puting them off the top and not allowing the other KSing bastages in your raid to get all the exp!   :)</div></div><hr />

I prefer using mana for the ww dragons, gives it that personal touch =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been told that JBB is easy to channel and rarely interrupted..so no reason not to melee / JBB. Of course, I'm only 44 and haven't been able to test this out....yet :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you ever try JBB on WW dragon, you will see thing is lots easier, it hit full DD most of time, and not longer need canni during fight</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For soloing seafuries or BW giants, I like:<br />
<br />
Pull with slow, send in pet, JBB till dead<br />
<br />
With regrowth, alacrity and buffs on 49 doggie, pet can hold aggro without rooting.<br />
<br />
If you get high hp mob like forest giant ancients in BW, gotta add EBolts to the JBB nukes, then you take the aggro and tank the mob.  Root and back off if you want to spread the hp loss to doggie.<br />
<br />
Works fantastic, especially with a horse because you are medding the whole time if melee is off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sigh. <br />
I hate/envy all of you.<br />
No JBB, no Epic, no Guild, no Fungi.<br />
Just bought a SBS at the Bazaar for 1200pp so I'm <br />
uber!<br />
<br />
It's tough being guildless. The best chances I usually have is when my level 60 cleric friend lets me tag along with his uberguild.<br />
<br />
Shoot, I've never even visited the Planes.<br />

JBB is evil !!! So horrifying it makes Cazic Thule crap his pants !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gazkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">When solo exp hunting I like to go after weak mobs like Katta guards... since I now have torpor and can heal extremely well, I pull with slow, send in pet, cast pox, cast epic... then I pull another one with slow, cast pox, and epic.. and jbb the crap out of em.. 2 dead guards in 2 minutes, and if the doggy gets hurt i can just torpor him, but fully buffed he rarely is.  Having a horse to use with the jbb is that much better.. I'd get one ASAP, and hang out in &quot;outdoor dungeons&quot; like CT, KC, COM, and Katta when doing exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cgur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I cant live without my JBB!  Have Epic and Barbarian Spiritualist Hammer which also procures Winter's Roar.  I will slow mobs, epic dot em, then switch to hammer and use JBB.  The hammer hits very slow but will cycle through during JBB casts and will strike immediatly after JBB lands.  Even though I only hit maybe 15 times with hammer during fight, depending on what Im fighting, hammer procures fairly often and I still love seeing two hits back to back for 263 each of manaless DD.  Add the dmg from the hammer and I can easily to 600dmg in 10 sec with no mana used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I still remember me and a chanter at lvl 50 doing the entire level at the spirocs in Timorous.  The chanter pulled with tash, I slowed on inc, bird hits him once, his pet engages, my pet is sicced, I apply Venom of the Snake and start firing off the bracer while tanking.  We killed so many and so fast that the druid who showed up for his usual quad kite was whining that there were no spirocs left for him!  We even had to pull the Spiroc Warrior ( 51 shaman mob) cause we didn't have anything left to kill.  <br />
<br />
JBB is power at low levels.  At high levels it's still a dmg supplement to add that extra kick to the dots I already have working on the mobs.  I don't solo anything weak, so the hps I count on a mob to have are around 7-8k hps.  I can do that dmg no problem in about 2 minutes without significant downtime in between kills.  But i'd say that canni5 makes that possible a lot more than JBB does.  JBB alone would take me like 10 minutes to kill something.  That would cut my efficiency by 300%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">JBB is still most effeciency to kill mob for those oracle don't have torpor/canni5, especial at outdoor zone with horse combo;<br />
<br />
I ususlly just dot and canni during tanking and click JBB only when mob start run, or sometime choose to click JBB nuke when not worth recast another dot<br />
<br />
for grouping, it is nice to click JBB nuke and fun watch the mob finished by your nuke. disease dot is too long, poison is huge agro and little bit long too.  JBB can also land on lots of raid mob too which give you something fun to do without worry about mana</div></div><hr />
