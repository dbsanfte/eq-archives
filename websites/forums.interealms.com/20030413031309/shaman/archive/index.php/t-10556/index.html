<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ishrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got done killing the Arisen Iksar that is spawned when you give Oracle Qulin (in FOB) a dusty skull from Howling Stones. When I went back to find the Oracle (fight had taken me some distance away) he was no where to be found. When I came back about two hours later I found him and turned in the Wet Skull Fragments from the Arisen Iksar, but the Oracle said he didn't want that item and gave it back.<br />
     What did I do wrong? Do I have to do this part over and turn it in faster or something?<br />
     I'd appreciate any help, thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haven't done #7 yet, but I'd guess he re-spawns as a temporary script version of Qulin when you hand him the skull, and only he accepts the wet fragments, then despawns after a time. If so, you'll need another dusty skull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You will need to get another skull for the turn-in, but you should be able to avoid the fight and simply give the oracle your skull fragments after you give him the skull.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slisth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Does Oracle Qulin aggro on your party members when this fight is happening? Should the Arisen be pulled away to keep this from happening?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes he will aggro on anyone without either the proper faction, or just for kicks.   <br />
<br />
Ok j/k on the last part, but be careful when bringing your party onto that beach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, when I did it I had my group stay well down the beach, I pulled the arisen to them.<br />
<br />
Then I ran back to the iksar.</div></div><hr />
