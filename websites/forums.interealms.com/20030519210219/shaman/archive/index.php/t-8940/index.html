<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remember a post about a month ago or so that questioned the lack of Chain drops in HoT.<br />
<br />
Friday night I was fortunate to be included in our first one group excursion in to HoT :)  Group was 65 war, 65 clr, 65 enc, 60 dru, 60 monk and me (61 shm). Broke into HoT and 5 hours later, we had a Leather BP, a Silk Robe, 4 more silk drops, 7 plate drops AND Chain legs and boots for yours truly :D <br />
<br />
Last night we did it again, 65 war, 65 clr, 65 enc, 61 mage, 62 wiz and me. Setup in Doze's room this time and got 2 chain arms, silk boots and 2 plate helms in 4 hours.<br />
<br />
So it is indeed random. You just have to keep pluggin away at it.<br />
<br />
I love being there with a single group, less stress and less downtime, nice AA xp.  AND, how great is it to land Malosini and Slow easier :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Now that's funny mono :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">nice stats!  That owns.<br />
<br />
one of the most interesting things is that Fiery Guardians only drop Plate and Silk!  At first I thought that it was coincidence, but then I looked back at the very old list I have from when we were doing HoT more often.<br />
<br />
*A fiery guardian<br />
	Kills: 52<br />
	Armor Drops: 20<br />
<br />
Plate:  BP, Bracer x 2, Gloves x 3, Pants, Helmet x 2, Arms x 2, Boots x 3<br />
<br />
Silk: Gloves x 2, Bracer x 2 , Sleeves<br />
<br />
<br />
We have been trying to finish some Dozekar quests recently and so have been driving through.  I swear to you, the most common piece of armor this month in HOT is chain boots.  We have got like 11 pairs.  Every member of my guild has a pair in the bank for MQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Did HoT the other week with guild.<br />
<br />
Only chain class not to have won anything when the BP dropped.<br />
<br />
Yep me :)<br />
<br />
Then next mob another Chain BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>monotikitia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Now that's funny mono<br />
<br />
I keep those stats, I'm allowed to call myself anal :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Very nice stats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">wow very nice breakdown</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That is a nice job indeed.  <br />
<br />
It stuck my funnybone to see all that data.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did you see all the @$#%!#$!# chain gloves that dropped?<br />
<br />
Sob!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">this monday on the HoT raid i attended i won a chain helm BUT omg,was it the night of plate drops. 1 set of plate legs, 4 sets of plate arms, a crapload of plate bracers and gloves. two weeks before that a shaman friend of mine went with the same group with no pieces, and came out missing only her legs and chest pieces. i only hope i end up witha night like that =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>monotikitia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We routinely joke about the plate boots drop rate...to the point that there is an enormous cheer when the first set drops for a given raid.  Everyone has a pair of plate boots at this point, most of the casters are even lugging around some.<br />
<br />
Leather gloves are the other joke.  Nobody but nobody wants them.</div></div><hr />
