<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You are in Ldon, 3 mobs, and 2 decide to ninja resist slow. Resists are becomming more and more frustrating because I want to slow and Bane a mob before the mob is dead.  Well anyway before someone mentions about debuffing before, I do I use malosini memmed. Then with resists of that sucks, and Malos is to slow<br />
<br />
I was thinking it would have been kinda good if slow was scaled instead of a straight out resist. Ie You cast slow on a mob instead of straight out resist it slows the mob but not by the full % ie mitigates according to the resist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, but it'd be nasty never knowing just how much of your slow landed, unless they implement something, have it not work for a few weeks, patch it, and maybe get it right.<br />
I know, It'd be wonderful to not get those resist messages, but I like knowing that my mob is or is not fully slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">By 'ninja resist' do you mean getting resisted 100% or that your slow was mitigated? Either way, once malos has been cast, Ive never had a problem slowing a LDoN mob...even on hard setting. Now, if you are saying that when you get a 'your spell was partially succesful' message it would tell you the exact percentage, I totally agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tend to never mem malos/sinia on normal mode. I will use tigirs in my malos slot. I mem malos for bosses if no other debuffer. I keep malos up in hard mode in case enchanter dies, but don't use it much.<br />
<br />
Also, how come 3 mobs magically appear? I find we usually rush room to room, or break bigger rooms with short pulls, plenty of time to root on Incoming, or peel adds with slow/park etc. we usually know when to expect adds ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wish I could get away from having malxxx memmed.  Whenever I'm adventuring with my shaman, I have a wizard guildie in the group who whines incessantly if I don't mal(osini, usually) the mobs.<br />
<br />
I guess he doesn't like to blow a strike of solusek.</div></div><hr />
