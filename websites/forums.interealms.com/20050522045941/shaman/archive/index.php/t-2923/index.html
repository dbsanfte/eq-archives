<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">begin scribing a spell, then drop it in the middle of scribing it.  You end up with the spell in your book, and a copy on the ground to pick up.  <br />
<br />
I started a level 1 shaman on test and ended up with an extra copy of inner fire,  I was able to sell it to a vendor for some gold that i used to buy some some extra food.<br />
<br />
To bad they fixed it, maybe we can make a petition?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hehe it was a bug that would have benfited people, they always find those ones generally :)<br />
<br />
I wonder if the person that bug reported it got a free account for life as this is a dupe bug and verant did mention that if you reported a bug for dupes that you could reproduce you would get your account for free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, now, if you couldn't reproduce it, it wouldn't be a dup bug, would it?  :D</div></div><hr />
