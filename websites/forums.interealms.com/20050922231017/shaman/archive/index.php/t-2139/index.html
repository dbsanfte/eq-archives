<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was hoping to glean some wisdom about Kaesora.  The xp bonus is very attractive, as well as the loot.  What's been people's experience in Kaesora?  I'm a 40 ikky shaman and have a 41 monk with me.  I've read the allakhazam boards, but I was hoping to get some shaman specific stories, most of the posts I read were by necro's for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Probably heard a lot from Necro's talking about the fear staff Xalgoz drops.<br />
<br />
As to duo'ing I was going to make another monk duo post, however we haven't tried moving down farther toward Xalgoz's lair where after 40 the xp is probably better.  <br />
<br />
We went there Wednesday and fought down to the library area.  We camped out front and once we had the spawn broke it was great xp until we had a bad pull where the mobs just wouldn't forget the monk.  After the monk dinged 40 he noted that some of the skeletal minions were light blue.<br />
<br />
Here goes the path down:<br />
<br />
After zoning in move up and drop down the shaft to the left.  You don't need levi for that one, you don't take that much damage from the fall.  Invis the monk and have him check the room to the right for mobs that see invis (indiff = no, ready to attk = yes).  If those 3 are indifferent then have him check thru the door that is accross the room.  There are two spawns in there.  Hang a left thru that door and there is a secret door (illusion wall) you walk thru.  Go thru it, take a left and stop at the top of the ramp.  Down at the bottom and around the corner are three undead mobs.  This is where you start to split and fight down.  At the bottom we set up camp in front of the library, off to it's left in the alcove that is accross from the hall you come in from.  Only wanderers come here, no static spawns.<br />
<br />
Most of the wanderer mobs are Skeletal Warders, clerics, that are mostly annoying.  Best bet is to beat them down fast so they waste time healing themselves instead of nuking you.  I just thru envenomed breath and this kept their hp dropping fast enough, along with the monks swings that most of their mana was spent healing themselves.  Don't waste much more mana than that because its really a waste with them G'healing constantly.  They only have enough mana for about 6 heals.<br />
<br />
We lucked out and had no see invis mobs so we could just avoid spiders.<br />
<br />
Our next plan is to head down to the area where Xalgoz is, not to pull him but all his minions in the areas around there.  There is a safe spot down there just as you enter his church cavern if you hug the right wall, nothing spawns there and only paths that way if you pull to it.  However I think killing the hall wanderer and pulling to the hall to break up the spawns would be a good idea.  <br />
<br />
Getting down there however will involve fighting your way past the spiders because you will almost certainly find one that see's invis.  If you don't have snare be ready to finish them fast when they start to run.  It would be so much easier as well if we had invis to dead for the area past the spiders to just go past the wanderers and such above Xalgoz's area but you'll have to fight down without it.<br />
<br />
I would recommend avoiding Xalgoz until 45th or so (this is from memory) because he's a nasty necro if you can't take him down fast.  Of course at 45th I'm guessing is when you'll start to see this dungeon go light blue/green.  Probably can eek 46th out of it.  I know when I was down there at 51 with my bard I could single pull anything down there with range cause it was all green, except Xalgoz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the guide.  Looking forward to hitting the zone.  Call me crazy, but there's something cool about leveling in zones that no one goes to, or for that matter any zone that isn't in the lemming cycle (LOIO, FM, OT, DL).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The other bonus is you may get lucky when you kill any spiders and pick up a straithbone shell shield. ;)<br />
<br />
But I completely agree with leveling in places where no one else does, its fun and avoiding the crowds is always nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wotjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually the spiders are good xp until 40, and after.  Yes, a lot of them are casters.  However, myself and a 40ish warrior ( i was under 40 at teh time) form time to time kill the spiders and whatever else wanders thru.  Its a good idea to for a shaman since they drop that nice 18 ac 8 wis shield.  Keep your melee hasted as mana permits, and slow whatever he's fighting.  Personally, i prefer a tank cause they can take more damage, but really anyone who can taunt the mobs off you will work.  keep their hit points, ac, and resists buffed up.  We didnt really ever move past the spiders as we were both looking for the shield to drop, me for me and him for his cleric alt, tho we have explored up to runlelord's area.  This is a great zone, with some very nice items that drop, along with several items for quests like key to howling stone and cannibilize2.  and yah, xp is great here even in mid 40's tho you have to move in further to get it ).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shoeby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay guys, I've got a question for you then.  I have a level 56 Enchanter pet.  He is my personal slave.  I'm currently a lvl 31 Barbarian Shaman.  Twinked on the breastplate (iksar regen) nothing too great in any of the other slots.  Was wondering when can we come down here and get good experience?  It's been my experience that the best exp comes from consta-pulling blue mobs.  That being said, I was just curious as to when stuff here would start turning blue.  And your thoughts on whether or not I could take it out with my enchanter pet at that level.  Oh by the way every once in a while i have a 39 SK that comes and battles by my side.  Just if that makes a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I went down to Kaesora when I was about level 47 &amp; had a level 50 SK &amp; a level 50 wiz with me. We cleaned house. There are a number of good drops there &amp; the xp is awesome. :)</div></div><hr />
