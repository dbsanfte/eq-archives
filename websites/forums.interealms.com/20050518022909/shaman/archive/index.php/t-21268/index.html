<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lich counts as a dot so necros recieve no regen boost while they have lich on.</div></div><hr />

Lol another heavily tested,excellently coded &quot;improvement&quot; from those wonderful Devs at SoE.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Belinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Please dont flame me but for Young Shamans THIS is a big boost.<br />
Im only 39 atm and with Chloro and my Iksar Tunic + the new Regen i feel a bit in &quot;God Modus &quot;.<br />
This feature wont help any 65 but its nice for the low lvl player.<br />
As much as i like to Blame SOE,this time they did something &quot;good&quot;.<br />
At least for the younger once. And not every young player has 300k in bank or a Druid to PL him.And even if you have Ldon it is  not for 100% <br />
sure that you will get a group, so you sometimes can only solo and this feature helps alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Overall this is a boost for low to mid levels, but I just knew that they mess up something. Doubt there was any real testing done with this, basically one day I saw this new and fresh announcement, that this new feature will be implemented, and couple of days later, blam, patch is in and feature as well. I knew that it would be too much to expect it to work correctly right away :)<br />
<br />
Hopefully it will be fixed soon enough for the races, who have extra regen as racial trait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's a good change for lower level peeps and I'm glad it's in.  I can't imagine that while shaman are getting frustrated with underpowered heals and useless regen in GoD against 800 quaders that a 4 point per tick regen is a serious nerf.  While it does need to be addressed, I can't see this as being any more serious than being unable to shrink our pets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its only a big deal because of the exp penalty that was paid to get the regen in the first place. Like they say, its the principle.</div></div><hr />
