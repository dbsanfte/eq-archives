ok so you wanna own SFK ?<br />
do you have 4 friends ? do you think you can get 4 people ? moderate skill around lvl 24+ ? then go for it!<br />
<br />
ok most of the mobs in SFK are 20+ elite.<br />
<br />
most are just straight melee, but others such as the undead spirits can silence, curse, stun and cast spells.<br />
one curse makes spirits come from the ether and attack you, one hit kills them (they have 1 hp), i wish i had a map i could spot all locations to you with it, but i do not. the undead horses, do not **** with them, they can chain stun your whole group and wipe you very fast, leave them alone!<br />
<br />
the sons of arugal curse with a curse that lasts 5 mins and ever minute does 200+ damage to you, pretty nasty.<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
the gate to the courtyard is locked, you must free the death stalker adamant in the dungeon to get in the courtyard, you must kill rethilgore  to get him free.<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=12975<br />
<br />
once hes dead, and you open the cell, talk to him, and lead him to the door, leave the human mage alone, hes not worth the effort.<br />
<br />
the courtyard is huge, holds around 25+ mobs, all tight packed, pull the left ones first!.<br />
<br />
Deathstalker Vincent is on the left, hes for a quest. http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=1098<br />
<br />
ok so you've cleared the courtyard ? cool, no pass those horses on the right stable, leave them alone !<br />
<br />
see that door going into the halls below ? don't go up the ramp to the right, you want to kill the sub-bosses for thier loot. so down we go !<br />
<br />
you will encounter curse using undead here, haunting servitors be careful.<br />
<br />
Razorclaw the butcher drops http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=1292<br />
and is near by make sure you have some form of crowd controll for when you get adds.<br />
<br />
once hes dead the dungeon opens up into a great eating hall, lots of cursing undead as befor.<br />
<br />
Baron Silverlaine  is in here, he drops<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6321<br />
he casts spells like lightning, and fireball. use earth shocks or stun spells on him.<br />
<br />
go up the left stair case. hit a landing, go up the left, kill 1-3 mobs wandering the stairs, and befor you hit the next room, hold there, don't go in, or your gunna wipe. you will see wailing guardsmen and other undead spirits, these guys silence, pull them 1-2 at a time, keep casters back, pull towards the right side of the room, so as to have a place to downtime near.<br />
<br />
Commander Springvale<br />
he silences, hes a paladin, hes one tough bastard. o yea he also heals himself... HOORAY !<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6320<br />
<br />
just a few more silence mobs in the next hall after.<br />
<br />
sometimes a random spawn can happen and you might get the<br />
DeathSworn captain<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6642<br />
 or Tormented Officer<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=1489<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=1484<br />
<br />
<br />
after clearing the parapets, you will come to a room, up a wooden flight of stairs.<br />
<br />
Odo the Blindwatcher<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6318<br />
he has bats in his room, KILL THE DAMN BATS FIRST ! they come as a group of three no matter who you pull.<br />
<br />
once this room is done, you will see more and more Son of Arugal's  around.<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=1318 is thier drops.<br />
<br />
after that, just follow your nose, kill some more sick mobs nd feats your eyes on the un holiest of unholy's.<br />
son of loki and his fell bride, feaster of flesh, killer of Odin, you guessed it.<br />
Fenrus the Devourer<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=6340<br />
is his common, but his other loot is much better.<br />
once you kill him, arugal's voidwalkers gt summoned in and attack you. they are punks, just kill them. after that look for the blue book near the entrance way you came in on the right, you will see it on the self, its fora quest, enjoy it, its well worth it.<br />
<br />
go up the stairs to the left, kill some son's of arugal, then you get to...<br />
<br />
Wolf Master Nandos<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=3748<br />
<br />
his wolves are easy to pull, just pull the one on the right, near the entrance way, you will get adds, once you kill off them, he attacks, and once hes dead, he spawns <br />
<br />
Lupine Horror<br />
he drops<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=1483<br />
http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=2807<br />
<br />
after him is the trek to arugal, aruaglas room has 3 of his sons, all single pulls, stand over the ledge look down below and pull them, arugal will not attack till you atack him, do not just rush this room, pull the sons out and deal with them first.<br />
<br />
Archmage Arugal    <br />
<br />
he casts multiple spells, one is a shadow bolt for a few hundred points of damage, one is a stun he uses in the beginning, one is a charm, the worst, and  makes your friends attack you, heal him, buff him, and debuff you.<br />
and he also teleports. sometimes standing on the ledge where he can't be reached, nuke him hard.<br />
<br />
when you rush him, have melee go first, and spell casters stay on the ledge on the top steps leading in and nuking/healing from a distance.<br />
<br />
using earth shocks or spell stuns is a must, he hits hard too.<br />
<br />
great caster robe<br />
