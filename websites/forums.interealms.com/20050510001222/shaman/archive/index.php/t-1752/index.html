<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, if you haven't seen Episode II yet... go.  Go now.  I don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it yet, but it...  Heh, can't really find the words to describe it...  to say &quot;it rocks&quot; is about like saying &quot;the sun is hot&quot;.<br />
<br />
The plot develops very well towards Episodes 4, 5 &amp; 6, and what we know Anakin is becoming (even though he does whine a bit - could almost picture him saying &quot;But I wanted a RED lightsaber!&quot; :D).  The action is pretty intense at times (although the frolicking scenes dragged out a bit), and you see why Yoda is truly a Jedi Master.  All I'll say about that is that he has a fight scene - and the audience was cheering after a few seconds of stunned silence.  (That scene alone is worth going a second time. :))<br />
<br />
My personal prediction, for what it's worth - this'll easily blow Spider Man away on sales.  I strongly recommend that you see it this weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I saw it last night, well this morning at midnight. It buries Episode I by far. I'm also not gonna give anything away, but the story starts to REALLY develop and you're drawn into the characters. <br />
Glad they gave Jar-Jar a small part, hated that about Episode I. <br />
Yoda is THE JEDI MASTER ! I was speechless ! <br />
Samuel L. Jackson knows his way with a light saber- &quot;Lightsaber- when you absolutely, positively have to kill every muthaf@--- in the room ! Except no substitutes.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
PS. Natalie Portman is HOT ! <br />
<br />
It is a must see<br />
<br />
<br />
Spiderman who ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Use the force! Mothaf---a<br />
<br />
I am going to see it tonite... not midnight screenings in this area... although i am happy the theater here got it opening night! heh the city i live in currently is ~5k people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From what I have heard and read on SW message boards, most SW fans are writing Lucas back in to their wills heh :)<br />
<br />
Looks like we got a winner here.  Will prolly catch it in a couple weeks or so when the crowds die down some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's the saber that says &quot;Bad Motherfooker&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The previews have got me chomping at the bit, but I effing HATE crowds. I'll see it after most people have had their fill.<br />
<br />
Three things though:<br />
<br />
1) Samuel L. Jackson kicking ass is worth 3 tickets.<br />
<br />
2) Yoda kicking ass is worth 5 tickets.<br />
<br />
3) Natalie Portman is gorgeous in this movie. Worth at least 5 tickets. ;)<br />
<br />
EDIT: You have become better at Counting! (5) :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Was a great movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Raoulna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am going tonight to see it with a bunch of friends and can't wait!!  From everything I have seen in the preview and heard in reviews I am sure it is going to be great.<br />
<br />
Let's just hope we don't have another Spiderman episode (a 3 year old kicking seats and asking &quot;what's that every 2 seconds...muzzle anyone?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Havent seen it yet .... bit of a hangover from Episode1 ... but with aline like this...<br />

Makes me wanna leave work and see it .... They gimped SLJ in Eps1, so I look forward to the Pulp Fiction star!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">episode 2 is by FAR the best of the series. Yoda kicks ass !!<br />
Yoda IS the master, Mace windu has nothing on him. hell, noone does! <br />
<br />
i havent been this excited about a star wars movie in a looooong long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Really looking forward to seeing it : )  I've heard almost unanimous positive reviews!<br />
<br />
I still think they need to give Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill cameos as clones, though.  Not like they are doing anything now, anyway (and no, Carrie's talk show thing doesnt count..LOL).<br />
<br />
First Ep.2, then Harry Potter 2, then Two Towers....good year for movies : )<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, I watched it, yet again disappointed. When Episode 1 came out, I waited in line for 3 hours to get a ticket to see the first show. What a waste that was. This time around I didn't pay period, someone else had tickets, and invited me to go.<br />
<br />
I've been a Starwars fan for awhile, I remember watching the series when I was little. Even now I can enjoy all 3 of the first released movies - Jedi being my least favorite. But the new releases have just been horrible. Episode 1 was plagued by JarJar and Anakin the kid. Half that movie was watching a kid racing around in a little spaceship/vehicle. The computer effects just didn't fit in with the movie either. With that kind of budget, I'm sure you can do a bit better about making the characters fit into the enviroment. Enough about 1.<br />
<br />
Episode 2 without giving away anything was about the same. It was a better movie than Episode 1. I didn't like the actor again playing Anakin. I don't know where they got him, but he needs some acting classes. It just seemed as if he was reading off a que card and they taped it. It was that bad. I really think he ruined the whole movie for me. I don't want to spoil anything so I can't give alot of examples. It's mainly about the &quot;love story&quot; that I didn't like with him and the script ruining it.<br />
<br />
On the bright side of things, Yoda scene was pretty good. Ewan played a good part as well. The Bobafett story was great as well.<br />
<br />
I guess I came expecting too much from this series. In the last trilogy it seemed like the actors acted and made it alot more believable - at least to me.<br />
<br />
To sum things up - Episodes 1 and 2 weren't very good. Same goes for Spiderman ;) - More cheezeball lines. The only good part of that movie was William Dafoe (sp?)<br />
<br />
Looking forward to LoTR pt 2 - Now that's a series :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, cos Mark Hammill is known for his excellent acting throughout the original trilogy. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I saw it last night and really enjoyed it much more than Episode 1. I also agree with Cush that you can see how the plot is going to tie back into episodes 4,5 &amp; 6.<br />
<br />
If you like sci-fi then it's well worth seeing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Anakins &quot;whiney brat act&quot; was annoying to say the least but the yoda vs dooku lightsaber duel made up for that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">To quote Humbert:Even now I can enjoy all 3 of the first released movies - Jedi being my least favorite And THAT is why he didn't like it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (I love that title!) is VERY much like &quot;Return of the Jedi.&quot; Has the same sort of feel to it<br />
<br />
Story is a LOT stronger than in &quot;The Phantom Menace.&quot;<br />
<br />
But yeah, if you liked &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; you'll probably like this one too.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, before I forget I got to see it on the big screen about 13-15 hours before any of you.<br />
<br />
+8GMT is so powah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Dont go with high expectations and I think you will enjoy it.  The theatre I was in for the 7pm est showing was only 2/3 full at most.  It was a great story, but I think a lot of unecessary filler could have been cut to make it a great movie (it was longer than all the other SW movies).  I liked it better than Episode I, but standing alone against Spiderman, I dont think it was quite as good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Humbert, I was told by friends it was as horrible as 1. I to am old enough to have seen the originals in the theatre so i guess i used to be a fan. EP1 disgusted me so much, it was unforgivable.I cant stand when people make excuses to have to enjoy a movie. Lucas has far to much money to justify the absolute lack of effort on his part to keep up the pace with the rest of the movies released this summer. Sepcial effects only take a movie so far and for my 8.50 it damn well better be worth my money. I have no desire what so ever to go see this movie and based on reviews ive been getting from people i trust my fears are justified. If you do enjoy though thats cool! glad ya liked it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I wanna go see it.  Problem is I wont get a chance to for about 5 more weeks.  <br />
<br />
The reviews I've read say there were some neat stuff like mentioned above with Yoda (he's a gnome!) and SLJ but many of the lines were sub par.  Seems to me like they could have spent the extra money and hired some writer who does romantic comedies and the like to write the love scenes.  But Lucas always has been very stand-alone in his approach to movie making.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Radiation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This movie was just insanely good. I loved it more than any movie I've seen to date ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Raoulna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I thought that the movie was fantastic.  However if I think if you are a die-hard Star Wars Fan and are going in with high expectations I can see how you would be somewhat disappointed.  I loved the story and character development...and the fight scenes...wonderful.  For pure entertainment value I give this an 8 and will probably end up seeing it again if the chance presents itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The acting and dialogue were the weakest points of the movie, oh and the pathetic non-ending.  I don't remember any other episode ending on such an open note.  They should have just stuck a 'to be continued...' caption in there.  The story itself I thought was good, as well as the action sequences.  I liked it overall  very much up until it just suddenly ended with no sense of closure to the episode at all IMO.  <br />
<br />
my 2pp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Are you forgetting that Empire Strikes back ended kinda open, Lando and Chewie were flying off to save Han. Never quite knew where they were going or anything else ? And Jabba hadn't been seen yet. <br />
Episode II ended kinda the same way, no real climatic closing. Same with Lord of the Rings (talk about non-ending).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I'm going to go see it for my birthday, it's rather a tradition since all Star Wars movies have opened at roughly the same time in May :) However, I'm not all that excited for this one. Beyond going to see what ILM has come up with this time, which I'm sure is spectacular, I see no reason to stand in line for it. <br />
<br />
The original 3 movies had extremely campy acting but they also had personality. Episode 1 had overacting/no acting and zero personality. From what I've heard from friends regarding Clones, the acting is a bit better but it still lacks that Star Wars &quot;thing&quot;. <br />
<br />
I can't say I'm surprised, writing dialogue and directing will never be Lucas' strong suite. He's a great idea man, one that should know when it's time to get some outside help *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">&quot;Same with Lord of the Rings (talk about non-ending).&quot;<br />
<br />
Read the books.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'd compare the ending of episode II with Fellowship of the rings.  Empire left openings for Jedi, but it still had basic closure to the story in that episode.  Episode II however has no closure whatsoever IMO, it was just like Fellowship in that at the end it seemed like the whole freakin movie was just a lead in to episode III.  <br />
Empire did have a climactic ending that was much better though IMO and at least a partial feelling of closure.  You have the epic battle between Luke and Vader where Vader reveals that he is Luke's father.  That was a climax.   Where was the climax in Episode 2?  I don't want to give spoilers so I'll leave it to you to compare the two, or any of the other episodes and see if you can find that climactic moment in Episode II that compares to any of the previous movies.  The Yoda fight I  suppose was supposed to be it, but while the fight was great, the conclusion of that fight was just.... blah.  Then you have the final scenes after said fight...<br />
<br />
I expected Fellowship to have an open ending.  The book was the same way and it is the first in the series.  Star Wars movies up till now have all had at least a basic amount of closure to the storyline in each episode, the conflict built up to a climactic ending that finalized that particular conflict while leaving the overall saga open for the next episode.  I think it reasonable to expect the same from Episode II, but instead we have an ending more appropriate to a wednesday episode of General Hospital.  Gimme a break...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I think Ep 2 had an ending...<br />
<br />
perhaps too abstract for american audiences but for its purpose it had a good enough ending for the situation.  It certainly was no worse than Empire... in fact it was almost the same. if you take the time to look at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I enjoyed the flick, but I think they relied a bit too heavily on computer animation, especially in fight scenes.  Either that or the computer generated graphics were just not done as well as I would have hoped.  I don't think they will ever top the light saber duel with Darth Maul in EP1.  <br />
<br />
Computer generated yoda just didn't look as good as the old Jim Henson puppet did - too cartoonish. <br />
<br />
The story was great, but they spent too much time on the so-so acted and written love scenes. <br />
<br />
But yes, Miss Portman is a hottie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I enjoy a thought provoking movie and endings, Star Wars however is NOT some deep abstract art house movie.  Never has been...  Like I said before, each movie previous has had a climactic moment and I didn't see it in this episode...<br />
<br />
I think the final fight with Dooku could have been that climactic moment, but the ending fell flat IMO.  The cheesy lead ins afterwards for episode III were anything but abstract or subtle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree somewhat with this statement... it is not, lets say Final Fantasy, for say on a the &quot;abstract&quot; ending (i know there are better but lets stay in the sci fi)... there have been constant complaining about these 3 mentioned movies about lack of a &quot;standard&quot; beginning middle and end.  So lets just call it open ending...  There is then a comparison mad to the older trilogy.  This to me is laughable as I see this first trilogy as VERY similar and this middle movie is just that... a middle movie.  again I dont want to go into the simularities but this movie = empire... some decent forsadowing at the movie too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I don't see why so many people care, but to be honest it probably wont make as much money as spiderman will.  It simply isn't being released in enough theathers, and it doesn't give you any reason to come back and &quot;see it again for the first time&quot; the way truly amazing movies do, which is where movies make there money.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I enjoyed the movie, and I was glad i went to see it, and I considered the time i spent waiting well worth it.  I didn't go in expecting a great movie, and I think my expectations were well met.  <br />
<br />
Comments:<br />
<br />
-Anakins actor was laughably bad.<br />
-Fight scenes were great, but a little to short.<br />
-Visual effects were amazing.<br />
-The love story was simple and to the point, although there were times that it dragged.<br />
-Overall story is impossible to judge because ep 3 isn't out yet, but i think this movie kept things interesting enough.<br />
-Natalie portman is hot, but this doesn't make the movie good.</div></div><hr />
