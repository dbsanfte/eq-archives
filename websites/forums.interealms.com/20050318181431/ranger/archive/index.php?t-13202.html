Not all of my guild is high level so it would stink if all of a sudden certain spells can't be cast on say a lvl 52 because I'm level 63 or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llyric</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They don't. It is not, nor has it ever been, the spellcasters level that was important.   It was the SPELLS level and recipients level that mattered. A level 51 spell will hit anyone level 39 or higher, regardless if it is cast by a level 51 or by a level 65. I just wish they would fix it so my hand-me-down druid spells would work on people based upon the level the druids got the spell instead of the 50+ levels where I got them. :(</div></div><hr />

Asking because I seem to remeber a level 41 guild mate I was grouped with that &quot;My spell was too powerful for&quot;.  Then he dinged to 42 and it would take.<br />
<br />
My feelings on this though are that even if they are below what ever that level limit is, it should not matter level if you can group and both gain XP.  I thought this was a group oriented game were people are encuraged to group and assist one another.  Well if my buffs won't hold then ny ability to assist them is lessened.</div></div><hr />

For example, I cannot cast Skin like Diamond(Lvl 54 Spell) on a newbie, but a druid(sub 50 spell) can.</div></div><hr />

There are a few exceptions to the rule like boon of G.  target has to be lvl 44, even though a lvl 44 enchanter can group with lvl 40s it don't matter they are not getting that spell cast on them till they are lvl 60.  Hense BG is treated like a lvl 60 spell.</div></div><hr />
