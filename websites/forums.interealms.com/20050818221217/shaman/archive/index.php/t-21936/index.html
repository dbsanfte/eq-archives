<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a longtime shaman like Soo many of us here are ... I have been thinking what would be a simple way too balance the Shaman class . What I would like too ask is Do you think that shamans as a class would be &quot;Balanced&quot; or at least effective enough too get by if we were given 2 new spells ...<br />
1 . A Blast heal along the lines of Tnargs but 2000pts as is BASE heal rate .<br />
2 . A new nuke that had a resonable Casttime and Mana cost that Nuked for a base of say 1200pts .<br />
<br />
I think that if we had these two things that minor tweeking would be all that we would need too be mostly balanced ...<br />
<br />
What are your opinions ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Honestly I feel SoE needs to do is sit down and decide which classes should fill which roles in a group. Then ask what other roles could that class fill in a group. Warriors and Knights can fill the MT role, though Warriors are designed to do the job best. All of them can also fill a dps role effectively. I would think that the priest classes would be similarly setup where all three can heal effectively in a group, but the cleric does the job best. Unlike tanks though clerics don't really have a secondary role in a group. <br />
<br />
This one simple change would remove some of the time sink in waiting to do something because you can't find the class you need for a specific job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To balance Shamans we need:<br />
<br />
1. A 2k fast heal(base) spell + a targetable Divine Arbitration(AA) that only balances out the Shaman's HPs and the target's unlike the real Divine Arb.<br />
<br />
2. A 6 second cast time nuke for around 1700<br />
<br />
3. A poison based DoT that does around 700/tick with a -50 resist mod<br />
<br />
4. A curse DoT that does around 800/tick with a -100 resist mod<br />
<br />
5. -70 resist mod for Balance of the Nihil<br />
<br />
6. A proportional upgrade to Canni V<br />
<br />
7. A carbon copy of the disc Stonestance, call it...Spirit Shield(that one sounds familiar, doesn't it)<br />
<br />
I am not including buffs as I don't see them adding meaningful buffs. Every buff beyond haste will have minimal impact. That's a design decision, whether I like it or not.<br />
<br />
There are different approaches to balancing Shamans mind you, I chose this, more offensive approach, because it allows for more stackability on raids and less headache for future balancing of the class in upcoming expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I posted on the EQLive site about how to easily tell if classes are balanced.<br />
<br />
It's easy to see how classes are balanced or how needed they are.<br />
<br />
Imagine EQ without a certain class.  Are other classes able to step in and take role of the class that you just removed from the game?<br />
<br />
How would EQ survive if ALL clerics just suddenly disappeared?  Not very well.  Seriously, imagine EQ with NO clerics.  Massive hitpoint buffs, CH rotations, etc., all gone in the blink of an eye.<br />
<br />
Only other instance, that I can think of off the top of my head, where one class is so important is a defensive warrior.  But even that isn't as big.<br />
<br />
Lots of classes have special little things that are highly convenient or useful (Mage's CotH, summon corpse, FD, backstab, etc.), but are not game breaking if they were removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
If shaman just disappeared, what would happen?  I haven't played any other debuffing class, so I am not sure if our debuffs are the only ones that are unresistable.  If so, then that might be the only thing that really can't be duplicated by at least 2 other classes.  Other classes, heal, slow, debuff, cripple, DoT, nuke, and have pets.  So the unresistable debuff MIGHT be the only things we have that is special.<br />
<br />
Please correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />

Giac supose we get what you ask for... would you be happy then?<br />
<br />
And still clerics would still heal better than shamans and blast better than shamans.  <br />
<br />
So, why would a group pick a shaman even with your upgrades?  <br />
Especially since even with your upgrades shamans can't heal as good as clerics?<br />
<br />
and oh God please forgive the time we choose to cast malos + Balance of the Nihil for maxium chance to land our slow. <br />
<br />
/sarcasm on<br />
<br />
So much time from the 30 second fight is waisted using malos + slow.<br />
<br />
No Giac We need:<br />
<br />
a 2 second 7500 K heal .... screw it we need and instant 10^100 heal!!!!<br />
<br />
oh and we need a group version heal that heals for like a million hitpoints<br />
<br />
lets change our names to super-ultra cleric-sha'mystic powa fun uber bear! (demonstrate our new german healing superiority.)<br />

I didn't know this kind of whine below was considered adult.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing will be done about it, though.<br />
<br />
It's painfully obvious that they aren't worried about it. This should be a top priority. The summer is close and I don't like to waste my time so I'll be moving on if I don't see drastic changes to my class and I suggest you do the same.<br />
<br />
Garf I have just as much right to disagree with Giac's crazy ideas. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The problem is there is no balance for the shaman class. We are too versitile and there is too many different desires in the shaman community. Giac wants a new set of DoT's, i want a group heal, which is more important ? Which should come first. Not to mention i agree with his DoT's so i want that too. <br />
<br />
<br />
So us as a shaman community, want fast big heals, big nukes, better slows, group healing, Rez, Better DoT's and FD, we want it all as a community. Which obviously isnt right we be the best in everything.<br />
<br />
The real twist is that its only as a community we want it all. When you break it down some people want upgrades to nukes and DoT's which is reasonable. Then you got the HEaling upgraders and debuff upgraders which are reasonable by themselves. But which is better, which do we want?<br />
<br />
Right now we are like ... Ok devs, we know this this and this all suck, and here is how to fix them. However its up to you to decide what to upgrade.<br />
<br />
The problem i see is one that has been around for so very long and just seems itll go away. We lack focsu and unity on asking for upgrades. Cause no matter how much we here at SC poll, there is going to be people like turtle at SoE forums that likes to play the devils advocate and stand against the unified requests and in turn it makes it look fragmented. It only takes a few people to oppse 100 to make it apears there is a section of the class that is unrepresented properly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh what a tangled web we weave heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Giac supose we get what you ask for... would you be happy then?<br />
<br />
I'd consider my class balanced for the content I'd face and in comparison to other classes. Thanks for asking, though.<br />
<br />
And still clerics would still heal better than shamans and blast better than shamans.<br />
<br />
Have I ever asked for Shamans to &quot;heal&quot; better than Clerics, you piece of dog ****? The Cleric nuke can be found here btw http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5279&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
So, why would a group pick a shaman even with your upgrades?  <br />
Especially since even with your upgrades shamans can't heal as good as clerics?<br />
<br />
Shamans would be &quot;viable&quot; healers with this. That's all *we* have been asking for.<br />
<br />
and oh God please forgive the time we choose to cast malos + Balance of the Nihil for maxium chance to land our slow.<br />
<br />
With a -70 resist mod on Balance of the Nihil, there'd be no need to cast Malos. The Shaman's Div Arb + the resist mods on our DoTs and the emergency Spirit Shield, would eleminate the need for Malos in exp fights altogether, which would alleviate a number of problems you are too dumb to grasp.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm on<br />
<br />
So much time from the 30 second fight is waisted using malos + slow.<br />
<br />
Read above, genius.<br />
<br />

We are too versitile and there is too many different desires in the shaman community. Giac wants a new set of DoT's, i want a group heal, which is more important ? <br />
<br />
Neither Shamans nor Druids have ever had group heals. DoTs on the other hand are an integral part of the class. <br />
<br />
So us as a shaman community, want fast big heals, big nukes, better slows, group healing, Rez, Better DoT's and FD, we want it all as a community. Which obviously isnt right we be the best in everything.<br />
<br />
Ask yourself why you want Rezz and FD. It's simple, to compensate for game design flaws. I wasn't discussing design flaws, just balance issues. Would Shamans ask for FD if DoT aggro wasn't broken? Again, it's got nothing to do with how the class is designed.<br />
<br />
The real twist is that its only as a community we want it all. When you break it down some people want upgrades to nukes and DoT's which is reasonable. Then you got the HEaling upgraders and debuff upgraders which are reasonable by themselves. But which is better, which do we want?<br />
<br />
As I said, there are many ways of fixing Shamans. But you should remain in the realm of the class. You could argue for better nukes instead of the resist mods on the DoTs etc, but I feel the things I adressed are pretty much the least infringing on other classes' abilities and within the parameters of the class.<br />
<br />
Right now we are like ... Ok devs, we know this this and this all suck, and here is how to fix them. However its up to you to decide what to upgrade.<br />
<br />
That's the problem with everyone having the right to express their own ideas regardless of how good their understanding or experience is. That's how suggestions like &quot;overcap statbuffs&quot; went into the one voice thread. <br />
As rough as it is, when decisions like these are made, designers and developers should be inviting experienced people and consider their ideas first. Of course this requires them to invest time on a relationship and the rest of the community trusting those &quot;community leaders&quot;.<br />
<br />
The problem i see is one that has been around for so very long and just seems itll go away. We lack focsu and unity on asking for upgrades. Cause no matter how much we here at SC poll, there is going to be people like turtle at SoE forums that likes to play the devils advocate and stand against the unified requests and in turn it makes it look fragmented.

<br />
<br />
I tried to explain what the problem is imo. Polling everyone is not going to lead anywhere, because some people have invested more time and are that much more knowledgeable. It's just how it is and there's nothing discriminating about it if you think about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So basically, you want shamans to:<br />
<br />
- heal nearly as well as druids (100 hp short)<br />
- nuke within a hair of druids and mages (without ancient spell, druids and  mages both do 1705 now)<br />
- DoT miles better than any other class in the game by far, (nearly double)<br />
<br />
not to mention improve the areas which are already our strongest points (slow and mana regen) before you'd consider shamans balanced?<br />
<br />
Now, I think shamans need a hand, but I believe you're living in cloud cuckoo land if you think that those changes would merely balance shamans and not make them hugely overpowered. With this set of changes, we'd outdamage pretty much anyone else, and still have slow, good heals and great mana regen. I don't want to be overpowered, I want to have a role equal to others (not better) in a group.<br />
<br />
If you'd suggested a slight resist mod on DoTs (but no change in damage), a 1200 nuke, and 1800 heal, I would think that much more realistic and *balanced*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kianor - why SHOULDN'T Shaman heal as well (that means 'equally') to a Druid?<br />

Apparently you have been playing less than three years, but here's a <br />
NEWSFLASH: Shaman used to be able to heal the SAME as a Druid.<br />
<br />
Shaman DOTs are great, but if they don't land and they create massive aggro - well what's the point?<br />
<br />
Mana Regen? Let's be specific - it's SELF ONLY mana regen. Unlike:<br />
<br />
BL's - Group Mana Regen<br />
Enchanters - Group Mana Regen<br />
Necromancers - Group and single target Mana Regen AND self mana regen<br />
<br />
This is Everquest - sit around and pat yerself on the back because you soloed Yeldema and two years later you are looking up from the bottom of the class totem pole.<br />
<br />
Ask for the sky and the moon and you get something.<br />
<br />
Settle for less and you will get less.</div></div><hr />

Did you actually check out the new spells classes are getting before you posted?<br />
<br />
Anyway, in case this wasn't clear, these changes would be part of Omens as it should be clear to everyone that SoE won't do any balancing acts 2 months before releasing a new expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And there in lies the problem. The issues are being added to new content, while the problems with the old content are not being addressed. Until there is a clear vision for what roles all 14 classes, and not just a few, should fill it is pointless to &quot;Balance&quot; the classes. It is about like trying to build a house with only the plans for a bedroom. We have had 2 new races and 2 new classes added to the game, but how much thought was put into how they impact the existing world? Patching this issue or that issue will only result in things being farther out of balance in other areas. Until the vision is re examined for the game as a whole and for how each class fits into that overall vision, any attempts to balance will be nothing more than treating symptoms and not the disease.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is class &quot;balance&quot; or improvment limited to what we have at hand. Druids never out healed us in direct heals, but now they do. In the begining we didnt have HoT's at all but we now do. The game changes and so does our required roles.<br />
<br />

Ask yourself why you want Rezz and FD. It's simple, to compensate for game design flaws. I wasn't discussing design flaws, just balance issues. Would Shamans ask for FD if DoT aggro wasn't broken? Again, it's got nothing to do with how the class is designed.<br />
<br />
Me, i dont want FD or a rez, my point in mentioning it is that some people here do and no matter what you or me logicaly argue against it, there will be people crying blood for it, which gives the presentation that we are not united, even if its 5 people to 500. Which is the point i was making there.<br />
<br />

You could argue for better nukes instead of the resist mods on the DoTs etc, but I feel the things I adressed are pretty much the least infringing on other classes' abilities and within the parameters of the class.<br />
<br />
I pretty much agree with you. I think whoever upgrades a shaman should close their eyes, envision a tirbal shaman and go &quot; would he do that?&quot; before they get any upgrades and do that with all classes, but i think its clear thats not what happens. Incidentaly i couldnt care less about nukes, it would be nice, but im not really spazing over our weak nukes, especialy if we excell in other areas to compensate, which right now we do not i feel.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's the problem with everyone having the right to express their own ideas regardless of how good their understanding or experience is. That's how suggestions like &quot;overcap statbuffs&quot; went into the one voice thread. <br />

 But who is to say I am right over you or vise versa. Its a given that some ideas are just ****e, but with the shaman its a very complex issue, since we can harbor different playing styles.<br />

<br />
I cant do anything but agree. There is a time to let the minority not be heard and the majority listened too. As much as i hate getting shut out of the descision making process and want a hand in building my shaman's role, there is a point where you have to sacrifice your ability to input for the progression of a movement. In this case anyway. We have been stagnate for far too long.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried to explain what the problem is imo. Polling everyone is not going to lead anywhere, because some people have invested more time and are that much more knowledgeable. It's just how it is and there's nothing discriminating about it if you think about it.<br />
<br />
I dont feel that time has anything to do with it. Take martuk for example, i value his input as much if not more then say .. gloriana or henora or whatever big name you want to through around and say &quot; they are uber&quot;. The important thing is to listen to a good idea no matter where its coming from, even if they dont have 4 green rep bumps ( teasing ).<br />
<br />
I do wonder why you think stonestance is something we deserve/need. I mean i can see its usefulness for sure, but you put it in the &quot;what would balance shaman&quot; rebutle, so i would like to hear more on that from you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Why is class &quot;balance&quot; or improvment limited to what we have at hand.

<br />
When HoTs(not taps) were implemented Shamans got them and thus became part of our class. When they implemented group heals they decided that Druids and Shamans were no masters of it, and the game hasn't changed too much in the direction for group heals to be a requirement at this point.<br />
I have no problem with people advocating group heals, however.<br />

<br />
I got the point and I was merely trying to explain, that I know and understand why certain people would want FD and Rezz and that for me those 2 abilities represent a fix to fundamental game design flaws, that I tend to ignore when examining class balance.<br />
<br />
But who is to say I am right over you or vise versa. Its a given that some ideas are just ****e, but with the shaman its a very complex issue, since we can harbor different playing styles.<br />
<br />
I believe that the argument regarding different playing styles has been &quot;overplayed&quot;. Shamans have a certain degree of versatility, but they certainly have core functions in a group that make them actually valuable. <br />
However, I am convinced to be knowledgable and experienced enough, that if I was to suggest changes to the class, they would cater to every &quot;playstyle&quot; and be appreciated by everyone. I am sure there are a few others who could do the same.<br />

<br />
I am not talking about majorities here. I am speaking of a selection of respected, experienced, long-term individuals discussing issues of their class and proposing changes to SoE in name of the whole community. <br />
5 smart(just speaking of EQ here) people will agree on solutions much easier and faster than 5,000 mixed ones. <br />

Your perception is a little different than mine. <br />
<br />
As far as I know Murtak is a member of Cestus Dei(just like Aruman who has been around a little longer) and both have been playing for a long time. <br />
Both have a good understanding of the game and are definitely to be classified as &quot;uber&quot;, if we go by gear, guild and experience, probably even more so than Glori and Henora(who seem to have 2 different playstyles btw, as Henora seems to be the more &quot;casual&quot; of the 2, but is not less competent).<br />
I do feel that it isn't that difficult to tell who on this board, like those we just listed above(and not just those), is competent, and who, regardless of their opinion if Shamans are fine or not, is not. <br />
<br />
I do wonder why you think stonestance is something we deserve/need. I mean i can see its usefulness for sure, but you put it in the &quot;what would balance shaman&quot; rebutle, so i would like to hear more on that from you.<br />
<br />
The Shaman class went from the slower with the best defensive abilties(i.e. best at taking damage), most durable to the most fragile of all. <br />
<br />
Enchanters, albeit being a silk wearer are harder to kill due to their arsenal of fast casting runes + instant runes + boggle etc. <br />
<br />
Bards are a plate class with high parry, dodge etc. caps, more HPs and the ability to just vanish from the hate list on top of DAs.<br />
<br />
Beastlords, our hybrid, has block(best defensive skill by far), high dodge, riposte, more HPs, a pet that taunts like mad AND the Monk's Stonestance disc making it by far the superior choice for suicide Slows, offtanking etc.<br />
<br />
The Shaman is the class that is most likely to draw aggro and while in the past Torpor and selfheals allowed us to take a beating against fully slowed mobs, today the Shaman is dead meat. <br />
He lacks any meaning of managing aggro, yet he has the lowest defensive capabilities with no possibility to escape or offtank when **** hits the fan.<br />
In other words, the Shaman not only lost something he once had(the choice to offtank if needed), but he also had to acknowledge, that the other Slowers are now superior to him when it comes to exerting his main ability, because he's more likely to die from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Kianor - why SHOULDN'T Shaman heal as well (that means 'equally') to a Druid?<br />
<br />
Apparently you have been playing less than three years, but here's a <br />
NEWSFLASH: Shaman used to be able to heal the SAME as a Druid.<br />
<br />
Actually, Kianor was created July 2000. I have a couple of older characters, but yeah, I remember when druids and shamans had the same heals right up to level 59.<br />
<br />
Druids were given better heals in order to become more group friendly. I am NOT saying that shamans shouldn't heal as well as druids, I really don't see why we shouldn't. What I AM saying is that healing as well as druids, nuking as well as druids, dotting much better than druids, and having a 75% slow on top of all that would be overpowered.<br />
<br />
Just think - if they gave a druid a 75% slow, everyone would think that druids would be overpowered, no? Well, that's pretty much what Giac was asking for for shamans, and more.<br />
<br />
It wasn't the healing I was commenting on, it was the combination of the whole lot of requests.<br />
<br />
Shaman DOTs are great, but if they don't land and they create massive aggro - well what's the point?<br />
<br />
Mana Regen? Let's be specific - it's SELF ONLY mana regen. Unlike:<br />
<br />
BL's - Group Mana Regen<br />
Enchanters - Group Mana Regen<br />
Necromancers - Group and single target Mana Regen AND self mana regen<br />
<br />
This is Everquest - sit around and pat yerself on the back because you soloed Yeldema and two years later you are looking up from the bottom of the class totem pole.<br />
<br />
That has nothing to do with it. I was just looking at his set of requests, and his comment that &quot;to balance shamans we need&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ask for the sky and the moon and you get something.<br />
<br />
Yeah, usually you will get laughed at.<br />
<br />
Settle for less and you will get less.<br />
<br />
Or, ask for less and you might actually get SOMETHING. If we ask for too much, SoE might not take us seriously, because they think we just want to be all powerful, and we don't know what we're talking about.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I want to be balanced, desirable, and to play a solid role in a group. I don't want to be overpowered, and I don't think we should ask to be, it only makes us look ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, your are wrong. I am not exactly sure why you insist, though.<br />
<br />
Clerics, Enchanters and Necros will be nuking for 1700, I am asking for the exact same nuking power.<br />
<br />
Necromancers are getting 2 curses on top of an upgrade to their Poison, Disease and Fire DoTs(and Lifedrain DoT). The 2 curses alone are doing 800/tick and 670/tick respectively. <br />
So basically, I am asking for my 2 best DoTs to be on par with the Necro's 2 best DoTs. <br />
<br />
Necros will still<br />
<br />
- have no aggro problems when applying their DoTs due to FD<br />
- be far superior DPS wise since they are getting an upgrade to ALL of their DoT lines<br />
- mantain their superiority as a DoT class due to their wider selection of DoTs(Fire, Disease, Poison, Magic)<br />
<br />
Druids will be <br />
<br />
- healing for at least 2275 HPs in 68(possibly more since there's still a Druid-Omen-Heal in the works in level 69) and <br />
- nuking for 2420 with their cold nuke and 1820 with their fire nuke(both nukes are a little faster than 6 seconds due to their Quick Damage AA that reduces the cast time for Druid nukes by 10% btw)<br />
<br />
So now tell me again that my requests are overpowering, please.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You want the same nuking power as the other classes you list, ok that in itself is not over powering.  Now add in you want your top 2 DoTs to be as powerful as a Necros, again that alone would not be over powering in anyway.  Now add in what other shaman want.  Equal healing to a druid, better pet, better slows, etc and it spirals out of control then at a high rate.  Then you would have the other classes going &quot;Well now that they can Nuke, DoT, Heal, etc as good as me what can I have that makes my class better in a certain field then them?&quot;  Which brings it all around again to what is the happy medium here?  No one here in this forum has presented a cut and dry way to &quot;balance&quot; our class, why you may ask?  It doesn't exist.  This is the truth, and no matter how much you may think different it doesn't change it.  If they give in and make a change to the class you will still have those that say it wasn't enough OR it thats not the way I wanted it to be, and then still  others who sid why di dyou change this it was fine the way it was.  Would I like a better DoT, Heal Nuke?  Sure I would.  Am I am enjoying myself fighting with my Best friend and Wife in PoE in a 3 person group, yep.

And that's the biggest reason it will fail. Because I honestly believe that many people will think and acts like me .. I won't buy another expansion until I see improvement to our current situation. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
And for Dots: I really could not care less about yet another dot, even if it does 700/tick. Dots are vastly inferior to DD. They don't run out in 99% of the fights and they generate tons of aggro.

These 2 things, while not totally &quot;balancing&quot; us, would make us effective enough to contribute on raids or high-end single groups.</div></div><hr />

I disagree, I will take an 800 a tic upgrade to Bane. Bane alone isnt enough to pull aggro from a good MA. No way. I use it constantly on raids afgainst bosses I can land it on. Bane, heal heal heal heal, Bane, heal heal heal. Bane has less aggro by design than BoS, and does more damage for less mana. If there is one thing I am PISSED about seeing the OoW spell lists, its the difference in the Necro upgrades compared to ours.</div></div><hr />

I hope it doesn't sound too sharp, Kianor, but wake up man.  They don't take us seriously in the first place.  Where have you been?<br />
<br />
Seriously.<br />
<br />
I think you're thinking of a more normal relationship dynamic than what we have going on right now.  Given the dynamic you're thinking of, what you say makes sense; the problem is the shaman class and the developers are not in that kind of a dynamic and haven't been for a very long time.  There is no real &quot;give and take&quot; and fair sharing or exploration of ideas going on.<br />
<br />
It's a dictatorship by fiat.  It's a &quot;shut up and stop making trouble -- the easiest way to balance the game is to balance everything BUT you.  But we can at least SAY nice things once in a while.&quot;  It's a sweeping under the rug, not a bringing into the light.<br />
<br />
I won't agree with all requests, but past history has shown that asking for little or just moping along quietly does absolutely nothing.  Might as well give them a list of things to choose from.</div></div><hr />

Edit: typo<br />
<br />
Figured I would say my piece on this thread.  First, I think you have the right idea except for one thing I think you are not realizing.  When people are making posts on this topic they are pulling out 5-6 other classes to support their thoughts on upgrades.  We &quot;are&quot; versatile in the fact that we hold the ability to dot,nuke,heal,slow,tank,cripple,debuff, canni, and have a pet. We are able to do all of these abilities on any mob as long as two things work: <br />
<br />
1. Mob is slowable<br />
2. Mob is suseptible to spell dmg  <br />
<br />
-Druids can't slow/can't canni/can't HoT<br />
<br />
-Mages can't heal/can't dot/can't HoT<br />
<br />
-Necros can't heal (xcpt for lifetaps)/can't slow(xcpt for undead)<br />
<br />
-Clerics can heal (not the &quot;strong&quot; soloing class)<br />
<br />
Many of the classes you mentioned have &quot;situational&quot; versatility.  They have many things they can do, but may not be able to use all of them in any situation.  In a perfect group we may not be picked because we fall behind one or two classes in a specific area, but how many perfect groups are we in on a regular basis?  Our versatility has to be taken into account when asking for upgrades.  <br />
<br />
I see three problems with the shaman class:<br />
<br />
1. Versatility is killing our spell lineup.<br />
<br />
Most of your 65 shamans (with appropriate spells) have a set line-up.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's/Daluda<br />
Quiescence/Breath<br />
Malos<br />
Turgur's/Balance<br />
Root<br />
FA<br />
Canni IV<br />
<br />
Some shamans drop some of these spells due to annoyance/clickies/or hate (or don't need) Canni IV up.  Fast forward to OoW and we could also have the new cripple added to our memmed spell line-up.  Balance of Nihli was a set in the right direction except for one problem- Reliance on standardized spells.  The game relied a long time on: Cheal, full slow.  Casters still rely on malos because they want their spells to land for full and they get pissy when its not loaded.  Melees almost always want FA, and many get pissy if its not loaded.<br />
<br />
My thoughts on an answer:<br />
<br />
Upgrade to Primal Essence (add pure atk)-  FA is not going to be a deciding factor when getting a group, so having it as a long term buff is  <br />
not going to make us lose our position.<br />
<br />
More (semi-available) clickies- Root/Malosinia.  Its on raid gear- make it a little more available so we can clear up some spell line-ups. <br />
<br />
2.  Sluggish Spells.<br />
<br />
This bothers me more than not getting a big nuke.  I rarely use my ice nuke simply because: <br />
A. it takes too long to cast and <br />
B. Tears of Saryrn has a better chance (with aa's) of doing more dmg.<br />
<br />
I like my AoE poison spells- with VP it adds some flavor to group tactics.<br />
<br />
Malos/Slow takes forever when I need a mob slowed.<br />
<br />
My thoughts on an answer:<br />
<br />
Either A. lower cast time to 5.5 or <br />
         B. up dmg of ice-based nukes<br />
<br />
Allow AoE's to be affected by ID4 and similar focuses<br />
<br />
Shorten the cast time of Malos and lower the mana cost from 500 to 350.<br />
<br />
3. Healing<br />
<br />
I really don't see a strong issue with this except in GoD.  Keep in mind that:<br />
<br />
**GoD was designed for lvl 70**  this was a rumor held by a few on this board until SOE came out and proved it.  Five levels makes a huge difference at the high end.  Think about the old &quot;lvl 60&quot; raid/group zones, and you will see what 65 did to them.  <br />
<br />
Another thing to keep in mind:  <br />
<br />
1.  Yes, we are a priest class.<br />
2.  How many shaman in-game have IH4 focus/maxxed healing aa's?<br />
<br />
This is a pretty big bone for me because I see so many say &quot;we are a priest class&quot; and then I check the magelo and see 0 healing aa's.  AA's have been out since Luclin- we are past the point where they were just &quot;neat things to get when you have time&quot;- they are now a point of necessity.  Do you need max healing aa's for BoT? no.  Do you need max healing aa's for later content? yes.  Many people will complain that &quot;my healing should not be determined by my aa's&quot; , but how many of those same people are going to be grouping with a tank in later content with 0 defensive aa's?<br />
<br />
My thoughts on a solution:<br />
<br />
- Quick heal for 1700-1800 for OoW<br />
- Advanced Healing Adept/Gift added to AA list<br />
- Add IH4/possible higher focus effects to LDoN list <br />
<br />
This may not even be necessary with the possible upgrades coming to our regeneration/HoT spells.  As long as we can land them without the tank dying in a fast heal lapse, it might be enough to slow down the dps.<br />
<br />
(HoT's should, in no way, cover ALL mob dps in challenging content.)<br />
<br />
Anyways, just some thoughts, and if need be- flame away...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">&quot;Do you need max healing aa's for BoT? no. Do you need max healing aa's for later content? yes&quot;<br />
<br />
Do druids?  <br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Druids have healing as a far more vital part of their group and raid contribution these days -- arguably as the most important part of their class.  I think easily actually; druids even take part in CH chains.<br />
<br />
We have other things, like canni 5(with a lot of crappy prerequisites there's no way we'd buy if we didn't have to) and spell casting subtlety, that they don't have to do.  That are absolutely vital to us.<br />
<br />
Yet we should have to do our most important AA plus our various other AA, including the healing AA you're talking about, while druids don't have to do theirs even when healing is so much more a part of their task?  You can't really compare our dedication to healing to them on this kind of basis.<br />
<br />
I don't think we should have to work much harder at AA's of secondary importance than others do at the AA of their primary importance just to still be nowhere remotely near them in capability.  If we were both working toward the same goal and level of ability, it would be one thing.<br />
<br />
But we're not.  <br />
<br />
Our heals are nowhere close to theirs regardless of how much healing AA we do and how little healing AA they do.<br />
<br />
For the average shaman, it makes much more sense to work on things like canni 5, virulent paralysis, radiant cure, natural durability, spell casting subtlety, and the like, than put healing AA anywhere near the top of the list.  That's why you don't see shamans running to the healing AA quickly.  There's VERY little return  even for maxing healing out, and doing so means putting a lot of unquestionably more useful things on the back burner for a very long time indeed.  Going for healing early is a poor decision for shamans, and that's the reason few make it.<br />
<br />
Now, when a shaman has a handy number of hundreds of AA under his belt, then the tiny incremental gains in healing he can get from AA deserve more consideration.  <br />
<br />
But until then, it would be more surprising to see one with all his healing AA than without -- and I don't think a low AA shaman with his healing maxed would necessarily be a guy who made the right choices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This goes back to the &quot;versatility&quot; that we have over other classes.  Druids don't need healing aa's, but chances are if they are healing in later content- they have them anyway.  The druid, in a group, handles two group aspects primarily: healing and nuking.  For most content, you still need a slower- and you have 3 to choose from.  Chances are, if we are asked to heal- we will also be the slower of the group.  We cover two &quot;requirements&quot; in a group.  <br />
<br />
Do we have aa paths that net better results than healing aa's? yes<br />
<br />
The majority of them are solo based that happen to be just as beneficial in groups. (i.e. canni 5, VP3, LR5, ID5, RC)  Druids are the same way, many of the aa's they choose first directly effect their soloing power.<br />
<br />
EQ has evolved to the point that slow is a necessity not an option.  We can slow and we are the best at it if only by a small margin.  We can also main/bridge heal in most content- that is our grouping power.  <br />
<br />
I think that EQ has also evolved to the point that people are wary with who they group with.  There is a big difference between a new 65 shaman and one who has 200+ aa's.  There is also a big difference between a sub-par/avg player and one who knows what he is doing.  In EQ today, if you screw up- even if only a little, the group wipes.  Unfortunately who can not determine any of this by doing a /who all X class.  I still get plenty of tells, but I find myself in groups with the same people.  Is it because they are blind to the shaman's fate? no.  Players want to be successful in their group efforts- wiping wastes tremendous time, so players tend to stick with who they know.  If I have a puller in the group who nows what he is doing then I don't need a chanter.  If I have a druid who knows what he is doing then I don't need a cleric.  If I have a caster who can root/cc mobs then I don't need an off-tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I am confused, seriously.<br />

I am basically asking for the Shaman to <br />

- heal a little less than Druids are healing for in &quot;GoD&quot;(We already do this, I just put us a little closer to Druid healing)<br />
- DoT for less than Necros while still having the same aggro limitations(we already do that in GoD too btw, all I did is add a resist mod to our DoTs to allow us to actually land them without the need to Malos)<br />
<br />
and some of you are honestly saying that I am asking for too much?</div></div><hr />

The entire Tash line enchanters have is also unresistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">In normal exp groups I use the following:<br />
Tnargs<br />
Quie<br />
Balance<br />
Malos<br />
FA<br />
Canni 4<br />
Utility Slot/DoT, Krag, requested rebuff etc <br />
Haste/DD<br />
<br />
On raids, while buffing, soloing, etc different spell sets of course.  Now in normal groups for exp I like to Make sure Mob is debuffed, slowed, then I wait to do back up spot type healing.  I only exp now in EP's or LDoN for fun.  Why waste your time exp other places unless you are helping a friend or guildie out.  On Raids I take on a different role depending on what and where.  There are so many different types of shaman out there.  You have your root/rot which we all are if we solo.  You have the reverse kiters, again solo.  You have your pure raiding shaman, Maxed out AA's Maxed out LDoN charm etc.  You have shaman who like to do alot of dmg while in a group.  There are many more kinds.  All of these are fine to be as long as your group/raid knows ahead of time what you will be doing.  If you as a shaman where invited to a group of SK, Ranger, BST, Cleric, Druid you wouldn't really have to worry about heals all that much now would ya?  However remove the cleric and add a rogue then you would.  But you would have beastie to assist with slows and small heals while the druid would take over the cleric role.  Thier mana would not be used for nuking it would be almost all heals.  My wife is a cleric and so I am never with out one of those in a group.  We almost always have the same ranger too.

Balance IS a big issue but again there is no way to satisfy the multiple playinf styles of all shaman.  I mean for real, to hell with balancing us with other classes, they have to figure out how to balance us with us first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alright I'll bit. I ask you what kind of Shaman would not find their concerns adressed, *if* those changes I proposed went live?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Predicus said:<br />
<br />
We &quot;are&quot; versatile in the fact that we hold the ability to dot,nuke,heal,slow,tank,cripple,debuff, canni, and have a pet.<br />
<br />
Somebody much wiser than me said -<br />
<br />
Being able to do a lot of things - * POORLY * does not mean we are balanced.<br />
<br />
I think you can add versatility to that as well. <br />
<br />
Shaman DOTs generate massive aggro and require a fight to run longer than it takes Roseanne to polish off a bag of Oreo's.<br />
<br />
Shaman Nukes? Yeah, when groups are looking for &quot;nukers&quot; I can't see them saying - &quot;Hmm No Wizards, Mages, Rangers, Enchanters, Clerics...Oh wait - grab that Shaman for his NUKES&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaman Heals? Well there WAS a time when Shaman healed as well as a Druid.  But those days are like baseball before the designated hitter - resigned to history books.<br />
<br />
Shaman Slows? Wow. Yep, Shaman can slow 5% better than an Enchanter AND 10% better than a BL. Woo Hoo !<br />
<br />
/e does a &quot;We're number 1 dance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Where's my &quot;We're the best slower&quot; cookie? Oh over in the 'mitigated' jar?<br />
<br />
Shaman tanking? Sure - in Droga. Whoops - 6 expansion old content. Hey, if &quot;tanking&quot; trivial content or LB's floats yer boat - I'm happy for you. <br />
<br />
NEWSFLASH: Shaman don't get groups because they can 'tank.' Heck Wizards can tank if they get healed and the MOB gets dropped fast enough.  Same with Enchanters, Clerics, yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
Shaman Cripple? See above comments about Nukes.<br />
<br />
Shaman Canni? Woo hoo ! We can get Carpal Tunnel with a self-only MR ability. Shaman Canni is like being the best stripper at the club. Yeah, it's 'nice' but not something you write home to mom and dad about.<br />
<br />
Shaman Pet?  Umm yeah...36 DPS is awesome. No really. If you're bringing up Dogdog (Whom I do love) as an example of Shaman 'versatility' then as Cartman would say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok dude - you are seriously reaching right about now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaman need * something. * We can argue over what that something is - but I don't think we have heartburn that Shaman do need something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that post says all I have to say on the subject of balance, in short and very bluntly we do not have a primary ability and we are punished severly for it (as in slow is to weak compared to other slowers to call it a primarly ability but we get it up the ass for having it anyway)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I am confused, seriously.<br />
I am basically asking for the Shaman to <br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing basic about it<br />
<br />
<br />
- nuke like Enchanter, Cleric, Necro<br />
<br />
<br />
Enchanter<br />
Insanity Lvl 64, 6 sec cast time 8 sec recast 1100 Dmg Resist Check Magic 300 Mana (78.57 DPS per cycle, cycle = DMG / (Cast + recast time)<br />
Cleric<br />
Condemnation Lvl 62, 6.5 sec cast time 7 sec recast 1100 Dmg Resist Check Magic, 365 Mana (81.48 DPS per Cycle)<br />
Necro<br />
Neurotoxin Lvl 61, 6 sec cast time 4 sec recast 1260/1300 Dmg resist check Poisen, 465 Mana (130 DPS per cycle)<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Velium Strike Lvl 64, 7.8 sec cast time 2.25 recast, 925 Dmg Resist check Cold, 300 Mana (92.04 DPS per cycle)<br />
OR<br />
Tears of Saryrn Lvl 63, 6 sec cast, 12 sec recast, 650/1950 Dmg, Resist check Poisen, 450 Mana (36.11 to 108.33 DPS per cycle)<br />
<br />
Seems to me that we already do - nuke like Enchanter, Cleric, Necro<br />
<br />
<br />
- heal a little less than Druids are healing for in &quot;GoD&quot;(We already do this, I just put us a little closer to Druid healing)<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok I agree with you on this<br />
<br />
<br />
- DoT for less than Necros while still having the same aggro limitations(we already do that in GoD too btw, all I did is add a resist mod to our DoTs to allow us to actually land them without the need to Malos)<br />
<br />
<br />
Again since we already do this, you would like to add a Lure type resist check mod to it like a Wizzy.  What about the other classes that rely on our debuff?  We are talking normal exp groups not &quot;perfect&quot; groups.  I get asked to Malo X all the time for weapon procs to hit not to mention actual casting charecters who ask.<br />
<br />
<br />
and some of you are honestly saying that I am asking for too much?<br />
<br />
No, I think you are asking for something that for the most part is already in place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">With heals equal to Druid's ones, not less, I'll be eventually be back.<br />
<br />
With BOTH DD line equal in damage than cleric's generic one and the cast time lowered, I'll be eventually be back.<br />
<br />
With both changes, I'll be definitively be back.<br />
<br />
Druids won't be lesser healers than us, we'll be at the exact same point but instead of bringing debuffs, they still have a far better DPS with DD by a large margin.<br />
<br />
Clerics will be a bit less efficient DPS due to their odd recast time (that should be removed if we get these changes), but they will still be the king and most needed healer in the game.<br />
<br />
As the fights are damn too short and dots aggro far too huge and bugged, I don't see any others way to bring us back in the battle.<br />
<br />
Increasing the dots damage and reducing the lenght will just bring us far more too much aggro and we'll overaggro the MA with no way to stop it...<br />
<br />
Increasing our pet would be a joke. I don't see this happening as we are already asking to have our pet DW innatly... and it's already seems to be asking too much in this area.<br />
<br />
So what ? the only thing SoE seems to be thinking about is increasing and upgrading our statts buffs who do next to nothing (and even with +accuracy, +striketrought, +offense, yadda yadda yadda but no other consequant balancing, I won't even start to think to come back).<br />
<br />
PS : sorry for bad english, i'm tired. I don't got enough sleep last night :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I just have to say that something like stonestance would absolutely rock for shaman.   Our aggro is so huge and the mobs these days so deadly that it would be an immense help to us who like to do things quickly (instead of wait 2 secs then slow etc,  no time for that!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I think one thing we can all agree on is that changing our buffs would do nothing to balance us.  I also think that a change in our healing ability would make us a more viable option in groups.  Since we can already &quot;nuke&quot; as well as other healers, no need to change that.  Maybe have a slight mod to resists, sure that would help some.  Over all the shaman class is how I feel, others opinions altho different are just as valid, is the way it should be.  A few minor changes and presto a nicer class to play for some and  an unchanged class for others.  I am all for people having fun playing a game, but when we asked for more content they gave it to us, as buggy as it was we got it.  When we asked for a more dynamic game again we got it, but that flickered and went out.  If we as a class can come up with a solid way to balance US and present it in a way that SoE would see our point, maybe then they would make a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">If any Clerics are reading this could you pull up how much DPs you do in a regualr fight? In GoD Or Hard LDON. Also figure out how many times you heal as well. And for how much.<br />
<br />
Once we have those numbers lets do the same for a shaman with no other people helping keep a group alive. <br />
<br />
Wait we can't. No group would go with a shaman as the only healer in challanging content. The shaman group would die.<br />
<br />
Therin lies the problem. Any of the three priest classes can deal with trivial content. and even Clerics do good DPS in trivial content. But only one class can truely heal in new content. And Even with that one class healing with a  lower end tank there will be deaths. But with that single class (Cleric) Even deaths really don;t slow you down if the whole group doesnt wipe and the Cleric lives.  With the other viable healer if you are fast and lucky. maybe you have one death and an Evvac. But no way to return the dead player without waiting for him to come back.<br />
<br />
Shaman can mitagate mob damage the best with slow (When not resisted/ Mitagated/immune) But have the weakest heals by far. Clerics can Mitagate second best with stuns (When allowed to use them and they land) But have the best heals no doubt. And druids get to mitagate damage by killing the monster faster with nukes and dots But also get the second best heals. <br />
<br />
The Only god damn thing wrong with this is that Slow Mitagation/ immunity strips us of our ability to heal. And our ability to slow is based off of Malos (A slow casting spell in the extreme) Making our Hots better might help this some agasint the lowest level of slow mitagation but when a monster is very capable of killing any tank in 2 rounds of combat witha  few lucky hits we have to have more spam healing power.  Or a long duration heal over time that when coupled with our weak spam heals is enough to do the job. We Dont have time currently to Spam heal then Breath of Daluda then start another spam heal. The tanks die before the next one lands.  So to fix us. So we can actually do a worthwhile bit of healing. <br />
<br />
I just thought of something possibly useful.  Add a blast heal component to Daluda/Quesance. When we cast the spell Let it do the heal for 1600 then start the heal over time ticks. That would let us when needed spam a quick heal then a New Hotblast then back to the Blast heal again so the next round we will have some small catchup ability.  <br />
<br />
Add to this Healing AA and Focus effects acting on HoT's and we are once again Viable healers. Without infringing on Clerics dominance. <br />
<br />
Then all you need to do for Shaman to get off your damn back on the damage is Make a Bane upgrade that doesnt take 24 seconds to recharge and does 800ish Damage a tick with a neg 75 resist check Vrs magic. If you wanted to make it more viable then Add a blast component to it So that it can only add risk while soloing in the dangerous places. (It could break root then)<br />
<br />
If you really wanted to make a dent in Shaman greivances. Then create an AA That penetrates Slow Mitagation. 5% 15% then 25% Of Slow mitagation ignored. And this should be Shaman only. No beastlords get it. No Chanters get it. So if something Mitagates our slow to slightly slowed we would be roughly one rank above that. And get rid of All slow immune mobs Make the currently immune ones Extremly Mitagated So if a regular slow lands it would be 1% slowed. But witha  shaman with the AA above it could be 25% slowed. <br />
<br />
Then for a  final bear hug to all the shaman that are feeling like you hate us Make a new pet. That innately duel weilds. Regens Base 250 Hps a tick has Spirit of the wolf speed innately But has roughly 125% of the current level 61 pet summons. The regen will make it survive when not having direct aggro But with the low base Hit points it cant truly tank for us. Its Dps when fully hasted buffed and Useing mage gear should fall around 45 DPS.Against the GoD based mobs. <br />
<br />
Add to all this the Buff changes and such and we could be sitting pretty again. With the ability to once again do useful things in a group reguardless of that groups makeup. But not taking the place specificly of a specialist<br />

Bludletters, no offense, but you are way off base here.<br />
<br />
Any calculation of rain DPS that assumes all waves land for full is highly unrealistic. Head over to the mage boards and check their parses - note the intrinsic resist rate of ~20% on rains.<br />
<br />
You are also neglecting the fact that clerics and chanters can mem their best 2 nukes and alternate them to avoid the recast delay (Clerics - Order, Condemnation; Enchanters - Madness of Ikkibi, Insanity). The pacing of GoD content is very rapid, making faster cast times extremely important. These days, being able to do things fast is far more useful than being able to do them efficiently.<br />
<br />
I don't think any of Giac's suggestions are out of line. I think they would make shaman a balanced and desired class for high-end content.</div></div><hr />

You see more than I do then. Tears of Saryrn can't be included in this calculation as it is highly situational. <br />
Comparing the straight nuking power(including a supplementary nuke to alternate for Enchanter and Clerics in order to circumvent the recast), you clearly see that up to GoD, Shamans do in no way nuke like Enchanter, Necro, Cleric.<br />
<br />
Again since we already do this, you would like to add a Lure type resist check mod to it like a Wizzy.  What about the other classes that rely on our debuff?

<br />
Where you ever invited to a group for Malos? In exp groups people do their damage just fine, the only one having troubles landing spells is the Shaman usually.<br />
Lure spells have a resist mod of -300. I am asking for -50 and -100 respectively for DoTs, a source of damage that is definitely inferior to a DD. On top of that, DDs are already coded to land easier, something that was implemented in late Velious<br />
<br />
No, I think you are asking for something that for the most part is already in place.<br />
<br />
Not really. The basics are there, but I am asking for small tweaks in several areas to actually allow me to use them effectively and not just look at them on paper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Our poisons should have a -50 resist adjustment. Well, given that they are pretty good below 50 let them scale from 0 at lvl 49 to -50 for Blood.<br />

No Offense taken, but we can do the same thing with our 2 best Nukes.  Now our DPS changes slightly.  Notice that I had a range for the Rain spell assuming only 1 hit or all 3 times.  Velium Strike is 92.04 DPS, add in Spear of Torment with its 4.2 sec cast time that raises our potential DPS to 112.28 for the 2 spells.  That is casting Spear immediately after Strike thats 1600 DMg every 14.25 Secs.  Also the person that said being able to do many things poorly does not make us balanced, I agree with that, However being able to play the class as I like to Very Effectively mitigates that statement somewhat.  As I said before we all play our shamans a little bit differently.  To increase everything and change everything that each of us would like to see is an unreasonable request.  How do you tell them which things to change when we as a class can't agree what needs to be changed?  As an example just making one up mind you this is directed at no one.  I want better heals, lower cast times, and better resist checks on my spells.  You want More dmg on our nukes and Better DoTs.  She wants a better pet and better buffs.  So on and so forth.</div></div><hr />

Neither Velium Strike nor Spear of Torment have a recast time that exceeds the &quot;innate&quot; delay all spells have, so there's no point in alternating them as chaining the higher DPS one is superior(duh!).</div></div><hr />
