<br />
we had a 60 warrior tanking in PoV and he wasn't holding agro well and must have died at least 12 times over the night, other than that the group was pretty solid but after a while the cleric started asking him things like<br />
<br />
&quot;are you sure you are a warrior (instert name here) you are tanking more like a hybrid&quot;<br />
<br />
it got some laughs and later on he asked him<br />
<br />
&quot;are you sure your mother wasn't part elf or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
there were a lot of other things, but it was really funny... <br />
<br />
<br />
i was wondering if you guys ever had a cleric like this and what funny quotes you could remember</div></div><hr />

This poor enchanter must have died 6-7 times that night and no one else died.  The enchanter was really cool though and knew death was common for enchanters.</div></div><hr />

I have had trouble keeping agro, let alone some poor warrior without a nice proccing weapon.<br />
<br />
Next time he did that, she told him she had just used up her last wizard heal for the raid, and if his life bar dropped, he was on his own, and that she hoped he had bandages :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;when you see the mob say &quot;you will not evade me &lt;insert wizards name here&gt;&quot;</div></div><hr />

&quot;Heal less, ress more&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one was available so in the end, I came to tank for them.<br />
<br />
Joined the group, first thing cleric said was :&quot;mourn my mana&quot;<br />
<br />
well didnt die once and had loads of fun the whole evening, I even ended up tanking the Sleepwalker. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarril</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been known to talk a heck of a lot in my groups :P<br />
<br />
On my guild board I have some 750 or so posts.  The next guy after me has about 400... :P<br />
<br />
There was this one guy I joined up with (another ranger) and I think we managed to annoy the other group members with comments on how superior rangers were :P.  And then everytime one of us took aggro, the cleric would say, &quot;Gonna need a med break after this.&quot; And everytime he healed us he would shout, &quot;Ranger heal!&quot; (note this was when we both still had our 100pt heal) :P<br />
<br />
The next day he joined my guild... :P He's still a laugh though :)</div></div><hr />
