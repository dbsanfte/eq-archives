<br />
Anyone know of Euro guilds recruiting Shaman atm? Texvu flagged :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blaorfi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure if your willing to server move, but if your good and have high play time, you might consider moving to the VS server.<br />
<br />
The whole server is euro based and there are 3 top end guilds on there that are about where you are.  Im not sure if any are recuiting but its always worth a look if your intrested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">totally open to a server move, was originally on BristleBroke thought about going back their. Only place don't want to goto is the Ubisoft servers:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Antonius Bayle is almost 100% Euro, server is in UK.<br />
<br />
AB forums are at http://www.antonius-bayle.org/index.php?<br />
<br />
Not sure if any of the top guilds are looking for shamans though, fairly unlikely, but you can browse through the guild listings and recruitment to see who's hiring :)<br />
<br />
Kane Bayle is also Euro (sorry don't know forums address for them) and both of these are SoE servers and not Ubisoft.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What servers divineGrace on?<br />
<br />
And AB had 1 for a shaman spot in Raging fury (level top guild with Darkwind) but they closed it in the last few days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">We are on Erollisi Marr. This is a US server so DG is only top Euro guild on the server. This is a good site to check up other guilds:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I would honestly suggest AB Jeis.  I came from there originally (no, i'm not euro.. that's just where my friends decided to start their characters at for some reason) and it was a nice place honestly.. although for my first 20 levels I didn't group with anyone that spoke english :(<br />
<br />
but.. good luck to you.  I know it's hard whenever a guild dies, and Remedy had been around a long time :(</div></div><hr />

Taler du dansk?<br />

<br />
Just kidding you, I have had no problems speaking english with anyone, although sometimes it's more easy to spot one who does not have english as first language.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just stopped so i guess www.europaguild.net has a opening for a shaman, since you got the flags to where they are raiding now you will fit right in.<br />
btw europa is on druzzil ro server.</div></div><hr />
