<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am sick to death of buffing people. God knows why, but I cringe everytime I group and start getting bombarded with &quot;focus, sta,agi,acumen plz&quot; tells. It is all I can do to stop myself from ungrouping. I think I am going through a shaman burnout. That being said, the idea of playing a warrior is looking very cool to me, if only cause a) I have a lvl 20 twink, b) I have a fungi and I'm not afraid to use it, and c) I have some nice stuff for a warrior, provided by a friend and by my own exp camps.<br />
<br />
EQ is pushing 3 years old now, and it took me 2.25 years to get Smylee to 60. Assuming I cannot play more than about 3-4 hours a day, is it worth it? What I am really trying to do is find a justification for not cancelling my account, and I think it would be novel to ASK for buffs instead of giving them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Give the warrior a try, Smylee.  I have one and he's a lot of fun.  Although I have it easy in that he's on another account and the laptop suffices for a PLing shaman, but still great fun to play.  The life of a warrior is vastly different from us shamans and it's truly a breath of fresh air sometimes.<br />
<br />
For the shaman, I find myself trying to beat people to the punch if/when I group up with non-guildmates and immediately say something like &quot;buffs inc asap&quot; or &quot;Go ahead and pull, I'll buff as we fight&quot;.  Seems to keep the annoying tells to a minimum, at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Believe me when you're a Warrior you'll be wondering when the buffs are incoming and dieing to type &quot;need haste, gen and sow&quot; or whatever but you won't, you'll just wait and wait because you know how annoying that can be.<br />
<br />
You'll be thinking of a million ways to broach the subject, what usually works is either sipping down a SoW potion in front of them or gettin' the tar beat out of ya. The only bright side is you'll usually get buffed before they start to slow but boy do they like to melee and nuke. <br />
<br />
/slightly sarcastic off:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I feel the pain.  After 54 levels of playing nothing except a shaman, I'm starting to get burnt out.  My 57sk friend lets me play his character every now and then, and it is a real godsend.  I love being a shaman, but every now and then I JUST WANT TO BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF THINGS :D<br />
<br />
The only reason I haven't made a serious twink, is because I feel like im wasting time and resources that could be spent on Jinheim.  If I wanted I could blow the 5k I have to my name on some decent monk weapons and armor, give him my fungi tunic, and go have some fun, but I'd feel like I wasted my time when the day was through /sigh<br />
<br />
Try the twink.  If you are completely burnt on your main, it will be a great release to play a melee class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A warrior+fungi is a lot of fun and zero hassle: exactly right for you, given your current state of mind.<br />
<br />
I've played one myself.  I found it particularly enjoyable to continue to pull as the casters brayed 'lom' or better still 'oom': up until level 40 - depending on degree of twinkage - or so a fungi'd warrior doesnt care what mana his support team has.<br />
<br />
For additional entertainment call your warrior 'Ressem', 'Kitem' etc. and go anon.  Then when buff beggars send tells, give them your location and give them a big welcome on arrival.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you fancy being away from groups for a while then roll up a monk.  A monk plus a fungi, plus any haste item and half decent weapon is a soloing machine.<br />
<br />
I find nothing better for stress than a good soloing session!  In game only of course :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aramous Chlovare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That is why I made a Rogue. I am having so much fun with this character now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I played a warrior before I played shaman and it was like a whole new game.  But i suggest not jumping right into warrir after shaman.  You will just get pissed having to ask for sows and invis and get yourself killed.  Maybe try a paly or ranger.  Warriors get the dirty job and you have to really love melee to be one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm really diggin' the shiznit outta my new meat shield. I 3 box him with my Shammy and Druid and the fun/exp just keeps rolling in.<br />
<br />
[EDIT]<br />
<br />
Tried a Monk (named Absolu Tzero :)) before I revived Dith, but just couldn't get into it. I like toys and gadgets and the monks minimalist lifestyle of 'doing without' just wasn't fun for me. Warriors have access to more fun gear/toys than just about any other class. FD would have been nice, yes. But not really needed when you've literally got your own group that includes buffs, heals, and evacs. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My main is a 60 shaman and I have a 39 warrior.  I started a monk and twinked him with my fungi and SCHW.  Now, he's 36 and I'm stripping the warrior to buy monk gear.<br />
<br />
Monks are waaaaaay more fun than warriors.  You don't need anyone.  You don't even need sow.  There's something incredibly casual and stress free when you have FD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shekina Wolfhowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did the samething when I hit 51. Burned out with hey shammy give me a SoW, I need speed, toss me a heal please... grrrr<br />
<br />
Anyway, I made a monk. I love my monk. <br />
<br />
<br />
Shekky is my favorite toon, but there are days where I just need to beat the bejeebers out of something and that is when Gavri comes in handy.<br />
<br />
After four days of playing Gavri is level 34. Can ya tell I've been feeling a bit tense lately? LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When burnout sets in make yourself a twink, play melee a while but I guarantee that in a few weeks once the novely wears off you'll be back on your self-sufficient shaman.  I find I can only play melee for small periods of time in one sitting, its just..well dull I spose.<br />
Now if only shaman werent so needed on raids I and people stopped saying 'sing mana' I'd go bard full time.<br />
<br />
Wilu SpiritBinder - 60 Shm<br />
Scactha HunderedSouls - 60 Rog<br />
Kareoke Kokee - 49 Bard<br />
Tiggly Tastic - 36 War</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My alt is a SK.<br />
<br />
Melee is very relaxing compaired to a shaman.<br />
<br />
No heals,  no buffs,  and no SoW is just awesome sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Azzi is still my favorite character (though she's irritating me right now). I truly love playing a Shaman, their versatility and survivability make it hard for me to do something else. But there comes a time for every Shaman, I think, where if you see &quot;haste&quot; one more time you're going to scream. <br />
<br />
I started a Warrior the first time I got fed up. She was nicely twinked and even PL'd a bit when I came back to EQ with Luclin (group Aego at level 11? *drools*). She is definately a nice change of pace. She's usually grouped with my boyfriend's twinked Enchanter (he's usually a SK) and we have a great time. Of course, being able to say &quot;haste me, buff monkey&quot; might have something to do with that ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thats one reason i made my monk, buffing gets boring quickly esp on raids. It is nice not to worry about anything to do with spells as a monk. Im sure warriors are good but i fancied the pulling as an added advantage.<br />
<br />
Trouble is i play both monk and shaman at same time so still have to buff to a certain degree :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">hey u could be a gnome sk  doent that prospect excite ya?  heheh<br />
<br />
actually i did start one, and was suprised how effective they are.  ok there str suks big time&gt; but a litllte twinkin gets u past 150 str easy.<br />
<br />
The big advantage to gnome is they have wow int- and u get skill ups REAL fast compared to a ogre shaman.  pls lots of mana of course.<br />
<br />
monk or SK    best melee option imo  cos of FD.   and both easy to solo with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sage advice all, in the end I decided to start little ogre war up again. Actually, grouping in ill omen at 20 was quite fun, kept the fungi bagged so the cleric could do something useful :D . Main tanking red con sarnaks made me feel damned uber, let me tell you :)<br />
<br />
Problem is, how the heck do you out-taunt uber_monk_twink_03 with his insane damage? I've done the monk thing twice now on second accounts (1 on a friends account which lay dormant 2 weeks out of 3 but is now used full time for his main, and the other where the friend turned out to be a total loser) and got 1 to 43, one to 51. Warrior is good because they rely on groups, and it's even fun. NO BUFFING!<br />
<br />
Not feeling eloquent tonight. Thanks for the input tho guys =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
remember...Twinking doesn't affect anyone but the twink.  You are just imagining things.  If you can't hold aggro you aren't doing you job. <br />
(ok, that was sarcastic...but if you are twinked and can't hold aggro...wow, thats a bad mofo monk. :) )</div></div><hr />
