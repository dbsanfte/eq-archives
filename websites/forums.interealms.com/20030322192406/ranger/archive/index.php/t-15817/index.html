<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thebigred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is rivervale the closest trainer, or would it be better to go to kelethin (i'm a wood elf).  Would halflings kill me?  Just started EQ and don't know the ways well, so anyone have any opinions on what i should do?  I'm level  7.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You would be fine with teh halflings, but it is a dangerous journey for a low level from FP to rivervale.  You have to pass through Kithcore forest which also has a ranger trainer.  Your best bet is to find the PoP portal in freeport (behind a hidden wall outside) and head up to the Plane of Knowledge if you have the expansion.  There is a trainer up there or you can take the Kelathen portal home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>thebigred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't own PoP, where is this ranger trainer in Kith forest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Crimsonsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the trainer in kithicor is called Morin Shadowbane (i think thats his last name) he's closer to the High hold pass zone than EC. Stay on the main path and keep trying to track him. You'll find him eventually</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">aye closest would be kitch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SwordMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, and only do it during the day. The forest turns from merely dangerous to outrageously dangerous at night.</div></div><hr />
