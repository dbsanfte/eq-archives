My old guild is doing a reunion in VP this Saturday.   I had gotten all my pieces together last night except the pained soul, which had given me problems.  Since it was coming down to the wire, I decided to auction for the MQ.   I found one very late at night and proceeded to the quest NPC.   In my haste and sleepyness I messed up the turn in bad.   The person doing the MQ had said put items in trade window.  I was not thinking and actually turned them in first.  Ending result is person that was MQing it got the last piece.  Now the dilemma I am in is that person said they would do final turn in with me.  I have a guildee with a trak tooth and he has to be on at the same time.  Should I just say forgot it and try to quest the pieces again?  Plus how do I know that the person doing the MQ will not get the key this time?  Not saying that they purposely will take it, but to be honest I know they needed it and I don't know em well enough.  Is there a way to determine who turns in items first and if it has taken place?   You can flame me for getting myself in this position, but I really didn't have the time.  Any suggestions??  Hoping for good answers and not &quot;you retard&quot;, I have already completed that part of the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my experience, the person that gets the final item, is the person that does the turn in LAST.  Most, if not all quest givers only keep track of what is turned in.  So get the one person to turn in the medallion, then the other to turn in the tooth, then you turn in the last 2 medallions.<br />

Once, when doing one of my Totemic quests, had one of the pieces wrong, but all my other pieces were taken as well.  I found out what was wrong, and 2 days later (no patches) turned it in and I still got the final item.  Totemic was popular at the time so I know there were probably plenty of turn ins before I got to try again.  And I believe if anyone had just turned in that one item I didnt, they would have gotten my quest piece.<br />

edit- how do you know the person did the turn in first?  Not sure you will know actually, I cant remember if you will see on your screen or not that the piece was turned in, Im so used to MQ with mine and my wifes characters, of course I see it on at least one screen, maybe someone else can help you out here.</div></div><hr />
