<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JESTER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, I a 60 shaman that soloed almost all the time, I would like to group for better exp and better drop's but when I go lfg I get offers from tier 3 or 2 and have no idea even how to get there, I have tried to find maps showing connections here and at eq atlas and any advise on how to dozones but no luck I am hoping someone has some advise and perhaps a link to maps, I thought there was 1 on here before but I canntot find in with search, any help would be great, thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi Hester, as a lvl 60 you can accept PoS/PoV group requests, but not BoT requests unless you get flagged for BoT.<br />
<br />
To get to Valor, go into the tunnel with the port stones at the end and click the second from the right.<br />
To get to Storms, go through the other tunnel, past the waterfall &amp; click on the wierd watery monument on the first istland you get to.<br />
I'm guessing you know how to get to tier 1 planes, so I wont patronise you further.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Crypt of Decay is the tunnel just past the Plane of Disease pipe &amp; click the orb at the bottom.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Valor is 2nd from left, I think.  Hmm, but I suppose that depends on which way you're facing.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Valor is tunnel directly off from the watefall/scales to poj. Take the tunnel in til you come through the tunnel to the semi (almost full circle) of stone. Its 2nd on the left. 9 or 10 oclock if it were a clock face i think. <br />
<br />
  Plane of storm is the next tunnel down from the water fall /scales. But futher along with the windmill more in sight but stilll flollowing walll. Follow that tunnel in and you walk onto a bridgeway so to speak and its first big rock. Its not a stone like the pok stones of the pov stones its a big boulder on a little isle and click on that.<br />
<br />
 COD tunnel is  stones throw up away from pod sludge drop down. Just slightly up the hill from pod is a tunnel works it way down and at the end is the only stone there and thats COD.</div></div><hr />
