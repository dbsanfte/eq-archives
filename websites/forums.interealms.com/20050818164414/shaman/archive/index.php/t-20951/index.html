<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just thought I would point everyone to an interesting thread on Paladins of Norrath.<br />
<br />
Paladins (http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=19721.topic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice to see that SOE is looking to take care of the Knight classes.  I guess they are not obsolete like Shamans are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It may be there are some melee balance issues in GoD.  I haven't seen it, but I haven't seen much of GoD.  <br />
<br />
I have seen that Paladins were way overpowered as tanks compared to warriors for a long time.  I remember the poll here indicating that 90% of shaman would rather have a paladin tank over a warrior.  <br />
<br />
I have also seen that a lot of the posters in those forums are basically god-mode players who want to be warriors with spellbooks and heal as well as or better than shaman.  I mean, they don't say that, but many constantly advocate for stuff that will have that impact.  <br />
<br />
Then there's the mounds of intellectually dishonest stuff that's posted, like their spellbooks are useless.  <br />
<br />
So I hope SOE shifts through what I expect to see a ton of drek to get to some legitimate issues.  I don't like the idea of changing encounters depending on who is in the group. <br />
<br />
They seem really lazy these days, so I have no confidance that will occur.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I remember the poll here indicating that 90% of shaman would rather have a paladin tank over a warrior.  <br />
.<br />
<br />
Aye the worm has turned.  The melee fixes for warriors have made them more valuable in many encounters than Pallys.<br />
<br />
It is my understanding that Paladins heal as well as shaman now, based on percent below clerics.  But I could be wrong and I have no doubt someone will point out the error of my ways.<br />
<br />
It looks like most of the paladins agree with you (as I do) that mitigating damage based on class is a lame fix.  But it would be an easy fix - far easier than finding a solution to the shaman obsolescence problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just hope, they rethink their somehow weird idea of tuning encounters towards the classes, that are present in the actual group.<br />
<br />
In theory it may sound like a good idea, but<br />
1. i don't think, they will get it right (sorry for the honesty ;) ).<br />
2. it will distract from the core issue, that GoD design is too dependant on raw (sometimes obscene) dps output of mobs.<br />
3. when content starts to counter design flaws of classes with varying difficulty levels, there is no reason left to fix that flaws to begin with.<br />
4. following point 3. those flaws won't magically disappear, so will ALL new GoD style content have that feature? /shudder.<br />
<br />
It's a bad and somewhat lazy attempt to solve the current issues. When SOE decides to increase game speed and mob dps (=basic game mechanics), they have to take the time to look at ALL classes (including shaman and knights ...) and retune them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thinking about them attempting to scale encounters based on group setup. &lt;&lt;Yikes&gt;&gt; In all honesty, that's really scary and shows my lack of trust in the SOE programmers.They have problems with very simple issues and now they want to attempt this fiasco! Come on still havent fixed collisions within the game shrunk in bearform I still get stuck on stairs or rocks. Sometimes I really dont understand what reasoning they use to come up with the ideas at Cluster Central, almost feel like I am back in the military.</div></div><hr />
