<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kalrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Sha-Rood lives!  And he is in my guild!  We went to go kill some giants in Kael last night, and I said that I would be main slower as I am 2 levels higher than him.  Well, we get a couple of adds and he decides to help me slow.  Needless to say, he gets aggro and dies.  This prompts me to ask what his AC is because he didn't last very long.  Turns out that at lvl 52, his AC is about 650 and I bet his defense isn't even maxed.  Now we are far from an uber guild, in fact I am about the highest level at 54, but my 917 AC sure does allow me to take a whole lot more of a beating than he did.  I then followed that up with a wis check and he is in the 190 - 200 range while I am sitting in the 160 - 170 range.  Even after he died, I couldn't convince him that he should go AC over Wis.  /boggle  We were in a raid situation at the time, so I didn't have a chance to talk to him all that much, but it is time to take this to our guild message boards and see if I can't convince him.  Wish me luck!  And links are appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I personally never seen a dead Shaman cast a spell. But that's just me !</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand you're an iksar, but that does not seem possible to me.  My defense is at like 191 at lvl 47, at my naked AC is 530'ish.  Yet you, 9 levels lower, with say 9 more defense points than me, have like 120 more naked AC? heh.  At lvl 60 you guys come out like 40 AC ahead, how do you come out 100+ AC ahead 9 levels below me?  Maybe i'm wrong or crazy, but that seems like utter bull**** to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maxing defense is the first thing any true shaman should do.  Gear is subordinate to this mandate.  <br />
<br />
I met a lvl 51 shaman girl with 135 defense and about 560 AC.  Needless to say she was about the most gimp shaman of that level I've ever seen.  Barbarian druid too . . . SP gloves and everything.  Very sad.  I instructed her in &quot;The Way&quot;TM and she learned quickly.  Last I heard from her she was doing better, had defense up to 165 and was working on it more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It was a joke, I was merely pointing out that his AC very low for his level. <br />
I have maxed defense and my AC is about 558 naked, just an FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&lt; 587ac naked at 60 with a base agi of 90 and that will happen around lvl 40 with max defence on an Iksar.<br />
<br />
Think theres a number muddled there, 550 sure, 650, no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If i'm joking my statement will usually be like &quot;I have more than that naked at 38, heh, well, almost =\&quot;<br />
<br />
You suck at making a joke =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sha-rood = Shaman Drood...  I think.<br />
<br />
Ironically enough, my moment of clarity came last night.  I had already decided to start the migration to HP/AC and keep my Wis around 160 at lvl 43, but last night was the clincher.<br />
<br />
I was grouped with a mage and he summoned 4 or 5  focus items for me...all were AC 4, +10 mana and +10 hps (earring, rings, etc).<br />
<br />
Anyways, oddly enough it dropped my Wis to 150 by my AC went up to 804 (up about 15 pts).  I noticed a *considerable* difference in the beating I was taking when my AC was over 800.  <br />
Kinda weird how a bunch of no rent focus items (that are supposed to help your spell casting) actually increased my HP and AC :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well it's nice that your AC is at a decent level where you can take a few hits. I myself follow the Hp/Ac path. Just be careful about giving your advice to others, especially guildies. If you have already discussed some of the benefits of Hp/Ac to him and he didn't want to go that path, then by all means let him. I wouldn't go on the guild message board and create a discussion about this one guy, seems pretty rude.<br />
<br />
Seems to be a line I draw about giving other people my opinion and not letting them play the game how they want (within reason - especially in a guild and how their playstyle is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's possible to keep AC/HP and Wis up.  At level 52 I have 226 Wis and 900AC unbuffed.  My HP is about 1300 or so as well.  I was a Wis junkie for a long time, but have started moving towards AC and HP.  But I want to keep Wis as high as possible at the same time.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Golden Efreeti Boots on a shaman still make me laugh, especially when the corpse is stuck in a wall and we can just see the shiny feet...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am all for balancing WIS and AC . . . but 650 AC at 52?  That's a little too low IMO, considering the type of raids that he will be going on.  <br />
In this case, he needs to shed some WIS and get some AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yeah, more ac needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Humbert hit the nail on the head.  No one likes to be told how to play their character, and I can't imagine anything positive would come out of the shaman in question seeing this thread.  Any positive advice here is going to be overshadowed by all the jokes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vinas Solamnus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That AC is disturbing, my 24 shammy is self twinked (ran to karnors and picked up Jarcrap ect..) and has a self buffed AC of like 618. but only like 130 wis, but luckily ive still got a million options that increase Ac AND wis still =)<br />
<br />
but back on topic, i agree the ac is low BUT i think that if the shaman got to 51 with that AC, i dont see why they couldnt keep going till they 'see the light' for themselves.<br />
I mean it will be like 4 levels before they realize they are smacking their heads against a brick wall so i say let them learn for themselves. Nobody likes being told how to play, as mentioned above</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frehya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So... he needs some better gear.    You and your guild can help him get that in arena in kael if he is +coldain.  Thurg quest BP an legs would really help and give him his precious mana and wis too.<br />
  Some JB arms helm etc would help and that stuff sells for pretty cheap these days.  Even Hate armor might be an improvement if he doesnt have it.<br />
<br />
Once you do the math for how much mana each point of wis gives you, the idea of balancing AC to Wis starts to look more attractive.  That and considering the exp lost from having such low AC that a cleric has no time to get a heal in before you are dead ...alot.  <br />
<br />
But I agree, in the end, it's his decision to make.   That and enough healers complaining about what a mana sponge he is. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Erg!! I think my ac is only at 500 something! i'm 41 and go ac over wis too (152 wish w/bearform) I'll have to check tonight when I log on!!</div></div><hr />
