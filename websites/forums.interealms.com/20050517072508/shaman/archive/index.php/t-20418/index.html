<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I can confirm that the spell is sold in GoD on the boat city. The shaman spell vendor is very clearly marked in the LoY map feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MMshammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I got someone to buy me several copies and have been contacting shammies between 35 and 45 without GoD to sell them on.<br />
<br />
I have had to sell them for a bit more than the vendor charges (vendor charges about 14pp) as I donated to the guy who bought them for me.<br />
<br />
I noticed that someone had them in Bazaar for 1500pp so i threw the ones i have left in bazaar last night at cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Belinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If any kind Shaman on SOLRO would buy me a copy of this next time they hit God.(Im NOT going to buy any more expansions from SOE.)<br />
I will pay 100pp. They sell or at least are listed in Bazzar for 1-4k range,somewhat sad how people tryto rip off other players.<br />
I asked one seller why he charges so much.... answer &quot; .... hard quest, takes a week or more.... &quot;. No more Fun at all :=(</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got the spell right after I saw the post, just use the Find Feature track any Spell Vendor they are all in the same area. I got the spell off the Troll Shammy Vendor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went to check the canni II situation out on Rodcet. It is on the vendor. I did a who all younger level shaman and sent them all a tell. Not one response. lol. They can get it themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GuybrushThreepwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bah - I spent so long on that quest too...lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, that's all they sell for rare shammy spells, but I hear there is a 50k ranger spell that's now selling for around 12pp, and another one for Bl's.  Unconfirmed of course.  But rumor has it that at least one difficult to get spell per class is now buyable in GoD.</div></div><hr />

I see there are two scrolls called Cannibalize II listed in Lucy. The one marked Race: All is sold in GoD, and the one marked Race: None comes from the old Kunark quest. Weird. I assume they both scribe the same spell.</div></div><hr />
