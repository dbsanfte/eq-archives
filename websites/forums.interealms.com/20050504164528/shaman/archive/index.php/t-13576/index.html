<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I wm 59 right now with 1 orange into it. Was thinking of selling fungi and getting a Taw Ew BP and buying torpor with whatever I have left. Is that reasonable? Or should I just grind out 59 with it and do it afterwards. Thanks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sell it, they're the most overrated/priced item in the game.</div></div><hr />

I am fairly convinced the fungi is one of the best shaman BP available - bar none.  It may not be flashy or fashionable, but it blows the doors off of BPs that just offer static stats.  I will NOT be selling mine when I mem torpor.</div></div><hr />

You should sell it when you mem torpor.  It is the best BP in the game before torpor, but after it isn't as good (though still nice).  This is because the 15hp/tick regen is irrelevant compared to the 300hp/tick from torpor.  Once you have torpor you'll see.  It is still a very good BP that I would keep around until I got something good like a vindi BP, but it IS overrated.  The fungi is NOT like ft7, because the HP doesn't just magically convert itself to mana.  You have to canni, which means it isn't that good.  My fungi is on my ranger now that I have quiescence, vindi BP, QB3, and SCRM.  I keep Q up constantly unless I am afk, so a fungi tunic would be just a drop in the bucket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A BP with 100 HP's matters when you are under 100HP's of health.  Which is like .01% of the time.<br />
<br />
A fungi matters when you are under 100% of health, and for a shaman that is 99.99% of the time.<br />
<br />
Torpor is amazing.  The fungi is amazing.  Hey, they stack!<br />
<br />
During my obligatory solo of Yeldema, I had one equipment slot heal me, mana free, for an extra 1,550 HP's.  <br />
<br />
It's old, it's pricey, it's a fashion disaster, but when it comes to us, who get our mana from health, the fungi rocks.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, my fungi is on my monk. :)  Damn I need another one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Back then I couldn't afford a fungi, but I replaced my ikky bp with a tae ew tunic at 58, which is when we get KM and canni4.  KM/canni4 is a great combo for mana regen, and torpor / quiescence only get better ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fungi is good until you get torpor at 60.  After that point any regen you get is negligable compared to the 300/tick.<br />
<br />
And it's not just 100 hps you're sacrificing.  You're also looking at a potential difference of 50+ AC, resists, um wis(lol)...<br />
<br />
HP regen is well and good, but to suggest that it's FT7 is crapola~ to realize true potential you've got to be canni'ing faster than torpor already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If I had a fungi (which I don't and never have) and if I wasn't in a raiding guild (which I am) I would buy the Tae Ew, then switch out with the fungi as needed.<br />
<br />
No way would I sell it.  Also, it's godly to put on your twink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Even if there comes a day when you no longer wish to wear your fungi, it's great on a twink.  My monkie self PLed to 50 in like 4.5 days /played with my old fungi.  <br />
<br />
Do what u want tho.  If you're dead set to starting the planar grind, go now and get your Malo/Torpor spells at any cost.  You will need em for Tier2 and 3.  And you won't be much of an asset to any group foolish enough to take you without them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Before I scribed Torpor, I wore a Fungi pretty much exclusively over a Vindi BP. AC and an extra 145 HP is nice, but it just didn't compare IMO to the regen of the Fungi. <br />
<br />
I loaned out my Fungi to a friend the minute I scribed torpor (since he was there loaning me the extra 15k I needed to buy torpor) and when I got it back the thought of wearing it again never crossed my mind. It's been sitting on a twink since then. If you can get torpor for it, I'd do it in a heartbeat, don't think I would've given up the Fungi for anything else though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wouldn't even bother paying for Torpor, just get to 65 and get Qui, it will cost you a lot less, and with Stoicism its not as hard of a grind without Torpor.  With the new tiers opening up you'll have the xp spots to get to 65 in.<br />
<br />
I still have my Fungi, it has come in handy on quite a few fights where you have a lower level DoT on you the entire time (XTC, Vulak, etc).</div></div><hr />
