Nerfed, no.<br />
Not caugth up to everyoen else? yes.<br />
We are better off in OOW then we where in GoD.<br />
I can MH in WoS and level 70 expeditions.<br />
I have *NO* GoD spells.<br />
I have HA2 and HG1, I have Healnig Boon 1 and the ornate arm pieces.<br />
<br />
My gear is a mix of ornate and Earth drops, rounded out wiht a little bit of baz trash.<br />
FT9<br />
I have No healing spells from OOW, nor the awesome looking OOW canni spell.<br />
<br />
I LOVE being a shaman. Yes, we get enrfed, ignored, and we SUCK lots of the time.<br />
<br />
I can solo tipt mobs and vxed mobs for INSANE exp.<br />
I can solo in low end Dranik's expeditions, after nerf, for moderate exp, trash loot, and an occasional rune.<br />
I can solo in hgih end Dranik's expediitons for decent exp.<br />
<br />
With a chanter or a pally frined, I can duo most anything in the game within reasonable constraints.<br />
<br />
There is no reason at all to rnu crying to mama, I'm nerfed I suck I wanna go play an alt.<br />

Unless you simply don't care to tighten your belt under the problems and make your class work</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did switch to a Berserker, however when i moved my shaman to another server the fun came back :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, Ive switched.  My guild still has 5 active shaman, but we were lacking range support and DPS.  So I dusted of a wizard thats been a really fun alt of mine for years and have worked him up.<br />
<br />
Its like playing a new game.  I still love my shaman and love the class, but its refreshing not to be chained to a buff rotation.  Instead of heals, I have evacs :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I semi retired  a few months ago, but recently started playing again.  I play my Shaman once or twice a week, but the rest of the time I play a rogue I started recently.  She has brought the fun back for me.  It's difficult to log in and still sit for a long time with LFG on.  I mainly just go for AA's and flags now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">my shaman is still my main, but I have now a 47 alt SK I'm playing from time to time. I'm enjoying it, but don't plan to switch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Curio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My shaman is an alt, I play a Ranger as a main. Despite the fact many people say both classes are broken I still enjoy playing both.  Also have a 63 Wizzard as a 3rd option when I want to just sit, nuke and slack :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
how many AA do you have?<br />
<br />
<br />
Toe to toe.<br />
Puppy and I are hasted/has weapons melee bufs etc<br />
spells loaded:<br />
Immobilize<br />
bane<br />
Pox of Bert<br />
Breath of Ultor<br />
Q<br />
Malos<br />
Canni4<br />
/Slow(switches to md MID FIGHT*)<br />
Cripple<br />
<br />
<br />
Mob is pulled with Malos, then slowed.<br />
Chaining root at about 15%<br />
<br />
Generaly, I have Virtue as an &quot;outide&quot; class buff, and all the other buffs are my own.<br />
<br />
Defnesively speaking,<br />
I have ND2(plus about 100HPs, actualy less)<br />
Innate Regen 3<br />
Channeling Focus 1<br />
SCR2(god you beautiful extra tick of Q, how you heal me so)<br />
QB1<br />
LR5(so easy to max thi9s,, why do we all wait?)<br />
VP2(Godsend,, slam da button, save yo life)<br />
Critical Affliction 1(Need the others,, does not crit very often)<br />
Mnemonic Retention 1<br />
Healing boon 1(critting on a hot is da schiznitz&quot;)<br />
<br />
Those are the AAs I have.<br />
I would gladly skip ND and healing boon and VP for this.<br />
By the end of the fight, I am generaly at 20%m and 20-40%hp, depending on how many quads he pulled off.<br />
The Channeling focus I would say is a REQUIREMENT.<br />
That ocasioanal cast through stun i a LIFE saver<br />

*cough*<br />
I never said backup.<br />
Let him beat on yah while you are casting. Run VotB to max your stats and give you +ac<br />
Don't start off rooted,, never start rooted.<br />
do not root... don't root...<br />
Don't root until he gets close to his flee health mark<br />
Q early, Q often.<br />
When in doubt, Q again.<br />
Never back away from your enemy, stand rihgt in his face and cast.<br />
<br />
It's not easy, there's a lot of luck involved.<br />
You may wish to practice on the non-named till you are completely comfie.<br />
But don't try backing away or rooting. I never mentioned backing away.<br />
And the only time I mentioned rooting was when he hit 15%<br />
<br />
(EDIT)<br />
You sound more like you are trying to root rot the named.<br />
I specificaly said toe to toe, not stating directly, but implcitly infering you melee wiht the mob.</div></div><hr />

i know the difference between root rot/toe to toe :P</div></div><hr />

My apologies, I should get some sleep instead opf responding in a half dazed state<br />

Good luck in your attempt, it's a tough row to hoe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>LachdanonColdpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Been my main and only since 2000, no plans on changing anytime soon...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Yes i have swiched to my necro alt having the time of my life since. You can call shaman soloing challanging but necro soloing on the other hand in FUN. Thinking about moving my shammy to another to 2box with my necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Have played 3 or 4 alts seriously (think ive tried just about every class barring drood) but ive always gone back to the Shaman.<br />
<br />
Wulfbane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rugtuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I play my Shammy as my main and will probably always do that, but I do also play a 65 Warrior on a sperate box if I can or on his own if that is what we need.  I also have a Necro, Monk, Berzerker, Chanter, Beastlord and Rouge.  With a Shammy main I can pretty much make a Alt partner for him in a week or two.<br />
<br />
Also I agree that toe to toe works I tend to put out enough DPS to get summoned Duo so I usually just stand with the Warrior and take my licks with him.  I have alot of ornate gear which helps out alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Switched to SK...  really liked the class, but I'm now back home where I belong, and having fun again with Aikoiko.  Only problem is I finally got into EQ2 beta, so I'm not playing as much =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Switched to RL ... cannot find the message boards for that class, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If you switched *** you doing here.. personally I have a 2nd boxed wizard and usually it's fun when I 4-6 box. Nothing compares to the shaman so far but rogue sure as hell is fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>gukana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Actually, I'm a 65 cleric who got sick and tired of being unable to duo with 65sk hubby cause we needed a slower.  :D  So Imma shammie now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Buzcam_Aro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Nice so far 37 fewer cry babies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Nice so far 37 fewer cry babies.<br />
<br />
This board was 95% cry babies just a few weeks ago, look at pre oow posts,  don't be a smart ass now.<br />
<br />
I never whined here i just swiched at some point when i found myself playing only my necro having absolutelly no fun with my shaman anymore for a couple of months in a row. I dont play this game to blindly stay with one class. When i have 200% more fun playing a necro alt you can bet i wont stay playing a shaman especially since my alt was at same stage of progression and EP flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Actually, even with the slow flip-flopping, i've been playing Gandwer hard. I haven't played this week due to a rather big dissappontment on sunday sort of sucking away my drive, but i'm gonna get back in there, get my levels and spells, and then go die in a few zones - The Shaman version of &quot;I was here&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I don't have the time to get another character up to 65+ took me 3 years to get my present one up! I'm not going though that agian!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>chees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">switched over to a alt wiz that only took a few weeks to get to 65 ( went fast because it felt like every zone had a 20+ mod after playing a iksar ) <br />
the class got boring fast though since they cant do a much as a shaman ... basicly their job is just to nuke / cc / pull / and evac if things go wrong ... gets boring in the long run <br />
<br />
so now i am back to chainkilling vox and naggy with my monk for abit of fun everyweek :/ <br />
<br />
eventhough people dont play a shaman any more does not mean that they are not allowed to care about the class and take a interrest in what is going on ... you never know they might fix us in a few years time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Jinudan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">My main is a 63 Necro, started this shaman in order to group with friends who wanted to start new toons.  Necro is awfully dusty now, hehe.  Don't get me wrong, I love the necro class but I've been having alot of fun with the shaman.  At what point do I stop calling the Necro my main? LOL</div></div><hr />
