luckily i think EQ peaked a while back and this will not have a ton of buyers.<br />
<br />
but if you ever thought ebayer / playerauction characters were clueless, what will this be like?</div></div><hr />

My rate is $165/hour, but I enjoy the leveling process and, besides, I can always PL myself if I am so inclined. And would you really want to have a level 65 character with 23 Defense, no spells or armor (and 25K to buy them with) and, most importantly, no idea how to play the class?<br />

Max worn regeneration + Chloro + 1K HP in buffs + DS = level 18 in under an hour in Kurns and Paludal. Between 18 and 43, FD PLing on the undead with a Necro is probably best. Then group with a 65 Bard or even 65 Necro and you are all set. That infamous Frog Cleric got to 65 and his Epic in 2 days /played, it should be even easier with a well oiled operation.</div></div><hr />

I'd do Kedge myself, better ZEM and same &quot;stuff doesn't run&quot; benefit.  But I digress.<br />
<br />
2 days played = 48 hours = he must be playing his levellers like 5 bucks an hour if he's making any kind of profit whatsoever.  And I can't imagine he's not making a godawful profit, this is Yantis.<br />

Do AE in paludal caverns for the low levels up to level 25 or so.<br />
I have a wizard that's level 20 right now with a bit of pleveling.<br />
With a cleric and shaman buff, and a druid babysitter doing dshields and heals, you can level on a single AE pull.<br />
My wizard just chains the fastest casting PB AE to do a bit of damage to the mobs, and the dshield takes over the rest.<br />
It will basicly take about 5 minutes including pull time per level up to about level 25 from level 10 or so.<br />
That's about 1.5 hours of work to hit level 25.<br />
Move on to a higher level zone like Sol A or Guk at that point and continue doing the AE dshields.<br />
Once you hit level 46, it's off the the planes.<br />
Once you get high enough to party with a level 65 bard, ae swarming is probably the best way to go.<br />
The other possibility is doing AE groups.<br />
That's gotta be the fastest way to level up to 65.<br />
<br />
As for how he can charge that little for the time needed to level a character, I can see it's possible that he hires 3rd world employees to level his characters.<br />
Considering how low the wages are there, he's probably getting away with paying employees a few bucks a day to play video games.<br />
That's my guess.</div></div><hr />

yeah really, this is like one level 65 spell, and there are tons of other pre 65 spells aswell which are costy like hell.<br />
<br />
Not to mention no skills, no equipment and hell, maybe a classical ebayer is playing this and knows jack about the class. Scary stuff.<br />
<br />
Aswell im really doubtful they can level a char to 65 in 24 hours on ANY server. Like if they had a PL char on every server..<br />
<br />
I definatly smell GM involvement here..</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of my friend borrowed a 65 druid and PLed his own alt to level 56 in 24 hours. A focused team of PLers might do better.<br />
<br />
However: Defense will = 0, RL skills in eq = 0. Does make for a bad char.</div></div><hr />

Damage shield tanking shoots your defense rating through the roof FAST.<br />
<br />
Also, just because he says he can get you a character in 24 hours doesn't mean he'll get it created in that time period.<br />
Suppose he has 5 level 65 characters of each class in stock.<br />
If 4 people on one day all order a 65 cleric, he's still got one in stock.<br />
He has an order for 4 more to be powered up by whoever is doing it.<br />
As long as he doesn't get 2 more orders for 65 clerics before the crew of people levelling up characters can get another 65 created, you won't know the difference in how fast he gets his characters created.<br />

They can't do much about it once the plat is in game either, because it is easily &quot;laundered&quot; by purchasing items in the bazaar and then reselling them.  They can't ban you for having someone buy your vendor crap with duped plat.  <br />
<br />
And, yeah there has to be a dupe out.  The guy is selling like 100 million plat on every server, cheap.  That is an awful lot of hill giants :P.<br />

I would love to know how he is PLing toons that fast though, if its legal.  FYI GM's can buff themselves and I assume others to 29k hitpoints or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if your killing mobs 5 or 10 lvls above you once you get to lvl 50 you have to kill an average of 150 a lvl best case. 15 lvls to get to 65. 15 x 150 = 2,250 mobs. Say you kill one a mintue that's still 37 1/2 hours.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think its probably some quest that yeilds decent exp that can be macro'd in the same zone.. over and over and over. <br />
<br />
After 24 hours of macro'ing you have a level 65 char with 300 aa's. <br />
<br />
Remember when they put in PomV3 in by mistake.. the vendor sold bone chips..  I went there bought many bags full and started doing cabalis faction hand ins.  (Free faction... no work)  The quest gave me coins in return for the bone chips as well as the faction.. I even think I was making a profit, getting free exp from quest, and building faction up. <br />
<br />
Before I logged for the night.. I filled up my bazaar mule with bonehips and sold them at 20pp a stack over night and made a huge profit. <br />
<br />
Then PomV3 was reset to PomV2 again. :( <br />
<br />
It's probably something similiar to this, but the exp reward or coin reward has to be much greater.. I got like 2% AA after a hour of turn ins.. (I'm sure if it was macro'd it would of been faster, but no where near the rate I can get soloing blues or grouping and the coins I get from killing those mobs).   Has to be something like this intensified 1000x.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it may not be maxed at certain levels, but it certainly won't be 0. I have done about 80 levels worth of DS PLing on a couple of toons and it works fine as long as you pay attention. Not all weapon skills will be maxed, but that can be easily fixed later on with Ensnare. Arcane skills will be far behind, but they can be raised by chain-casting in PoK, 5 casts per macro. Somewhat time consuming, but not challenging.<br />
<br />
However, there is much, much more to playing a class than having all of your skills maxed. I don't mind PLing friends' newbie characters when they already have 2 legit level 65 toons w/200+ AAs and a few 50ish characters on the side, but giving a high level character to a total newbie is an obviously bad idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">$500 for that seems actually quite reasonable, and I hate myself for saying that.  A couple day's worth of salary and bam, here's your level 65 x, y, or z.  What's YOUR time worth?<br />

<br />
Seeing is it's a game and you're supposed to be having fun, and seeing as the game as enjoyable at all stages and if it isn't then why play it, there's no reason to buy a premade toon and miss out on most of the game.<br />
<br />
What is there to do at 65th except pound out AAs, raid, and farm crap you don't need?  A large part of the fun is getting there.<br />
<br />
If your game becomes like a job to you I highly recommend you re-evaluate and consider finding something else to do!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">A quote of a quote i just read on he rangers glade. I did not write this:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me start by explaining who I am.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm an individual most of you dislike, and I understand that. I sell items and platinum in game for real life money. I have been doing this for 4 years now, and this is how I make my living. I will not be providing my email in this post, nor is this an attempt to sell items to you.<br />
<br />
This post is meant to inform you of a very serious problem you all need to be aware of.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have you noticed prices of high end items in the bazaar have doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled or more in the last 2 months?<br />
<br />
Have you noticed a serious LACK of high end items in the bazaar in the last month or so, and shrinking each day?<br />
<br />
<br />
THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DUPLICATING PLATINUM IN YOUR GAME ILLEGALLY, USING HACKS BUGS AND OR CHEATS.<br />
<br />
THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE USING HACKS AND CHEATS TO CREATE A LEVEL 65 CHARACTER WITH HUNDREDS OF AA POINTS FROM LEVEL 1 IN 24 HOURS OR LESS!<br />
<br />
<br />
Allow me to explain the platinum issue. A couple of months ago someone, or some group of people figured out how to duplicate platinum coins in Everquest. Since I am a seller of platinum and items I can see an influx of platinum into the economy of a server very quickly, as the first thing it impacts is the selling price of platinum on the auction sites.<br />
<br />
Overnight, one seller dropped the price of platinum to one half what it had been the night before. It has since dropped to one half again, and continues to fall.<br />
<br />
Of course, originally this only affected sellers such as myself. We tend to suck these things up and deal with them. They happen from time to time, and SOE is usually very quick to react to them and fix them. A normal player would not see much impact from this except possibly a couple days of increased buying and selling in the bazaar. 3 or 4 million platinum will not impact a server economy.<br />
<br />
But, since SOE has decided to NOT chase this issue down, and has allowed it to permeate the servers for nearly 2 full months, it is having a moderate and soon to be severe (if not already severe) impact on every server economy.<br />
<br />
<br />
How? Well, for one, people are starting to realize that they can sell items for 3 and 4 times their usual value. I sold a fungi tunic for 175k the other day. I was able to get 800k for a blade of carnage. 750k for a helmet of rallos zek. These items are NOT worth this much, but with plat floating around like crazy, and it being so very very cheap to come by, there is a huge influx of buyers with hundreds of thousands, or even millions of platinum to buy items with. For reference I would be lucky to get 65k for a fungi, 200k for a blade of carnage, and 150k for a helmet of rallos zek just 2 months ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what's wrong with that? Prices inflate over time. I bet it is just because of Lost Dungeons of Norrath.&quot;<br />
<br />
I know some of you are thinking the above. Please remember, this would not &quot;increase&quot; the value of items. This would decrease the value of items.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what's wrong with that? If prices go up on everything everyone will make more money to match it.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's the problem, everyone will not make more money. Lower end items will stay cheap. This puts the fun toys, the fungi tunic, the blade of carnage, the haste cloaks, etc. out of reach of almost every single player.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that sucks, but it will just take me longer to save up, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong. What happens when something comes into an economy in mass numbers? It becomes worthless. So, if you have platinum that is nearly worthless, what do these dupers, hackers, cheaters, whatever you would like to call them, do? Since platinum becomes de-valued, but they have an unlimited supply of it, and they want to continue making money, they do this: They whip up a batch of fresh platinum and hit the bazaar and buy any and all high end high value items available.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure they do, I don't believe you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, my traders, and the traders of other sellers I speak with, tend to offer a wide range of higher level gear in the bazaar for individuals to buy. We talk to each other, of course, and have noticed lately that our traders almost instantly sell every single high end twink item or fun piece of gear. The other night a good friend of mine sold over 4 million platinum worth of high end gear to a single person. There was no rhyme or reason to the purchase, as the items spanned several classes (it was not like some guy was making a warrior twink and bought all warrior stuff). He made an ooc saying wow, thanks ------- for buying all my stuff! And over the next few minutes began receiving tells from other traders &quot;yeah he bought all my stuff too!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
So you need to ask yourself, do you see these changes in bazaar prices lately? Have you noticed a serious lack of high end items for sale in the bazaar? When you do find a high end item, is it priced for some strange reason extremely high?<br />
<br />
Want a level 65 character and 300 AA in a single day? Well, one seller promises that, and has accomplished it. Now, simple math tells you if that was only the AA, that would be 1 AA every 3.8 minutes. Impossible, by even the best powerleveling team. A person would be extremely hard pressed to reliably get level 65 in 24 hours, let alone 65 and 300 AA points.<br />
<br />
The character comes with no skills at all. IT IS LEVELED USING DUPLICATION BUGS AND EXPLOITS THROUGH HIGH EXP QUESTS.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so people should know better, and they will get a useless character anyways so how does this affect me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Do you group in game? Well, these people are going to HAVE to group extensively to get their skills up. You can be sure they are not going to /ooc 65 WIZ LFG! I just bought this useless character and only have 100 in my casting skills so I need a group to help me practice them! (and I'll over nuke a little to get my dodge up too!). These guys will need YOU to finish the power leveling process.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is impacting YOUR game, guys. Believe me when I tell you I and others have reported and feedbacked these things until we are blue in the face. Perhaps it is not enough, which is why you are seeing this post. I urge you to look for yourself and see the messed up server economies. I urge you to send e-mail to your GMs, feedback in game, and put a bit of pressure on SOE to get this resolved quickly. If you think I am posting this for my own benefit, don't. Since my items sell for 3 or 4 x their usual cost in the bazaar I am still making the same living I was months ago. I also love playing this game. I am concerned for the well being of Everquest, and would rather not see it ruined like so many other games have been.<br />
<br />
Sony has been informed and yet they have done nothing. Their complacency has contributed to this problem.<br />
<br />
None of us want EQ to turn into one of the many games out there that have been destroyed by cheats and hacks. SOE used to be very very quick to react to these things. If you feel as I do, you will send in a petition or a feedback or an email and urge SOE to fix this NOW. You may refer them to this post if you like.<br />
<br />
I also caution you. If you were considering buying platinum or taking advantage of this &quot;powerleveling service&quot; for a level 65 character with 300 AA in 24 hours, I suggest you reconsider, as there is a very high chance that useless powereleveled character will be banned within a month (and their disclaimer only guarantees the character for 2 weeks), and there is a very high chance you could be banned for buying ill gotten platinum.<br />
<br />
Spread the word! Let people know this is going on. Let them know they can get it stopped with very little effort on their part. Feel free to cut and paste this post anywhere you like and get the word out!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tristarss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">In the &quot;SKY IS FALLING&quot; thread that Kamm pasted. The author states lvl 65 300aa in 24 hours.<br />
<br />
I would link the site, but its since been changed and the service isn't offered anymore. But it never stated 65 lvl and 300aa in 24 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yeah the plat duping is the worst.  They can't do much about it once the plat is in game either, because it is easily &quot;laundered&quot; by purchasing items in the bazaar and then reselling them.<br />
- It's actually much easier than that. Stackable items (plat, gems ...) have no item IDs. meaning once duped, SOE can't just look in their logs and see if someone duped. If you dupe your elemental bracer (Item ID 666) then as soon as it's duped, it will trigger a logging mechanism server side because duped bracer will be item ID 666 also. However if you dupe plat/gems/whatever stackables, SOE can't figure it out unless they analyze your entire interaction/trade/loot history. Of course this is extremely costly for them, not to mention spying on 400K+ accounts is really costly in terms of manpower. Unless you are a dumb duper who dupes regulary 100 million plat, then catching you will be hard if not impossible. Add to that throwaway accounts, and even if SOE catches the duper, the smart one still has his main characters not to mention can get another account from people who sell them for a few K plat and dupe again.</div></div><hr />

We are sorry to have to do this, but as we have just learned that the company we had hired to do our Powerleveling may be using exploits or cheats, because of this we are no longer using them and refunding our customers that wanted Powerleveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Personally I smell GM involvment. Wasnt but a few years ago that a SOE emploee got fired for selling items on ebay. I know that GM's have some crazy buffs that are used with testing. For that matter a GM could probbly just /char buff it.<br />
<br />
pfffff.. GMs are a myth.. they dont even exist, how can one be involved?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">For christsake does Yantis think that people are so gullible and dont know that he KNEW his people were using exploits etc ?<br />
If not why the hell would he put in the warning in the original ad that account maybe banned etc.<br />
Perhaps one of his PLers has been caught exploiting and now Yantis is trying to get as far away as poss from it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Its definitely possible.<br />
<br />
I have a lvl 65 enc with 5 AA and 6 days played time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dinged lvl 65 with about 5 days and max spell skills and all spells and good gear. That played time includes some AFk time.. and I raid a few hours a day, and have RL stuff to do for 12 other hours so its definitely possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
A bard AE kiting in POV was 1 yellow a kite which took about 20 or 30 mins. I got my POV flag at 46 so that was about 2 yellow/kite from 46-52 and 1 yellow from 52-65.<br />
<br />
If someone was doing this all day for 24 hours, its definitely possible.</div></div><hr />
