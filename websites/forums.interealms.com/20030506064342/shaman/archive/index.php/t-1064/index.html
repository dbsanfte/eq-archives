<br />
Runnin' from Halas to NK to take the Port-O-Matic, I nearly trip over this newbie getting absolutely OWNED by a will-o-wisp.  I do what every self-respecting spirit talker would:  Heal, Chloro, SoW, and scoot on my merry way, figuring that if those don't allow him to survive the encounter, he has no business fighting it.<br />
<br />
About a min or so later... FOOMP.  There goes my truespirit faction.  Amazing how much faction one can obliterate without really trying.<br />
<br />
Now stuck MQing the books and/or the fools to repair it.  The Spirit Sentinel near City o' Mist won't give me the container for the reports.<br />
<br />
I never really checked faction at each level, I just figured that if I did the quest right, it'd work. :rolleyes:  Besides, actually doing the post-Black Dire parts quest was both fun and pretty good exp.  <br />
<br />
So, back to Ally be good enough, or spend mind-numbing hours running cross the Karanas and/or farming the books?<br />
<br />
I think I already know the answer.  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Timog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just bind in the sewer in North Freeport. Take the boat to Ocean of Tears, kill Capt. Surestout, tell the spirit you wish to know more, make sure you have gem. Gate, hand gem in, rinse and repeat until it says your faction with Truespirit could not possibly get any better. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, I thought about doin' it that way.<br />
<br />
I bound by Glaron in RM, and harvested the fools.  Woe, Envy, kill a few HGs... Marr's Promise, run to WK...<br />
<br />
Gate back, kill a few HGs... no spawn... kill a few HGs... get bored, blow the plat made off the HGs turning their toes into Dulsehound potions... repeat ad nauseam.<br />
<br />
Just now back to 'ally.'  This step o' the process seems to give a sizeable faction increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's another thread somewhere in here that has the faction levels at most of the steps in the quest listed.<br />
<br />
I've done the quest in correct order without repeating any steps up to turning in Neh's Diary.  Before turning in Neh's Diary to the Sentinel Spirit I was at Warmly.  After the turn-in I was at Ally.  After that, I turned in an extra set of Ghiosk's books and got the &quot;Your faction with True Spirit could not possibly get any better&quot; message.<br />
<br />
If possible, get extra copies of Ghiosk's Books when you can - they seem to be a sizable faction hit.  Guilds raiding the black reavers for druid/ranger epic pieces will likely have Ghiosk rot every time they do a round of reavers, so shouldn't be tough to get an extra set if you catch one of these raids going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shandy, I had a near faction hit like that except mine was due to the evil 'a' key (autoattack grr).  The VERY first spirit you encounter in the epic I accidentally attacked, luckily didnt kill it.  I had to root and camp out (took a few tries as they are casters).<br />
<br />
Almost shat myself as I was looking at the guide to see what I had to type next, then I look up at the screen and hes down to like 25% health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All done with the mind-numbing tedium.  Didn't get back to CoM again, so just did the fool-harvest.  Maxed, so if (when!) I ever get that darn Tear, I'll be set.</div></div><hr />
