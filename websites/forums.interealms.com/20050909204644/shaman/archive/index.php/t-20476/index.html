<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I scan disc and defrag almost every other day.  But I'm wondering if somebody put a keystroke logger on my puter. (My home page got changed a couple of times among other things).<br />
<br />
So here soliciting ideas / and or web sites to check out.<br />
<br />
Thanks much.</div></div><hr />

They came be removed by running Ad Aware (download at www.lavasoftusa.com). Be careful though, Ad Aware does pick up things like tool bar add ons like THE GOOGLE TOOLBAR!! (Yes, I love my google toolbar!) and of course, website cookies. Thankfully though, it does update and identify current spyware, so you just have to pay attention to what it removes.<br />
<br />
as far as online virus scan. Try http://housecall.antivirus.com Norton and McAfee both have one also, but you have to look for them on the parent sites.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

If no one that you don't trust has physical access to your PC another thing you can do is to add a firewall. What some people dont realise a firewall will also alert you to software that is trying to contact the internet from your PC. So if you have got a keylogger installed that your virus checker has missed, then the firewall will alert you. <br />

I use ZonealarmPro for my home and work PC. You can get a free cut down version from Zone Labs (http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/company/products/znalm/freeDownload.jsp?lid=zadb_zadown)</div></div><hr />

Google toobar installs spyware if you select &quot;advanced&quot; installation. If you decline this there is no spyware. The difference is the installer is 100% upfront and explicitly states it is installing spyware unlike everything else.</div></div><hr />
