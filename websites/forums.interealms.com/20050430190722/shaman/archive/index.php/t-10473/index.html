<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just been on a Kael arena raid.<br />
<br />
I was having a resist rate of upwards of 75% with slow on troopers and legionnares. These are all blue to me at 58. Last weekend I was having a miniscule resist rate at 57 and hardly ever having to use malosini. Tonight even after being Malosini'd the resist rate was still up at  75% or so .Also cripple won't land at all, I'll admit we had no chanter, but I doubt very much that was the sole reason for this.<br />
<br />
Another thing I noticed is the Troopers are now dispelling my bear form somehow as I was having to recast it after every Trooper fight I got aggro?<br />
<br />
This is something that I have neither run into or heard about before. I'm just curious if anyone else has noticed any strange changes there post patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think some of them is a distance thing.<br />
<br />
i think some are like dragons , you have to be in melee range. if i remember right i ran into it back in those days too and it threw me for a loop . give it a shot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can't be distance. If I got any closer to them I'd have been inside them. I always,always stand directly under a giants legs when I cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I should be going on a kael raid sometime over the next couple of days...I'll give you a report when I get back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At level 63 I was having resists on them too, for some reason.<br />
I tend to just malo them first. My partner is a 64 monk w/ 1500 ac, so slowing can wait just a bit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They've always been resistant bastards.  always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kingwhip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is all about levels. Without tash at 58 you were getting a correct resist rate imo. I remember having a very hard time back then myself. Now, at 62, the only thing I debuff before slow are the temple guardians and other higher level mobs in there.<br />
<br />
Wherez</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did plate cycle tonight and the only resists I got were on the final giant and the dorf, which are mr anyways.  Didn't go in the arena, so not sure of there, but I know some of the plate cycle giants are lvl 60, higher than most arena giants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Holth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Got same problem as you.<br />
Giants seems to be more resistants now than a couple of months ago.<br />
Except Zeks. Slows lands 100%.<br />
Strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did plate cycle as well a few weeks ago.  No problems.<br />
<br />
Did arena as well.  No problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kagan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The giants in the arena have always been pretty resistant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Arena giants are very streaky and I always clench my teeth when I'm main slower there. Somtimes it's cake and other days you spend 2-3 bubs on malosini+slow.<br />
<br />
But alas there's always some numbskull there to make it entertaining by telling you to buff your CHA to help land slows. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kael giants are annoyingly MR, just the way they are.<br />
<br />
I think I had a green con giant resist me 4 or 5 times once at lvl 65 after Malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I havent been to Arena or Bank area in awhile, but yesterday I was passing through and I noticed the high Resist.<br />
<br />
That first Giant, Recruiter something, thats right at the zone in/out of Eastern Wastes. I casted slow on him 5 times and all were resisted. He cons green and has been green since at least lvl 47. <br />
I tried casting Malo, resisted. I casted JBB resisted. I thought it was a bug, so I just invised and went on, not even sure why I casted on him in the first place...hehe.<br />
I haven't tried on any other mobs, but the assumption that some of the giants are bugged seems to be correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That recruiter is a quest mob, hence the high resists on everything.  Don't use that giant as a basis for the rest of Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ahh that's what I thought for a second later after I went on. Makes sense now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">At 65 I still get resisted on watchmen more than enough.Giants are resistant,they always been.<br />
<br />
I doubt SOE went thru all giants properties and add some MR here and there,they already have enough bugs to fix after each patches.<br />
<br />
I don't bother with malo other than troopers and up,someone telling he's landing 100% slow w/o debuffs on these is a liar or damn lucky.They are more like 50/50 before malo.(btw,they are light blue at 65)<br />
<br />
One single watchman resisted 3 times tugur's and 3 times bane,same freaking giant.<br />
<br />
I've hunted in Kael last 4 weeks,killed pretty much everything there is to kill,giants are resistant,like most Velious mobs.</div></div><hr />
