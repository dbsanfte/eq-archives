<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ouglaim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A spot I have been soloing is in Gunthak at the Nadox zoneline.  As you are heading to Dulak the second left takes you to Nadox.  You can setup at the far wall from the troll guards and if all goes bad you can zone into Nadox.  All the mobs can be single pulled and I can usually get 6 or 7 before I need to med up.<br />
<br />
I am pretty much a safe player could probably walk the tunnel coming to Nadox and back, but I like park the pet, pull and run back. I started there at lvl 39 and now have reached lvl 42.  Some of the mobs in the tunnel are turning lgt blue but most are still dark blue.  Exp seems to be a steady 1 to 2% a kill.<br />
<br />
Spot is a nice quiet area no trains from Gunthak or Dulak.  Hope this helps.<br />
