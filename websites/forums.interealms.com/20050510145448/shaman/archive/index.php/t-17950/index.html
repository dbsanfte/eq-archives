<br />
either way.. great job the two of you that I know were in the fight on Rallos.  And great job to the rest ofyou that participated in the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Is it true the guy who got the killing blow now has the custom title &quot;the Dragon Slayer&quot;?<br />
<br />
Grats to everyone, but he must be over the moon :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Here are a few shots I took at the end of the fight.  Granted, I didn't do the whole no text stuff as I was lagged up way bad to begind with, and I was a little pumped up to think about it. So I doubt that these ones will make it to the EQ main page from Sony. Notice the message from the GM in the last one. Now call me silly, but I can recount many times where system wide messages were used. Oh well.We know they are prolly just mad as heck that we beat their &quot;unkillable&quot; dragon. Thanks again everyone, and see ya in the channels soon again.</div></div><hr />

*edit* corpse was empty according to screenshot...guess thats why he was despawned the first time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">grats to RZ.  Good accomplishment but in the grand scheme of things it would of been done a lot sooner on other servers had they been able to put the sleeper back to sleep.</div></div><hr />

Was he slowable :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hey Shamu:)<br />
<br />
Lol didn't think about THE question so far, might be the lack fo sleep as well..no he wasn't slowable, no spell expect for LB MB and HT lands on him. Gogo shaman swarm pets and gober_19237!<br />
<br />
Btw our shaman crew for the sleeper on RZ experienced something funny. If you summoned a pet while you were lagged it might have been that your pets name was Coltrane's pet or Shatanos pet. *** did they make us getting pet names for each other?))<br />
<br />
/cheer<br />
<br />
SS inc soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, how many pet names are available?  With that many shaman, necros, mages, etc all summoning pets, I'm guessing every possible name was probably exhausted.  Looks like &quot;character's pet&quot; is used when no other names are available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">You know, I always have loved RZ the best. Now all I have to do is get 65...200 AAs and a full set of clickies and elemental armor and I too can join the ranks of the likes of AD! Hehehe..<br />
Can you say OOOBOR!<br />
Grats AD, Wudan and MiM!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Gratz guys, nice to see it actually done this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">In the end, it doesn't matter whether or not your 'supposed' to kill him.  Its a monumental achievement either way.  Congratulations on a well earned victory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sheymalra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I might have missed this if anyone said it because I was skimming the posts, but how long from start to finish did the fight take?<br />
<br />
And congrats~!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'm guessing it was just SK's and Wizards manaburning and HTing him to death, then dying themselves, then doing it again.

<br />
Come on Tribunal! We can do it  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">@Sheymalra:<br />
The fight on monday took us about 3 hours, +/-10mins with the Lag:)<br />
Was an intense and long fight, took me like 12 death.<br />
<br />
@Landragoran:<br />
We had like 20 Sks and Wizards, Yes MB and HT helped some, but im it wasn't more than 2-3% of Keras Hps. And Wizzies and Sks reported to be able to use their ability 2-3 times during fight.<br />
The most dps we got from was easy as it sounds from pets. When everyone and their momma busts out a pet, the names for them were all used and funny names appeared (Thanks to Feradach for the idea:).<br />
<br />
I'll post some SS when I finally get time, then ya know what I mean,hehe.<br />
DPS: Pets&gt;Melee&gt;MB/LB/HT&gt;Shaman Melee<br />

We made the choice NOT to wake him two years ago. We enjoyed farming SoD's and fungi robes and primal weapons. As of late when we took a poll on if we should wake him, we chose to do so.</div></div><hr />

That's what I said :) AoD was the moron guild on my server that woke the Sleeper about fifth serverwide. Idiots. One of the monks from that era still wears his warder robe. I hadn't even realized that the Sleeper was still sleeping on RZ. It takes a lot of willpower not to follow through and wake him up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Spite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Kudos to RZ for being more cooperative of a server than any other, in leaving the Sleeper up for as long as you did!  <br />
<br />
I had to laugh when after RZ took out the Sleeper, someone on my server (druzzil) was whining that all servers should have a chance to take out the Sleeper.  The funniest part was that this person is in the guild who took out the Sleeper  (to get bragging rights and hinder the progress of the other server's guilds)...</div></div><hr />

Never thought I would see someone say that. Thats cool =) Just goes to show, we ain't a bunch of savages all ther time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Waking the Sleeper just because you can is one thing. Any guild that does that just to say &quot;We did it&quot; deserves the ****storm coming their way.<br />
<br />
Waking the Sleeper with a purpose and a plan....then killing the supposedly unkillable Dragon...now that is damn Uber.<br />
<br />
Especially since you did it not once, but twice, for all purposes.<br />
<br />
Almost makes me want to start a character on RZ and get ganked left and right just so I can see your guild tag floating over people's heads.<br />
