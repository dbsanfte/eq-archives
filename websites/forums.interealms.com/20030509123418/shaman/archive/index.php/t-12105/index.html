<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RedHat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello Shamans!<br />
Im looking to get back into Eq and thinking of playing a shaman. I have a question about their solo ability, however. At what lvl, if any, can soloing be better xp (time/xp ratio) than grouping. Also, how do we rate as solo'ers compared to the other classes? Sorry if this question has already been asked =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1-60 solo exp &gt; group exp<br />
61-65 group exp in planes &gt; solo<br />
<br />
Atleast thats my opinion, during 55-60 I think its best to group in dungeons just to hone skills but if you wanna pl your way to 60 just solo.  As how do we compare?  With efficency(sp?) I would say necro/mage are better solo'ers and at 61-65 mage/necro/chanter are definately better solo'ers for exp grinding.<br />
<br />
Anyways just my opinions, I'm sure others will differ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So far....<br />
<br />
1 - 61  Solo Exp &gt; Group<br />
<br />
<br />
Some clases can sol better then shaman at some stages in life but we are fairly close to the top. I would also say that the shaman class is more gear dependant then some of the others I have played and gear can have significant impact on soloing performance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can say with xp though on solo from 1-50 it's fairly easily done.<br />
However my question if folks are saying solo &gt; group xp 50-60 where would be prime spot(s) for that level range?  As yet I haven't done much looking mostly grouped for last level but I'd be interested myself in finding some prime solo spots.</div></div><hr />

I think the stock answer to this is High Keep - Nobles (upstairs) then Katta guards (Nathyn's guards if faction is a concern).<br />
<br />
Look on 50-60 Hunting grounds for details on both of these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lol the stock answer leaves much to be desired, not even sure what you mean by High Keep (uh isn't that like in one's 20's lol unless i'm think'n of a diff HK now, no I'm not a smart arse I just play one in life =p) &amp; as for Katta pending faction issues I'll have to look into that, thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">HHK guads, supposedly best exp till 55ish</div></div><hr />

Um only if you are twinked and/or have the funds for KEI. Try doing that in leather and banded without KEI like I did and it's damn painful.<br />
<br />
It was around 14th lvl that I realized I couldn't solo without a lot of downtime. Around 49 I could finally solo quite well but before that it's just so damn frustrating with ****ty gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did it.<br />
<br />
i grouped till 34ish when i got pet then i didnt see regular grouping for XP till pop which was the later part of 59. after that grouping in PoV/BoT owns soloing.<br />
<br />
You can ask anyone here , my gear was WEAK. Yet i soloed as well as everyone hear pretty much or any shaman i knew. Its not gear that makes the shaman. So 1-57 id say Solo &gt; all  by that time your ready for PoP zones and serious XP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually it's not entirely true about 1-60. At some points it is faster to group then solo. Possibly paludal for 14-20 as the exp bonus there is nuts. <br />
<br />
However for most of 1 through 54-56 is without a doubt best done solo. once you hit 55-56 though it's time to hit pop cy groups or hedge groups and you will gain exp 10 times faster. I did 50-60 in 3 week with very littlep laytime going as much as not playing for an entire weekend but yes I did play a lot other days.<br />
<br />
Pop exp once you hit 54-55 is almost always better then soloing.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind I played back when you had to outdamage your pet to get full XP, back when there was no such thing as paludal caverns and when hell levels still existed. Soloing was doable but just damn slooooowww compared to grouping. At 49 to 53 I soloed almost all in CoM and it was great but until you hit 49 I found grouping much faster than soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I leveled all my 1-60 pre-nerf of hell levels untwinked as well.  I still concur that 1-55ish is best to solo.  Think someone was asking where to solo in low 50's? I remember I solo'ed at DL at 51ish and it greened at 52 I believe then I hit Ice Giants.  Never did the HK thing myself, maybe with a twink I'll give it a try.</div></div><hr />

don't forget the joys of KEI when SoL released as well, soloers rejoice</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was the death of the low end game i think , cause at that time , no one is forced to group anymore , everyone can just get a KEI and solo to 50+. Sometimes i wish KEI has a level restriction cause i really miss the old days of getting a 30-40 group and EXPLORING zone like Nurga , or dalnir or solb. Now its about getting buffed and KEI and hitting the more lucritive solo spot in those levels. I have a few alts that i really enjoy , but there is only so much i can take alone , i mean you cant exactly KEI a monk or a warrior. Its a shaman cause i could have some fun with them once in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you don't want to group in tier 1 from 55-60 (tier 1 = the new DL/KC) then I suggest velks - guards in katta start to go lb at 58 iirc,and I spent a good deal of time there- velks &gt; katta for exp, and no faction concerns.</div></div><hr />
