<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First, yeah I don't agree with all that.  You people wanna be all of everything or equal with everyone at doing everything, ffs let it go.  Our class owns as is, if you can't play up to the ability to realize this then thats your own fault.<br />
<br />
But anyways, on to what this post is really about.  Does anyone actually read this stuff and think it remotely sounds right for the most part heh.<br />
<br />
* Current new slow in GoD is substantially inferior to our level 51 slow due to recast time and short duration, it will not replace turgurs.<br />
<br />
Reason could be, this will be a slow that will only work on GoD mobs or some GoD mobs.<br />
<br />
* Lack of non-essential spell gems preclude wasting a slot for new slow and having 2 slows memorized<br />
<br />
Hardcore shamans won't have to &quot;waste&quot; another slot for a new slow, hail Time's Antithesis - and yes I realize all of you don't have access to it(our guild just this month started hitting time) but you have to take that item into consideration none the less.  And if my above statement happens to be true, you would'nt have to even mem Turgur's where the new slow would be aplicable.<br />
<br />
* Slow mitigation has decreased the substantive advantage we have over other classes that can slow<br />
<br />
So now our slows have the possibility of all landing at the same % slowing, and your complaining?  Thats ok, just gets it slowed faster if a bst/enc wants to toss out slow - ours will overwrite and whoever is on slow for that mob(raid wise) will just cover it after his/her's lands.  Mobs in PoP are short lived fights compared to the VT days, if they were fully slowable their dps would goto **** and completely trivialize the encounter... no extremely easy loot for you! /whine on<br />
<br />
* GoD Slow upgrade is insufficient, recast times and short duration, when paired with a nerf in effectiveness of the slow makes this spell undesirable<br />
<br />
Again, this could be with good reason with GoD mobs - like judging a book by its cover you just don't know.  If it turns out that it will be as awful as you guys make it sound to be, then so be it petition to have it changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Slowing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Reduced agro, mana cost, resist rate, and/or recast time on (an upgrade to) Turgur's Insects, which has been in its current state since Kunark was released six expansions ago<br />
<br />
Turgur's is still an awesome spell.  Resist is mob dependant I guess, mana cost is low, recast is'nt bad - if you need to cast slow so fast just ae slow then turgur's.  The six expansions ago arguement will never work, CH is original and that most likely won't be touched again - and as was it got nerfed(with good reason)<br />
<br />
* An AA ability that mitigates mitigation<br />
<br />
Be nice, but at raids you would have to go through who has what AA's and all that crap - again refer to mitigation thoughts above.<br />
<br />
* An AA ability for a random chance to bypass mitigation<br />
<br />
Too much of a pain - again mitigation thoughts.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have it good, but I guess over in wish land the grass is greener - wish away I'm happy we own as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can`t asume eveyone getting a item that is at the top level of the game.<br />
you cant assume they mean that the slow will only work on GoD mobs and there is nothing to suggest that this is the case.<br />
<br />
at 51 250 mana was alot.<br />
<br />
your are right with mitigation the % to slow are even more narrowed, but why does that mean we have to acepted a lower % slow? what is does mean is one of our major spells has been nerfed!<br />
<br />
<br />
i certainly dont want to have to load 2 slows and use a spell gem that could be used for something esle and reduce even more what spells we can load up.<br />
<br />
also at no time did anyone say we want to be master of all, nobody is asking to heal as good as a druid just beter than we currently do (i would say we should be 3rd best, but not that far away from 2nd). we not asking for more % to slow just faster. we not asking to be wizards just similar to other priest classes in nuking. (this other priest class have there own advanatages )<br />
we do want to be best at what is common perception we are best at, slowing debuffiing and buffing? why shouldnt we be best at these?<br />
<br />
you just seem to assume that we are asking to be best at all which means you haven`t read the thread properly, because we are not, which  seems to be a problem with alot of poeple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First day here or something?, all these points have been addressed within the past, oh I don't know, month or so, in an excrutiatingly high number of different threads.  If you can't bother with reading them, I can't bother with debunking the pointless blather.<br />
<br />
I was taught that if you can't say something nice about someone, don't say anything, too late!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The whole point of the proposal is we arent asking for everything. Our wonderful versatility was the heart of the great difficulty in reaching any sort of consensus in the shaman communities. How can we agree on anything when we all play so differently? <br />
<br />
So, we made a poll. It ran for about a week. The top five shaman issues were identified (which is why you don't see dots, pets, or melee on the list). <br />
<br />
I specifically asked that the proposal be about solidarity. People that &quot;agree&quot; with the proposal are not agreeing that we need EVERY point addressed, they are agreeing with at least one point.<br />
<br />
As Henora said so eloquently:<br />
<br />
&quot;Please remember that you can support the PROPOSAL without agreeing with ALL the issues or the details of each suggestion. Even though this proposal has a number of specific points, it has a general objective; bring attention to the general consensus on the lack of usefulness of the new proposed GOD spells and AAs.&quot;<br />
 <br />
<br />
In 7 pages of posts, you are the first true &quot;I Disagree.&quot; In an earlier thread, I stated that it would make me uncomfortable to delete any &quot;disagree&quot; posts but I would do so.<br />
<br />
I can't decide what to do, any one else have any opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll be blunt and honest. I didn't read your whole post, because...well doesn't matter, but whoever thinks Shamans get this kind of Slow because mobs in GoD are special is a ****ing moron and shouldn't be talking about class balance or Shaman issues at all.<br />
<br />
Btw, do you know Turtle yet?<br />
<br />
Shamans are gods! Oh ****...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You people wanna be all of everything or equal with everyone at doing everything<br />
Oh yeah, if we got, say, an improved Q, most of us would be happy, 'cause it's something high on the list...  We really should get that god complex in check.  More than 50hp/s in healing power?  Nuts!<br />
<br />
Edit: I'd leave his disagree, Glori...  He's entitled to that opinion, even if it seems to me he thinks we want it all rather than like 1 or 2 things.  Besides, like 300 to 1 isn't such a bad ratio. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well we could not bother to care about our class, and others that we group with, quite frankly i am happy going on group and not contributing much to it and still get great exp. i buff,slow mob .. yep thats me dont have time to do nothing esle. but hey if poeple still invite me for that more fool them:)<br />
<br />
<br />
i am sure when the shaman class becomes so rare that poeple have almost forgotten what a real main shaman is , theyll think then , by god we could have had such a great class with us, shame we bashed them when they where down.. still we got beast and pallies now... who needed them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There are prob some people that will allways say &quot;We arent broken !! See Im so good !&quot; More than likely the warriors had people spouting the same crap before they got fixed . <br />
My question is .. if we are just fine like you say .. Why are there SO many that disagree with you ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you can`t asume eveyone getting a item that is at the top level of the game.<br />
<br />
If your at this level, and your guild dose'nt make sure you get this.... problem.<br />
<br />
you cant assume they mean that the slow will only work on GoD mobs and there is nothing to suggest that this is the case.<br />
<br />
I was'nt assuming this, was merely suggesting that this could be the case as others have.<br />
<br />
<br />
at 51 250 mana was alot.<br />
<br />
Back then, I'll agree yes.  But, for today's 51st+ char - it's not too much at all considering the spell.<br />
<br />
your are right with mitigation the % to slow are even more narrowed, but why does that mean we have to acepted a lower % slow?<br />
<br />
I don't really get what you mean the % to slow are even more narrowed?  Maybe I'm just read'n it wrong.  I'm just simply saying that the mitigation is a good thing.<br />
<br />
i certainly dont want to have to load 2 slows and use a spell gem that could be used for something esle and reduce even more what spells we can load up.<br />
<br />
And agreeingly I don't really want to mem another either, may not have to or we may... yet to be seen.<br />
<br />
also at no time did anyone say we want to be master of all, nobody is asking to heal as good as a druid just beter than we currently do (i would say we should be 3rd best, but not that far away from 2nd). we not asking for more % to slow just faster. we not asking to be wizards just similar to other priest classes in nuking.

<br />
It seems to me everytime I come to this board there's a new post or a new whine about how we are bad at this, we need to be better at this, if we could only do it like this class etc etc - I just get tired of seeing that really, if people opened their eye's they would realize our class is awesome and really dose'nt need much tuning.  I don't understand why anyone would think we need to slow faster?  With the right focus/spell our slow is extremely fast, like 1.8sec or something?(I can't remember) And recast is'nt that bad, just like malos almost could be exact.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I guess I'm just tired of seeing so many people complain about our class - so many of us as there is go play a diff one if you have so many probs with your own =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thats ok, just gets it slowed faster if a bst/enc wants to toss out slow - ours will overwrite and whoever is on slow for that mob(raid wise) will just cover it after his/her's lands. <br />
So, why is your guild even taking you on this raid if you're slow just overwrites what someone else did first and at a marginal % difference due to mitigation?  Is it your buffs?  Heals?  DPS?  Tell me, I really want to know.  Sounds like you're just taking up a spot and now we have expansions where there are limited spots, mitigating mobs and if your slow isn't that big a deal why is your guild putting you in that slot when they can get someone who actually makes a difference in that encounter.  The only difference is malos and my response is big hairy deal.  Your own statement shows that we do not &quot;own&quot; and your assumption that you're the only shaman with a clue is clearly erroneous and more than a little arrogant.<br />
<br />
Glori, I say you keep his post on the one voice thread, he's a shaman and it counts even though I doubt he really does have a clue.  One disagree on 13 pages ... I say thats pretty unified.</div></div><hr />

Offering suggestions for improvement isn't the same as complaining.  I love playing a shaman, and I want to continue to love doing so.  Getting useful (and sometimes fun) improvements with each expansion is one way of doing that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, I can't really imagine why the guild would take me over say a wizzy or true dps class - most likely because its a) my turn to cycle in or b) we don't have 72 there.  Imo 2-4 shaman per raid is fine for higher end pop encounters, and we average 10-11 per raid which is high.  I'd rather see most of us sit out and a real dps go in.  And the mitigating mobs and me not thinking slow is useful...where did I say this?  Slow is one of the most useful spells in the game, all I said was that mobs mitigating slow was good in that it dose'nt comepletely trivialize encounters and the fact that they do mitigate just gives more of us(ench/bst) a chance to slow also just as good, which helps the guild as a whole.<br />
<br />
And as far as the &quot;own&quot; thing goes, our fuctionality and ability to do so many things and take on different roles in different situations(grinding/non-raid mostly) is what makes us so good.</div></div><hr />

Ok yes, not everyone does complain and that voice post was'nt a complaining post - sorry to imply :)  But many posts do and where I don't post too much, I guess I just got kinda fed up with seeing those that do complain.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The guild on my server that has been in time the longest is still 2 TA short of all their shaman having one.  They got a few quick, and it's been very rare since.<br />
<br />
Just because you're in time doesn't mean you can hail saryrn and get a TA, jackass.  Seeing as the rest of your idiocy was based around free TA for everyone, I'll stop there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">you where assuming that all will get a time level item, and you are asumming that all guilds will make it to time, or have enough members to kill much in time?<br />
and you where assuming that this slow will affect only GoD mobs otherwise you wouldnt have mention them as backup for your arguement.<br />
the poeple making the list have not assumed anything, just wanting to make it clear how most feel<br />
<br />
to you the shaman class if fine, fine you have posted and i replied . i dont share your view. not because i want to be uber powerful, but because i wish to contribute more to a group/raid than just debuff slow and buff. most other classes contibute to a group in more ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hmmm...sorry the guild on your server has been unlucky - the other 3 guilds on our server have all TA's and all the twinks in the first guild do too =\<br />
<br />
Our guild only has 2 saryrn kills, so none.  And I did not assume everyone would get TA at all and never said that everyone would(*but* Time abled shamans 99% sure should get it if your guild is good to its members) - but since it is an item in the game you have to take it into consideration, why? because Sony does.</div></div><hr />

What is wrong with wanting to get a fifth of the upgrade other classes get? We are still paying for being able to solo WW Dragons. Just because you haven't noticed problems it does not mean they dont exist.<br />
<br />
* Current new slow in GoD is substantially inferior to our level 51 slow due to recast time and short duration, it will not replace turgurs.<br />
<br />
Reason could be, this will be a slow that will only work on GoD mobs or some GoD mobs.<br />
That makes the new slow worse, not better.<br />
<br />
* Lack of non-essential spell gems preclude wasting a slot for new slow and having 2 slows memorized<br />
<br />
Hardcore shamans won't have to &quot;waste&quot; another slot for a new slow, hail Time's Antithesis - and yes I realize all of you don't have access to it(our guild just this month started hitting time) but you have to take that item into consideration none the less.  And if my above statement happens to be true, you would'nt have to even mem Turgur's where the new slow would be aplicable.<br />
Apart from the fact that I would not mem the new slow at all - even if you have a Time's Antithesis you are wasting a slot. Just because you saved a slot when you gained Time's Antithesis  does not mean you do not loose a slot to mem something else.<br />
<br />
* Slow mitigation has decreased the substantive advantage we have over other classes that can slow<br />
<br />
So now our slows have the possibility of all landing at the same % slowing, and your complaining?  Thats ok, just gets it slowed faster if a bst/enc wants to toss out slow - ours will overwrite and whoever is on slow for that mob(raid wise) will just cover it after his/her's lands.  Mobs in PoP are short lived fights compared to the VT days, if they were fully slowable their dps would goto **** and completely trivialize the encounter... no extremely easy loot for you! /whine on<br />
<br />
[QUOTE='GeddarRN']* GoD Slow upgrade is insufficient, recast times and short duration, when paired with a nerf in effectiveness of the slow makes this spell undesirable<br />
<br />
Again, this could be with good reason with GoD mobs - like judging a book by its cover you just don't know.  If it turns out that it will be as awful as you guys make it sound to be, then so be it petition to have it changed.<br />
Unless this new slow is the only slow to land on GoD mobs it is as bad as we make it out to be, thus we are petitioning.<br />
<br />
Slowing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Reduced agro, mana cost, resist rate, and/or recast time on (an upgrade to) Turgur's Insects, which has been in its current state since Kunark was released six expansions ago<br />
<br />
Turgur's is still an awesome spell.  Resist is mob dependant I guess, mana cost is low, recast is'nt bad - if you need to cast slow so fast just ae slow then turgur's.  The six expansions ago arguement will never work, CH is original and that most likely won't be touched again - and as was it got nerfed(with good reason)<br />
Turgur's is good, certainly, but that does not mean it could not stand an upgrade. A -30 resist adjustment would be fine. Turgur's would even be fine as is if other classes would not be getting slows that creep closer and closer to Turgur's in power. If slow is as overpowered as CH how come so many classes got new slow spells and noone got anything remotely approaching the power of CH?<br />
<br />
* An AA ability that mitigates mitigation<br />
<br />
Be nice, but at raids you would have to go through who has what AA's and all that crap - again refer to mitigation thoughts above.<br />
Or you could just have lesser slows bounce like they already do?<br />
<br />
* An AA ability for a random chance to bypass mitigation<br />
<br />
Too much of a pain - again mitigation thoughts.<br />
The real reason this will not happen is because we could just chain cast slow on a boss until someone gets lucky and crits his Turgur's.<br />
<br />
We have it good, but I guess over in wish land the grass is greener - wish away I'm happy we own as is.<br />
Good, then you will not mind getting upgrades.</div></div><hr />

While I agree our versatility makes us effective as a filler or replacement, even helps us solo better than most.  For raids (as you seem to focus on) it's more desireable to have a specialty class.<br />
<br />
As for the first bolded part from my quote of your post, druids had the same complaint, SoE agreed and out came the ICH.  This despite the fact that they had better burst DPS, more stackability and a variety of buffs and even debuffs that are situationally usefull.  Their major HP buff has a mana component as well that most casters prefer over virtue.  This establishes a precedent that classes needing an upgrade to increase group and raid utility to nominal levels get it.  We need this kind of boost, you said so yourself when you said you don't know why your guild doesn't replace you on raids.<br />
<br />
My second bolding of your post shows you saying that you're happy for the other classes because on mitigated slows, they slow almost as well as we do and that it's good for the guild.  I agree, it is good for the guild, but it sucks for us as a class.  If you don't need a shaman, why take one along.  Slow is a very powerful spell that defines many encounters, but if anyone can do it, why pack the shaman?  I know we have a lot of utility to BU/rampage heal, our debuffs are still numerically marginally superior, and we have a couple of widely requested buffs, BUT with limited space the requirements for dragging a shaman along will become less stressed and we'll be reduced to bot status.  That's not fun for me, thats not why I invested in my character.  I refuse to be dragged along because there is an open spot.</div></div><hr />
