<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just thought I'd give a heads up to people thinking about getting +damage items.<br />
My mage is now 60, almost entirely arcane specced.<br />
Doing ae killing, I know I can kill about 3 level 54 mobs at once, or about 4-5 level 51ish mobs at once by just hammering arcane explosion and using arcane power sometimes.<br />
This is using my standard int/sta/spirit type of gear.  (143sta, 270 int, 184 spirit).<br />
I also had a set of gear for use that was pretty much all +arcane damage.<br />
Using this equipment to try to make my ae pulls better, I actually found the opposite.<br />
I usually died doing exactly what I would do on pulls I could normally easily kill.<br />
I lost too many hps from the gear tradeoffs.<br />
I lost too much mana that wasn't made up by the increased damage to the spells.<br />
I ran out of health before the mobs were dead, or I ran out of mana.<br />
I've since sold/disenchanted all the arcane power gear I've got.<br />
If anyone gets some incidental +damage out of gear with decent stats, then great.<br />
But it's not worth it if you ever plan to use it for doing AE stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm also planning to try dumping the arcane build, and going with ice to see how it goes.<br />
I've seen a mage blizzard kill about 8 level 51 ghouls at once, and seemed to have no problems with it at all.<br />
I also like the emergency ice block type of spells to compliment the spell shield all mages already get.<br />
I need another 5 points talents for the build i want though :(<br />
Basicly gonna try arcane missile, clearcasting, evocation, arcane explosion, and the rest into ice talents for AE purposes.<br />
I'll post how it goes after I've tried it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">+damage is really only good for actual damage dealing... AEing is dangerous and you need as much HP and mana as you can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Doing solo ae without ice? sounds painful...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ya.  I have enough mana to ae level 54 mobs, but not much more.<br />
It's a race between my health hitting zero, and the mobs hitting zero first, and sometimes my mana hitting zero first.<br />
I've gotten so used to instant explode, it'll be interesting to see how i can do without it in favor of using blizzard for ae.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've gotten so used to instant explode, it'll be interesting to see how i can do without it in favor of using blizzard for ae<br />
<br />
Why wouldnt you spec arcane high enough to get IAE? its only 15 points, 16 if you also want evoc. Leaves plenty of points for ice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Because I want to see how well blizzard can substitute for doing ae instead of instant arcane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm not worried about picking up any +dmg items for my mage atm.  I'm snagging up all the *** of the Eagle gear on AH atm so i can have a bit more HPs while AE grinding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">So a green lense I made with +32 arcane damage, will that actually add 32 points to AE?<br />

An explanation of +damage and +healing items | 2/14/2005 8:15:37 AM PST           <br />
 <br />
 <br />
There is some confusion about how these effects work and how effective they are, so I wanted to explain what they do. <br />
<br />
When an item has the effect &quot;Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 20&quot;, the damage dealt or hit points healed by one of your spells will be increased by a fixed amount up to 20. The actual amount that the spell is increased by is not determined randomly, but by which spell you are casting. You are not receiving a random bonus value between 1 and 20 whenever you cast a spell. Some random items, such as those with the property &quot;of Shadow Wrath&quot;, indicate that they provide &quot;+X Shadow Spell Damage&quot;. The actual amount of the bonus is again determined by the spell being cast. There are a few items that do provide a random bonus, such as Dreamweave Gloves, but their effect notes the randomness by stating that item's bonus as &quot;up to 1 to 19.&quot; Once again, the bonus received could be reduced depending on the spell being cast. <br />
<br />
Spells with longer casting times such as Fireball and Greater Heal will receive the full bonus listed every time they cast the spell. Spells with instant or short cast times receive a fraction of the bonus listed. As an example of such a spell, Flash Heal (Rank 7) only receives approximately 43% of the item bonus. Talents or other effects that might change the casting time of the spell will not change the bonus; the amount received is a property of the spell being cast. <br />
<br />
Most long duration Damage and Heal over time spells have the bonus divided amongst every tick. So Renew, which lasts 15 seconds and heals an amount every 3 seconds, has 20% of the bonus applied each tick. In a similar fashion, channeled spells also have the item bonus divided amongst every tick of the spell's duration. <br />
<br />
Lower level spells receive a greatly reduced benefit from these effects. <br />
<br />
These effects all stack. So if a Mage is wearing 3 items that provide up to +20 Fire damage, you will have a combined +60 to Fire damage. This means every high level Fireball cast will inflict an extra 60 damage to the target. <br />
<br />
These bonuses are also added to the effect of the spell before the 50% bonus from a critical spell hit is applied. <br />
<br />
Note that there is currently a bug in the game that affects heals over time such as Renew and Rejuvenation. The +healing items worn by the caster are only providing the appropriate healing bonus if the caster is also the target of the spell. Direct heals such as Greater Heal work fine, and the +Healing bonuses are being appropriately applied. Damage over time spells are also working properly. We're working to fix this bug, but currently I can not provide any kind of ETA on the fix. <br />
