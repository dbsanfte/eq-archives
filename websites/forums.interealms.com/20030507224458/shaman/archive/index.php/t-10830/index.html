<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lenamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My equipment flat out sucks, and I've decided it's time to upgrade.  However, my situation is worse than most other people that post here.  My guild isn't capable of raiding anywhere really nice, I have 50pp to my name, and I don't have uber connections to help me with everything. I've earned everything I have.  So, any help as to where I could go to get good drops or money and advice for what to buy would be greatly appreciated.  I'm willing to do pretty much anything, as I'm desperate to improve.  Thanks for your time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">not sure what the economy is like on your server, but the things Im about to list are dirt cheap now on my server, so most should be easily attainable once you get a little cash:<br />
<br />
range: goranga idol, as low as 50pp<br />
earrings: black sapphire electrum earrings, 250ish pp<br />
rings: velium fire wedding rings, 500ish pp<br />
head: metal linked crown, couple of hundred Im guessing<br />
waist: spider fur, 100ish pp<br />
shoulders: tattered mantle, 50ish pp<br />
face: crystal spider eyes 700ish or enshrouded veil, even cheaper<br />
shield: sarnak battle shield, couple of hundred maybe<br />
neck: ivory imbued collar, couple hundred<br />
<br />
all of the mentioned above should raise your hp by a little less than 400, increase your ac by about 52raw (~78 total), but will reduce your mana pool by about 250ish, all for around 3k, many of the items listed are groupable at your level as well.<br />
<br />
as for what/where to farm at your level, not sure, but save and sell everything you get.  3k is pretty easily attainable, especially if you get lucky on a drop in a group that sells well so try to group in camps where nice things drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cystal caverns - camp the geos and sell the gems to vendors. Make sure you get best prices. You can make up to about 1k an hour if you are lucky. Solo or take a partner.<br />
<br />
If geos are camped, take the crystal spiders instead, and farm the silks. They sell to players for a reasonable amount.<br />
<br />
As a bonus, you'll still be getting xp there at 49 I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think chardok is a place for you to go as you could use many drops from there.<br />
Earring of Purity / Cleansing, Chokidai Hide Spaulders, Ivory Imbued Collar, Golem Tear Earring, Band of Di'Zok, Sarnak Battle Shield...<br />
There may be more which I don't remember atm but these would prolly be upgrades for you.<br />
I'm not sure how you'll do there at 49, but from 51 on (when you get Turgur's) this is prolly a nice place for you to hunt.<br />
<br />
Good Luck :)</div></div><hr />
