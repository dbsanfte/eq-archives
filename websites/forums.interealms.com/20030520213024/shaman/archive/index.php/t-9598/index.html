<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Grabbed a bladestopper cheap (700 pp- yoo-hoo!) in the bazaar just to resell and make a little coin.<br />
<br />
Soon after, my main shield (stretched fungushide) sold.<br />
<br />
I'm seriously thinking about just using the Bladestopper rather than following my original plan of grabbing either a OOiV or going cheap and getting a skull shield.<br />
<br />
Stretched fungushide:  AC 32, +15 Sta +10 Wis +15 vs Disease<br />
Bladestopper:  AC 25, +15 Sta, +50 HP, 10 charges of Rune IV<br />
Skull marked shield:  AC 22, +7 Wis, +50 HP, +50 Mana <br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, it's really a toss-up.  Discounting the Runes, Bladestopper has plenty of hp and slightly better AC.   3 less AC and less HP, but the 50 mana and 7 Wis give you a noticably bigger mana pool to begin with.</div></div><hr />

I'd go with an OoIV if you have the money.  I'm very happy with mine.<br />
<br />
I had a Skull Marked Shield at one time.  Upgrade to a Shield of Bane Warding.  I bought a Bladestopper for a VS attempt (short on enchanters, figured it might help) that failed, and eventually gave it to a younger shaman to use.  I've had a SBS for hp+resists for a long time.<br />
Sold my Shield of Bane Warding for 19kpp &amp; Coldain Skin Gloves for another 3kpp.  Put that together with some other sales and bought an OoIV for 28kpp cash.  Well worth it in my opinion.  Best shield I will probably be able to get for some time considering the targets my guild is hitting.<br />
<br />
Recently picked up two of the 10ac 50hp 20wis PoJ rings, and I don't miss the wisdom that I lost from Bane Warding shield any more. ;)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

PoJ, or the PoP player made ones? Can you elaborate please, they sound nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its POP player made<br />

<br />
I have one so far, had a guild group help farm items, just bring someone that can snare it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />
<br />
Yes, those are the rings.<br />
Sorry about the confusion.  I call them PoJ rings since the components to make them all drop in that zone.   Glittering rings drop off of prisoners, the eyes off of bugs there, and the other component comes from worms.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
