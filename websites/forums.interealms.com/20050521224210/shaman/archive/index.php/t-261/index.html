<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know exactly what this spell does? I've heard rumblings and rumors that it helps lower your resist rate. I haven't had a change to test it out yet and parse some logs, but from initial experiments, it does seem to lower the amount of first cast resists I get when slowing. Then again, the resist rate is so random who can say?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its &quot;supposed&quot; to lower you fizzle rate thought enchanters don't cast it hardly because they saw they hardly ever notice a difference maybe only on a cleric in CH rotation or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Thought Horror Overfeind in The Deep casts some sort of spell that's supposed to make you fizzle alot more, but I've fought him several times now and I didnt notice a fizzle increase.<br />
<br />
This spell is mainly used in this encounter. We hardly use it otherwise.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">against THO if you can hail him you will be affected by the AE.  If you are out of hailing range you will get the icon but not the effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It does effect your fizzle rate altho most of the time it's not a big deal. A little spell data file diving and it's easy to see that. THO's ae has a reallllyyyy big negative to the exact same things that this has a much smaller positive to.<br />
<br />
In my own personal testing my enchanter cast this on my druid when he was casting his group cold and fire resists spells that he usually fizzles horribly and it definitely helped out alot.<br />
<br />
Exactly how it effects fizzle is hard to say. Is it the equivilent of being high lvl or maybe having a higher skill. If it's like a lvl buff as far as spell casting goes then you would expect it to help spells land. Never seen any good tests on if it effects resist rates altho some people think that it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">haha I use it as a trash buff when fighting AE dispelling mobs :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just more proof that they altered the fizzle rates before SoL so we would fizzle MORE and appreciate spells like this or the AA skills to reduce fizzling.<br />
<br />
Except for Cann III and Rage, I never noticed a fizzle problem until this expansion.</div></div><hr />
