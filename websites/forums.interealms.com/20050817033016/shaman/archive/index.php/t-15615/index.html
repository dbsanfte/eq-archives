<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MuuruGai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've gotten all the juicy AA's such as c5, mgb, scrm etc.<br />
<br />
Now I am sitting here wondering where I should put my AA pts.<br />
<br />
What are you thoughts of something like this?<br />
<br />
Improved Natural Durability I<br />

Improved Natural Durability III<br />
Combat Agility I<br />
Combat Stability I<br />

Lightning Reflexes IV<br />

Innate Defense V<br />
Total   96<br />
<br />
From what I understand that would reduce all damage taken by 30% and completely avoid another 30% of the hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think that the changes in defensive are quite that dramatic, but it is definately a noticeable difference.  However, you should consider other, non combat related AA's.  SCRM, QB2 (or maybe even 3), and SCM3 all served me well.<br />
<br />
Also, I think you'd get better results if you didn't jump between skill lines and just did all LR5, then all ID5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">click search</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definitely better off doing all of 1 before the other.  Get ca3 then lr5, then go back to do cs3 / id5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree. CA and LR are much more effective than CS and ID. CA/LR make the mob MISS you more, so when it works, you are effectively eliminating 100% of the dmg the mob would have hit you for. CS/ID on the other hand only mitigates the dmg the mob does do to you, reducing a hit by some number depending on which level of the ability you have at that point. But you can bet that mitigation will be lots less than 100%.<br />
<br />
I also would suggest SCM3 and QB2 or 3 (depends on your preferrences, I went with QB3). They save you mana/casting time on buffs. QB3 will also cut your casting time on Torpor/Quie in half. That makes it much easier to get it on yourself when you are being beat on.<br />
<br />
Also consider getting RC1. It will remove many curses and other detrimental effects not only from you, but from your group members as well. Its also the only way I know of to remove malo and tash short of dispelling yourself. And you can use it mana free every 3 mins.<br />
<br />
Those are the main ones... We get alot of good/fun AA's The trick is getting the points to buy them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with what others have said about getting LR5 before CS1, and buying RC1 early. However, don't forget about VP. I wish I'd gotten it earlier as it really is one of our more useful AA's, due to the knockback.<br />
<br />
Where did you get the 30% figure from? I don't have parses but there's no way it's as high as 30%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its also the only way I know of to remove malo and tash short of dispelling yourself.<br />
<br />
I hate to nitpick about irrelevant stuff, but tash can be removed via cure poison (it has 1 counter).  RC is really great though, for all those times when you malos yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MuuruGai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't worry, I do have the aa casting reinforcement mastery. SCRM. I wouldn't know what to do without it.<br />
I never really put much thought into qb, rc and vp. I might fit vp and rc somewhere early on. <br />
I currently have 60aa pts.<br />
<br />
Name: Combat Agility <br />
This ability increases the players ability to avoid being hit altogether in combat.<br />
The first point increases the chance to avoid a blow by 2%, the second by 5% and the third by 10%.<br />
<br />
Name: Combat Stability <br />
This reduces damage taken from every blow which lands on the player.<br />
The first point reduces all damage taken by 2%, the second by 5% and the third by 10%.<br />
<br />
I was estimating when I said 30%. LR5 and ID5 cost twice the aa pts as their lesser versions.<br />
<br />
I assume both &quot;should&quot; negate the same amount of damage of the same period of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">SCM is an overall great skill.  I'd rank this way higher than CombAgi, and even more so than CombStab.<br />
<br />
Crits, while perhaps not as useful, makes the game more fun to play. I still smile every time i get a crit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Get Virulent Paralysis (cheap) and RC1 or even level 2 before you start doing skills that have very little impact on your playing per AA point spent.  Both of those skills you will use and come to appreciate more and more over time.  <br />
<br />
There are also some other small gems that I particularly like.<br />
1) Innate Metabolism3  = omg huge reduction in stat food I need to buy!  <br />
2) Pet Control = hard to replace this skill for working with a pet either in groups or solo.  Our pets do much better when you can properly newspaper their nose and they obey instantly.  Makes them an addition to a group, rather than a liability.  I use my pet constantly, often as a pulling aid (pull with Malos, sic pet to take initial Bash and first couple hits, land Turgurs and assume aggro).  <br />
It's only 6 points, as opposed to the 27 you'll need to get LR5.  LR5 does make an appreciable difference, but it's not really all that.  Yer still gonna die if Fennin Ro aggroes ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't worry, I do have the aa casting reinforcement mastery. SCRM. I wouldn't know what to do without it.<br />

I currently have 60aa pts.<br />
<br />
With only 60's aa's there are probably other aa's out there that could benifit you more than ca/lr and cs/id. I'd definitely recommend a level of Radiant cure, a level of Virulent paralysis and even a level of Spirit call. All very handy and relatively cheap. Metabolism is great if you use any sort of stat food especially with a horse.<br />
<br />
Quick buff is a nice aa altho not as need with post 60 spells since they have a quicker cast time that the 60 equivilents. It is still nice for torpor/q 3 secondish cast times on these spells is very useful.<br />
<br />
Some shaman don't seem interested in SCM since we can generate a fair amount of mana already but I found it to be a great improvement in both how many spells i could cast and how well I could keep my mana up.<br />

Neither lives up to the 30% you'd guess from thier description. Of the 2 the LR line seems to be the better. ID does seem to help but not as much most of the time. <br />
<br />
Don't forget healing crits, healing adept, spell crits and mgb if you don't have it.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm at 215 aa's and i've got LR5 but i don't have CS or ID at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have 142 aa and have only just finished ca3. i'll probably take LR1-5 next. It has made quite a difference already on trash mobs (no parses heh), I just feel a bit harder to kill.<br />
<br />
In no real rush for CS/ID, I will max out PoP healing aa/nukes/radiant cure before touching these.<br />
<br />
Healing aa is a good investment if you raid a lot or play main healer a lot, I have a lot of fun 'chaotic healing' on raids with hg3/ha3/ih4 tnargs and scrm Quiescence. Best thing about is is heals are unresistable, so you always get the value from healing aa.<br />
<br />
Crit nuke line is fun (SCF), I did this mainly to add comedy value, no regrets and decent damage when you crit 2-3 waves of saryrn.<br />
<br />
Radiant cure 1 is best 2aa I ever spent, VP is handy but not essential, spiritcall is fun but I'm in no rush for levels 2/3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Oh and i'd take SCM over defensive/healing aa. this isn't about what mana you save, it's all about how much more you can spend ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">VP is fun!!!<br />
<br />
1 &amp; 2 dont last too long, but 3 lasts until it refreshes and the knockback will have you giggling as you look upon the melee's faces as they look around for the mob and say ***?<br />
It does get resisted easily on PoP and new content zones (solC, velks, chardokB)<br />
It's great for CC when it works.. highly recommend it.<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure 2 is nice as well. I works so well atm, I am not considering RC3.<br />
<br />
Natural Metabolism!!!  If I knew what I know now.. I never would have got Natural Regeneration. Metabolism just rocks!<br />
<br />
I spent 5 points on Spirit Call. It's fun. but.. it should be better.. they are not hasted and dont wield weapons so DPS is not so great.. but for 1 minute you can distract an add provided you can root it first. Many times the puller will be back too many mobs.. I can VP or root a mob and use spirit call.. mob is practically mezzed for 1 min.. it has saved my life a few times. I claim dibs on the name &quot;ghetto mezz&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>MuuruGai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think I am going to go after VP and RC before CA/CS LR/ID.<br />
<br />
One question about RC though, what is the difference between RC1 through 3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Higher levels of RC has a greater chance to remove more counters.  At RC2 you can remove most stuff you would find in an xp group, RC3 helps on some boss mob DoTs and a few other things.  2 is really worth it, 3 is nice but at a cost of 6AA rather expensive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Radiant Cure 1 removes 9 poison/disease/curse counters, and has a chance to dispel one negative effect that doesn't have a counter (malxxx, snare, root, necromancer snare/fire dots, etc.).<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure 2 removes 12 poison/disease/curse counters, and has a chance to dispel three negative effects.<br />
<br />
Radiant Cure 3 removes 16 poison/disease/curse counters, and has a chance to dispel six negative effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
In my experience, radiant cure 1 is good...but not good enough.  There are times I've had a malo wear off via duration on me, while popping RC1 every time it was available.  Like a dispel, there's no guarantee it's going to remove counter-less effects.  With RC2, you're virtually guaranteed to remove one negative effect, and, more often than not, two.  Unless you're really unlucky (or have low resistances), you're not likely to have more than 1-2 counter-less effects on you at a time (one possible &quot;worst case&quot; scenario could be malxxx, snare, root, necro fire dot, necro snare dot, etc.), so I agree that RC2 would be sufficient for most instances.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, that term has been in use on these boards for the last 3 years.  Where u been? :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
VP ~ must have ( cheap and damn damn handy )<br />
RC ~ must have<br />
CA3 + LR5 very helpful<br />
SCM ~ must have<br />
CS ~ not sure, just started working on it myself.</div></div><hr />
