<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">52 shammy here, on Ayonae Ro. Wanting to know of any other decent soloing spots BESIDES solB and LGuk.  I am geared fairly well imho.<br />
I have been playing for about 6 months now, and I know there is a lot of content I havent explored yet.  All options are open to me, and if need be I can enlist the services of a guild bot'ed cleric (however, i hesitate to do this). I would like to see lvl 54 by the end of the week, if at all possible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should be able to solo PoJ exit hallway at 52, if memory serves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dulak is nice money and you can easily solo most of the boats there.  <br />
CoM if you haven't done your epic parts there yet.<br />
<br />
If you like a challenge, HS ZI most fights would be 2 at a time but RvR is good. If you die, just summon corpse in Guild Hall.  Good resists help here.<br />
<br />
SkyFire would be good exp.<br />
<br />
BW Giants are easy<br />
<br />
KC if you don't care about OT faction (HS will ruin this faction too)<br />
<br />
HS and SF you get a lot of spell drops (just none you can use)<br />
<br />
If you have good CoV faciton you can do Wyrens in CS (use port in PoM to get there).</div></div><hr />

No idea what HS ZI is.....?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HS ZI = Howling Stones Zone In</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know you haven't asked, but either your back or your shoulder can be replaced with bazaar-available mana pres 3 items.  Either of those and a burning affliction item like Coldain Military Wristguard would help a bunch with your soloin'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I seem to have a vague memory of soloing in scarlet desert around that time...reavers on the plateau were pretty good exp back then if I recall.  Another possible spot to check out would be the zone in area mobs in nadox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Do people still do the Highhold Keep nameds up on the second floor?  I remember in the low 50s that being the &quot;hotspot&quot; to xp..  so many moons ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the advice.  Tried POJ but couldnt find a good camp, and was pulling three or four at a time.  Had to get out.  Went to the boats in Dulak but the XP was slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There's nothing wrong with the exp in LoY... try torgiran mines if you find the boats slow - don't know if the exp bonus still applies though??  The idea with the LoY zones is that you can make about 500p per hour (likely better) all the while getting decent exp.<br />
<br />
It's not the planes....nothing is.  But it is a very safe spot to solo in as most everything is a single pull.  More importantly if you haven't done the Stoicism quest then it is well worth it and very easy.  See the quest section for details on that.<br />
<br />
At 52 you could do the caves in Dulak's Harbour as well - the Enraged Soulstealer might be a tough (close) battle but if you're prepared I suspect you could do it.  Keep resists up for his dots though and make sure the wanderer is killed before he's due to pop.<br />
Keep in mind he's got a larger agro than the others that spawn there.<br />
<br />
Just so you know - I spent 8 months at lvl 55 (now lvl 56!) so for the most part for the soloing shaman I would give LoY zones as the best zones to be in.<br />
<br />
Nurga and such can get into multiple pulls, as can Sebilis and most other places of that nature.  Doable but most certainly a much higher risk especially CR in Seb ;)<br />
<br />
With your gear I'd give it another few levels before soloing in PoI too - feel free to try it if you wish - can't hurt.  But you will need a virtue and I suggest one for dogdog too.<br />
<br />
Another spot you could try but is a pain to get to would be Acrylia caverns.  You'd do well in there but again multiples may be an issue and mobs do run @ 20% health.  Plenty of wanderers in there too.  If you die there - you're eating the exp loss too unless you have a pet cleric you can call upon.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you have DoN, just use the corpse summoner in the guild lobby, and spam for a rez, voila, nasty CR no more. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In PoJ, just set up camp (park dog if soloing) at one of the two hallways leading to the exit clickout, around the entrance steps. Pull the rats or Gailors or whatever wander by. I think at 52 I was mostly in PoD groups.</div></div><hr />

started a monk.  havent messed with vork for about a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I started a monk once.  Gave him fungi &amp; tstaff, nothing else, and was level 38, solo, two days later.  This was about 2.5 years ago, and he's still level 38</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hey now.  Vork is and will always be my toon of choice.  But he's damned frustrating sometimes.</div></div><hr />
