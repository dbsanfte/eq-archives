<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yep, its that time again :)<br />
<br />
I've now got all the really major upgrades I wanted - Taw Ew BP, Epic, JBB, horse etc, and have all the spells I really need up to and including level 62 (torpor, malo etc).<br />
<br />
My guild is currently working on HoT 2x week, and looking towards NToV in a few months. Vindi is currently beating us 3-1, but we are capable of killing him so Vindi boots and BP are a (low) possibility for me. I don't want to spend a lot of pp on items that I am likely to replace with no-drop gear in the next couple of months.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering where to spend my money next. I think a solstice earring is top of my list, not so much for FT1 but the nice stats on it. I'm trying to do the talisman of benevolence, just waiting to find that scout up :) I'm also hoping for SS greaves to drop as I have the RPs for them. After that though, I'm not sure where to get the most bang for my buck. <br />
<br />
Some obvious choices are OOIV and Heiro cloak. However, as I already have a fairly reasonable shield and a nice (no drop) cloak, I feel there's probably better value to be had elsewhere (although I'm open to being told otherwise). I'm also starting to consider ditching the JBB and ODS, but I'm not at all sure about that yet. Oh, and I'm working on the prayer shawl, but that'll probably take a while yet. <br />
<br />
Budget about 30k, +10k for ODS, +20k for JBB if you think they should <br />
go too. My current priority is on HP (I really want to break 2k), followed by resists.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice, magelo is linked to my name in the sig!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Things look pretty decent as you stand.  I might try and upgrade those earrings.  Just grab the highest HP earrings you can reasonably afford.  Then maybe replace the shield with a Tae Ew Shield... which I prefer over the OOIV.  Perhaps a Wicked Bone Atlatl for the range slot, or something else with a nice focus effect.  <br />
<br />
Just FYI - tradeskills for the prayer shawl can get expensive, especially if you don't plan on farming the tailoring components yourself.  If you're serious about the quest, take a look at the overall picture and try and get a rough estimate of your costs, then plan accordingly.  I have my 7th, working on the final combines for my 8th, and I've spent about 25K in skills practice, and another 5K or so in actual components for the shawl.  But, I am one of the few people who've been lucky enough to never fail a final combine on the 5th, 6th, or 7th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Groz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good call on the Earring of the solstice, it should be the next item. If your guild has enough tradeskillers, it can be very cheap. <br />
<br />
Another decent earring choice is Silver hammer earring (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16449).<br />
<br />
A bigger step up is raptor bauble (drops in CT) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10447) <br />
<br />
I chose the Tae Ew shield as well.  Assuming you know a GM smith, the hardest parts are the Tae Ew blood (which you could solo at CT entrance) and Iksar blood (just boring farming in Dalnir or guard/necro in Seb). <br />
<br />
To maximize hitpoints, i wear a slime covered rubicite coif (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12186).<br />
<br />
Finally for the neck, you could look at the  ribbon choker (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16451) or tracking wolf collar  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12307).<br />
<br />
One of the key thing for me  is to avoid low health aggro when duo'ing using Cann V, so maxing hitpoints have been pretty key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are doing HoT and on cov faction you can try to pick up a Talisman of Benevolence.. easy quest starts in ss and you do the fight in WW.<br />
<br />
Or buy a wicked bone atlatl.. nice foci effect for us.<br />
<br />
Shield: orb of the infinite void is a decent upgrade.. but dont spend much.. I hear they go for mondo cheap on blues.<br />
<br />
Groz has the right idea on earrings. <br />
<br />
For alot of slots, HoT will help you out alot.. most of the wolf callers is pretty nice.<br />
<br />
You can try to buy some Stormriders Gauntlets. 22ac 30hps/mana and some other stats.<br />
<br />
Your cloak rules, I want one.. where does it come from.. 15ac 50hps no drop.. would be nice for me on a zek =p<br />
<br />
Really though, HoT will help you out a bunch, and once you start doing wtov nameds and ntov(particularly eeshan.. he is a treasure trove of really nice ****)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks all. Taw Ew shield is on the list, I already have all the bloods just got to get a monk friend to buy bloodwater in cablis.<br />
<br />
For the shawl, I'm on the 6th, had one fail on that - tailoring is 159, + sewing contraption. Most of my tradeskills are in the 130s or so except JC, I don't think I need to spend more than 8k or so more and I'm farming all the bits rather than buying.<br />
<br />
Stormrider gaunts - do they have any stamina? Otherwise the 20hp +9sta on coldain is perhaps better?<br />
<br />
Wicked bone atlatl - will have to look that up and see what the focus effect is.<br />
<br />
Raptor tooth bauble - good call. Might be hard to get though, 4c is a b**** and I gather that's where the named raptor spawns. Only been there once and got owned by too many adds.<br />
<br />
As for my cloak, it drops off the big man in Hate, Mr Innoruuk. I was very happy with it, not as much hp as a heiro cloak but +10 wis too and it was free :) I can imagine on red servers its very desirable.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the ideas so far. Any comments on ODS and JBB? To keep, or not to keep? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you're planning on leveling to 65 soon, may as well sell the ODS...if you know you don't have access to spells, may want to just stay 62 and farm aaxp (especially if you don't have PoV/PoS/BoT access).<br />
<br />
Focus effect on Wicked Bone Atlatl is Haste of Mithaniel, 20% faster beneficial spells...buffs...TORPOR...TNARG'S.  Very nice focus.<br />
<br />
I sold my JBB at 63 or something 'cause I never used it except when slumming in guk or something.  People who use JBBs much in PoP groups who have torpor/canni5 are robbing their group of DPS.  Better to rain and canni a little than JBB 1 or 2 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd suggest Tae Ew leggings, Tae Ew Shield, and the Earring of the Solstice.. they would get you some nice upgrades, more resists, more ac, and more HP/Mana and on Drinal they're not that bad.. you can even farm the stuff for the leggings and shield solo if you want to save the money and just find a smith to do the combines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If your regularly farming HoT i would suggest waiting on some chain legs drops rather then getting Tae Ew (though you could always sell the tae ew).  <br />
<br />
As to Bloodwater, you can buy some in Fungus Grove.  The last vender on the left before you leave the town sells it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Since your on CoV faction I'd looking to the circlet of farlakin quest or what ever it's called. Makes a nice helm.<br />
<br />
For upgrades i'd consider looking and some of the new JC made rings. Either the valorium ring of galantry or the big wis rings.<br />
<br />
Earrings could definitely use an upgrade. An earring of solstice is good for one. A silver hammered loop would be a good option for the other one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, I'm going for the SS leggings over Taw Ew, slightly better and the Thurg leggings aren't hurting me too badly at the moment, they're pretty decent anyway. <br />
<br />
I got myself the dusty soriz boots, 25 more hp and some nice resists, at the cost of some AC and a little wisdom (and some pp :)). Paid 900pp, no idea what the standard price is but it seemed reasonable enough.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info on the Bloodwater, I never knew that. Will have to make a trip there, I think I have all I need for the shield - and then I can sell my SBS and skull marked shields for some more upgrades :) Hopefully I'll have enough for the solstice earring after those.<br />
<br />
Gwain - working on my BoT key, just need one more medallion. Until I have that and start getting speccies, I'll stick at 62 so the ODS gets some use still. Just not sure if its 10k worth of use :) JBB I like for farming greenies and soloing, I've decided to keep it until I've got my coldain shawl done as I'm <br />
soloing lots of greens for that. <br />
<br />
I was going to get circlet of falinkan but with the affliction focus nerf its far less appealing than it used to be - plus its only for spells up to lvl 60.  <br />
<br />
Wicked Bone Atlatl - I now have a new uber upgrade to work for :) Sounds great, sounds expensive. Spell haste is great though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Circlet of Falinkan is still pretty good for its stats alone, regardless of the focus.</div></div><hr />
