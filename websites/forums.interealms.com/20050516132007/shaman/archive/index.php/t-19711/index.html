<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok I have seen many many reasons not to get GoD, and so far the only reason to GET it is for the new Cani which I wont see for decades so thats not even a reason.<br />
<br />
anyone give me any reason at all to purchase this expansion?<br />
<br />
also feel free to list your beefs with it so far.<br />
<br />
<br />
beef#1, the new tradeskill thingy, what a great idea, what limp dick implementation :( put in tons of combines that havent been used in years and put in almost 0 of the ones for sale in the baz 24/7...grats sony.   (havent checked my chanter yet, I am kinda in dread...I forsee all the silver combines and the only velium will be malchite and emerald)<br />
<br />
beef2, the spells. 3 spells right? one that is only good for soloing, one thats complete garbage and one that should have been in game 2 expansions ago and is beyond ultra rare...<br />
<br />
good things, the trade skill thing will get patched and then it will rule...wait I dont have to pay money for this feature I WIN!<br />
<br />
<br />
tell me there is hope for this expansion, or tell me to blow the cash on a rave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">More content.<br />
<br />
Thats about it. Seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i can't say i've bought an expansion yet based on the spells available ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">tradeskill thing you don't need GoD for. I guess the main reasons for buying the expansion are the same as every other expansion... new advancement options-aa, new class-beserker, and new zones/content. I myself am not buying it, my eq thirst has been quenched not because of GoD but that is to an extent a contributing factor.<br />
A lot of people will be content with this expansion, and there will be a few that won't. Eq carries on though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BluntDoctor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I will say this, I don't like the fact that I'm stuck with the default UI for the moment. I think going to 56k would be an easier change. Infinium isn't really supported anymore, so who knows how long a fix will take. I don't have the patience to do it myself at the moment.  I'm just whiny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dronach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i can't say i've bought an expansion yet based on the spells available ..<br />
<br />
Ditto. I've only bought them because I want to play with friends/guildies in the new zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">New zones were the only reason I bought it, some new spots to die in with friends. Spells look pretty worthless if we ignore the ancient that nobody will probably get. /rude SOE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dronach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">...some new spots to die in with friends.<br />
<br />
Hehe...The only reason I ever buy an expansion. I would probably be 65 by now if I didn't die so much  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Don33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sounds like a completely worthless expansion to me.Looks like SOE needs some new employees, these guys lack even a shred of creativity or at least the balls to put something different in this game for once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ummm..... nope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Haven't found a reason to buy it yet...and I have bought every other EQ expansion the day they came out in stores...at least that says something to me about this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like it.  It's fun, challenging.  The only real complaint that I have so far is the damn Crematory.  That flagging even can blow me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was quite impressed about the tradeskill window (and that is rare these days with SoE  :rolleyes: ). Seems at least one developer invested some thought and came up with a decent solution (experiment mode, stackability - hope it works hehe, favorite recipes ...).<br />
<br />
It will probably need some fine tuning (what new feature doesn't?), but it's nice so far.<br />
<br />
Question: one thing i missed regarding the missing recipes (or i am totally blind ;) ), is there a possibility to add 'own' new recipes to the recipe list? That would help the issue with incomplete recipe lists (and i assume, SoE wants to keep the more advanced/unusual recipes out of the default list).<br />
<br />
We said out part about spells, AAs already (ugh).<br />
<br />
Gameplay? Can't say much really, as the starter zones were perma trained (our cleric got like 15 rez requests in 10 minutes  :eek: ). Hopefully people will get used to the new zones quickly, currently it's a mess. Rampaging yard trash is a nice touch though, lol.<br />
<br />
Graphic? From what i saw, zones look ok, but nothing really spectacular.What the .... is up with lag in those zones? It's horrible (with all options down already). And not only for me but for all in my group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">As soon as you perform a succesfull combine of the recipie, you've learnt it, &amp; it will show up in your list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The recipes should be stored clientside, so give it a couple of days and you can probably download the 'big list' from eqtraders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I like it.  It's fun, challenging.  The only real complaint that I have so far is the damn Crematory.  That flagging even can blow me.<br />
<br />
When a 6k hp gear shaman says it challenging, there's little chance there is content for me ;)<br />
Only thing that surprised me is, it seems my whole guild didn't buy it either.  Not a single person in the new zones all night.  We actually hit a few little targets elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">tell me there is hope for this expansion, or tell me to blow the cash on a rave.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy the rave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">About the new tradeskill UI.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
one more time:<br />
<br />
1. Recipe's marked AutoLearn in the database will automatically show up when you have a skill &gt;= (trivial - 50) and you perform a search which the recipe matches.<br />
<br />
2. Searches can only return 100 recipes. If a recipe is not being found, and you know it's AutoLearn, then restrict your search by limiting the trivial's involved, or entering part of the name of the recipe (usually the name of the item created). Note that there's a text message displayed in chat when you hit 100 recipes on a search, telling you this.<br />
<br />
3. Recipe's marked CanLearn in the database will not show up in the recipe list until you perform one successful combine of that recipe in the old interface (experiment). After you have been notified that you've learned the recipe, you can then search for it in the new UI, and use it to perform combines. If you successfully perform a recipe combine in the old UI and don't get the &quot;you have learned&quot; message, then you either already have the recipe due to it being AutoLearn and within range of yoiur skill, or it is not marked CanLearn (for now, that may change later, of course, but then you'll have to &quot;learn&quot; it after it's changed).<br />
<br />
So, if you tried it in Experiment mode and were successful, but didn't learn it, then check again to see if you can search for it by name (it might be autolearn). if not, then you can't learn it right now.<br />
<br />
4. Marking said recipes AutoLearn and CanLearn is a work in progress. A lot of recipes can (and probably will) get marked as one or the other in the near future.<br />
<br />
5. All data about what recipes you &quot;know&quot; is stored on the server, as is the recipe data. You can't find it on your client side... it's not there.<br />
<br />
6. Some people want to switch the Right-click/Ctrl-right-click functionality of Tradeskill containers. Just click the &quot;Use CtrlRClick&quot; button on the new UI, and regular right-click will open the container in the old, bag-style; you'll have to Ctrl-right-click the bag to bring it up in the new UI.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. I won't be responding to requests for this recipe or that to be marked CanLearn/AutoLearn. I don't do the marking, I don't make the decisions. I would suggest compiling a list here on EQTraders somewhere and submitting it through Niami after a while.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have an alchemy skill of 175 ( soon to be 180) and the recipe for sow potions is NOT there. I have made them twice ( 2 bags of 10 doses ) and it's still not there. I tried all variations of what to call it and it's just not there. Almost ALL of the alchemy recipes are missing.  :confused: <br />
On the plus side, I love being able to make 200 dyes in 45 min instead of 3 hours of drag and drop. ( vials of prismatic dye) :D <br />
The downside to the tribute system is that the clock keeps counting whether you are sitting in bazaar or on a raid. And having to cancel them and run back to your home city is just not practical. They should have put a Tribute Master or 4 in PoK. :mad: <br />
That is all I played with till servers came down fo the emergency patch.:)<br />

I was online for an hour chatting with a former guildie and catching up and they were not in zone the whole time.  Yeah ... just what I want.  $30 for EverCR.<br />

I don't tradeskill, I almost never raid anymore, I'm not big on Gates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course there are still bugs, did you really think there wouldn't be?<br />
<br />
Of course there are things in the expansion that do not apply to you.  They make this game for 500,000+ people, not just you.<br />
<br />
And of course there are things here that you disagree with or think are stupid/wasteful/etc.  That is true of every expansion you bought, even the ones you loved!<br />
<br />
The truth is, if you're looking for things you don't like, you'll find them.  I guarantee it!  The good news is, the opposite is also true.  For me, I prefer to look for the things I do like.  So far, I've been finding them with ease.<br />
<br />
So much for trying to be objective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">ok having read the posts here, and adding what I have heard from guildies I will not be buying this expansion for the following reasons.<br />
<br />
Shaman are a class that needs some tweeking, we need more power in one place or another and this expansion actually makes us even WEAKER compared to other classes. of the aa's we get ScS is the only one thats worth crap.<br />
the spells...what the ****? a new solo spell that we dont need, a new slow that is weaker than one already in game and in use by ANOTHER class, and one that should have been in game with the release of ldon or pop.<br />
<br />
the fact that I am just not feeling the need to exp in zones where yard trash hits like AoW when I have a ton of existing content to choose from.<br />
<br />
I have put my money where my mouth is before, canceling accounts when sony/verant is on crack, in this case sony isnt getting anything for an expansion that only adds a few new zones. <br />
<br />
yes I realise not everyone feels this way, we are all welcome to our opinions and I am not trying to say youre a moron for getting the expansion, enjoy it if you will but for me this is a very poor excuse for an expansion.<br />
<br />
and yeah the tradeskill thing is broken for shaman, my chanter has no problem at all learning new (i.e. enchanted) recipies for the comon stuff but I cant get the potions people actually want to show up at all.</div></div><hr />

I'm fairly pleased that SoE didn't really blow something up this time in a major way. thats all for now.</div></div><hr />

 Don't feel too left out, all those with cultural skills didn't get flagged either.<br />
<br />
I was able to evaluate a large chunk of tradeskill products and assign &quot;CanLearn&quot; and &quot;AutoLearn&quot; flags to many of them. There are a bunch that have had flags added but weren't complete in time for data-lock for the Gates of Discord launch (shaman potions fall in this category). There are also some that I still have yet to evaluate (cultural falls into this category).<br />
<br />
You can expect another large chunk of changes to be made in the next live update -- Keep your eyes peeled on test as well, since the changes will make it there first.<br />
<br />
As always, feedback is good, keep it coming!<br />

Actually I can't really think of any other expansions where I had to look for a reason to buy it. This one I definitely do. And sadly enough I haven't found any.</div></div><hr />
