It obvoiusly won't affect me but for you guys it'll mean more n00bs running around. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think he means that they may be removing the flag requirements to get into Tier 2 PoP zones.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

NO not now that i got a succesfull trial <br />
rolling crying and laughting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If that means PoV / PoS who cares ... if it adds torment and cod that would suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personaly i think they should make the trials easierif its their goal to let people in PoV and PoS. Its just another dumbing down of the game if they just remove it, takes away the story and adventure of the whole game if people can just plow through. <br />
<br />
I dunno , on one hand i can remember how hard and frustrating it was, On the other hand i think i would have been cheated of a good experience and accomplishment if i hadnt done it.<br />
<br />
I hope they dont ...</div></div><hr />

Yup thats a awesome idea and frankly allowing us to get to 65 then have nothing to do but use that power for raiding and farming cash , i just dont understand it. I know veksar is on the horizon but im not a fan of underwater zones, doing phinny is just a pain in the @ss to a caster. <br />
<br />
I would like to see things like kith was, lots of low level but in the center i still thought twice about cutting through at 55. What they did to CT was too much , right now atleast on my server its truly dead accept for the occasional farming party , but if they had kept it low level at the entrances then 55+ level mobs in like the serwer or right inside 4c , now that would be cool , especialy cause you could level there at a low level then come back at a high level and exp in a familar zone. It would be like coming home, like in the old days when i could only go to halas when once in a while cause it was so far from where i was XPing from, its a good feeling to come back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Christ no.  Required level 62 at least if they take out trial requirement.  They're overcrowded and full of newbs as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The problem with CT at 60 its a much tougher zone than many planes zones, yet it yeilds much less exp.. as say, PoN(comparingly).  Rewards in loot are greater, but no one uses that as a detirment when selecting a spot anymore... its all about phat exp these days and pl'ing up fast as you can sadly.</div></div><hr />

That alone will make me doubt this will happen.  Add to it that this is the same type rumor created every few months about something similar (VP no longer needing a key,  ST not needing a key, VT not going to need a key, etc, etc, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wouldnt care about the keying errrr flag system if they would just add some more 60ish places to go. I havent been flagged and sitting in the mid 60's in the same zones gets boring. Course i'm about done with the side key quest for COD so with my luck wont need the key anymore heh.</div></div><hr />

That would be one cool zone upgrade.  Maybe make a few floors in the Spec Tower with some mean mobs.<br />

Oh, I miss the fun in oasis.</div></div><hr />

Since we all know that GMs don't actually exist, this means the whole post must be fiction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I for one would be kinda glad if this is true (considering I've been trying to get flagged in vain since PoP hit), but only as long as they stopped at Teir 2.  Removing requirements for Teir 3+ would really cause problems for those who were meant to be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I wish. Seems like I'm always grouped with one or two friends that aren't flagged. Would give us some more spots to exp with a range of 60-65 people. <br />
<br />
It isn't like T2 zones are all that hard compared to some of the old world spots. Tough mobs but but any idoit can pull singles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Weren't we supposed to be taking into account that if we raced to 65th, without a guild to attain flags, that we'd lose certain zones to hunt in ?  Personally, I enjoy some of the old world and have chosen to stay at 62nd and work on AA instead of limiting myself to just PoP for exp. To me it was obvious that anyone who raced to 65th and wasn't able to attain higher access to PoP zones was doomed to be exp hunting in first tier/second tier the rest of thier career.  Call me crazy....I'd hate to see this changed now because people leveled without looking ahead...<br />

<br />
I have been Frickin Amazed at how few people have seen PoP as a trap.  I'd honestly say its designed to make people feel like they've beaten the game so they go play SWG or EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">APRIL FOOLS!<br />
ahhaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I kind of wish this would be true just to see all the backlash :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This would be great. No more nights spent waiting in line to get<br />
guildies flagged. I'm already flagged, but we have some members in<br />
their upper 50's who haven't been yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">the flag system has been a distaster to the casual eq player. sure if you play eq 40 hours a week its not a problem to get past the trials, just sit in poj for weeks . real fun SOE. a level requirment to each plane would be better. but everyone bought the expansion and we should be able to explore each zone without being a full-time eq player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">IMO the trial system for PoV/S is perfect for Tier2.  CoD on the other hand is hosed up relatively speaking.<br />
<br />
The requirements to get into BoT are also not unreasonable, while forcing you to have a raid guild capable of killing MB/AD to get into HoH and Tactics is stupid.<br />
<br />
Sure they put quests in, but there should be a way without some long drawn out camp quest to get into CoD like there is for PoV/S.  Same goes for HoH and Tactics.  Put something in game that a couple groups can do as a mini/pickup raid and get access to those xp zones and all would be well.<br />
<br />
Torment... Why the hell would you want to go to Torment? :p  Trust me, you're not missing anything if you're not flagged for torment.  The whole zone sucks for xp and if it weren't for the flag you needed off Saryn I doubt anyone would go there more than once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Based entirely on the fact that I finally got trial flagged this weekend, this wouldn't surprise me a bit  :p</div></div><hr />
