<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kedin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye, decreased prices in herbs :b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Which herbs have gone down in price?  I wasn't aware of any.  :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Reeannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can we still combine various stat and aura potions?  When I first started alchemy, I printed out a chart of combinable potions (i.e., combine potion of purity with potion of null).  Well i tried to do this last week, only to find that they don't combine.<br />
<br />
This is what i did.  First, I bought each component for each of the two potions.  I combined to make one potion of purity and one potion of null.  I then combined those two potions and got the message that they can't be combined.<br />
<br />
Next, I bought each component for each of the two potions.  I combined all six components at once and got  the message that they can't be combined.<br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong with these combinations, or can we not combine these anymore?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Most stack - but can't be combined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can someone please post the following info:<br />
<br />
- Exact Trivial point on Hawk's Eye Tonic - reportedly 192<br />
- Are any other SoL potions now trivial at &lt;200<br />
- Trivial point for Quintessence of Knowledge<br />
- Herb cost for Quintessence of Knowledge<br />
- Names/Locs of herb vendors in PoK<br />
<br />
