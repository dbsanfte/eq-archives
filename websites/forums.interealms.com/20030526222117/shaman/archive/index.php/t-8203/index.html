<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samsonn Thunderfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am asking that all the Shaman 61-65 start flooding SONY with hate feedback and e-mails to get the parchment dops increased and to do something to eliminate the high nember of duplicate spells being awarded with parchment turn-in's.<br />
<br />
This is totally garbage the number of duplicate spells I know myself and other Shaman are getting. There has to be a way to eliminate the high number of duplicate spells and to increase the number of parchment drops.<br />
<br />
They say the squeaky wheel always gets the oil. Let's let SONY have it right up thier back sides and let them know, we the players are upset.<br />
<br />
I don't mind working for the spells but at this rate it will take 5 years to get a full spellbook. THIS IS GARBAGE!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i don't know if hate feedback is necessary but i too am very upset with the way the parchment turn is working. I have turned in 5 parchments and received 4 Agility of the Wrulan's. not only duplicate spells, but the most worthless of all spells. after talking to many other shaman, they seem to get this spell in abundance as well. why am i not getting True Spirit 4 out of 5 times? i don't believe the spell you get is truley random and i'm sure AotW and less beneficial spells have the highest probability to turn up as the reward spell. <br />
<br />
my main issue is that my friends i camp with insist i take the parchments until i get True Spirit. so by getting the same spell over and over all i am doing is wasting everybody time but.. uh Verants $12 a month... i'm sure VI was saying - make sure they don't get the spells they need so they have to either spend more time in game getting them or more time getting money to buy them.  of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally I think it's just pretty much random. I think the ethereal parchment drop rates are fine now. Spectrals and lvl 65 might be another story at this point but I think it's too early to tell. Personally AotW is one of 2 spells i'm missing and i seem to be getting anything but that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't have a problem with ethereal parchment drop rates, or even with duplicates. It's just luck of the draw like any other expansion, I don't expect my spells to be handed to me just for dinging.<br />
However-- the spectral and shadowy parchment drops are absolutely pathetic as is. I honestly cannot believe Verant wanted only the people in top tier guilds to EVER see a spell above 63.<br />
I would suspect this will probably/hopefully be changed in a month or two. Other expansions had drops adjusted post-release.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">3straight 15hour days in the planes with only one parchement drop...... i have a big problem with the etheral drop rate, maybe im just stupid but where do you all see these parchements drop? the only one i have gotten was off some yard trash rat in PoD that agro'd me on my way to a group</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">erm, 3 straight 15 hr days?<br />
<br />
I've been hunting PoP since week 2 of it being released, with days near 10 hours. still not one parchment. But I dont want it to change. It's like a set of trading cards. SOme are rarer than others, but its still possible to get dupes in them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The drop rates might be crap, but at least its crap for everyone and at least they fixxed it so you no longer get SLTW.  Honestly, I'm glad that its a relatively level field for all casters.  I hated how some peeps, especially mages, just expected you to have a full spell book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samsonn Thunderfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think some may take me wrong. I realize that the high level spells are supposed to be harder to obtain but I mean get real,sometimes up to 20 hours real play time until you get lucky enough for a parchment drop? This is insane. Then to top it off, you go to turn in the parchment and it's another worthless duplicate spell that everyone else has and you can't even trade or sell.<br />
There is basically speaking, no loot that drops off the mobs and if there is vendor loot the clerics hog it up and don't split it with the group. Clerics for the most part loot whores and greedy cheats.<br />
<br />
All the people who claim to be getting all the spell drops and for the most part and no duplicates, all I can say is your extremely lucky or just trying to BS everyone. The majority of Shaman I have talked to are in the same situation of many many dupes or basically no parchamnet drops to speak of.<br />
<br />
Since the PoP expansion went live I have only hunted the PoP zones. went from 61-65 and all I have spell wise is 2 parchment spells and 2 vendor bought spells. This is sad.<br />
<br />
I don't expect the spells to be handed to me on a silver platter. I will work for the spells but get serious concerning spell drops,  if your lucky in a whole day hunting then you lose the roll to another class? The drop rates really need to be increased and the number of dupes drastically reduced. I mean get serious level 61-65 and only 2 spells? This is playing for the most part on work days 6 hours daily and off days up to 12 hours a day. That is called working at trying to better my toon. That should speak for itself. Perhaps you don't mind paying for nothing but I chose to at least get something besides the daily frustration of getting nothing. How many others also noticed that no PP  drops off anything in PoP?<br />
<br />
Again, please join me in flooding SONY with daily /feedbacks and e-mails to perhaps get the drops increased and number of dupes reduced. We can all benefit from this. Also, the reason I spell SONY in caps is because that is the proper way of spelling the company name.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>coryn braun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pffttt.  Flood Sony with hate mail?  Please, don't be ridiculous.  If you really levelled from 61-65, and if you can really hunt for 15 hours a day for weeks at a time, and not see any parchment drops - then you're obviously in the wrong place.  <br />
   I've seen well over a dozen parchment drops, easy, if not more, and won 5 of them myself.  Yesterday alone, during a 4 hour spree in the factor killing golems (PoI) we had 3 ethereal drops.  Saw two more in 2 hours at the consorts in PoN.  If you're killing yard trash in the 1st tier zones, then no, you probably won't see many drops.  Why should you expect to see them on the lower-level mobs for these zones? <br />
<br />
And as far as duplicates go, maybe I'm just one of the lucky ones, but I haven't received a single dupe spell yet.  So far I have: Talisman of the Tribunal, Grummus, Ancestral Guard, the single-target STA spell, and Tnargs.<br />

<br />
There is much more reward and satisfaction when you earn a spell then when you just have a full spell book after a few hours of killing easy yard trash.<br />
<br />
And duplicates can be traded or sold to grant access to spells you did not get.<br />
<br />
No reason at all to be upset about the spell drops unless you prefer the other option when they only drop from 1 boss per expansion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe if the shamans of Norath could unite hehehehe sorry just funny we as a group can never unite on anything. Just look at our CH spell half the people were mad other have thought it was just fine, me personally think we got ripped off identical spells yet we get 1k less of a heal for same time/mana. The thread on that went all over the place truly showing the division amongst us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't see why in a Role Playing game why anyone gets high end spells using completely mindless grinding killing X mob to a factor of 10.  Forgive me for being naive and using worn out cliques ... but isn't Everyquest about questing?  These parchment drops are nothing more than a gatekeeping system to slow down completion of spellbooks.  Long ago VI could have created some system that involved our trainers in upgrading class spells ... which to me seemed logical.  Instead ... trainers are completely forgotten about lvl 30+ by VI ... and they continued with the easy to code but horrific mindless grinding system.   <br />
<br />
On the other hand ...  since the Rich always get richer ... the high end guild members are the ones that move the fastest throughout these expansions to the higher tiers ... picking up the most parchment drops along the way.   So I'm not surprised at all by those posting here of the stronger guilds commenting that parchment drops (ie spells) are working out fine for them.   <br />
<br />
But to be honest ... I don't have a problem with the current system of grinding for parchments for PoP spells.   What I have a problem with is that you can't turn the duplicate spells.   It would be easy to check a player flag (ie does x have spell y = NO - allow tradeback - Yes - disallow tradeback response).   That would at least allow people to finish out each set of spells.  Sure some will continue to loot parchments for the first turn in and then sell them for profit ... but at least those that need spells would not have 5 copies of the same spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aye the Rich get richer and high end guilds move fastest.<br />
<br />
A truer statement i have not found in this game.<br />
<br />
Problem is after the high end guilds get all the Best and find the easiest paths Verant / Sony nerfed everything, so guess what the normal players can NEVER hope to reach where the Higher Uber Guilds have gone on before them. Sure makes it a Dismal outlook for those of us coming after them.<br />
<br />
Sleepers Tomb is but one example of things being changed after the Highest Guilds were thru with them. Next will probably OS before i ever get a chance to get my level 60 spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please take a second to evaluate what you write before you post.<br />
1) look at the VT key quest, look at all the other stuff you gotta do to get shissar bane weaps for some content.  All this stuff eats gobbs of time and some of the ubers are still completing this stuff.  Where's the easy stuff?<br />
2) there are no cheat guides, no experienced friends to mooch info from.  Learning the pulls and mob tactics takes insane amounts of time and many more deaths than you might otherwise imagine.  Hardly easy.<br />
3) starting off you're still accumulating spells and gear and not everyone has it, so you can't be as bold as you will be after you do this 100 times.  More deaths, where's the ease?<br />
<br />
Spending weeks doing repeated CR isn't easy.  Looking at these guys now, yeah, they got it easier, but it wasn't that way for the first to pioneer these zones.<br />
<br />
Sleepers tomb was changed, big deal.  VI tried to incorporate dynamic content and now they're fixing the zone so its fun again and more people can go there.  The loot essentially wasn't changed all that much.  PA proccing gear still drops there with the same stats, how have you been robbed?<br />
<br />
Honestly, its a reality that the more time you commit to the game, the better the rewards.  There's nothing wrong with this and thats coming from a guy who doesn't want to raid often and plays 10-12 hours a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'd definitely say being on the leading edge has it's advantages and disadvantages.<br />
<br />
Sure you usually get exclusive access to the mob so you can kill them repeatedly (farm) with out competition. You can learn how to kill him with out having to worry about someone else killing him. Sometimes get higher drop rates or mobs that are later made more difficult.<br />
<br />
On the flip side you really have to learn how to kill things the hard way. No looking on up safehouse or some other board how much so and so hits for. Or that he spawns x number of adds at y point. Or spawns z number of mobs every time someone dies. What do you think it was like the first time Foh or AL or who ever went against seru or the emp and all the melees are getting immune msgs and not hitting at all. Or having to deal with killing a 2 mill hp mob like Emp that hted every couple minutes? Those bugs making things easy to kill and work the other way too. Cursed was tuned down several times before he reached a reasonably killable state and boy did it hurt before the tuning.<br />
<br />
As far as sleepers tomb goes verant admited it's mistake and retuned the zone now so late comers don't really suffer anything more than increase competition.<br />
<br />
Do the advantages out way the disadvantages? Probably. The bigger question is probably are you willing commit the time needed to get to that lvl and stay at that lvl?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Where did I say the UBER guilds has it EASY? dont put words into my mouth. What i said was they find the easiest ways to do things. Once they have that info or exp they can do as they wish with it, gratefully they tend to share it.<br />
<br />
What i meant and im not faulting the Uber guilds is that once they have torn thru and completed or discovered all that info and how they can take advantage of it, verant or now sony changed it. Its not their fault Sony are so quick to make the game harder and i can understand why Sony does it, a easy to master game ends up being a game completed or ended. Hence no cash if no one plays.<br />
<br />
Its basically that im jelious, sure no one said it you were being kind but yes of course i am who ever isn't when it comes to that is a liar. What mean is I would like to think that I would be able to reach where they are now some say in the future but it appears I never will. I play on average 20-30 hours a week, I dont take advantage of others to get ahead and I try to help those i see that need it. IF living for the game or taking advantage of others is what it takes to be Uber then I guess Im lucky to not be able to get there.</div></div><hr />
