<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Today, i go on a Vox raid, we kill her, and Hide drops, RBB, 2x Books, Bag, and Horn. So someone steals RBB, but then gives back. Then we start rolling, i get 31k out of 32k for the hide. I was so happy, then **** Tells you &quot;Ill trade the RBB i just got for the Hide MQ&quot; I say sure, (sweet, i can get a fungi tunic+ more!!!) We go to Rathe mounts, we get our needed jewerly, and he is dubi, no problem, /tell local 60 chanter, Comes, tashs, i malsiemant, no go. So i think &quot;Crap&quot;. So we have been sitting here for hte last 4 hours, thinking. We checked allkhazams, and everlore, and no one knows how to raise faction for evils. So i check alliance items, 1 item, 4 charges, but wait, it drops in icewell keep, the one guy says, i think i have that, but he doesn't. So i petition, waiting for a GM to talk to me (hahahahaha, i wish). Any ideas on how to get faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Isnt cloak droppable?  Why dont you complete the quest for it and just trade cloak for RBB...seems alot easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">...I would but my faction isn't high enough to complete the quest, thats why I'm so mad, and i just spent 8 hours trying to raise faction and it didn't move. You need indiffernetly to do quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grubbnubbnubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yubs, it a pain alrights, he a picky little dwarfs.<br />
I was hads a friend who was having da same issue, so I did what all gud Ogah's do when dey confronted wit a dwarf dat starts talkin smack, I killed him.<br />
Well afta lookin at what factions his gives and takes, it turns out he issa on da dwarf rogue faction.<br />
Miners Guild 219 me thinks, lemme dig up da SS I took inna bit anda tell ya.<br />
Anyways, iffa ya not KOS ta da runts, ya heads ta da Dwarf city, find da rogue guildleader, feed him bone chips, should do da jobs.<br />
Home dat helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grubbnubbnubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Right, here da faction bit fromma mah log:<br />
<br />
You crush Karam Dragonforge for 29 points of damage.<br />
You have slain Karam Dragonforge.<br />
Your Faction standing with Merchants of Kaladim got worse.<br />
Your Faction standing with Storm Guard got worse.<br />
Your Faction standing with Miners Guild 628 got better.<br />
Your Faction standing with Miners Guild 249 got worse.<br />
Your Faction standing with Kazon Stormhammer got worse.<br />
Karam Fragonforge says 'My comrades will avenge my death'<br />
<br />
So me wassa wrong, not 219, it 249, dunno da difference, ogahs dun bother wit da number stuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Talked with w GM, main faction is Merchants of Kaladim, meaning its going to take days to get the faction up. Also did /feback saying it should be droppable. Wow, days of work, just to get something thts inferior to a RBB(I know other items she drops are alos inferior, but this is around the same price, and takes a lot longer) and drops from the same mob :/ /sigh</div></div><hr />
