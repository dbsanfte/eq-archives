<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vusum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just had a very interesting and painful fight with my guild trying to take down XTC.  We where doing good with 36 people too till the mt goes ld the chch chain falls apart another ld.  Hate it when the mt and a chch cleric are 2 boxed.  One of our mez tank healers got a pop on him and bite it in a wonderful and painful way.  And we almost recovered at that point too which was kinda remarkable.  Needless to say it was a fun corpse run because we didn't get a cleric camped in time due to a bit of miscommunication.  What really sucked is that we had to let another guild who was in ssra doing the cursed cycle come in and pick up our mess and then rez us all back in.  So i was just wondering if you all could make me feel better by telling some nice nasty painful ugly raid stories.  The more colorful the action the better.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The time when we bound outside Naggy's lair so that if we died we would not have to fight naked through the LDCs if we wiped.  The raid got delayed a bit and just as we wiped to naggy, fire giants popped and it was deathloop time!<br />
<br />
For those who don't remember, back then naked corpses poofed in very short order, like 5 minutes.  So everyone took at least one unrezzed death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My first PoF raid, must be a couple of years ago now, some of the guild had been there before a few times, loads of people hadnt.  Despite clear instructions to STAND AND DIE if you got aggro a few people didnt listen and trained the safe spot.  Raid started at 7:00pm, we wiped at about 7:10pm, CR finished at 04:00am.  <br />
<br />
That was not what I would call a fun experience.<br />
<br />
Went back not long ago to help CR for a smallish guild with some friends in that was trying their first PoF raid, we did the CR with 1 group and took us bout 20 mins to clear enough mobs for them to be able to get in safely, rez and loot and get set up.  Its amazing how times change :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh, yeah, plane of Hate, without a doubt.  Similar to Foggy's experience, took about 6 hours to CR that, and we ended up begging help from a much larger guild, as the CR team piled corpse upon corpse.  The entertaining part was that I was bound next to KC along with a guild mage (I had every monk hunting his KC pipe charged to tell me if my uber jarsath legs dropped), we said what the hell and duoed lt blues for about 4 hours of the CR, buck naked.  Gotta love pet tanking.  Our mana pools were hell, but at least we had summoned jewelry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When Plane of fear was introduced...<br />
<br />
Wave after wave of naked people with summoned runeswords rushing the portal... spending hours naked rushing just to break the zone.  Hoping that we would break it soon so that the rezzing could begin.  Zonig in to a pile of corpses (LAG!!!) That was insane stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
Fear and Hate wipes from a few years ago have to be the most painful memories for me.  Several CR's lasting 4-5 hours each because of a bad break-in.  Pulling other guilds into the raid to assist (before /raid function) and then having their bodies added to your own.  Going in wearing backup armor, dying in that, and then going in with Phantom armor on.  Then just going in naked.  Finally just logging out happy that you got your gear, and not even that upset about the non-exp rezzes (yes, plural).  Those were hideous.  THEN you HAVE to raid the zone again the next day to get the 4-5 people who had to logout and wouldn't share acct information.  Ugh.  Then having the second day CR-raid wipe, and doing the whole thing over again for a few hours.<br />
<br />
That which doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.  I think I'm a better player now because of it, but it certainly didn't feel like a &quot;growing experience&quot; at the time. :p <br />
<br />
More recently, raiding Shei Vinitras in Akheva Ruins for the first time.  SV goes down, and then the raid wipes from the adds afterwards.  Nekkid people running from PoK to Akheva, scrambling for coffins &amp; trying to figure out a way to get people rezzed in place within the 30 minute timer.  <br />
<br />
We ended up running an &quot;Alive or Dead, BID NOW&quot; DKP auction for the 3 nice drops w/in about 2 minutes (sometimes a single auction would take that long on a normal raid) w/ 5 min left on the body.  Most of us didn't bid because we weren't sure we'd make it in time.  A Warrior ran her buns off nekkid training the whole zone from the IV prep steps to SV's corpse in order to loot the mantle w/ like 3 minutes left on the corpse timer.  Last loot was taken w/ 30 seconds left to go and the Orb rotted.  We had a nekkid orgy at the zoneline celebrating, and our rezzes (w/ exp) occurred shortly thereafter.  So that one ended sort of alright, though I didn't bid because my first nekkid rush failed due to triggering a trap.  Would have liked that Shadowed Storm Sphere.  /sigh<br />
<br />
Several flagging raids for Grummus and Behemoth I've seen succeed in killing the big mob, but nobody ended up with flags OR loot because of raid confusion &amp; lunacy.  My spouse and I went on a Grummus raid that failed on first try, succeeded on second, but the raid wiped after the big guy went down.  Six hours spent (horribly unorganized &amp; agonizing pickup raid) w/ no loot or flags given.  /shudder<br />
<br />
Feel better?<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Like the others, numerous planar breaks that ended up with naked CR efforts at the wee hours of the morning.  They were oddly fun.  <br />
<br />
Folks camping out to chat rooms and shooting the breeze while the FD types were dragging corpses to North Wall (back when that was considered the safe spot).  <br />
<br />
Then, when the monks died, the mood dimmed and everyone got a little glummer.  <br />
<br />
The Queen in Chardok lit us up a couple of times early on.  She used to be a beast.  Now she's easy.  But I do remember her blasting out that AE and simply obliterating everyone.  <br />
<br />
Our first foray into HoT.... we didn't do very well breaking the pit.  3 hours later we hadn't killed a single mob and then folks had to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wasn't a raid, but kinda...<br />
<br />
Back before any expansions had been released, there was a GM event in South Karana at the Aviaks. The GM was using a Gravity AE (never found out what it was) that threw everyone bloody miles away from him. Once all the aviaks had joined in the fight, there were about 40 people randomly fighting dozens of pissed off, buffed up Aviaks, with the GM in the middle just waiting for his chance.<br />
<br />
He cast the gravity spell and I swear I've never seen such an amazing thing - scores of characters flying through the air and landing with a crunch miles away - and dying from the damage of the fall alone.<br />
<br />
After a LONG run from Everfrost (pre PoK remember) the zone was covered with bodies. If you imagine drawing a circle that spreads out to the Southernmost spire, that was the killing field. I lagged to a crawl just trying to get there.<br />
<br />
I stayed to hunt there and people were doing corpse runs for many hours after that. Some of them were pissed at a good 3 hours of their night spent running from Freeport/wherever, most were in awe of the gravity spell and thought it was well worth the death.<br />
<br />
Someone DID kill the GM though. Never found out who or how.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PoFear back in the day broke me of raiding for a very long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My old guilds first attempt at Grummus, joint raid with a less then stellar guild. <br />
<br />
There were 3 attempts made. During which: <br />
- a Druid from the other guild evacs her entire group before we engage<br />
- some Clerics follow the SK that is outside of the raid (because we have a full 72 people) into Grummus' lair even though he was going in only to position and die<br />
- the MT was supposed to wait for the call to go in with the Clerics but jumped the gun, shouts charge to the Clerics, engages Grummus before he's even down the stairs<br />
- people start leaving because they're pissed off<br />
- 3rd attempt, we manage to get him positioned, sort of. The MT doesn't know how to pin (&quot;I couldn't hit him&quot;) so he reverse pins him. Yep, he pushes Grummus into a corner facing OUT. <br />
- Rogues start dropping due to riposts, our DPS royally sucks, the nasty dot goes off AGAIN hitting all of us, including the Clerics.<br />
<br />
In the end, Grummus goes down and we have about 4 Clerics, a Shaman, a Necro or 2 and a couple of Wizards left (give or take a soon to be corpse). Yay, we win!! No, we don't. Repops, no tanks left to tank, healers are dying from the dot while being told to rez in people for the flag. <br />
<br />
Melee are being rezzed in to help with adds that they didn't know about while also being told to run and hail for the flag. I think out of the 60 or so people left for that last attempt, 10 got flags, 9 of which died shortly thereafter, then they get thoroughly chastized for it and told to never speak of it because it isn't fair to the rest of the guild. <br />
<br />
Yep, definately one of my better raid memories  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Plane of Fear, definitely, back in the dark ages. Had 120 corpses in the zone (no hidecorpse command), and the lag was so bad a GM had to come despawn the zone finally so we could do CR. No, wasnt 120 people on the raid, just multiple bodies for most of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ahh that was fun... every level 50 (50 was the max then) on the server was at fear when it opened... hundreds of deaths to get the zone broken, then farms that went on until the next patch.  Then having to break it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">How about a story from last Friday?<br />
<br />
We had just zoned into the Ssraezhian Emperor's chambers for our first Emp attempt.  Exited the safe room and moved to the left corner to prep, acquiring pretargets and the like.<br />
<br />
Wizard casts an Eye to go out and fetch a pretarget, but he's being dualboxed and doesn't notice the fizzle.  Dualboxer turns back to the wizard's computer and hits the forward arrow key to move the eye forward... but moves the wizard forward instead.<br />
<br />
Blood and 8 snakes aggro on the wizard.<br />
<br />
Now, if he had just kept going, it might have turned out OK.  But he realized what was happening and either stopped or tried to come back, not sure which.  Now Blood and 8 snakes are in aggro range of the raid.<br />
<br />
We jumped in and gave it the old college try, despite having lost several CH clerics and other assorted classes in the first 30 seconds.  Blood went down - a little too fast, since tank mezzing him would have bought us time to rez/rebuff - and we got Emp to 60% or so before cornering him and losing half our tank force.  <br />
<br />
The ironic thing - the night before we had a practice run, and a different wizzy DID THE EXACT SAME THING.  It's now standard practice for wizards to SIT after casting Eyes.<br />
<br />
For the record - we took the Emperor on our second attempt four hours later, and took him again last Wednesday - with bane weapons not working.  Go go necro-&gt;cleric manafeed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Steelbear:  Yeah, our first attempt at PoF went just as bad.  We tried at one point to send in a wave of naked people, each buffed up with SoW, to try to get agro (not hard!) and then run south (I think, away from the fire wall).<br />
<br />
30 seconds later cleric started zoning in, one at a time, in hopes that the immediate area would be trained away so they could get to the west wall and camp out.<br />
<br />
That didn't work and after the 3rd or 4th death we had several people, myself included, who where no longer 46 and even able to zone in.  GM despawned &amp; summoned us in.  I forget how many hours we tried before we called the GM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The worst CR I ever had was after zoning into a zone I had never been before to see what it was like.  Got slammed quicker than a Denny's Grand Slam.<br />

<br />
Hehe that happened to me in West Commons at like level 7.  Happened to be a badass Orc right at zone.  I know now that it must have been trained there, but I sure thought that zone was hot death for a long time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nothing beats loosing your first corpse to the blackburrow tree trap back in the day....<br />
<br />
But otherwise yes, PoFear easily has the lead in the potential for horrific CR's back when it was a nasty zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>WittlesVaseel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Picture it, Fall, 2000. My guild was a small one, but allied with a couple of others. We had several good raids into Hate, 1 succesful raid into fear (with an uber guilds help with breakin and figured to try our hand at Fear. I had been on several Fear raids before, and thought I knew a thing or two. Not only that, but our break team was fully prepared to lose exp in the break.<br />
<br />
So, we buff up, and zone in with everyone. We had people from 46 to 60 on this, so I figured we had a good chance of only losing 50% of the raid on the break. We kill one mob and then we wipe. No biggie, Our break group was bound at Ogguk, and we had a mule standing by the fear portal with CR gear for us. We killed one more mob, but then started to get wicked bad aggro and had to keep evacing out. After 4 hours, we finally had the west wall clear enough to zone the rest of the raid in. What one young level 46 neglected to tell anyone though, was that he was now 45...and past the res timer. Gm came by and said he was SOL.<br />
<br />
That raid didn't go too swell, and my guilds' EQ chapter broke up and left to DAoC, although me a few of us stayed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For some reason when it comes to wipes, Chardok comes into my mind.  I don't exactly remember how many times we have wiped out trying to get our first cleric epic'd.  I think around the 6th night of trying we finally killed the King and got our cleric piece.  We got bold and cocky so we pulled the queen thinking she can't be any harder.  Hehe.. another wipe, another corpse summons run ...  It was so horrible back then since the corpse summoning alone added an extra hour into your raid night.<br />
<br />
Nowadays we just AE the place down it is so easy but the possibility of wiping everytime I come down there never leaves my mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">One time in NToV, we had just killed something in the area before Aaryonar (Eashen or Ikatiar I think). Aary wasn't up, so we decided we'd go kill Feshlak, Kreizenn, etc. Just as we hopped into Aaryonar's pit, he spawned. I saw him falling out of the sky on top of us (mobs do that when they spawn sometimes). Anyway, he mana dotted every single caster and healer and owned us (we couldn't hide from AE once we were in pit).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Vox.<br />
<br />
2+ years ago now, I think.<br />
<br />
We wiped, barely.<br />
<br />
I set my monk up to do CR's, and drag bodies out from underneath vox, with a mass drag. Simple, easy, safe.<br />
<br />
Those who are in the bearpits are told they can wait and we'll go down and get their bodies with 2 groups easily after the main group gets out.<br />
<br />
Well, its amazing how much chaos one idiot can cause.<br />
<br />
This wonderful other monk decided to get his high level druid and drag the bodies out of the bear pits.<br />
<br />
His plan?<br />
<br />
Drag them as far as he can running at full speed into Vox so she'll port him out of the zone.<br />
<br />
I asked him to stop after he killed me once.<br />
<br />
Petitioned him after he killed me the second time.<br />
<br />
Wondered how he didn't get banned when I sent in logs of him training Vox on me for the 17th time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I remember about 18 months ago getting a serious earful from a guy who had only been in our guild for a while, who had just dinged 46 and wanted to come to Fear....and our guild rule was 47 min. Heheh. I also remember that all our officers had hotkeys saying &quot;If you get agro, grab your ankles&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
I think my toughest, which will sound a bit lame, was wiping in droga, when about 15 of us raided there when we really were not quite high enough. We did not have a FD class, and in those days my divination sucked ass. I remember dragging corpses for what seemed like hours, using invis that lasted what seemed like seconds.....aaaah the happy memories.<br />
<br />
P.S. My guild killed the big wormy dude in the deep yesterday...wooty woot. Did it easy except for the MT dieing when it was at 4% haha</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Fear wipes are definitely highest on my list of Most hated experiences. Not having at least one decent safe spot in the zone for corpse sumonning or rezzing makes it particularly evil in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Plane of Fear and Hate.  Fear raid was exactly as described by another poster - we died except for 1 Monk (me level 50).  So in all my excitement to help I forget to camp to clear aggro. After about 30 minutes of feigning, moving etc I get toasted when FD fails twice in a row.<br />
<br />
NOW begins the really fun part. Guild is arguing how to best get bodies etc.  5+ hours later people are falling asleep at the computer. Eventually we get our corpses the next day. (Thanks AV of Xev iirc).<br />
<br />
Plane of Hate. We go up with 8 or so, all 58-60 except for 1 - level 48 guy.  Yep you guessed it, roamers make a bee line for him. We get crazy aggro and wipe. Well the fun ensues as the roamers continue to beat the crap out of us. At one point the cleric rezzes the LOWER level guy first while the higher level guys watch in dismay as both the rezzing Cleric and the lowbie get beat down.<br />
<br />
I eventually log in a bot cleric, get all rezzed BUT the bot cleric. (Yes he bit it too), and we make a 3rd foray back up to get him. <br />
<br />
Had a couple of 3 Boxers. Does not (imo) work on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Fear, without a doubt. It was before anyone had nice things such as Summon Corpse and the like. It was around a 7 hour corpse run, I don't know how many times the poor monks died trying to chain /corpse drag people to the clerics.<br />
<br />
As with Foggy, it all started when ONE person didn't stand and die, and brought the whole damn train to the safespot.<br />
<br />
To this day I have no intention of seeing PoF again. Hate I liked, haven't seen the revamped PoH though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">My personal worst was a PoF raid I ran.  I sent in 3 break groups to clear the zone in.  When making the groups I was low on clerics so I put a Fearbie cleric and her RL spouse (also a Fearbie) in the break crew.  They were generally good players and great people so I figured they'd do OK.  I had posted specifically on the guild boards about the &quot;if you get aggro, stand and die&quot; with the rest of my rules and tactics.  Well even a generally good player can fall to a moment of panic.  The cleric's invis drops and she draws aggro, but keeps running for the break ledge (she didn't know she had aggro at first).  Only about half a dozen mobs at this point so no big deal.  I had loaded 2 vetran 60's groups with experienced CC teams, clerics, MT's and evac.  However, her better half tries to be a hero and pulls most of the 6 off of her and starts running into the middle of the zone to lead them away from the crack team.  I believe the cleric tried to heal her hero at that point and that's what I think messed up aggro.  The train that followed when he died was truly amazing to see.  Within a couple minutes everyone was at their binds, not even one group was able to evac.  I was left with 3 fully suited groups of rookie 46-55 is players.  Team CR loaded in their second accounts, mostly 60 players, all experienced ... they wiped ... I forget how as that was the point of time I started drinking.  5 hours of CR later (not THAT bad) some allies from another guild saved our collective asses.  I learned that PoF experience was more important than levels when assigning groups and we never had another wipe on break in.<br />
<br />
The worst CR I've EVER seen (more precisely heard of was when my guild went to PoF before Velious was released.  Some dumbass fears an unsnared mob and the uglies came in from all over.  In guild chat you could hear them over the 36 hour CR (I was too low a lvl to participate).  Eventually, a couple paladins and a ranger began training away from the zone in while clerics zoned in, rezzed and ported parties out.  The &quot;train from zone in&quot; guys lost something like 6 levels collectively.</div></div><hr />

It was for my Kirn kill in the Hole.  Rumor was that you could jump in the pit in Paineel and land in the water inside of the Hole.  Regroup and then only kill up the ramp and into the tower - thus saving a lot of time.<br />
<br />
So anyway... we decide to give it a try.  About 15 or so of us.  Since it's my raid, I decide I'll go first.  So I get a fresh lev and run off the edge - heading for the waterfall.<br />
<br />
What I failed to do was tell everyone to wait for me.  So they all dutifully ran off the edge too... and we all missed the water....... every last one of us.<br />
<br />
In the moments where the game is starting to reload the next zone after you die, you know you can still see stuff moving around you.  All I saw was PLOP!  body falling... PLOP!  another... PLOP!  another one.... it was so sad it was funny.<br />
<br />
Luckily another group was nearby and was able to rez one of our clerics so that we could CR without coffins.  :)</div></div><hr />

Again.<br />
<br />
First 2 groups to do break in wipe when some go in uninvised, then stay to fight at the top of the hill.  Wipe.<br />
<br />
Second 2 groups go in, finish break, and perform CR's.  About 3 hours later, all groups in and killing of yard trash comences.<br />
<br />
No golums up.<br />
<br />
*kills self*<br />
<br />
Still no epic to this day, level 65.  Sad, sad, sad.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>KaerzanMM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">this might be off topic, but my favorite CR was when i just had turned about 13, and went to befallen, back when people in full banded, derv rings and a rune totem staff where hackers..I fell down the well in befallen, and could go down, but i couldn't get back up, and couldn't gate cause i was bound in like rivervale or something, and was scared of the forest..all in all..got someone to go loot my corpse..back in the day you could type /corpse and someone could loot your stuff..and the guy kept my cash :P what an ass lol,but it was still fun<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Well, i'd have to say my worst was a Fear raid, i was very young, 46 maybe 47, it was probably my 3rd or 4th raid, i was the lowest level (main) in my guild. I convinced my guild to raid fear for my tear. I resurves the plane thru the proper channels, had to wait a month and a half for our opening. <br />
<br />
the idea was that our monks and necros (i think necros, the guys with FD) would go in first and pull the mobs away from the portal in. we had 8 groups waiting to zone in, and about a group of FDers in fear.<br />
<br />
the plan was 2 mages (?) would invite 4 folks into group, 1 mage in fear at sfae camp, the other outside zone (he does the inviting), then we zone in 1 at a time and get CoTHed (?, teleport 1 groupmember to caster).<br />
<br />
after sitting in ferrot for ever (getting raid buffed), i finally get my invite into the group (about 8 groups have gone thru by now), so i'm expecting to zone into a cleared area, then get CoThed into camp, after all, i'm the lowest guy in the guild, (kinda like the guild mascot) about 40 others went before me, my guild is experienced in stuff like this, we've done on other raids.<br />
<br />
well, when i did zone, i was in the middle of about 20 guild members and about 15 mobs. being a relitive newbie on raids, i saw our MT (An Ogre warrior in Hot pink armor) slashing away at stuff, shot him a quick tell if he needed anything, his answer was quick and short, &quot;haste, regen, heal&quot;<br />
so i slap on my highest lvl haste and regen, then i start healing him, chat channels are busy as heck, stuff scrolling by too fast to read.<br />
so i just keep healing the MT as fast as i can, after all, my heal was only 500points at the time. needless to say he goes down in a couple of minutes. I notice the other melees starting to drop like flies now, being a newbie raider, expecting a safe trip to camp, i didn't have gate loaded, so i attemped to mem it and get the heck out of dodge. As soon as i sat down to mem it, i got teleported somewhere.<br />
<br />
I wandered around in a small circle for about 10 seconds and realized i was at the bottom of the hill that the portal in was on, so i head back to where i though m,y guild mates were. When i got there, nothing but corpses. There were still about 8-10 mobs hanging around, but for some reason they were ignoring me. i just stood there for about 30 seconds, then i decided i'd die with my guildmates right there at zone in (easy CR) so i run up to the nearest mod and attack it, i watch my health drop, and drop, at about 10% health i got teleported and instantly died.<br />
<br />
they managed to break in, and recover all corpses except mine. I didn't have a loc for it, they were unable to summon it. the whole Coth thing worked the second time around, in the mean time, they had all the FDer looking for my corpse but 1, he was pulling for the raid. the raid cleared the zone, but the bosses were not up, thanks to an inconsiderate guild that does not respect the servers reservation system. 4 hours later my corpse was found and i was able to loot it. so not tear  for me that day, still need it though.</div></div><hr />
