<br />
I had a 61monk, 60 monk, 57cleric, 60sk, 59ranger and myself and we were getting pretty crazy experience. <br />
<br />
Have to do a bit more testing, but most mobs were slowed easily in one cast without having to malo. The only ones I had to malo were the scavengers. Only had a few mobs that are resistant to snare but once we moved away from the entrance it was no longer a problem. <br />
<br />
Repops are fast, and you can either continue to move up slowly or pull to one spot for great exp. <br />

At any rate, since there are piles of junk lining either side of pathways through out the zone, it feels more like a dungeon crawl than an actual plane - this also affects tactics. <br />
<br />
Root/Mez/&quot;lulls&quot; are a must as the mobs like to pile atop each other. Mob appearance is almost Dawnshroud like occasionally as &quot;adds&quot; are the norm and should be expected.<br />
<br />
Mobs, for the most part, are slowable excepting the Ancient corroded unit (I think is it's tag), which resists roots &amp; slows. <br />
<br />
Expect to have to throw Cripple as well - the AC is quite high on these beasties, undoubtedly due to their &quot;natural armor&quot; - they are after all made of plate metal!<br />
<br />
Since the pop rate is as high as it is, it's worth traveling North (right from zone-in) or South (left from zone-in) back and forth. Don't dispair if another gorup crowds your space as we've found this to be beneficial during double/triple/quad pulls or the inadvertant training.<br />
<br />
Pathing is interesting in that once one of these automatons has a lock on aggro for a target, they tend to ignore anyone in their way, but like to walk up and down the pathways before locating their prey - don't know if this was intentional (defective control units) or inadvertant.<br />
<br />
It's worth purusing Allakzham's at this point, they're starting to amass some of the quests and mob info to the point where it's useful.<br />
<br />
Jot down carefully the &quot;shopping list&quot; the gnome at the windmill portal on PoT is looking for - this turns into xp, and in the case of &quot;clockwork shields&quot; also nets gems - we walked aways with at least a BD.</div></div><hr />

Head left from the zone in everytime.  You can pull mobs without adds all the way until you get to the rooms.  If you go right, all the mobs add and make life less pleasant.<br />
<br />
Kill the dragon xana with your guild to get into the factory.  In the factory, clockwork golems hit somewhere in the 400's and enrage but are excellent experience.  Found paladin and sk tanks to be the most efficient pullers, since their ability to gain and hold agro immediately are excellent in this situation.  Once you walk into the factory, we typically sit in the front left hand corner, and pull to the left hand hallway.  This way, groupmembers and the mob stay away from the entrance (the tins will agro through the door if you get to close to them).  Pulling tins on accident are an easy way to wipe.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the levels or whatever to hit up the factory, head down the left hand side with your group.  Like I said, each mob can be pulled single all the way down to the rooms.  There are only a few wanderers, mainly near the end of the run.  Once you move past maybe 20 sets of spawns, you'll come into a wide open space.  Stay on the right hand wall and you'll enter the &quot;rooms.&quot;  I seriously advise you to have a chanter, as it can get ugly at times with adds (mobs enrage and hit for almost as hard as factory mobs).<br />
<br />
Experience in this zone is excellent, but a slower is basically mandatory for any real experience gain.</div></div><hr />
