<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hit 200 last afternoon but had trouble getting another skill increase past 200.  Based on the formula we should be able to get 205.  Anyone else have any trouble or did I just have some bad luck?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what potions are you making to get skill increases after 180?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Started with Hawk's Eye but that became trivial eventually (I think at 190) then switched to Greater Concentration which is not trivial at 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've only made about 30-40 potions since hitting 200 so it wasn't a alot over all.  There were a few spots were I had to make 60ish potions before I got a skill increase.  <br />
<br />
I guess the only issue I have is that I have Brewing over 200 and had hoped that Alchemy would not have been affected by the 200 skill limit like the other tradeskills (which VI claims it isn't).  At least without spending AAskill points to get the last 5 points, which would be a waste imho....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What level are you? You'd have to be level 65 to get over 200 alchemy skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, I am level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cudes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hit 200, not gonna bother going past it though...<br />
<br />
blew 30k getting to 200 from 70 and i've blown enough plat on a crap ass skill.<br />
<br />
i'm level 65, did hawk potions then went to the +10 resist all, cheaper than greater conc potions... still not trivial at 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd just haveto ask.. WHY?<br />
<br />
Did we get anything worth mentioning for potions in PoP?? I got my Alchemy up to 175 a while ago and didnt see anything worth making other than sow potions. I dont even say to make pp or anything, but uses v price. On top of that at most times when I hunt in PoP all 15 buff slots are filled including bard songs...<br />
<br />
I did make port potions for friends sometimes but now they are worthless since PoK takes you anywhere... almost.<br />
<br />
/rant off :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did see a rumor on Alakazahm that negative stats and skill cap have been removed on test, but that remains to be seen, If all potions still stack with spells there may be some hope. I personally have given up on Alchemy except for personal use, why not Verant/SOE has why shouldn't I abandon the Skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Until I see something worthwhile to do with Alchemy why would I want to waste the platinum on Alchemy?<br />
<br />
I'll sit at 180 until it's worth advancing, then I will max it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Terabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Skill Cap on Alchemy is 200, it was 200 when they revamped it the second time but 180 was highest you could go with the formula involved, now you cna go over lvl 60 and it will sit at 200 i wouldnt waste time or money going past 200 if you happen to proove me wrong then cool im wrong but far as i know 200 is highest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">At this point, I would have to agree that 200 is the max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why is 200 the max?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I really don't know, maybe Terabar can fill us in.  Based on the formula that is used for Alchemy skill levels 205 would have been the max skill level at 65.<br />
<br />
I don't really go out of my way to make potions, but I still have a few guild members that like to have the extra mana/resists  <br />
<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I use to make ds potions all the time, but haven't for several months.  They don't take a high skill to make though.  Maybe there will be upgrades in addition to any other revamps to other potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cudes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">my solo camp was taken and i didn't feel like grinding and i needed something to do... thats why i raised skill to 200...<br />
<br />
BTW mystical amplitude works like ****.  I think its bugged :(.  I'd make the potions more often if i saw a greater difference in the effectiveniss and at this point, it just costs too much plat to do any kinda of significant testing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I, too, will wait at 180 till I see a reason to skill up.<br />
<br />
I have other things to blow 30k on... Torpor, Girdle of Mithandrael... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hardiman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I often sell port potions to tanks in my guild at cost.  Even with the new PoK ports tanks can still get stuck in certain zones, especially if they go link-dead at a raid and can't log on for several hours and are in a safe spot.  My friend has used my potions to port out of ToV, Akheva Ruins (deep in), etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Port potions trivial at 170.<br />
<br />
So why skill up beyond 180?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ragathor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I tried last night to get past 200 as well before reading this though.  I came here to see if anyone else has gone to 200 and made it past.  I made over 250 combines of a non-trivial potion (Resist Potions) cant think of name but the one that gives +10 to all resists.  Anyways didnt get past 200.  Are we bugged?  And yes I am level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thorondor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I had no problem zipping up to 200 doing +10 resist potions, but nothing since even after around another 100 non-trivial combines so I have to assume there is a 200 cap until I see different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I suggest /bug if you're stuck at 200.<br />
<br />
They fixed a bug with tinkering incorrectly capping at 200 for certain gnome classes in a recent patch, and there might be the same problem with alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Or maybe it is by design?<br />
<br />
I hear the Potion of Mystical Infusion is not trivial at 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shanelle Heartogold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I may be insane... but I've got Alchemy up to 175 now.  I keep hoping that a miracle will occurr and VI will actually make Alchemy USEFUL again... thereby making me RICH beyond my wildest dreams!  ROFL  Yeah... right... but it doesn't hurt to DREAM!  hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Unfortunately, I've always been a poor shaman.  So I never spent any time training alchemy past skill 70 (/grins) plus never had the money. <br />
<br />
Besides sow potions for people under 50, I see no reason or worth to train any higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jasak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Personally, I will go higher so I can make the higher level potions that my guild will use. There are some mobs and some dungeons where the added stats or resists or regen or mana that a potion gives is really worth it.<br />
<br />
I will never recoup my plat on getting to what ever the max cap is. But then again, the potions I make for the guild really help sometimes. They are especially nice now that the Negative Stats have been removed.<br />
<br />
I think of it this way. With a college education a person should make more than the person without the college ecudation. Let's say the added income is $4,000.00 per year. How many years will it take to remake the $75,000.00 I spent on a college degree. <br />
<br />
You must also realize that a higher level alchemist can make potions more cheaply because he has fewer failures. So he can cut his price. Should he keep his prices higher so you can make sales at your higher price or should he price his product at what sells the fastest?<br />
<br />
It is amazing how many people live in an economy yet never understand how it works. When you go shopping for a new digital camera do you look to pay more to be fair to all the people involved in making that camera or do you go for the cheapest camera with the features you want?</div></div><hr />
