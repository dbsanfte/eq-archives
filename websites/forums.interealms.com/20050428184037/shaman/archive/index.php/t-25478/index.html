<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive posted before that my billing for EQ1 ends in March and after that no more online games for me.<br />
No ive not cancelled EQ because of what its turned into i still love EQ the game just jaded with sitting in front of a PC i think.<br />
<br />
Anyway just recently ive taken to looking at the WoW site and reading posts here more and more.<br />
I also sent an E Mail to Blizzard about being in Germany do i have to play on a German server etc etc.To which i recieved a prompt and most helpful reply.<br />
Its even got so far that my cursor is hovering over the preorder button on Amazon.de :(<br />
The more i read about WoW the more it seems to be the perfect fit for me. ie casual player who plays in 1 or 2 hour chunks.<br />
Please help me here and talk me out of this :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aammon Aammonite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have given in to the pull.  Buying a copy of WoW tonight.  High end raiding in EQ is the SUCK.  Going to go Horde PVP.  Looking for recommendations on servers if anyone has any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Be careful, I just got into the Euro open Beta and the download was finished when I made it back home at 5am (should have been home at 9pm but serious work probs) and still ended up playing for an hour. Lots of fun to be had, plus so many quests to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you can find a group of cool people to play with regularly to do dungeons you will be hooked on Warcrack for sure. Dungeons + Teamspeak = &quot;Holy crap, what time is it? It's that late!?!?! ARGH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Stick with EQ1- your burnout will ensure that you limit your playtime. WoW on the other hand...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Think I ned a better mic, teamspeak just doesn't sound good, I don't to other people at least. Be cool if we got it working.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Belinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">DONT BUY IT. STAY AWAY.<br />
The warning has been given.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you, by chance, using a USB headset Mill?  I've found them to be notoriously weak in the mic sensitivity department.  (Our guild uses TS all the time).</div></div><hr />

I had this problem last week, and it turned out to be due to my onboard sound being under par, I installed an old creative labs soundblaster and now am fully functioning with teamspeak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>biran808</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I recommend WoW to you if you can only play in spurts. It is Great. I just had a baby and while playing I can easyly walk away and return with no great loss to answer baby's crys. If you die you are only out five min while you walk to your body for a free rez with no penalites. I could not do that in eq. If I went afk for a baby emergency I risked in some cases a CR that could take hours. I would have to get a cleric maybe a necro to summon me. Then lose xp and have neg effects from the rez. NO THANKS! I will stick to the WoW way of things. <br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with the EQ way of it. It makes the game fun in its own way. But for a parent I think WoW is easyer. <br />
<br />
Even in a instance you can just tell your group need a afk for a few. In EQ the LDON's were timed. Even if people did not say it you know they were grumbleing about you going afk. Agian timed LDON was fun. It was just not parent friendly.</div></div><hr />
