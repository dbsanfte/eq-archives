<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hit warmly and got IHV sleeeves 2 weeks ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, 2 weeks later, I have finaly gotten max faction with RS, Loyalist, and Children.<br />
<br />
Now to go experiment and see how many of them want a new cat pelt LOL<br />
<br />
Has anyone found any purpose to the other factions in OOW yet?<br />
<br />
Did a few (non exhaustive) searches, didn't see anythgin..<br />
<br />
Burt mostly importantly, ,NO MORE FACTIONING!!!!<br />
Wuzzah!<br />
<br />
(unless there's an overlord mata muram quest.... ugh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did some searching too (allaz, caster's realm, google and about 20 different sites for that) and found nothing for any reasons for any factions other than Loyalist (for armor quests).  Maybe its just to bring back some of the old feel of the game when factions were important (like Dragons Vs Giants (vs Dwarves).  Although with topped out RS faction I am still VERY KoS in there, so not sure if there is any real use to it, Oh well....I tried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmm,, might need RS facrtion to get the citadel of anguish quest thing. I forget where she's at, but I have 5 of the rings ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Congrats on your sporty new sleeves! :cool: Alas, they're only a dream for me ... three weeks of off-and-on faction work, and I'm STILL dubious. I need to buckle down and really get to work on it; I'm after the sleeves and a new necklace (BA5!). /sigh ... as one of my guild mates said the other night: &quot;Faction is teh debil.&quot;<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/agree Tord<br />
I was trying to get that same necklace,, need 2 more chains. <br />
<br />
The sleeves are defintly nice, since I was still wearing PoP ornate ;)<br />
<br />
Where is everyone factioning anyways? I've been doing DH farming gear for guildies,, faction came happily as an accident.<br />
No way in hades i'd've ever gotten the faction otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The sleeves won't be much of an upgrade HP/mana wise (perhaps even a slight downgrade) but that healing focus more than makes up for it. Besides, there's an aug slot. ;)<br />
<br />
There's a thread around here somewhere of good faction places, I think. Or maybe that's just a rune-farming thread and I'm going nuts. But the search function is not working today on this computer (on ANY website, lol, methinks this computer has some serious issues). Some folks in my guild spent awhile mass-killing in Bloodfields, and others are factioning in Noble's Causeway over near Menlo and out toward Walls of Slaughter. I've gotten some faction work done in Muramite Proving Grounds (out near where the mobs are all level 70 and see invis). Few mobs in Riftseeker's seem to give Loyalist faction bumps (which really stinks, because I love exp'ing in that zone). There are greenies in Dranik's Scar to be killed.<br />
<br />
Any other good faction spots escape me ... it's Friday and my brain is fried.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've been taking whatever groups come along (lots of them lately), MPG/WoS and occasionally in NC. If I only have a few minutes, or am in /lfg mode, I kill ukuns, nocs, and kyvs in the SW corner of DS, at that castle thingy, trying for my dull stone of sorrow (never saw one caming the ukun skins, unfortunately). I figure that'll be a good second aug for my catstick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Faction work sucks.  Asside from a week in RCoD at the Murks and a week or 3 before the Rune nerf of early oct Ive been hitting mobs that give Loyalist faction.  STILL dubious.  3 levels (almost 69 now) and 18 AA later and Im still sar from getting the faction.  Ive got the parts for all the armors except the Dragorn City Ember for the legs collecting dust in the bank.  Much hate for low faction hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fawlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That reminds me... lemme log in and kill some stuff *cry*</div></div><hr />

<br />
4 weeks and counting ---- still dubious.<br />

What is this BA5 necklace you guys are raving about?!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ribeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">After grinding to warmly and helping a few friends grind up to warmly, I think I know the best way to get faction.<br />
<br />
You need to get a full group (or almost full)...just sit in DS and /ooc that you are doing a faction group and I've never had a problem finding takers.<br />
<br />
Go to the fort that blocks the NC zone.  Go up the ramp that goes on top of the fort wall.  Make sure you have dps and a healer (even a half-assed shaman healing worked for us ;) )...then slaughter back and forth on the wall, working from one end to the other.  Went from kindly to warmly in about 2 hours....just slaughtering back and forth.  Every mob up there gives a faction bump.<br />
<br />
Also, xp is better here than in NC.  All the mobs are light blue, but they die so fast that you get better xp ;)<br />
<br />
Thats my advice =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Go to the fort that blocks the NC zone ... Also, xp is better here than in NC.<br />
<br />
Heh, you confused me. You say go to a fort that blocks NC zone and then say exp. is better in NC than in ... NC. :p Do you mean the fort/wall that blocks Bloodfields zone, or the fort/wall in WOS?<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />

He is referring to the fort in DS that is at the NC zone line.  As you enter gate, before going into the tunnel to NC, look east.  There is a ramp that leads up to the top of the wall.  Mostly LB at 67 with some greenies.   They fall fast.  <br />
<br />
With a group of 3, I was on pace to get an AA in about 90 minutes.  Not bad, when combined with the faction hits.<br />

edit for spelling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ohhh, I see! Thanks Moj! Sounds like something I need to try tonight.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What I did is wait until the server is the most populated.  Say 8pm on a Friday or mid day Sunday. Which ever the case may be.  Then take your lowest unresistable disease debuff.  Not sure which name it is off hand.  I used MD myself but it your choice.  Then run around to each group fighting and tag their mob.  Dont bother taging the ones that dont give DL faction obviously.  You could also cast a low heal on the MA if thats better mana wise for you.  Just as long as you get the hit you are golden.  Do this while LFG and you can actually make progress on faction while waiting around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I noticed the Fire pit instance had mobs thate gave good faction.  Has anyone tried using a levle 52 toon to get an expedition and then just running through slaughtering stuff?  How does this compare with other methods?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you're going to get an instance just for faction, why not just kill stuff in Dranik's Scar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">from my understanding, you get one hit per kill, and it does not matter if it's greenies or blues or yellow cons.<br />
<br />
and I think drop rate on intersting loot is nerfed in DH instances.<br />
You'd be better of lawnmowing (or repeatedly recasting PuP) in DS.<br />
<br />
My guild farmed a couple of those rare jaded shields of pain for people in the guild, and I suppose that's one reason my factio got so nice,, I was pretty dedicated towards everyone i guild having a cockroach butt on their arms ~_^</div></div><hr />
