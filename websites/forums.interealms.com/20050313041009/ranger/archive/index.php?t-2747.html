<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladas Sindarin</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I was able to shoot and hit targets that were nearly a straight down shot.  I still got the too high/low message on a couple targets that were about 10-15 degrees below my horizon, but on targets that were 60-80 degrees below, I was able to hit.  Anyone else notice this last night?<br />
<br />
Also, and I'm not sure if this is because of the NPCs geometry, but Dracoliche last night was hitting me with melee, but I was able to continue shooting him with arrows... at point blank range.  It could just be that his &quot;sweet spot&quot; is so far back on his body it was outside the &quot;too close&quot; boundary, but it was certainly interesting.</div></div><hr />

It isn't new, just a feature of the monster geometry and the enormous melee range on dragon-class monsters.</div></div><hr />
