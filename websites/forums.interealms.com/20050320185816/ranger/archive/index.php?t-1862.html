<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yzen Danek</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they're going to have to be very careful with this one. In both UO and DAoC, item decay is a huge hassle. Actually, because of item decay, I never even used my best stuff in UO; I was always waiting for that 'perfect opportunity' to bust my massive silver heavy crossbow of vanquishing out of my bank.<br />
<br />
In DAoC, the problem is that use of items is extremely limited because the time between when you become able to get reasonable use out of an item and when it gets too low for you is extraordinarily short. I don't think Mythic understands how attached some people are to gear. Part of what has made EQ so tremendously popular has been pride of ownership. The chance at extremely rare items is a powerful motivating factor in playing EQ. I doubt anyone ever quit a game because their items never wore out, but many have because their items did.<br />
<br />
That being said, the EQ economy could be in much better shape. I think that a nice system could be designed that had some aspects of the old (like no item decay) and still have some outlets to keep the economy from deflating so rapidly.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think this combination of factors would work well:<br />
<br />
1. Have vendors buy items at prices that reflect the level of the mob that dropped the item and its rarity. If an item is the rare drop from a level 55 mob, it should sell to vendors for an amount commensurate with those facts. This puts a lower limit on how much that item would ever sell to players for. <br />
<br />
2. Put in a large number of money-sinks, to suck up all the extra platinum. There should be tons of purchaseable, expendable items in the game. Allow people to trade platinum for time, which is the very basis of economics. If you give people heal potions of varying qualities that cost 5 times as much as the average value of loot for their level, in exchange for enough healing to take them to full, and make it take 20 seconds to use, you let people trade their time for their in-game money. These potions can be both vendor sold and player sold, with the vendor type being moderately more expensive, as long as at some point currency leaves the game.<br />
<br />
3. Allow magic items to be salvaged for their components for use in tradeskills. Instead of selling my 10 centi shortswords to vendors or lower level players, it migth be worthwhile for me to give them to a skilled dwarven smith, who would melt them down to produce 10 units of moderately high-quality enchanted metal. He could then craft those units of metal into, say, a two-handed axe. The quality of that axe would be based upon the skill of the smith and the quality of the metal he was working with. Reaching the highest levels as a smith would require the destruction of a significant number of magic items. <br />
<br />
4. No item decay. =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durgen</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Item decay can be a good money sink.  And money sinks can be good for a game economy.  EQ's economy suffers from massive deflation on items as availability increases.   <br />
<br />
But I agree that the DAoC system is lacking.  They use a level range system that limits the use of nearly all items.  I personally don’t like it.  And I personally don’t feel its in EQ’s best interest to copy that kind of system.  <br />
<br />
I feel its ok and reasonable for players to may for item upkeep or else suffer the degradation of use.  Imposing minimum levels for items also isn’t unreasonable.  But imposing item breakage to the point its unrepairable and or item maximums is bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having to seek out a high end smith to repair your Badass Axe of Kicking Ass is fine and good idea.  Losing your Badass Axe of Kicking Ass eventually because you used it sucks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Addressing each of the suggestions:<br />
<br />
1.  I'm not sure I agree completely with this.  It doesn't really allow them to play with the rewards for a particular encounter very well if all the drops always sell for the same amount.  And how do you set the value?  This would introduce a large influx of plat into the economy as it's basically a 'time spent camping mob = plat' equation.  You camp a mob, get drops, sell them to vendor even if a PC wouldn't buy it, get good pp.  <br />
<br />
2.  The money sinks idea could work I think, if it's done correctly.  But your suggestion about he potions worries me.  Take for example a player who's got lots of PP, and buys lots of potions.  That player basically becomes a 1 person group. They have little to no need for any supporting classes.  The amount and type of usable items in the game has a direct impact on class balance and has to be addressed carefully.<br />
<br />
3.  This idea I like.  It would be cool if a good weapon like a Centi Long sword was actually more valuable to be melted down and used for smithing, than it is to use in combat.  Of course the whole tradeskill engine of EQ has problems that have to be addressed.  <br />
<br />
Its an issue of supply and demand.  If there is a demand, and someone can gain from supplying the demand, then the supply will occur.  Thus the whole problem of continually respawning mobs always dropping the exact same items on a reoccuring basis continually creates supply.  Give enough time supply exceeds demand, and value of the item is equal to how much the vendor will pay.  tada mudflation.  <br />
<br />
Item decay could be implemented in a manner which would help this problem I think, but I agree it has to be done better than DAoC did it.<br />
<br />
The issue of gear that 'cons' or adjusts with your level, is pretty much a seperate one.  I liked that DAoC made red con gear inefficient to use, and the way that EQ is scaling the effects of the weapon with the users level.  I didn't like that DAoC made it so that a green weapon was useless.<br />
<br />
Maybe instead of gradually getting worse, a weapon could stay the same effectiveness until it just 'breaks'.  That keeps people from feeling like they have to replace their gear all the time because it's 80% less effective as it was when they got it... <br />
<br />
It's a tough problem to fix, no doubt about that.</div></div><hr />

It only makes sense... Think of how many items have become so abundant that they've become utterly worthless.<br />
<br />
I'm not at all against item decay as long as it takes quite a while to disappear.  Dark Age of Camelot's decay was a little bit too fast for my taste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd be less against item decay if you could designate one or two items in your inventory as &quot;unbreakable&quot;.  That way you could protect those items that you are really attached to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A)  Gather at least 30 of your high level friends to wait their turn to kill Uber Mob and get 1 or 2  Uber Swords for 1 or 2 out of the 30.  Or wait on ultra rare spawn and get his ultra rare drop of ultra good axe... which is obsolete in a few months when an expansion comes out or new ultra axe is found.<br />
<br />
B)  Have kick ass swords and armor and spells drop more frequently in single group camps... but.. they decay and eventually you need to re-equip.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draeven</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wholly wholly dislike the idea of item breakage... I don't mind Item decay one bit, but breakage.. How would you feel if your Short Sword of Morrin, Swiftwind, (Insert item of sentimental value here) just up and broke?  If an item decayed past a certain point, it became inneffective to use, until you repaired it, that's fine.  Have them repairably only by players with a smithing skill, requiring some drop material of magic quality to repair it.  Item breakage would be the one thing that would definatly turn me off of EQ2, no matter how good a game it is otherwise.<br />
<br />
As for level restrictions?  I don't mind having a low level limit, but DAoC's upper level limit is just frustrating.  It's not enough that items become obsolete due to mob strength, but to have them further become useless due to some seemingly abitrary level of the item, doesn't seem right to me.<br />
<br />
And I agree, DAoC's range is to narrow, you get an item, and it's near useless within a few levels.<br />
<br />
Edit: Short Sword of Morrin? I'm showing my age o.o;;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yzen Danek</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If item decay doesn't lead to item loss, it serves no purpose in terms of keeping the economy from deflating. It just takes a bit of time to have your guild smith sharpen all your weapons, and money for repair materials, which is a money sink, but not an item sink. If the goal is to have people interact more with smiths, that's all fine and good, but unless items are leaving the game you will always end up with the EQ economy we have right now.<br />
<br />
With that said, I hate the idea of item decay for EQ. EQ's strongest point compared to any other game out there is the opportunies it presents to assemble massive raids to go after items of unparallelled quality. You can't add item decay to the current system; it takes way too long to get high-end items for decay to be feasible, and you can't make the items more common, because their rarity is what keeps people coming back night after night. In other words, you can't add item decay without changing the loot system, and the loot system is what makes Everquest work. You need ubers taking out the highest end mobs and posting their accomplishments on the boards to motivate the just-sub-ubers to take it up a notch, and you need the just-sub-ubers posting their stories to motivate middle-levels, and so on. Without those huge goals to strive for, the hack and slash will wear out very fast. Other games use PvP as the endgame, because there is only so much PvE content to experience. Everquest does not; it is a PvE game from the ground up, with an ever-advancing set of goals that require larger and larger numbers of people. This formula makes it work. No one in the game has all the best loot, and it seems we will continue playing until we do.<br />
<br />
To make an analogy relating item decay to current Everquest using a rhetorical question: why do people hate dying so much and losing their level? I mean, after all, they did get the level; they accomplished the goal, it's just that later events took that away from them. Well, that is exactly what item decay is like. You assembled the people, you killed the impossible mob, you got the reward, and now, some time later, you no longer have that reward, and have to do it again. If you love dying and losing your level because it gives you the opportunity to regain it again, then you will probably love item decay as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krux</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a good mix would be in order. I think items should have a quality level. The Higher the quality then the less likely they will decay. <br />
<br />
If I get a Rusty sword off of a orc pawn i would expect it to decay over time.. If that sword had some magical properties I would think it would last longer.<br />
<br />
I also agree that players should be able to upkeep the items.. A tradeskill like weaponsmith for example. <br />
<br />
In reality you can keep a well crafted weapon at a high quality level with good care. <br />
<br />
You can take a well crafted weapon that had been previously neglected and restore it to a quality below it's original making.<br />
<br />
You can not take a weapon that was poorly made and apply care to it and expect a better weapon out of it.. (With a High weaponsmith skill.. you might have a chance). <br />
<br />
You should be able to take a weapon have it enchanted to get a better weapon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RangerKeaianea</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't forget that the quality of the item in DAoC affected it's decay as well.  If you have an item that was like 100% quality, condition and durability, you could repair it at like 98% Dur and it would never degrade.  My 40 Warden had a Crescent Reaver, but any craftsperson could repair that item and it would not decay through the repair.  I personally liked DAoC's item decay.  Of course, being a Warden, I was not beating on stuff all the time.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yzen Danek</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;it's basically a 'time spent camping mob = plat' equation. &quot;<br />
<br />
Restated: (Time = Money). You are correct, that is the basis of all economics. There is no commodity in this world except time, and currency was invented as a tradeable medium for it. If you want to create a balanced economic system in a computer game, you start first with this very basic tenet. Efficiency is another thing altogether, and creates the niches for people to be good at things, but what you want in an economic simulation is for people to be able to turn their time into virtual money, and spend their virtual money to save time.<br />
<br />
This is already the way the EQ system works, it's just poorly distributed. In a perfect system, the risk/reward would be evenly distributed, so that better items never drop from easier encounters. But, we know it doesn't work out that way, in part because it's an incredibly difficult job to keep populating the world with new items that all have utility to the people who would be likely to be challenged by that encounter. The solutions I posted above let you always gain a minimum amount of utility from anything you loot, and create entire new economies for the materials you can get from destroying items and for the items you can buy from selling them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Treeze</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see the logic behind item decay. Items like weapons and armor (tailored and smithed) should be able to be sharpened and/or repaired by smiths or tailors. This could be a great boost to those tradeskills. There could also be merchants that you can turn the item into and get it repaired for a fee.<br />
<br />
However, I would like to see some high-lvl no-drop weapons have no decay whatsoever as part of their inherit magical abilities.<br />
<br />
They'll definitely have to be careful on the rate of decay as well. Weapons decayed way too fast for me in Diablo. This could really be a huge turn-off for people - especially a player-base that isn't used to item decay at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarlyn</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with quality-scaled decay periods is that new players have to replace their items more often since lower level players will be finding lower quality items. I would think the opposite is more ideal since older players will have some resources to spend on replacement/repair.<br />
<br />
I never played DAoC and I never will because of the item level restrictions. They only serve to homogenize characters of a certain level. If the game world limits everyone's relative power ina narow band, there is no real point in progressing. The lewt mania is EQ can be sickening, yes. But given that every male human ranger in Ivy will look the same, there needs to be loot variety for individuality. <br />
<br />
I think EQ's belated level restrictions are the right way to go IF they are part of the game from the beginning. Adding them later doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The item level restrictions in DAoC didn't homoganize everyone...  Everyone chose different colors for their vendor bought armor. :p<br />
<br />
But I think it's safe to say that if VI comes out with an Everquest that has item decay, then it's not really Everquest as we know it anymore.  It might turn out to be EverEquip instead. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Er... sorry, just tried out that Size button, and I am having way too much fun with it.<br />
<br />
Anyone remember the old DM's standby? That wonderful &quot;Toric the Fighter is getting too uppity with his vorpal blade, he just beheaded a celestial deva&quot; problem solver? That's right, the rust monster!<br />
<br />
How bout some zones that drop absolutely rocking loot, but also have monsters that can eat items?  Could do some things to make this a little less aggravating to those who fought them as well.  For instance, have a chance that the item is not &quot;consumed&quot; if the monster is killed quickly enough, and have these monsters perhaps be non-agro if the zone is not real secluded (&quot;Hey, I was on my way to WC when Sergeant Slate ate my fine steel socks!&quot;), and a difficulty for &quot;eating&quot; based on the level of the item.  Putting in a level tag for items could be used for a lot of stuff like this, it would also make implementation of a more balanced NPC vendor price possible.<br />
<br />
Also, it sounds like this may be already in the game in some for or another, in terms of planning.  Anyone catch that comment about needing to hire guards and do escorts to transfer goods from bank to bank because of highwaymen?  Depending on what &quot;The Vision II&quot; is, said highwaymen may end up running off with more than just money.<br />
<br />
Anyways, some things to think about.  I still think it would be cool to see &quot;Ubardrood shouts, 'HEY! Vox ate my Scimitar of Twinking!'&quot;...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rotane Shagaminn</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the raiding aspect of EQ.  Raids can and do go for hours and hours, the idea of very short term item decay seems like it would greatly hinder such events.  Even if the decay only means &quot;to sharpen&quot; or &quot;repair&quot; your item for 10 minutes every 2 hours.  Yuk.<br />
<br />
I think item decay, meaning only reducing the effectiveness of the weapon, would also greatly affect small group situations if you have to go to a vendor or another PC to get the item fixed.  Would you need one of each class to insure your weapon or gears effectiveness holds out during the raid?  We all know how long it takes at times to get a group together to begin with.  More down time is not what the doctor ordered.  The same goes for extended single group 4 or 5 hour dungeon crawls to places like the Hole.  You have to evac just to redo your weapons?<br />
<br />
With respect to item decay to the point it breaks and is gone that just would be silly and annoying to me for a lot of the items I have.  Some of the armor I have I acquired many levels ago.  Rarely have I upgraded all my armor over an 8 or 10 level interval to the point where 8 or 10 levels later I have and use none of the stuff I started with.  <br />
<br />
What about sitting and holding a camp for hours and hours to obtain an item?  I spent days camping that dude in OOT for the Ivy Leggins Quest.  When I finally accomplished the quest I was elated.  I liked the reward for my efforts (and used the leggins for 15 levels).  To get me to camp him that long though knowing that the leggins might break and be gone in a level or two?  Sorry, not gonna happen.  <br />
<br />
Continuing with the leggins example, as someone eluded to above, it would be necessary to make the quest much easier so that it would take less time to accomplish.  Much less time means I should be more willing to do the quest knowing the item might break?  If it does break in a level or two I have to do the quest again, and perhaps again?  BORING.  Not to mention, can you imagine the problems with acquiring camps under that system?  They would be never ending as peeps tried to reacquire their items.<br />
<br />
I dunno, my point is that the idea of item decay to either repair or destroy an item introduces an element of repetition into the game that would not be attractive.  That seems to be the major complaint I see here, as well as from speaking to so many friends that played (past tense) DAoC.  Not only that but gear in EQ is status because a lot of it is hard to obtain.  By allowing such items to break won’t that remove that great aspect of the game?  I hope whatever EQ2 does to try to fix the economy supply/demand problem recognizes these things. Perhaps allowing no-drop items to be exempt from decay would be a start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am an older player. My ranger is now 49 and trying to gather pp to practice fletching again. Due to my irrational behavior in desiring to solo at times and thus needing a res, I allow myself to fletch til the bank balance is at 300pp.  I am at the stage of fletching now where the components cost more than I can get from a vendor on resale (would like to see MASSIVE fixes to this. At least let me get CLOSE to break even! Gimme a component purchase discount cause I AM a ranger!!)  and the items made are not that enticing to arrow shooting classes. So as I stand there lobbing arrows into things to keep that skill on the rise as well, I tell myself: Well, there just went 5pp....there went another 5pp....woops! That 5pp just vaporized. Must have been a dud arrow....ahhh! 5pp that managed a 47 point critical! Ahhh, yes, I love my trueshot...oh darn! That 5pp only hit for 1 point /sigh. etc<br />
<br />
For 20 plus levels because the money wasnt flowing freely, I gave up on fletching and archery completely. Now I am playing catch up. I still find myself buying a backpack of summoned arrows from a mage and hoping to high heaven that I dont go LD before I get to shoot them off. <br />
<br />
I dont know where these folks are getting all this pp to spend, I sure as heck aint finding it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have played EQ and I play DAOC.  Item decay works great in DAOC.<br />
<br />
Some Facts:<br />
1.  Items do NOT decay that quickly.  If you do not repair your gear it will last you for days not hours.<br />
2.  Good items are not that difficult to find.  You don't spend days camping a monster to get an item so there is no need to be worried about using the item because it might decay.<br />
3.  The really good items decay even more slowly than the normal items do.<br />
4.  Repairing an item is simple, hand it in to a smith and smiths are located EVERYWHERE.  Costs bugger all at higher levels when you are rolling in gold.  It can be a problem at lower levels when you are broke but there I found myself upgrading items before I needed to repair them.<br />
5.  If you are so attached to an item that you continue to use it after it goes grey then the decay rate becomes even lower.<br />
<br />
The only way you are going to screw yourself over with item decay is if you use items that are too high a level for you.  red/purple items decay at an accelerated rate.<br />
<br />
I play DAOC, I have lots of items I use depending on the situation.  There are NO items I don't want to use in case they decay.<br />
<br />
EQ has a problem because items exist forever and I think EQ2 should look at item decay to correct this.</div></div><hr />

I am the type of person that can sit at a spawn for 32 hours and when I get it be proud I did it.  That is just me.  <br />
<br />
Keeling things?  Heck, that gets boring sometimes.  Keeling things in a unique way with a lot of people to get something that takes alot of time, that is interesting to me.  Same thing with having to go many levels sometimes to get a good upgrade for a weapon.  I have to hunt and work hard for an upgrade, I don't want them to be easy to obtain. <br />
<br />
There are different types of people for everything.  Not saying anyone here does it, but I don't ebay plat so I can get a better weapon.  That takes the whole idea of accomplishment out of the game for me.  Some people don't care though and do buy plat on ebay.<br />

/shrug.  Just me.</div></div><hr />

Diablo and Diablo 2 both deal with item decay in a very good way.  Each item has a durability rating that decreases with use.  When your item's durability gets low, you take it to the blacksmith in town and they repair it.  Magic items cost more to repair, and some of the higher end items are indestructible.  If the items durability reaches 0, it is no longer usuable until you repair it.  Hopefully Verant does something akin to this.</div></div><hr />

Main problem in DAoC was teh lower limit on use not dekay. Weapons and armour greening out was totally idiotic.<br />
<br />
I personally would prefer to see more damage done if you lose a fight and very little/none if you win along with far lower exp penalties.</div></div><hr />

Just a quick thought off the top of my head. =)<br />
<br />
I really like the idea of reusing materials in the world to create new items.  Of course it will take more than you already have to make the new items, though. =)<br />

Sorry if something like this was posted already, I'm a bit too exhausted to read everything right now. hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani Greywynd</div><div class="date">06-24-2002, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never had a problem in UO, Diablo, or DAoC with item decay.<br />
<br />
I do like in DAoC having to be a certain level to use a certain item, but not the inverse to that (reaching a certain level makes said item useless to you).<br />
<br />
The better the quality of an item, the longer it takes to decay and be damaged.  Items SHOULD be breakable, but only if you let it decay to the point where it's just not going to last.  <br />
<br />
Why?  Well, it's realistic for one.  If I go out in the yard and duel with one of my katanas with a friend, I'm going to need to sharpen it at some point.  If I never sharpen it, after a few weeks, the blade will be dull beyond belief.  And if I never take care of it, eventually it will be a worthless bar of metal with a handle.<br />
<br />
Second, it starts to filter items and money out of the game, which helps beat out the mudflation we have now.  It gets old when you waltz in to the local server auction zone, only to find out that the item you picked up last week and were selling for 5k is now only worth 3k, and next week it will be a newbie gift.<br />
<br />
We're not saying every hour you'll have to run to town to repair your gear, but if you don't do it at least once a week you'll be looking for new gear very soon.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the loudest voices against item decay are the people who have 100k platinum collecting dust in their banks.<br />
<br />
A properly implemented item decay scheme will not only help with filtering out excessive money and items from the game, but it will also help decrease farming indirectly (this was something else I thought DAoC did well).  It shouldn't be the end-all beat-all solution, but a tool to be used to nudge the economy into somethign a bit more realistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vivax</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few additional comments on this thread:<br />
<br />
I must agree with dlmcpaul and Kiriani on this:  item decay is necessary to stop &quot;item inflation.&quot;  Why?  Because I know several people who tried to start playing EQ, but quit in disgust because these days it's &quot;be twinked or be instantly obsolete.&quot;<br />
<br />
And think of the side-benefit:  reduced camping!  The better item decay (and related money-sink ideas) reduce the inflation problem, the faster new items can drop.<br />
<br />
Imho, the single-most important idea DAoC uses is that the rate of item decay depends very heavily on the relative level of the item to its user.  Twinking is possible, but expensive in terms of decay and repair cost/time.  And the highest-level characters using the highest-level items notice an extremely slow rate of decay.<br />
As a result, new players to DAoC aren't finding all the other level 5's twinked like Liberace.<br />
<br />
Aizle's idea is very innovative, though:  have high-level item-repairing npc's located in places which only high-level characters can brave.  That increases the time cost of repairing those items with whiched you twinked a newbie-- you'd have to take the item back and go get it repaired for the newbie, too.<br />
<br />
Ok, a new idea for the sake of furthering the economic debate:  <br />
When very high-level items finally become unrepairable, what about making it possible to hand the item back to the mob and doing so guarantees that a new version of that item will drop next time?  Yeah, it'd be difficult to hand items back during the fight, but possible...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
When did VI anounce how they were gonna do it?<br />
<br />
comment on daoc: <br />
<br />
Yeah DAOC was flaky but is was there so you wouldnt have your lvl 1 running around with lv 50 equipment like i have seen hundreds of time on EQ. UO dont know i never played it so i cant say how bad it sucked for decay.<br />
<br />
Flame me all you want for being a new ID10T all you want i still wont comment much more on this subject till VI has announced something on the game they weren't even planing on announcing for a while. <br />
<br />
Later</div></div><hr />

If I have to log in and wander all over creation to fix Earthcaller and Swiftwind from last nights Hole group I did for xp, thats a pretty big negative to me. I dont have infinite time and I dont want to have to spend resourses on maintainging gear I already have. I want to be spending that cash on financing my Guilds next raid to get better, neater toys.<br />
<br />
What is wrong with deflation? It BENEFITS people in the long run. I can remember FBSS's selling for 10k on my server. My ranger could never afford one. I picked one up for my SK twink in the bazaar for 2k the other night. Deflation brings better items, cheaper, to lower lvls so you can advance faster. After making the adjustment to the 50+ game, I dont like playing a toon sub 50 any more.<br />
<br />
I like Raiding, I like taking 24-30 people from my Guild up against big mobs and hoping 1-2 neat items drop. Its somehow not as fun knowing that that 1 big mob will now drop 10-20 items ... because half of them will rot in 2 weeks anyway.<br />
<br />
To the guy that said something about not being twinked means your outdated, well DUH! I am sorry but true new players are a rarity on the 7th hammer. Most people that are starting now are starting because X friend convinced them to start. If your friend couldnt spare 2-3k worth of stuff to get you out fitted out a bit, then he/she isnt much of a friend.<br />
<br />
I had mostly decided to not go to EQ2 anyway but item decay will turn my mostly against to dead set against.  My opinion anyway. I play for friends and to get stuff, not to send countless hours fixing the stuff I already got.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani Greywynd</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, one of the biggest problems with deflation is simply because the gear becomes so commonplace.  The people who aren't part of a large guild that is ahead of the curve never get the gear to sell until it is nigh on obsolescence.<br />
<br />
I also don't think twinking the living crap out of a newbie character should be possible.  I think learning the nuances of the class should be done the hard way, regardless of the time/effort gear that drops from 50th level mobs could save you (I feel the same about powerlevelling - a few buffs here and there aren't bad, it's the 60 cleric and druid sitting near your character in a zone nobody your level should be in that's too much).  You should have to work for your levels and equipment whether you are just starting out or playing your 5th new character.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;working class&quot;, I work 8-5 everyday. I have a good 4-6 hours a night that are viable to play in, provided I have nothing else to do.  I have never had a problem with spending one hour or so per week maintaining my gear (in DAoC or UO).  We're not talking about a decay system that you would have to spend an hour or more each day on dealing with upkeep, but something to make things:1)more interesting, 2)more economically minded, 3)making practicing a trade more than just a means to blow platinum and accomplish quests, and 4)adding a whole new appreciation for what you've got.</div></div><hr />

Magic items are magic. Because they are magic they are eternal. Spoil them not.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiriani Greywynd</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't neccessarily say that magic items are eternal because of being magic.  More durable, yes, because usually magic items of only the highest possible (some would say impossible) quality are enchanted with their abilities.  I would not say invincible though.<br />
<br />
TO use an AD&amp;D example: the Retributive Strike ability of the Staff of the Magi.  You destroy the staff to release the power in one massive attack.<br />
<br />
Magic items in various tales have not always been in the best of condition, and many have been destroyed through various means.  ANYTHING with a physical form can be destroyed, although some may be harder than others.<br />
<br />
For that reason, I say go ahead and apply the decay to magic items as well.  Because of their magic (and inherent high quality) they will decay/take wear and tear slower than a typical item of that type, but they will decay non the less.<br />
<br />
Example: Short Sword of Ykesha vs. Fine Steel Short Sword.  THe FIne Steel Sword may require repair/upkeep once per day of average EQ use (meaning 6 hours of non-stop fighting realtime) whereas the Ykesha might only require the same upkeep after 4 days of this same level of use.  Sure, it's magic, it's higher quality, but nonetheless it takes a beating.</div></div><hr />
