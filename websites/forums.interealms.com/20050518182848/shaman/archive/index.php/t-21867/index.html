<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I realize this should have gone under the &quot;my update&quot; thread, but that thread had so many angry/unproductive posts that I felt this one would just get lost in all the trash.  If you feel another thread is a problem, please move this to the &quot;my update&quot; thread.  <br />
<br />
Gloriana  - thanks again for taking your time to go to the summit, and to be the shaman representative in general.  Please disregard the &quot;messenger bashing&quot; posts on some of the other threads - I'm willing to bet 99% of us truly appreciate what you are doing.<br />
<br />
Brenlo  - thanks for taking your time time to read and post on this board.  In regards to your suggestion that shaman need to present another round of arguments to Rytan...  I feel this needs to be a 2 way process.  Since the first round of proposals was rejected, we need to know why (in some detail) and what type of approach could be better received.  It's ok to have an argument rejected - but the rejector has a duty to explain their response.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, I agree with the above poster here.<br />
<br />
Brenlo, Rytan or whom it may concern. Can you elaborate a bit on the faults of our arguments so we can come up with a better solution to the existing problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At the risk of a thread going awry this is ABOUT a thread that went awry...<br />
<br />
/agree</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agreed - and for Brenlo / Rytlan - SOE has a reputation for claiming &quot;X isn't broken&quot; for months on end, and then finally actually looking into the problem only to find &quot;Holy code bugs Batman, it IS broken!&quot;.<br />
<br />
So I'd really be impressed if they can come back and honestly say &quot;We've looked into shaman concerns such as stat buffs being essentially meaningless for high-end play, slow being essentially meaningless for 30 second fights, etc, and here's the data that we see and here's how we collected it&quot;.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I think folks will assume that this is another alchemy / tradeskill / hybrids-tanking-in-GoD &quot;Broken as intended&quot; fiasco.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry for hijacking this thread but did SOE told us what the role of a shaman is (in SOE's eyes) in GoD+?<br />
<br />
I know we asked for this but havn't found a anwser (may be I just missed the post).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you are sorry for hijacking it, than dont.<br />
<br />
Brenlo/Rytan: Thanks for coming to try to talk to us and even speak to us about your views (while we may not agree with them, it is appreciated)<br />
<br />
Gloriana: Do I even need to say how much we appreciate you? :D<br />
<br />
Oh ok, if you insist... ALOT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Agreed. Please explain in detail why we did not get what we asked for in the &quot;One Voice&quot; post.<br />
<br />
Alternatively explain to us what a shaman is supposed to do in a GoD trial group and on a GoD raid. Be sure to include numbers. (Like: heal x % of a cleric, add x % damage to melees, etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah although things maybe getting desperate for SoE and shamans its very nice seeing 3 developers posting on the board. However, it is a little frustrating that what is being said is being dismissed. Hopefully, we as a shaman community can convince the developers that shamans are in need of some attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well the developers are here .. thats good . I would like the devs too just tell us if they Think we are balanced as we currently are .. I dont mean infer it .. If the devs feel we are Balanced currently i just want them too type exactly that .<br />
That way i know shamans are how they want us . if thats the case the I will know that I shouldnt hold out hope of being usefull in cutting edge content anymore .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Honestly, Brenlo and Ryan, we would like some answers. Phrases like &quot;In the future&quot; and &quot;not at this time&quot; and &quot;have a bigger impact&quot; are not working for many of us. When, how, and how much (numbers). As I said in another thread, people who have a LOT more free time on their hands have done parse after parse after parse with regard to stat buffs. Is the code changing or something? Just a quickie example (mob does 1K dps before slow, therefore does 20K damage the first 20 seconds, then slow lands and instead of 10K, he does 4K for the last 10 seconds, and 6K is only 1 single CH) proves that slow is becoming less and less effective.<br />
<br />
Why are we continuing to be punished for having the &quot;best&quot; debuff in the game if that debuff is being made obsolete by content?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">AGREED!   (with the original post)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if you guys were sent here with instructions to simply stall us and string this discussion out as long as possible, or if that's just happening on accident...  But you're losing credibility.<br />
<br />
Please commit to a productive discussion soon by providing concrete feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I add my support.  Definitely the next step that should be taken.<br />
<br />
Thunderwolf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nydara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Great post. Seems this is one of those things all of us shaman agree on  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/agree with the original post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am not sure I get this.<br />
<br />
We have presented well reasoned arguments with the numbers to back them up (there are posts here that anslyze logs for various stat buffs) to bolster our case.  The counter argument is &quot;I disagree&quot; with no facts to back that up.  How do you fight that?  I am puzzled.<br />
<br />
It IS good to see that the SOE personnel are looking at our complaints, even if they percieve us (to paraphrase Brenlo) as &quot;the biggest whiners out there now&quot; - a charge that is difficult to dispute even if we have reason to whine.<br />
<br />
I will admit that all the flamage around here is difficult for me to take, let alone what it must be like for the SOE folks who must see it everywhere.  I cannot believe that it is productive.  But there are well reasoned and well written catalogs of our problems here as well as flames.  It would be nice to see SOE cover those point-to-point with something more substantial than &quot;I disagree&quot;.<br />
<br />
It goes without saying (but we will say it anyway) that the community appreciates what Glori is doing for all of us.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />
