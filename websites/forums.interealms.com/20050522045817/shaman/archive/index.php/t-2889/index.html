<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I havent worried about AA skills until I was 60 and now that I have managed to get there I am wondering which AA Skills to train in.<br />
<br />
I suppose I would do regen3, run3 with maybe sta3 and wis3 and all resists from the general skills.<br />
<br />
Priest Archs then I would pick channeling focus and spell casting reinforcement them maybe onto the healing ones.<br />
<br />
Shaman Archs then I would pick Cannibilisation, Mass group buff, quick buff and Spell casting Reinforcement Mastery.<br />
<br />
I was curious as to what order people would put these in?<br />
<br />
Would you disagree with having some of these?<br />
<br />
Would you want to add some that I have not put in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ghorharth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think the best AA way is<br />
<br />
run 3<br />
regen 3<br />
<br />
mental clarity 3<br />
<br />
cannibalization<br />
Mass group buff<br />
<br />
...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pretty much what Tryg said.  You'll definintely want Cannibalization.   MC isn't exactly the best arch ability, and even if you decide to get MGB first,  it'll be best to get MC out of the way, so you don't have to spend 12 more arch points to get to Canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I went:<br />
<br />
Run 3<br />
Regen 3 (here I really suggest STA 3 if you are low stamina...hps really needed for Can 5 later...wis...sure I guess but once you break into high end game you will find that is not an issue anymore)<br />
MC 1, 2 and 3<br />
Can 5  &lt;----this soooooo owns!  You will be rarely out of mana!<br />
Quick Buff 1<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
Now working on AE skill since we had a shaman leave guild and that just left 1 with it.  Do not be fooled into thinking you need the AE skill.  It is purely a raid skill and if you have 2 or more shamans with it already focus on other skills.<br />
So my next skills are:<br />
AE Skill<br />
Quick Buff 2<br />
Quick Buff 3 (3 sec cast time on torpor = awesome)<br />
Rabid Bear (I want to have some fun!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">run3<br />
regen3<br />
MC3<br />
Rabid bear, no regrets</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">run3<br />
regen3<br />
mc3<br />
canni5<br />
<br />
I can't imagine going another way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The nice thing is, we don't have to be cookie cutter shaman, do whatever seems fun to you.  I am scandalizing my guild by opting not to get mass group buff, instead I'm going to do a couple levels of quickbuff to get a faster casting torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My guild has plenty of shaman so I havent wasted 9 points on massive group buff either. We always get our buffs done before most everyone else and are fm gtg. If I was the only shaman on raids regularly I would definately get it though.<br />
<br />
Instead I've spread my points around some so I am a little better at EVERYTHING. Definately more fun for me this way although I wont get my 3rd title soon at this rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally I went with the standard now run3 regen3, MC3 , cann v, mgb route.<br />
<br />
So far i'm still our only shaman with MGB and love having it, altho the clerics don't love it =(. I would agree tho that if you had 2 or 3 shaman with MGB already go for something else instead.<br />
<br />
Currently I've got 2 points saved up and I am planning on getting quick buff 1 next. Not sure what I'm going to do next after that. Might go for another point or 2 of quickbuff but I should be getting my shissar ring soon and it seem silly to spend that many points for just a faster cast time on torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So nobody has done SCR and SCRM after Canni? Did I miss a key discussion about how these skills suck? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did <br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Regen3<br />
MC3<br />
Canni5<br />
SCR1<br />
QB1<br />
<br />
I'm getting bored.  I want crits, all my melee friends have crits.  They all crit so much I have to filter them out.  But where are *my* crits??  bah.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ryse_eq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The route I went was:<br />
<br />
run3<br />
regen3<br />
<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
<br />
Mass Group Buff &lt;--- Cause AE focus owns for raiding all the time<br />
Cann 5<br />
Rabid Bear (Makes meleeing fun)<br />
QuickBuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm no one is mentioning Spell Casting Mastery.   The effect is VERY noticible imho, at the second and third tier.<br />
<br />
This has been my roadmap.<br />
<br />
Run Speed 3<br />
Innate Regeneration 3<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
Cannibilization<br />
Mass Group Buff<br />
Spell Casting Mastery 3<br />
Quick Buff 2<br />
<br />
I'm working on Channeling Focus right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gloriana you said you went for Quickbuff for faster casting on torpor. I have heard rumors this only works when you cast it on yourself and not on others? Anyone have any firsthand experience with this? <br />
<br />
Was also thinking about getting a few ranks in QB before going for MGB but don't want it to be relegated to self only. A 3 second torpor could be really useful on big mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm Been a while.<br />
<br />
Regen 3<br />
Run 3<br />
Spell casting Fury 1  (Next day JBB crits nerfed Damnit!!)<br />
<br />
(Leveled to 60)<br />
<br />
Mental clarity 2<br />
Healing Crits 1  (I was tired of not having enough healing power with no Torpor)<br />
Spell casting reinforcement 1 ( Got torpor /cheer had to make it last!)<br />
Saved 2 points so far. <br />
<br />
I am going to try and hold out for MC 3 Then Cannabalazation. But that is hard..../sniff<br />
<br />
One thing that is really really fun though is to werewolf form then Proc a crit damage and crit heal on a lifetap proc and Crit for 70 and heal for 140. (Wheee)<br />
<br />
I may not make it to MC3, spell casting fury two is winking at me right now, I have been grouping with a wizard alot recently and his crits are pissing me off. I only get a couple a night as it is and That makes me mad. (Though I did Get a triple 760 off torrent one night and a 540 as well (it was two critters at once.) 2820 damage with a single spell was kinda fun. And blew the mind of some thief I was grouped with. )<br />
<br />
Cannabilazation is the smart thing, but damn I have a 60 int for a reason (At char creation)<br />
<br />
Snoww Silverhammer  Bashy bear  E marr</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm, I thought it would work like my enhancement haste focus item, and that works on spells cast on anyone.  You're right, if it's self only, it's a lot less valuable.<br />
<br />
Anyone that actually has some points in Quickbuff got the real story?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This definately works on others in your group as well. Cast time is 3 secs maxxed on anyone cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I suppose I would do regen3, run3 with maybe sta3 and wis3 and all resists from the general skills. <br />
<br />
forget Sta3 and wis3 unless you have 100+ AA points</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">thank you all some excellent feedback there :)</div></div><hr />
