<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heard a lot of people say it works on torpor, and a lot say it doesn't.  Well, I wanted it for celerity/regrowth/avatar/rabid bear, so was working on it regardless.<br />
<br />
Only have level 3, and it's being weird.  At level 2, torpor was 24 seconds without failure.  Odd, as it used to be 24-28 seconds, which is why sometimes you got 1500 hp.  Anyhow, logs tell it all.<br />

But...anyhow, yeah.  Just wanted to clarify it!  I'm sure it was posted before at one point, but never saw logs accompany it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">30-34 sec torpor...so you definitely get 1500hp and sometimes 1800hp?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The extra 4 seconds are because you catch an extra tick... something about the timing issues between the server &amp; your comp, if you get lucky &amp; catch it just right, you get a free tick on the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OT slightly, looking at your profile Gathu, how come Quickbuff before MGB?  You weren't online last night when I was so couldn't send you a tell.  I'm personally thinking of passing up on MBG for SCR myself after Can V.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">MGB is just too situational.  When I was putting those points in, there were no focus items, and 6.0 torpor annoyed me.  I really like 3.0 torpor, and 4.0 celerity, 13.0 gfocus, etc. are all nice as well.  If I could remove the last point in it I probably would (thanks focus items making it near useless!), but I don't regret not putting the 9 in MGB at all.<br />
<br />
Plan to get SCR Mastery, SCM3, and Channeling3 before I get mgb.  MGB is just a very overrated skill for shamans...it's fun to see all the targets, but just not really that necessary given our mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm doing quick buff before MGB as well. MGB just doesn't help enough I think. We regain mana so fast that focusing a few groups (usually another shaman or 2 on my raids with group focus too) is no big deal at all. I can't justify spending 9 points on it.<br />
<br />
I have run 3, regen 3, MC 3, Cannibalization, Casting Fury 1 (damn that jbb nerf), Spell Casting Reinforcement 3 and Healing Gift 3 (just maxed that last night). <br />
<br />
I'm going up to Quick Buff 2 next, as I have an Essence Lens now, so Quick Buff 3 is a waste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For me, MGB is anything but overrated.  I am in a guild where we have at least 40 people per raid and i am the only active shaman in the guild.  Occationally i get another shaman on the raid, but most don't have malo or torpor.  I got MGB before C5 and i think i made the right choice.  Raids are alot more relaxing and i stress out alot less.  If you are a shaman in a large raiding guild with one shaman, i recomend MGB before anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">MGB is silly.  With Cannibalization, you can cast GFocus every three minutes practically mana free.</div></div><hr />

I am curious to see if it is any different at all, from someone without SCR1.<br />
<br />
Are those 2 instances where my torpor lasted 30 seconds just the effect of lag, or the effect of lag plus my SCR...  ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Seems to fit.  Before I got any SCR (oddly this seemed to vanish when I got level 2, but maybe I'm mistaken), torpor lasted 24-28 seconds.  Assuming that you got the max 28 roll, and then an additional 5% duration, that'd be 29.4.  So it could roll over and look like 30.  The fact that you never got a 24 second supports this...maybe level 2 is just borked, who knows.<br />

30% increase, from 24-28 to start.  It should range from 31.2 to 36.4...which due to the imperfect nature of eq's timestamps (only even seconds so sad) seems to fit.<br />
<br />
Level 2 simply does not seem to work though.<br />
<br />
Oh, additional note...I was duo'ing with a monk (playing both), and when I cast Group Regrowth mine faded at the 15 minute mark or so, where his didn't fade for another 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />
