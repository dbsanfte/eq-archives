<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Per popular request I made a couple shiny graphs(TM). They show sustained healing of the three priest classes.<br />
The first graph shows healing per second over an indefinite period of time, with no outside buffs at all. This is the graph to use if you regularly spend upwards of 4 hours without med breaks.<br />
The second graph shows healing per second on a LDoN adventure. The timelimit is one hour, the only outside buff is VoQ. This is the graph to use for LDoN adventures.<br />
The third graph shows raid conditions, time is still one hour but bard song, beastlord and druid buffs are added to VoQ. This is the graph to use for all raids which require extensive clearing.<br />
<br />
The different gear levels are as follows<br />
basic<br />
No focus items or AAs at all.<br />
medium<br />
Everyone is assumed to have Mental CLarity 3, Spellcasting Mastery 3 and Flowing thought 4. In addition the <br />
shaman also has a mana preservation IV item and a spell haste IV item as well as the Spell Casting Reinforcement 3 and <br />
Cannibalisation AAs.<br />
high<br />
Everyone is assumed to have Mental CLarity 3, Spellcasting Mastery 3 and Flowing thought 8. In addition the shaman <br />
also has Improved Healing, Mana Preservation, Spell Haste and Beneficial Spell Extension focus items (20% items).<br />
The shaman also has the Healing Adept 3, Healing Gift 3, Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery and Cannibalisation AAs.<br />
<br />
You will notice that shaman compare worse and worse to druids and clerics as total fight duration gets shorter and as overall mana regeneration increases. You will also see that druid heals don't scale as well as cleric heals which is mainly due to the druid heal being capped lower.<br />
<br />
If people are interested in the raw data I can post that also but I figured this would be the post for people who like images not numbers.  :D <br />
<br />
Edit: The numbers represent points healed per second</div></div><hr />
