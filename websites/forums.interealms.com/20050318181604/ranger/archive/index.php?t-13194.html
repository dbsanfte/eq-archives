<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xequecal</div><div class="date">11-02-2002, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm writing this guide mainly because I'm frustrated. Frustrated with people who obsess on leveling and completely neglect their gear. It may be hard for some of you to grasp this, but your gear is what makes you in this game. If your gear sucks, so do you. I don't care how good you are or think you are. Playing skill pretty much only determines who lives and who dies when the **** hits the fan, something that does not happen very often anymore with today's gimpified XP MOBs. 90% of this game is standing in front of a MOB and letting the random number generator do it's thing. If you are level 50 and still wielding Icetooth Claws, a Crystal Fiber, Banded armor, and no haste item, then this is directed at you:<br />
<br />
STOP LEVELING! STOP RIGHT NOW! YOU ARE THE REASON EVERYONE MAKES FUN OF THE RANGER CLASS! Rangers are THE most gear-dependent melee class. Paladins, SKs, and Warriors have higher AC on their gear, more hitpoints, and a higher Defense skill that will compensate for below average gear. Rogues get a Backstab key that adds so much damage that even with crappy gear, they will still outdamage most anyone. Rangers do not have either luxury, so you MUST have better weapons to stay desired. Rangers are GOOD tanks in most situations if they've kept their gear up to par. <br />
<br />
Now that the mini-rant is over, here is my advice:<br />
<br />
- Panic Animal. Never, EVER use it. Why? Animals do not drop loot. If you can't solo a blue MOB with straight melee, then you need to farm plat until you can. People say Panic Animal was an amazing improvement to our class. I disagree. It lets any idiot get to 60 without any skill at all, and wearing some pretty abysmal gear. The only exception to this rule is gryphs in Jaggedpine or in NK/EK at low levels, or snow griffins in EW, because they drop money. It may be fun to get 10 levels in 3 days off rockhoppers, but you'll have gained exactly zero platinum doing it, and chances are your defense skill is 30 points behind.<br />
<br />
- Hunt in places that drop large amounts of loot. Even if the XP is below average. Go to Crystal Caverns at level 30 and don't leave until level 39. You'll have made at least 3k in that time, more if you managed to get into the geonid camp on a regular basis. At 39, go do Hill Giants. Do them for at least 2 levels. Yes, it's boring. Yes, the XP sucks. But you'll get 10k doing this pretty easily, giving you a large equipment advantage over everyone else your level.<br />
<br />
- There are a lot of places where you can get tons of loot, yet are largely unexplored. Oggok is a great example. The bouncers inside are easy to pull singly, and you will get 1-2 FS weapons from EACH kill. That's in addition to the platinum you will get. There's a non-KOS merchant right at the zone that you can sell to. Get a friend, and hunt here for a few levels. Sol A is another great plat farming location, especially if you're level 50 and are wearing crap. You can massacre this dungeon and sell all the fine steel to vendors in the zone.<br />
<br />
- Don't be passive. If you are in a group and someone else is looting everything, call them on it. Don't try to be nice and just hope that he/she will stop on their own.<br />
<br />
- Recognize what items are valuable to players and hoard them. For example, the small pieces of velium that drop in crystal caverns are very valuable to players, because they are required for trade skills. I collected 40 at one point and sold them for 400pp to a player. Also know the rare spawns and rare drops in the area you're hunting, and constantly check Track for them. Direct your group to these spawns when they appear so you have a chance at getting a nice item to use or sell. Winning the lotto on a Quillmane cloak will solve all your money problems, as high level mages will pay 50k or more for the multiquest rights to this thing.</div></div><hr />

Lately I've been running into 50+ melee with no haste, including warriors with under 950 buffed AC. That's ridiculous, I don't care how good plate damage mitigation is if you can't even break 1k AC with full cleric, shaman, and ranger buffs on. Too many people will pay 10k to get that 1dps increase out of their weapons while ignoring AC and haste. Idiots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which I hasten to add, is pretty much unsupported.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skack</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it depends on how you look at it.  Your level will obviously make more of a difference than your gear if you are talking about a level 12 and a level 30 both hunting in Crushbone.  But as you level up, people within the same level range will hunt the same monsters, ie the level 30 wouldn't be hunting in CB.  So based on the fact that the same levels hunt in the same ranges, the gear makes the bigger difference because differences between levels are relatively small.<br />
The difference would be, at the very top of the level range where a level 60 and 50 could be hunting in the same area, and with AAs coming into effect, level differences could outway gear benefits.  <br />
That said, I would have to agree with much of what was posted, though I don't think panic animal is at all bad so long as you don't recklessly neglect your inventory and defence skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I agree completely although this is hardly a Ranger-only issue.  Seeing level 63+ 'tanks' using Venomous axes and wearing paper for armor tends to make me sad (and often dead).<br />
<br />
Levels are the most important thing in determining effectiveness *given equitable gear* but they are not everything.  I would also add that AAs are not a thing to think about at 65, they are something new 60s really will want to work on before moving on.  Flame me if you wish but that is my opinion.<br />
<br />
A level 65 Ranger is far more effective than a level 60 Ranger against Mob X.  The trouble is when you join my group fighting Mobs Y and you may well be completely ineffective due to having the same gear you got at level 50.  I'm a Rogue and I tend to know I am only as good as my skill, my weapons and my armor.  I'd be fooling myself if I thought it was really in that order also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jalim</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gear is important. Levels are important. Obviously a near naked 60 will not preform as well as a well equipped 60. As far as panic animal, yeah it is nice to have, and I use it. I DO hate that animals in general do not drop cash, but what are you gonna do.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is you DO have to make money somehow. If you can keep your grouping skills up to par, can fearkite animals for exp most of the time, somehow make a killing in the bazaar to make money, more power to you. <br />
<br />
It is generally true in my opinion that soloing as a ranger is for two things, usually mutually exclusive. You can either get exp (fearkiting or soloing underconned blues), or you can make money (farming greens). Sure sometimes you can do both at once, but not often (griffons in Jaggedpine offer at least a little cash and a rare chance for a sellable drop). Most of the time however, it seems if you can get exp from something solo, it isn't going to drop much cash. <br />
<br />
I like to solo for exp, generally when I don't have anyone playing that I know that I want to group with. I tend to find strangers somewhat unpredictable for my tastes, and I hate being on someone elses timer. By that I mean for instance the only healer in the group has to leave 5 minutes after I get there, and I spend 20 minutes waiting for a replacement, or the tank/puller/chanter you name it has no clue what they are doing and end up killing me for the 10th time in an hour. My favorite has alwas been the extended AFK. It can almost be like a game: &quot;How long can I get away with going AFK before someone boots me out?&quot; I just love soloing for the pure time to experience ratio. I can AFK on my time, I wait for nobody, if I die I only kill myself. I start and stop when it is comfortable for me.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love to group, I love to raid, and I do it whenever I can with folks I know in my guild, etc. But for pure exp grinds when &quot;I want to get to level ## ASAP&quot; I solo and do the fear-kite no money thing.  <br />
<br />
I have done pretty decently in tradeskills, and that is how I have made up for my lack of funds from grouping in Seb/Velks/name-your-lousy-group-zone-here.  I have grouped in those zones to be sure, but usually only with people I know. Like I said, I raid/group all the time, but for me soloing is great.<br />
<br />
 My gear is not WONDERFUL. I wield a Tox Axe, LSoEE and BFT for weps for example (Still working on epic with guild, getting there :)  ), but it is definitely on par with others in my guild, and I drop soloing and go on raids and epic hits for others whenever they come up. I know a bunch of people in game and usually do not have trouble finding a group when I want to, which is usually for fun, or for taking out larger kills, or both :)<br />
<br />
Anyway gear/soloing etc can be done a number of ways, you just have to find what works for ya!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taylia</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree mostly, with this sentiment.<br />
<br />
I think that on a PvP server, the argument that your gear determines how effective you are, is very prevalent. <br />
I was fighting a green con Ogre Shaman awhile back, which drove me to the conclusion that level is not &gt; all. He was some evil’s twink whore, as he was decked out in gear that someone his level could not attain on thier own. Although he was very cunning and knew how to play his Shaman well, it was not that alone which turned the battle in his favour. Through the course of the fight, I was Malaised, blinded, rooted and DoTed, while I tried slashing him. His AC must have been extremely high as I could barely land a hit on him and the ones I could, were quickly recovered (a fungi tunic I suspect). If it were not for a passing guild mate, I would have surely suffered a humiliating death at the hands of this Ogre.<br />
<br />
Due to geography and territory control, I would say that the majority of “Goods” are ill equipped. I can’t walk into Oggok and fight Bouncers, as I would have Evils from all adjoining territories on thier way to kill the “Goodie” Ranger. Making money is not that easy for me on Sullon Zek; my options are very limited. The majority of my current gear, much to my chagrin, has had to be purchased off of Evils or Neutrals, who seem to dominate the market for equipment. Buying from them only funds them in thier quest to better equip themselves so they can kick my arse more effectively....thus the vicious  cycle begins.<br />
<br />
I have seen well-equipped players walk into a zone and completely own it by themselves. Thier important stats are through the roof as well as key items such as pumice, heal potions, DoT potions etc are at thier disposal, thanks to the goods who fund them.<br />
<br />
After all is said and done, the number crunching machine that is EQ will always favour those with the numbers to come out on top.<br />

I suppose some Good looking to level quickly in Kaladim could have bought them, but you're right - evils and neuts have most of the money.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I'm trying to picture my Good Ranger going to Oggok to fight Bouncers! Doubt he'd even make it to Innothule, much less inside Oggok.<br />
<br />
Right now, I'm hunting in Everfrost and Perma, fighting the urge to go back to Paludal for a couple of quick levels.  Coin has been pretty good so far, even if the experience is (comparatively) so-so.<br />
<br />
Oh, and as far as territory goes on Sullon - it's gotten worse with PoP.  Lowbie evils have been PoPorting into EF, looking for other lowbies to gank.  Problem is, there are more evil lowbies than good lowbies, and there are so few zones we can hunt in as it is.  Very few safe places now, apparently.</div></div><hr />

I think it’s only a matter of time before we loose our hold on Everforst. Where to then? Greater Faydark? GF has been under constant attack, more so than before the release of PoP.<br />
I have stopped leveling for the past week, trying to do my part to keep the hunting grounds of our young free from the scourge of Evils and Neutrals. It has been very trying.<br />

<br />
Sorry - not to hijack, but I have very few places to talk intelligently about Sullon (my guild's board is broken, for now).  I'll stop now.  Well, except to say that I feel like I've stopped levelling after zooming through four levels in Paludal. Have gained a little more than one in the same amount of time in EF.  Got four tusks last night, however.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because level has no effect on damage mitigation, base hitpoints, ATK rating, AA accesibility, damage from AE's, disciplines or anything else.  Please.<br />
<br />
If you want to be a level 8 in full Tolans, good for you.  But do not make outrageous and ridiculous claims like &quot;gear &gt; level!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drienne</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is less a guide and more a bunch of unsupported estimates and opinions.  I agree with a previous poster that gear is important, as well as levels.  Completely neglecting gear in order to gain levels will definitely leave you at a high level with gear so abyssmal that you can't function.  However, telling someone to forget about leveling is just plain silliness.  You talk about 3kpp from 30-39.  If you wait until 45, you can just go and solo in CC and make all the money yourself (which is what I did).  Hill Giants for 2 levels making you 10kpp?  That seems like a rather liberal calculation.  I've farmed Rathe with both my 60 ranger and 57 necromancer (both extremely well outfitted) and can make, at most, 1000pp per hour.  That's in the dead of night when nobody else is around, fear-kiting 4 at a time with the necro or just laying waste with my Ranger.  In a full group, with pulls like that, you'd be making barely 200pp per hour.  50 hours for 2 levels (10kpp over 2 levels, 200pp per hour)?  Seems like a waste of time.  Bottom line, everything in moderation.  I've seen gear-hounds, level 35, thinking they're cool for having a Wurmslayer and an FBSS or something (at the time, this was good).  I've also seen those gear-hounds 18 levels later, with better weapons, but the skills of a newbie because they spent all their time farming non-threatening, non-challenging mobs that drop some pp.  Skill first, levels next, gear comes in time.  It worked for me.<br />
<br />
P.S.  50k for a quill cloak?  I have one I can't get rid of for 7k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having some levels under your belt makes farming for loot much much easier, and also gives you access to zones where loot drops that you will use instead of sell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree 110%, if you are lvl 50+ in Ivy armor useing weapons worse then Centi SS/Wurmy combo you are NOT going to be effective, IMO if you go 1-10 in the n00b garden then 10-27 in PC (makeing maybe 300-400pp) then fear-kite to lvl 60 in the gear you obtained with that 400pp + some lvls of Mammoths you are gonna get laughed outta zones. This isnt hard to do ethier, like the org. poster said pharm or kill in CC/Dungeons. Fear-kiting is SOOOO boring that anyone who FKs 22-65 must have no life and no concept of the game.<br />

Yes, such an equipped ranger will not be up to PoP and arguably ME and UP, but it hardly makes him/her useless. Kunark was designed around those equipment levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perregrin</div><div class="date">12-09-2002, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have played beside characters in excellent equipment with no clue about some of their abilities.  I have also seen clueless individuals in terrible equipment.  A truely excellent player shines because he know his class so well (he or she).  Not cause he has a wurmmy/centi or an FBSS or any other shiney weapon.<br />
<br />
I don't care how great your equipment is, unless you understand all of your spells, their effects, and utility you are not a ranger.  Till you understand why, when and where you would use your different tracking filters you are not a ranger.  You are not a ranger until you understand all facets of of your class.  Yeah equipment means you live longer, or add some  extra dps or have a bit more mana but equipment does not make you great it just helps you.<br />
<br />
In a group I would rather have a poorly equipped ranger that knew his stuff over an uber equipped ranger that has never had to sweat when heading in to a battle.  That is not to say that that uber equipped ranger with uber skills would be turned away.  But equipment does not make the class.  It just make the good better and the ****ty passable.<br />
<br />
Hell with 2 rusty weapons you could fear kite your way in to any equipment in EFP  you just need patience and time.  Right now I make about 100pp per night solo and I get to practive my casting and weapon skills and I can chat with my guildies.  I can even kill the red con corrupted mammy if I am patient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gandilain</div><div class="date">12-13-2002, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its true, levels are more important than anything.  Get to 59 or 60 in the gear that you can get, maybe taking a few trips to kael or PoF to get armor. As long as you are getting good xp, you are in good enough gear. The 3k you made in crystal caverns lvls 30-39 you can make in one day later levels.  Levels, more than anything else, make you more powerful. Dont get me wrong, you shouldnt be in newb quested armor at lvl 40, but if you can get to 60 in barbed ringmail, do it.  No matter what you will have more ac/hp than the guy who is five levels lower than you in a PSC.  It is a good idea to take a break every now and again for a Kael raid, epic stuff, PoF raid and such, but dont live in those zones.  The gear you get there will be considered sub par once you get high enough anyway. Just get what you need to get by, and get those levels!</div></div><hr />

I just thought the beauty of EQ was that you could do whatever you want. <br />
Want to lvl? Go ahead.<br />
Want to farm pp? Go ahead. <br />
Want to make a million pp in bazaar? Go ahead.<br />
Want to make it to lvl 65 using fearkite? Go ahead.<br />
<br />
Aye guides are good... but following them all will shape you in to a cookie cutter player... (anyone remember the javazons or the static field/ice orb sorceress in Diablo 2?)<br />
<br />
The most important thing is that you have fun. doing what you want to do. In time the high lvls and the crappy gear will come to an equilibrium (sp?) where you cant advance much more in your current setup.<br />
<br />
And after all some have got to play rangers poorly in order to make the rest of us shine...<br />

<br />
&quot;Frustrated with people who obsess on leveling and completely neglect their gear. It may be hard for some of you to grasp this, but your gear is what makes you in this game. &quot;<br />
<br />
-  First, you shouldnt be frustrated by other people in the game unless they get you killed through inept playstyle.  I think you're trying to say that craptacularly outfitted Rangers who are too lazy to pharm plat and buy some decent gear are giving the class a bad name... I disagree.  The Rangers out there who are decked out in Tolans (or better) but cant manage aggro or be bothered to keep a mob off the Cleric/Chanter wihle grouped in DL are the real issue. <br />
<br />
&quot;If your gear sucks, so do you. I don't care how good you are or think you are. &quot;<br />
<br />
-  I disagree, but I think I see the point you're trying to make.  At higher levels, gear definitely is important.  However, everyone has been alongside an overly well equipped player who couldnt play their class well at all.  Chanters who couldnt control a &quot;crowd&quot; of one add, the tanking Bard who only plays heal song throughout the fight, Necros who chain cast all their DOTs and then wonder why they keep getting summoned...  They might be wearing some badass gear, but I dont care how much perfume you put on a pig, its still a pig.  A friend of mine plays a high level Wizard, and knows that class really well.  He's one of the most fun people Ive played with because he knows his role and plays it to perfection.  However, he pimped himself a Bard alt to the teeth with all kinds of shiny colorful Bard gear, and man, he sucked.  Despite all the gear he had, he never could learn how to play a Bard well (a very difficult class IMHO), and gave up. <br />
<br />
Gear tends to be dictated by playstyle, I think.  If someone is a casual player who enjoys soloing, they'll take a long time to put together a set of decent gear, may never bother with a resist set or haste item.  Someone who plays the game for the social aspect will likely put together a decent sized friend list, make it into a guild and have an opportunity to get their hands on some decent items.  Then there are the players who play very aggressively, looking for groups or creating their own, and grinding as often as possible.  They would likely be the ones who end up getting into or developing a guild that allows them access to the better gear.  I dont think any one of these players is better than the other, its just how they want to play.</div></div><hr />

I've got 1000ac self buffed at 52, not bad at all I'm told, was grouped in KC last night and had a full 200 ac more than a bard a level higher than me, and equal to a paladin 2 levels higher than me.

<br />
Just because your opinions state that you hate people in lesser equipment, don't tell people how to play.  They pay the same amount as you, unless you play on stormhammer, so they have every right to play in whatever they desire to play in.  Maybe they don't troll message boards hanging on every little piece of equipment dropped in every zone, maybe they play for fun?  If they are having fun and not encroaching on your equipment dependant world, leave them alone.  <br />

I have a hard time taking you seriously when you whine and whine and then state: &quot;Playing skill pretty much only determines who lives and who dies when the **** hits the fan, something that does not happen very often anymore with today's gimpified XP MOBs. &quot;  If this is what you believe and a rarity, your whole post is inane.</div></div><hr />

Too many people forget this, their loss.<br />
<br />
Panic Animal is one of the best spells we have.  Too bad you don't know this.  If ya REALLY wanna farm cash, go fearkite Rockhoppers and sell the pelts.  I made ROCKIN exp on these guys and had pelts galore to sell.  I gave em to friends, but you can sell if ya want.<br />

Although I have to say that I think people should chill from leveling some times I think there are far too many people these days who have missed alot of what EQ has to offer by living in places like PC try exploring the world, remember part of being a ranger is knowing exactly how to get to any zone in the fastest time without getting lost (or at least without letting anyone know you were lost on the way hehe).</div></div><hr />

The higher level you get the less extra benefit you get from your gear.<br />

<br />
I ran into a twink the other day who didn't even KNOW we had panic animal, much less how to use it. He had _way_ better gear than I did, &amp; at the time I was 5 levels higher than him. He was running around arrow kiting animals monsters &amp; animals when he could have been fearing them, and wasn't using his dots either. <br />
<br />
It's easy to neglect gear when all you're doing is fearing, but there's another way to look at it too, in that fearing allows someone with bad gear to level up and then get better gear. The fact is that it's easier to kill a green con for loot in bad gear than it is to kill a blue con. <br />
<br />
There's a guide in this someplace... But I'm not sure what it looks like. I think it might be something along the lines of what's good ac/dps at what level, &amp; what the threshhold of acceptable is. I'm CERTAIN that it's a big question for people. It might be good to thrash it out some on the General forum. That said, the average ubertwink won't care, but people who're primarying will, and people who're playing secondaries who arn't stinking rich will too. <br />

Gear comes with levels &amp; as for slating Panic Animal you are wrong.  I made about 3k PA Mammies in EF.   Over 10K PA the Gorillas in Stonebrunt.  Add to that the Wakazashi of the Frozen skies quest i did 8 - 9 times &amp; sold them at 300pp a Wak.<br />

<br />
Here's a thought for a guide:- Best &quot;bank for the buck&quot; gear - with a list of gear, and approximate prices (your mileage may vary). I am sure it would be controversial (dex gear at level 20??), but at least it would be guide-like. I know I would have loved to have had it (it already exists across many posts, just not nicely summarized).<br />
<br />
And for the subject at hand, I have to agree that gear is 2%...<br />
<br />
The ONLY lasting valuable things you will ever get out of this game are relationships and memories. The best non-lasting thing you can hope for is an exciting or pleasant time (hopefully both). If you have good relationships in the game and take pride in being as good as you can, then whatever you want will come to you in time. You won't have to farm unless you want to, and you won't be LFG for long, if ever. But heck, you are paying for it.. do what you want.<br />
<br />
One last note... on all my chars, the very best gear that I have was given to me or gotten with friends - and I have *given* some nice stuff to friends (boots of flowing slime, cloak of flames, etc..) so that we could do more interesting things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Changes as one levels, especially with the Required/Recommanded lvls and where you are currently playing/exp.<br />
<br />
Lvl 55 and etched ivy in KC ya fit right in.  Lvl 55 with the the same gear in PoN/D/I, you are kidding, aye?<br />
<br />
The above might look like a contradiction, a knowledgeable ranger understands not only the multiple roles his character can/should play but also how to get the most bang for the buck.<br />
<br />
Early lvls 1-25ish? - Whatever works.<br />
25-50ish? - AC/HP, ya basically a tank with spells.<br />
50+ exp - hp/sta/ac (esp if ya in PoP zones)<br />
50+ raid - resists/hp/sta/ac (Old world onward+)<br />
<br />
Particular gear selection changes with each expansion.  One's willingness to hunt in areas that would provide a steady monetary income as well as experience or hunting in zones that provide a higher experience return with very little to no monetary return.  Or a combination of both, a higher yield exp/no plat zone then off to a low/no yield exp/high plat zone inorder to augment your gear as you lvl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Er, incase you haven't noticed, playing skill also determines the amount of times the sh*t hits the fan.  In a good group were everyone knows what they are doing that basically never happens except under unlucky circumstances.  What do you mean by 'gimpified', yes they are easier then the mobs of old, but that can be explained byt the fact that players infact get the upper hand due to the increasingly better weapons/armour what is released.<br />
<br />
<br />
[QUOTE='Xequecal'] - Panic Animal. Never, EVER use it. Why? Animals do not drop loot. If you can't solo a blue MOB with straight melee, then you need to farm plat until you can. People say Panic Animal was an amazing improvement to our class. I disagree. It lets any idiot get to 60 without any skill at all, and wearing some pretty abysmal gear. The only exception to this rule is gryphs in Jaggedpine or in NK/EK at low levels, or snow griffins in EW, because they drop money. It may be fun to get 10 levels in 3 days off rockhoppers, but you'll have gained exactly zero platinum doing it, and chances are your defense skill is 30 points behind.[/QUOTE]<br />
<br />
This has probably been said before but I'll say it again, do you know what you are actually on about?  These are a few animals which aren't too bad on the money making ide while lvling.  <br />
<br />
*Everfrost mammoths, commonly drop 2 tusks which sell for 8-10pp.<br />
*The gorillas and pandas in stonebrunt commonly drop gems ranging from 2-15pp.<br />
*As you have actually mentioned, griffs in JPF, while dropping plat the meat of these guys is in high demand and sells for 25pp each in the bazaar(on my server anyway).<br />
*Rockhoppers, they drop flawless and pristine (i think) hides, these sell for 200-300pp in the bazaar (again, on my server).<br />
<br />
Before you open your mouth, engage your brain please.  There are, to my understanding, three types of players in eq, The level obsessed, the gear/loot obsessed, and those why want to treat it as a game and want to have fun.  I wonder which one you fit under?</div></div><hr />

What a way to give them the wrong impression of a ranger.  Knowing how to CC, control aggro, exert dps, pull, tank (yes tank!), track, and everything else that being a Ranger actually means, is what makes me a part of this game.  And it makes me damn good at it too.  Not the fact that I have my epics, that only helps me perform better.  <br />

You see, in the circles I tend to hang out in, a game that is only about items is a pretty shallow one, designed for kiddies, as opposed to one that requires skill, strategy, some thought, etc.<br />
<br />
Having been gone from an EQ for quite some time, I wasn't immediately prepared to say Xequecal was incorrect.  Instead, I was wondering why I came back.<br />
<br />
But a lot of the other posts reassured me.  And made me remember all of the sucky rangers I've run into who were decked out beautifully and were completely clueless about how to play the class.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, when my ranger was growing up, we didn't have Panic Animal.  So even with my low interest in gear, I did reach points where I had to say to myself, &quot;OK, maybe it's time to see if some gear upgrades would make things easier.&quot;  Without having Panic Animal, there was a kind of natural spur to finding gear upgrades, so leveling could get very difficult without adequate gear.  So really don't know if rangers are now grossly under-equipped because of it.  I suspect though, that me in my probably antique-gear, is probably in worse shape.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, I think the idea of having &quot;a best gear for the money&quot; type guide is a great idea.  Unfortunately, it would be a very high maintenance under-taking.  I remember when the going rate for a BIBS was 500+ pp.  If you don't know what a BIBS is, the Axe of Iron Back has better stats.  :P</div></div><hr />

In the early days of the Glade, there used to be threads arguing about whether people who bought their gear had actually earned it, as opposed to people who had earned it by killing the mobs and looting the gear themselves.<br />
<br />
Sadly, that's tough to do these days when you can afford to buy something long before you reach the level where you could actually loot the item yourself.  However, if you never bought an item, but rather killed the mob yourself (with a good group, of course), your gear would be no worse off than most of the original EQ rangers.  And in my book, you'd have a better claim to valour and greatness than someone who bought their gear, no matter how better than yours it might be.</div></div><hr />

Intereseting philosophy lets look at the opposite side of said coin rather than your extremes of  Ivy vs Time gear.  The opposite being :<br />
<br />
Gear is only important up to a basic ac/stat point. Once you have enough gear that your character can take a few hits and do some nice dps and other simple things, your skill is going to determine the rest of it. If your incompetent, there are lots of things you can NEVER do, no matter how good your gear is. Conversely, excellent ability WILL make up for lack of gear .  <br />
(BTW so will that shaman etc in your groups buff spells)<br />
<br />
You might have 200kpp worth of gear, but if you're not snaring taking hits from riposte all the time, an experienced ranger that has AVERAGE gear even will still get more groups because they won't be dead on the ground wasting the clerics mana on rez when they couldn't control agro, and also not have a reputation as being an ebayer who gets everyone killed.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Higher level does make getting better gear easier, but I'd LOVE to see someone reach level 65 in Ivy. &quot;<br />

Enough with the Ivy,  anyone in ivy can go hunt mammoths or spider silk and go to the bazaar and buy  better armour.  On the other hand someone who doesn't know what to do in ornate chain, can easily go and get pasted by same said mammoths because they think they have to tank it at 25 too.<br />

Hmmm interesting point, I'm 62 and no one has EVER inspected my gear in group,  and rarely do people ask what your gear is, more often its to ask what that cool looking weapon is or to see what a fellow class member has that they can try go get.  <br />

and most people are trying to reach the middle.<br />

Also why do people have this hang up on tanking, sure we can do it if need be, and we can save lives by taking the hits instead of the caster allowing them to get their spells off, but a ranger being main tank is only an instance where you cant get a real tank or have a full group and don't want to tell someone to get lost.
