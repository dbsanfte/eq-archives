<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Someone posted this on my server board.  Generally I take these things with a grain of salt, but there's a bothersome ring of truth to it.<br />
<br />
Let me start by explaining who I am.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm an individual most of you dislike, and I understand that. I sell items and platinum in game for real life money. I have been doing this for 4 years now, and this is how I make my living. I will not be providing my email in this post, nor is this an attempt to sell items to you.<br />
<br />
This post is meant to inform you of a very serious problem you all need to be aware of.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have you noticed prices of high end items in the bazaar have doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled or more in the last 2 months?<br />
<br />
Have you noticed a serious LACK of high end items in the bazaar in the last month or so, and shrinking each day?<br />
<br />
<br />
THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DUPLICATING PLATINUM IN YOUR GAME ILLEGALLY, USING HACKS BUGS AND OR CHEATS.<br />
<br />
THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE USING HACKS AND CHEATS TO CREATE A LEVEL 65 CHARACTER WITH HUNDREDS OF AA POINTS FROM LEVEL 1 IN 24 HOURS OR LESS!<br />
<br />
<br />
Allow me to explain the platinum issue. A couple of months ago someone, or some group of people figured out how to duplicate platinum coins in Everquest. Since I am a seller of platinum and items I can see an influx of platinum into the economy of a server very quickly, as the first thing it impacts is the selling price of platinum on the auction sites.<br />
<br />
Overnight, one seller dropped the price of platinum to one half what it had been the night before. It has since dropped to one half again, and continues to fall.<br />
<br />
Of course, originally this only affected sellers such as myself. We tend to suck these things up and deal with them. They happen from time to time, and SOE is usually very quick to react to them and fix them. A normal player would not see much impact from this except possibly a couple days of increased buying and selling in the bazaar. 3 or 4 million platinum will not impact a server economy.<br />
<br />
But, since SOE has decided to NOT chase this issue down, and has allowed it to permeate the servers for nearly 2 full months, it is having a moderate and soon to be severe (if not already severe) impact on every server economy.<br />
<br />
<br />
How? Well, for one, people are starting to realize that they can sell items for 3 and 4 times their usual value. I sold a fungi tunic for 175k the other day. I was able to get 800k for a blade of carnage. 750k for a helmet of rallos zek. These items are NOT worth this much, but with plat floating around like crazy, and it being so very very cheap to come by, there is a huge influx of buyers with hundreds of thousands, or even millions of platinum to buy items with. For reference I would be lucky to get 65k for a fungi, 200k for a blade of carnage, and 150k for a helmet of rallos zek just 2 months ago.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what's wrong with that? Prices inflate over time. I bet it is just because of Lost Dungeons of Norrath.&quot;<br />
<br />
I know some of you are thinking the above. Please remember, this would not &quot;increase&quot; the value of items. This would decrease the value of items.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what's wrong with that? If prices go up on everything everyone will make more money to match it.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's the problem, everyone will not make more money. Lower end items will stay cheap. This puts the fun toys, the fungi tunic, the blade of carnage, the haste cloaks, etc. out of reach of almost every single player.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that sucks, but it will just take me longer to save up, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong. What happens when something comes into an economy in mass numbers? It becomes worthless. So, if you have platinum that is nearly worthless, what do these dupers, hackers, cheaters, whatever you would like to call them, do? Since platinum becomes de-valued, but they have an unlimited supply of it, and they want to continue making money, they do this: They whip up a batch of fresh platinum and hit the bazaar and buy any and all high end high value items available.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure they do, I don't believe you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, my traders, and the traders of other sellers I speak with, tend to offer a wide range of higher level gear in the bazaar for individuals to buy. We talk to each other, of course, and have noticed lately that our traders almost instantly sell every single high end twink item or fun piece of gear. The other night a good friend of mine sold over 4 million platinum worth of high end gear to a single person. There was no rhyme or reason to the purchase, as the items spanned several classes (it was not like some guy was making a warrior twink and bought all warrior stuff). He made an ooc saying wow, thanks ------- for buying all my stuff! And over the next few minutes began receiving tells from other traders &quot;yeah he bought all my stuff too!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
So you need to ask yourself, do you see these changes in bazaar prices lately? Have you noticed a serious lack of high end items for sale in the bazaar? When you do find a high end item, is it priced for some strange reason extremely high?<br />
<br />
Want a level 65 character and 300 AA in a single day? Well, one seller promises that, and has accomplished it. Now, simple math tells you if that was only the AA, that would be 1 AA every 3.8 minutes. Impossible, by even the best powerleveling team. A person would be extremely hard pressed to reliably get level 65 in 24 hours, let alone 65 and 300 AA points.<br />
<br />
The character comes with no skills at all. IT IS LEVELED USING DUPLICATION BUGS AND EXPLOITS THROUGH HIGH EXP QUESTS.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so people should know better, and they will get a useless character anyways so how does this affect me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Do you group in game? Well, these people are going to HAVE to group extensively to get their skills up. You can be sure they are not going to /ooc 65 WIZ LFG! I just bought this useless character and only have 100 in my casting skills so I need a group to help me practice them! (and I'll over nuke a little to get my dodge up too!). These guys will need YOU to finish the power leveling process.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is impacting YOUR game, guys. Believe me when I tell you I and others have reported and feedbacked these things until we are blue in the face. Perhaps it is not enough, which is why you are seeing this post. I urge you to look for yourself and see the messed up server economies. I urge you to send e-mail to your GMs, feedback in game, and put a bit of pressure on SOE to get this resolved quickly. If you think I am posting this for my own benefit, don't. Since my items sell for 3 or 4 x their usual cost in the bazaar I am still making the same living I was months ago. I also love playing this game. I am concerned for the well being of Everquest, and would rather not see it ruined like so many other games have been.<br />
<br />
Sony has been informed and yet they have done nothing. Their complacency has contributed to this problem.<br />
<br />
None of us want EQ to turn into one of the many games out there that have been destroyed by cheats and hacks. SOE used to be very very quick to react to these things. If you feel as I do, you will send in a petition or a feedback or an email and urge SOE to fix this NOW. You may refer them to this post if you like.<br />
<br />
I also caution you. If you were considering buying platinum or taking advantage of this &quot;powerleveling service&quot; for a level 65 character with 300 AA in 24 hours, I suggest you reconsider, as there is a very high chance that useless powereleveled character will be banned within a month (and their disclaimer only guarantees the character for 2 weeks), and there is a very high chance you could be banned for buying ill gotten platinum.<br />
<br />
Spread the word! Let people know this is going on. Let them know they can get it stopped with very little effort on their part. Feel free to cut and paste this post anywhere you like and get the word out! <br />
<br />
It would explain the recent price explosion in the Bazaar.  If it's true, there's a good chance EQ could go the way of Diablo II.  Then again, I might just be too easily convinced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It doesn't have to be duping, it could be the aftereffects of the shark bug or the temper bug or the enchanting bug still affecting the economy. But whatever the cause, pp inflation causes severe imbalances in the relative desirability of &quot;cash&quot; camps vs. &quot;item&quot; camps, undermines built-in plat sinks, affects trade skills like JC, and so on.<br />
<br />
As far as the latest Yantis scheme (&quot;Get a level 65 character with 300 AAs tomorrow!&quot;) goes, it's a whole different ball of wax. Every bit as bad as devaluing platinum, probably more so, but different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Things that make you go...&quot;Hmmmmm&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am not quite sure as to why the original poster is trying to make people aware of someone duping plat when he himself is someone obtaining items/pp for selling outside the game. He is, in essence, complaining that someone is better at it than him and therefore wants them stopped. Would he then stop because it's wrong? Or does he just want his profit margin back?<br />
<br />
Sounds fishy to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">According to the post, Mr. plat seller is not harming us players, but these unscrupulous dupers are hurting his cash flow. Oh, and us players too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The influx of platinum recently was due to a bug where some mobs were dropping up to 10k-20k plat.  Verant has since fixed this issue, and unless there is another way to dupe platinum things should be back to normal soon.<br />
<br />
About the powerleveling to 65 with 300aa's .. any new level 65 toons I see running around will be eyed suspiciously by me for a while =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know some of you are thinking the above. Please remember, this would not &quot;increase&quot; the value of items. This would decrease the value of items.<br />
<br />
<br />
How do you figure?  Most items gained in LDoN are no-drop.  Since a good quantity of people are now off getting gear in LDoN, not many people are left gather dropable gear.  <br />
<br />
The fact that the LDoN gear may be better means nothing.  Too much of it is No-Drop.  Most high end droppable items are used by twinks in the first place.  New characters don't have the bankroll to get a fungi, and the best gear is still no-drop, so high end folks usually have more of that.  The only ones left spending plat on high-end items are twinks  (there are of course exceptions, but this is a general rule).<br />
<br />
This being true, twinks can't get good gear from their higher alt's LDoN points because the gear is no-drop.  Therefore they are left buying the same gear they always were.  However, FAR less people are getting exp/loot from mobs with droppable gear (because they are in LDoN) therefore the supply of buyable gear is greatly diminished.<br />
<br />
Econ 101...  LDoN does nothing to reduce the amount of twinks (buyers) in game (demand stays constant), but it does drastically reduce the number of folks fighting mobs with droppable gear (supply decreases).  Result -- price inflation.<br />
<br />
I am not arguing any of his other points, and if they are creating tons of plat and buying up all the high droppable gear, then there is much to be concerned about.  I am just saying that the current prices in the bazaar are not necissarily proof of foul play, and that his assumption that LDoN will lower prices is completely incorrect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not everyone is in LDoN, not everyone can replace all their gear via LDoN, and you can't get but a few spells from LDoN.  I've bought like 4 things via LDoN Merchants after doing 110+ adventures and *maybe* got 2 dropped items worth using in all that time...and 2 of the 4 things I've purchased are augs and 1 I've already outgrown and replaced (via the bazaar).  The 65's that do LDoN probably already have great gear and are likely filling in gaps or enhancing what they already have.<br />
<br />
There is still a large demand for standard gear and bazaaring to get coin to pay for overpriced spells.  I don't think LDoN is impacting the server economies that much.<br />
<br />
I don't know about duping and whatnot.  Xev's economy has been a mess since I started there a few months ago...people often bring up the 'shark thing' in public channels in regards to the screwed ecomony.  Given the history of exploits in EQ I wouldn't be surprised if someone was duping stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
I've read about the 'shark thing' online recently (link somewhere in a recent thread here?) and heard it mentioned on Xev several times.  Apparently, on some servers (but not all?), at some point relatively recently, some shark mobs were dropping 10-20kpp per kill - so a bunch of folks farmed the bejesus out of them then many supposedly bought all kinds of expensive goods in the bazaar to &quot;launder&quot; their ill-gotten funds.  The thread I read today said that some of the folks that took advantage of this are being tracked down and punished (via rollbacks and such).  I don't know how much or to what exetent any of this is true.  In the thread I read one person (from Xev) admitted to farming the sharks, making tons of plats, getting caught, and getting rolled back.  Anyways, if you spend time in the bazaar on Xev and anyone happens to mention how screwed prices are in general for big ticket items, someone will inevitably mention the shark thing as being responsible for it all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There is definately something fishy going on. I've never bought or sold anything, but I like to keep an eye on the various auction sites from time to time. For two reasons mostly, the economics of the whole thing just interests me and I like to spot ebayed characters so I know who to avoid as much as possible. Lately there has been an obscene ammount of plat available for almost every server, the likes of which I have never seen in the year and a half or so since I started watching every once in a while. <br />
<br />
As with anything where money is involved (lots and lots of money in this case) there will develop a group of people willing to do anything to make more money. You can bet your last dollar that if there is any kind of bug in the game that allows duping plat, items, ect, the yantis' of the world will take advantage of it. Happened in sept 2002 with someone dupping blue diamonds hard core on Torv, sure theres still exploits in the game now that haven't been patched. If someone out there is making money off of it they'll find it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is also another tradeskill cheese tactic going around where you can do a quick combine and sell back to a vendor at a profit.  Few dozen macrobots running this 24/7 could increase pp supply a little as well.<br />
<br />
Not saying that there isnt a duping exploit around right now too, just that I haven't heard about it (not that I probably would) and these other factors could explain it.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to hold your wealth in a fairly even mix of pp and goods, that way you won't get hit by inflation or deflation when it comes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I check IGE and MSS from time to time, mainly out of curiousity.  Over the last month, their buying prices for platinumhave dropped to half of what they were.  On the IGE site, it even says:<br />
<br />
We apologize for lowering our purchase prices, but we are left with no choice. It is rumored that our competitor has access to a large duplication bug (an exploit to make free platinum by the millions) and has lowered his prices both for buying and selling. Because of these drastic price changes being made by our competitor, we are left with no choice but to constantly lower our buy prices to be able to be competitive a few days after they lower their prices. We do not want to lower prices, but the rumored dupe bug is the cause. <br />
<br />
Our competitor's behavior leads us to believe he has decided to destroy the market and only cares about making a quick last buck, while shamelessly endangering the livelyhood of hundreds of EverQuest sellers. We hope you will remember this once prices are back to normal.<br />
<br />
This, combined with the fact that I have watched prices for pretty much everything jump up and in some cases just skyrocket, leaves no doubt in my mind that the EQ economy is fubar'd.  I know for a fact there is a guy on my server who is buying up expensive items with duped plat in order to destroy them.  He's up to 11 aon's and 22 manastones, and who knows what else.  He offered me 300k for my aon.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what exactly it is, but something is wrong with the EQ economy and needs to be addressed.  However, SOE's appearant lack of effort to fix this problem makes me wonder =\</div></div><hr />

actually if u think about it this way....<br />
<br />
if u consider the fact that many people are upgrading through ldon all of their twink gear is going back to the bazaar, and there are some droppable items that have very nice stats that are lowering the price of other Twink gear.<br />
<br />
just my opinion both seem logical, i have a feeling they balance eachother out.... mostly...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Conclusion: it doesn't affect me anyway since those were all items I would have had to farm myself somehow if I ever hoped to acquire them (since I dont care for plat farming).

EQ/Verant/SOE has always had philosphical problems with real life $ for virtual goods. I dont see much about them banning etc anymore for this activity.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">All games have some crotch-ride (uncomfortable feelings) with players making money FROM TS's. But by and large it's because of blinders worn by said company.  Allow me to elaborate:<br />
<br />
Stop me if you've heard this before:<br />
<br />
1) &quot;The first Jedi won't appear for a year or so.&quot;<br />
<br />
2) &quot;C'mon, do you really think players would hit 'combine' for hours on end?&quot;<br />
<br />
The answer is yes of course they would. <br />
<br />
Now personally, I have no problem with a person, who of their own volition, sitting on their butt and making some money TS'ing. If that's what floats yer on-line boat - more power to ya buddy. Anybody whose every tried scrimping and saving plat to raise skills knows what a pain in yer gazach (butt) it can be.<br />
<br />
Now granted, a 250 pp return on a 40 pp investment is darned nice. I play the stock market and a 600% return is, while not unseemly, a bit disproportionate. C'mon - we're not ALL CEO's :) (michael eisner die in a fire)<br />
<br />
And frankly shouldn't TS'ers get SOMETHING back for their time? Not to interject reality into a computer game, but take wood, varnish, nails and a hammer, inject time and a skill not all of us have - and you end up with a bookcase. You sell said bookcase for more than the sum of the components.<br />
<br />
THAT I don't see a problem with. And quite frankly if the &quot;brain trust&quot; over at Sony DIDN'T think that players would sit there for hours hitting combine then they underestimate (AGAIN) their playing and paying community.<br />
<br />
Now the bug insofar as: the Sharks and the Temper?  That's different. <br />
<br />
The use of macros to over-utilize (or 'exploit' if you so choose) the TS ability - yes different. I'm not versed enough in macros to suggest how Sony can stop them. <br />
<br />
The use of the Cleric / Enchanter combo at Sebilis Guard (Bugs)? Different than all of the above because it uses macros but also takes up a spot.<br />
<br />
Then we come to Yantis. Either utilizing multiple TS'ers, multiple PL'ers, identifying multiple quest bugs or a combination of all three he offers: Plat and or characters. Someone wiser than me suggested (since he lives in San Diego) he is paying people (possibly illegal aliens or kids) to utilize all the methods, agreeable or not, to generate income.  (Btw Yantis also spells 'Sanity'.  Ironic)<br />
<br />
I'm not worried about some unemployed iron worker or housewife in her underwear utilizing TS's to make some money. <br />
<br />
Macroing for profit? Not 'fair' (With all due respect to your computer skills)<br />
<br />
Identifying high level quest exploits? Probably borderline. <br />
<br />
But (and if you've stuck with me this far) what does this mean or show about Sony?<br />
<br />
Two things. First, they do NOT test their product. And second, while they continue to underestimate their customer base, I'm not sure Sony employees play the same game we do. Whether it's /bot 65, or /assign_Phat_L3wt_01 to account_absor_slot_013, whether it's idiotic statements such as &quot;Classes are not that out of balance,&quot; or dumb nerfs, their priorities and foci seem, for lack of a better term - out of whack.</div></div><hr />

Thats funny as hell.  How is it wrong that they use tradskills to combine 2 items and sell back to make a profit.  What is wrong is that they will use a script to do the combines for them and run 24 hours a day.<br />
<br />
If you doubt the power of scripting and such,  consider this:<br />
<br />
I personally know someone that uses a script to get aa's.  It's not fast, but it is safe.  The person runs this and keeps 5 spawns killed in a zone.  The script is smart enough to: pull mob, back pet off until mob hits the puller, cast dots, detect if the mob will run and root, loot the mob, move back to the original starting position after the fight - mobs push, buff pet &amp; self, detect gm's in the zone, can camp out if anything weird happens and such, etc.  Nets about 1 aa per 10 hours of running and 1k in plat.<br />
<br />
Scripting is a problem, but until SoE does something about it, it's going to continue to happen.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but you really don't know what you are talking about.  First of all, all three of the programs you listed work just fine in windows.  Second of all, you are right that there were macros made that made money off of tradeskills.  However, they averaged about 1k an hour.  There were a few macros that made more money, but there were only specific spots where you could use said macros (just one for the 30k/hour macro), which made it much easier for GM's to stop.  Third, they fixed this and you can no longer make money this way.  Merchants don't pay as much for arrows as they used to.  Finally, this isn't even &quot;duping&quot;.  Duping is when you use a bug in the game engine to duplicate plat or items.  i.e. you have 100k, and somehow manage to turn it in to 200k by abusing the engine.<br />
<br />
What you said would have been accurate 6 months ago, but it isn't any more.  I don't know what they are doing nowadays, but it is much more extreme than macroing ever was.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Edit - pardon the length...<br />
<br />
Here is the mudflation problem - there is a limit to the amount of economy growth created by the way the loot tables are done.  Basically - you can only get so much direct plat from hunting.  We've all had to live with the crappy amount of plat we get from hunting, because it's sony's misguided attempt to control the economy.  If you kill and autosplit the cash from every mob as it enters the world, you have the upper limit of a specific amount of cash that can enter the economy in a set time period.<br />
<br />
Then you have loot.  Loot sold to another player doesn't change the total amount of cash available in the world.  Loot sold to a vendor does, because every vendor has access to an infinite amount of cash.  If you kill everything, sell it to a vendor with max faction/charisma, and autosplit it, you have an upper limit to the amount of cash coming into the world from direct loot in a set time period.<br />
<br />
Duping is its own problem.  Taking 1k plat and doing something stupid that makes it 2k plat needs to be handled better by the engine.  For example, there was a bug at one point that if you were able to shadow step at the moment of death, you could live and die, so you had everything on your person intact and a corpse with a copy of everything. So now there's an out of vision element inflating the economy, with no control at all.<br />
<br />
Sony's practice on tradeskills has been to try to make them a net loss to the economy overall.  If you take two pieces of loot or a vendor bought item and combine, the result should be less valuable to a vendor than the componants, at least in Sony's model.  <br />
<br />
I've noticed a drop in vendor price on several tradeskill items over the years.  Some announced, many not.  For example, iksar cultural armor used to be mildly profitable for vendor sale.<br />
<br />
The reason these &quot;bugs&quot; exist is because of the complexity of the interactions between all of the tradeskill componants, the method used to combine them, the success/failure rate, and the vendor price of each individual componant and the results of any combine.  Sony should have created a tool long ago that looked at all of these branches in order to set the prices.  Unfortunately, they don't.  They rely on catching macroers, so there is another 'illegal' element adding to the economy.<br />
<br />
In order to keep inflation down, money has to come out of the economy or the number of consumers needs to grow to keep the supply and demand of cash roughly static.  That isn't happening.  The main sinks are tradeskills (which are broken), food (which doesn't really cost much), players leaving the game (sell characters on ebay or pimp out their stuff before they go), some tradeskill componants and quests, and horses.  The consumer base isn't growing much either.  Almost all of the n00bs are twinks and bypass most of the previous generation of equipment for banked or bazaar'd high level items.<br />
<br />
I don't know what the answer is for the economy.  No one likes having to repair or recharge items.  No one likes having to hold an item because a vendor has limited cash.  No one likes the fact that tradeskills aren't immediately profitable.  No one wants to pay a bank surcharge or vendor processing fee or taxes.  No one wants to start the game with a debt that has to be paid back over time.  OTOH, many don't like the fact that the current economy is tilted towards macroers, dupers, ebayers, and pharmers.</div></div><hr />

 It makes me wonder how SOE continues to get away with letting stuff like this fly. Someone already said it, Diablo is upon you, the duplicating has taken over.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Everyone needs to understand that there are 2 main issues here.<br />
<br />
1. Macro'ing<br />
2. duping<br />
<br />
<br />
I can tell you all you need to know about macro's.  Basically anything you can do sitting at your computer playing everquest, you could probably write a script to do that for you.  The risk for the scripter is that they are very obvious about how they do it.  Good scripters have ways around all that.  There are ways to make your actions in game seem more random.  ex. A script written to practice casting spells would have random intervals between casts.  Responses to /tells could have one of many afk messages or responses, like: &quot;Me no speak english&quot;.  LOL<br />
Detecting a GM in the zone, or /say's around you character should be dealt with as well.  Writing a script to do a few combines and sell to the vendor would be very easy as long as you don't need to move around the zone and buy and sell from different vendors.<br />
<br />
<br />
When it comes to duping, it has something to do with tricking the game engine to duplicate the item in question.  I heard about a guy duping blue diamonds by going LD at a critical point or his system procecessor was so slow that it tricked the game engine to duplicate the item somehow.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure it's not a big deal for these plat sellers to have half a dozen or more of these running all the time.

This is hearsay only, but I'm given to understand that macro programs can access memory directly and use vendors and tradeskill containers from any point in the zone, no character movement required.<br />

Until recently, when you zoned into South Qeynos, you'd see a few /anon and /afk people stuck in some of the ODDEST places in the zone - generally jammed so far into a corner that you'd be hard pressed to see much more than their name blinking if you /targeted them.<br />

Well, way back there were programs that messed with outgoing packet data. Since in-zone movement is done on the client side and since the server side was instructed to trust the client in that respect (mostly for performance reasons since relating every ASWD keystroke to the server would be a nightmare), you could achieve an unlimited in-zone mobility. If memory serves, this led to some major abuses on PvP server(s), a public outcry, and, eventually, a mass banning of the exploiters.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">The people buying good items at insane prices are stocking up for when the eq economy goes into freefall.  Obtaining large amounts of plat is obviously trivial to them, so paying twice, three times as much for an item as it's 'worth' is inconsequential, and when the economy does flush, these people will be sitting on a large stock of very nice tradable, sellable items.<br />
<br />
They are investing.  How disgustingly Real-Life.</div></div><hr />

They don't care about your account, they don't care about your quest that got screwed up, they don't care about 'balance', they don't care about your guild that got run over or trained.<br />

They have spreadsheets and people doing analysis to show them how to max profits and min losses. They are interested in turning a buck.<br />
<br />
You get disgusted and quit and sell your account. Think they're pissed? Sorta. They're mad they didn't get their CUT, but hey, if somebody buys your account, that's $12.95 a month. So what if the individual doesn't know how to play the class. THEY DON'T CARE.<br />
<br />
EQ generates maybe 50 million gross a year. Let's be generous and say 100 million a year. That my friend is a blip on the Sony financial charts. As long as they aren't LOSING money on EQ, then they are happy.<br />

12/04/2003 11:41 PM CST<br />
WARNING: This post discusses the current issue of flooding platinum onto the live servers. I am choosing not to participate in the scheme, but I feel I owe it to the EQ community to divulge what I know. It is not the actual event that bothers me, it is what the existence of such a thing entails. Also, I am not from your server, and will not be leaving my game name or server name.<br />
<br />
Im not going to flatter this post with many of my 'theories', so I am going to cut straight into the event and then briefly discuss what it means. Please copy this if you wish. Im trying to get this out to as many server boards as I can.<br />
<br />
There is a &quot;banker&quot; named Banker Aderodh that has been spawning in the dungeon Befallen off the adjacent zone WC. The bankers account is not tied to your global bank. When you transfer coin from gold to platinum, it goes at a 1/1 rate. But when you transfer it back to gold, it goes at a 1/10 ratio. This process can be quickly used to earn a &quot;monumental&quot; amount of platinum. I am a bard, thus I have track. I had never seen this name in befallen before, so I checked it out. Its a nervous habit of mine to transfer all of my change into platinum, so I noticed the bug. I then saw someone who obviously new about this come and port out. I petitioned the character.<br />
<br />
There is no way this is an un-intentional glitch in the game. The designers must have made some sort of code that separates this banker from the global banks.<br />
<br />
The reason I am telling this to everyone is quite simple in my eyes. I do not want my favorite hobby to be ruled by ebayers. The economics of this exploit only hurt the honest player. Now, either it will be even grounds, or this will get fixed. Do with this post what you will, thank you for listening.<br />
<br />
**PS: It was around 7pm in game time when the NPC spawned. I found him near the well to the bottom floor. I have no further information about the spawn time/place for the NPC.<br />

True, but that doesn't mean they aren't interested in stopping dupe and macro money-cheats. There aren't many things I can think off that would kill EQ off as quickly as an endless influx of duped plat and I would hope that SOE recognizes that fact. ... if not, I'm sure a lot of people are gonna be gone 6 months down the road.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Fearcazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">This is mudflation. There are like millions of plat that enters the world but never leaves each day. VI tried making money sinks like horses and Plane of Sky. Remember when the game came out? Money was only good to buy food and water when your lvl 50. No one will sell you a Short Sword of Yakesa or Manastone.<br />
<br />
The prices in the bazaar went up because the population of the server is much richer now and LDON has something to do with it as well. More people doing LDON equals less item farmers so items enter the world slower such as Fungi. No one on my server camps fungi. How many we have on the server is how many there is. I have seen two fungi tunics for sale in 3 months. <br />
<br />
I sell 10 Dose gate potions from 4,500pp to 6,000pp because there are so many rich people. I do drop the potions down to 3,000pp if I don't sale my batch in a few days.<br />
<br />
Duping has been going on since day 1. I have seen people running around in Crush Bone with full steel armor at level 5. My guild on TM duped SoDs at the bazaar arena. PP dupes were done with 2boxing and zoning for months. Elephants in NK dropped 10K to 20K couple of years ago much like how the sharks were droping. Even GMs helped by /kill adds while a group kill the name. GM got fired. Biktik Quickkick was his name I think.<br />
<br />
The poster is just some small fish trying to be like Yanti and can't beat his prices. I like to complain too and say Walmart is killing mom and pop shops because they can price cut. I used to own a car shop that sells aftermarket parts for imports until Summit, a drag racing american car mail order company, entered the import market and was selling stuff cheaper than what I can buy from the distrubuter. Summit and Walmart must be duping Cash!!!!<br />
<br />
There are also diamonds that goes for millions. It's supply and demand. I wasn't duping PS2 or Cash when I ebayed PS2s for $600 during christmas. I was just lucky enough to be working for a game company that I can buy consoles before they hit stores. We even had a LeAnn Rhimes concert here and was sold out before it went on sale to the public. The people who put the concert together for the fair bought all the tickets and they resold them 3 times the value. Well, the city said screw that and we never gotten another concert in town again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Mudflation is one thing, but there has been a huge rate of increase in available plat in the past few weeks and nothing to explain it. Mudflation steadily increases the ammount over time. LDoN definately isn't generating all of it.<br />
<br />
I would agree that if that banker story is real, it has probably been the source of all the duped plat. It was also rather convientent that the servers came down within hours of that being posted. I agree with what some on the cleric board have said this definately smells like an inside job. They didn't want to fix it until someone pointed out exactly what was going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">I was just sitting in the bazaar and heard people talking about what had happened that caused the infux of plat.

<br />
I may be paranoid, but doesn't that seem a little like Sony has something built into EQ that monitors what webpages you visit while EQ is running and if it matches their one of their flagged websites, boom, reboot?  It's all a conspiracy!</div></div><hr />

Both my traders have over 1 million plat atm - usually they top out at 3-400K.  There is also nothing of any value to buy in bazaar, compared to months past.  Something is definitely stinky in Denmark and I hope they get it fixed soon and really whang the guys doing it.  I have grown to enjoy trading in bazaar almost as much as the game itself.

Yes, sony does need to crack down on it, then the plat you've made with your casino will be worth more.  Or perhaps the plat you've made selling your hurricane tradeskill armor as elemental?  Possibly the plat you've made buying any shaman items you can get your hands on and tripleing the price?  Of course, you want it fixed, you've made all the plat off it your getting, and want the prices to go back down.<br />
That being said, it really is a problem.  Anyone who isnt cheating cant compete.  If sony doesn't fix it, it WILL be diablo2 all over again, at least on Firiona Vie.  Nodrop will give some protection to the other servers.  <br />

<br />
All of the above posters are right to one extent or another.  Kind of the nature of complex systems.<br />
<br />
* There is mudflation.<br />
* There are pp exploits.<br />
* There are bugs like the sharks droping 1k pp.<br />
* There are pp farmers/resellers that drive up bazaar prices so people will have greater reason to buy their pp with real $$<br />
* There is a lack of old-style droppable items because aren't killing the older mobs that drop stuff we're used to seeing.<br />
*There are tradeskill snafu's that sometimes add tons of pp to the economy.<br />
 <br />
All of these contribute over time to the insanely inflated prices and a surfeit of pp for the lucky few.<br />
<br />
All of which make it very hard for an honest player to build a decent char with his own effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Your deluding yourselves if you do not think there has been some MASSIVE large-scale infux of pp across the board on every server in the game. Sure there have always been bugs, and TS combines that netted a few more pp than they costed, and duping schemes that worked sometimes, and sometimes not (I once duped my corpse accidently, and a GM showed up withint 2 minutes). <br />
<br />
This is different than all that. This is different than some macro sitting around 24/7 farming gems in OS, or making 2 pp of some tradeskill combine to net 30K a day. This is MILLIONS of pp flooding into the servers. <br />
<br />
This dindnt build up over a long period of time. LDoN has been our a while. I can make far more cash PP farming cash than doing LDoN. This happened FAST, a month, maybe 1.5 months. I shop in the bazaar all the time, and this hit FAST.<br />
<br />
The banker bug may have been it, I don't know. But if you think SOE wants to see EQ turn into Diablo then you are quite mistaken. People would leave the game in DROVES. Yeah, its not cost effective to track down the silly chanter/cleric combos farming pp in OS, or try to find ever 2 pp loophole in tradeskill combos, but this is DIFFERENT. <br />

Trust me, they care.</div></div><hr />

Not necessarily. There are a few bankers in fairly obscure places. Runnyeye has one. I remember running down there to bank having 5 or 6 goblins beating on my. Even though the bankers scowled, I could still use the bank. Heck, I used to pull him up to the zone so people camping up there could bank as well, LOL. Crystal Caverns is another example of an obscure bank zone. Smack in the middle of completely &quot;scowls&quot; dungeon, is that little fort with a banker and merchants. Comes in handy when your farming Velium.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, what it did was convert gold to plat at a 1:1 ratio, instead of 10:1. So starting with 1 pp, you could convert it to 10 gold, convert that to 10 pp, then convert the 10 pp into 100 gold, back to 100 pp. Few more like this and you are at 10 million in a few seconds. <br />
<br />
Its very possible that it was an inside job, but I am not ruling out the possibility that SOE stuck a banker in Befallen for higher levels to use, and he was simply bugged. Its close to WC, which has both WIZ and DRU ports, close to EC LDoN, etc etc. Bugs happen. <br />
<br />
And to be perfectly honest, I dont WANT to know if they were hacked or it was an inside job. I don't have to know every internal detail of how this game works. It matters none to me, personally, except my tradeskills are on hold (cept stuff I can raise using store-bought) for a time, and I sold a few high-end items recently that I had kinda  big numbers on (cause I am of the attitude if someone pays that fine, if they dont, I can use on my next twink), but I sold them before any real &quot;news&quot; hit. <br />
<br />
Regardless, bug, insider, hacker, they BETTER fix it, and keep it fixed. I don't want to play EQuiablo.</div></div><hr />

Right... multiplies your plat by 10 every time you exchange plat -&gt; gold -&gt; plat.  Pretty much what I said. ;)</div></div><hr />
