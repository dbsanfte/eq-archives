Superior Healing is also an old world cleric spell, so it is going to be available in a bajillion cleric guilds around the world, in addition to 50+ places for shamans and druids. Immobilize seems to be both a cleric and int caster old world spell, so it's going to be available in both cleric and int caster guilds, in addition to 50+ spots for shamans. Listing all of those vendors might be more trouble than it's worth. There is also now a DOT vendor in shar vahl, 2nd floor of the alchemy shop, should sell same 49+ spells as Stearn Bearjumper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I might be missing spots in Cabilis or Shar Vahl, but according to Caster's Realm and Illia's Bestiary, here's a smattering: <br />
<br />
The same two vendors apply for the 49 spells Abolish Disease, Envenomed Bolt, and Plague:<br />
Stragak (Innothule Swamp) (1183, 542)<br />
Starn Bearjumper (Everfrost) (2871, -3437)<br />
<br />
Frenzied Spirit: Analya (West Karana) (loc approx -4250, -2500)<br />
<br />
You forgot Chloroblast, at level 55:<br />
Rushka Deklamoor (East Commonlands) (loc uncertain, near Shady)<br />
and Harnessing of Spirit, 49:<br />
Herol Beaufodal (Shadow Haven) (approx 100,1100 - underground through the wis caster guild teleporter)<br />
Unknown (Shar Vahl) (approx 150, 90 - underground through the palace)<br />
<br />
Then for the Kunark spells Turgur's Insects, Regrowth, Deliriously Nimble, Ice Strike, Riotous Health, Annul Magic, Talisman of Kragg, Celerity, Maniacal Strength, Mortal Deftness, and Unfailing Reverence, I don't have names but zone and locs are:<br />
(Firiona Vie) (-3896, 1661)<br />
(Overthere) (2782, 2364)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks, soupy, this is very helpful.  Like an idiot I was missing Immobilize, Regrowth, and Turgur's because I totally forgot to check Firiona Vie.</div></div><hr />
