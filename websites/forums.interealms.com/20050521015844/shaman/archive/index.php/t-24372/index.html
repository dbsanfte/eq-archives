<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The subject is the question. How does your guild distribute the new OoW runes? My guild just hit the tip of the iceberg on theses runes and can't seem to come up with a way to hand them out in a fair manner. Some want to roll, some want them to be charged like loot, some want them to be assigned to top raiders. So I'm here for some anwers. Help me out please.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So far only gotten the 69 runes to drop with the guild I'm in. At first we let everyone roll that attended the raid. Since several people (mainly the ones that were 69+) were angered that level 66 people were rolling on runes they wouldn't be able to use for months, we had a poll and now only the people who can use the runes can roll. It makes more sense that those who can use them immediately get them first. At least to me it does. Although, I've not been lucky enough to get one yet. hehe...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my guild spell drops are randomed according to raid attendance. I kinda like the system, as it rewards those who raid more, and yet doesn't force you to spend DKP on spells. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We do alpha order no matter if its 69 or 70. So Bards first and Wizards being last on that list till it comes back around. Then with in the class themselves its left up to us to decide how to handle the runes. We just decided that those on the most and been in the guild the longest get the first runes and on top of it in the case of the shaman it takes 3 runes to get our first group Wushi spell..so we each passed till one shaman had the group version.<br />
<br />
Its working nicely. Couple things to keep in mind though. You can single group lvl 70 runes if you know where to hunt and same can be said with 69's. It greatly helps you if you dont solely count on raids for your runes and also that your guild set aside some time and actually go after the rune droppers for a couple nights here and there to get the ball rolling.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The first few to drop in our guild were done distributing them to the buffage classes. So a couple clr to get new symbol, druids to get steeloak, shm to get focus and pallys to get brells, bards for songs and chanters for c6. This i believe was basically the idea so that we get the max HP benefits and mana regen for the guild</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Given to buffing classes who's next spell is raid beneficial.  <br />
And you have to be able to use the spell right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We've done officer decided like all other loot calls for the guild. Initial runes have been going to get raid useful important spells. New versions of group buffs. Brells, symbol, 9, focus, etc. New mezes for chanters. New luls for monks. When distrubiting rune for those new spells people had to be of level to use the spells and was based on attendance. We're getting you spell xyz so you can mgb it on raids so we want someone thats gonna be there.<br />
<br />
We're getting close to being done with the important raid spells at which point we'll start disributing them more so that everyone can get spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seniority.  We have Seniority of everyone who ever attended a raid back to 1/1/2002.  For GoD runes, the Raid leader says 'send tells if you need X rune'.  The person with the highest seniorty would get.  I'm not sure how this has been adjusted in OoW though.  Its really the only way you can be fair to all classes who need them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whatever works for you, but I gotta question this one:<br />
<br />
<br />
SO a level 66 who has been in the guild forever but only plays once a month or so when the guild is raiding picks up that lvl 70 rune he will probably never use. <br />
<br />
How is this fair to the newer folks who worked just as hard on the raid as the most senior folks?  Or for that matter to any of the level 70 folks who can use the rune now?<br />
<br />
Is your guild a union?  Y'all in AFLCIO? <br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tempting</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My guild is too small to worry about this, but I know I'd be totally ticked off is someone that couldn't use an item, any item, was given the item before someone that could and that is on the raid.  I would suggest treating these as &quot;uber&quot; loot (which, for now at least, they are).<br />
