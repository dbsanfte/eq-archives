Any suggestions on what recipes to try for 200+?<br />
Ones that are fast and not TOO expensive?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Started doing one that trivials up at 234 and costs around 68pp.  10k down and 12 skill-ups so far.  Going by this, 70k will be about right.</div></div><hr />

Can anyone confirm that they did, indeed, raise the augment trivials? If so, this is nothing short of retarded and another example of Sony's infamous &quot;Give a little, take a lot more.&quot;</div></div><hr />

That does nothing for us except make us spend more plat upping our skill.  If it doesn't give us a better chance at sucesses, *** is the point?  Sheesh!<br />
<br />
It's nice to be able to get the title, but I'd rather have a better chance at making an aug!</div></div><hr />

I spent 3k on Elixir of Divine endurance, but didn't get any skill ups, so I switched to Elixir of greater concentration.  and spent the remaining plat there.<br />
<br />
I do have lots of potions though.  I'm gonna try to sell em and see if I can make a little back :)<br />
<br />
I was fully buffed with 315 wis when I did this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they upped the trivial on the augments..then the extra skill is just retarded.  They just made it so people that had 200 skill will never get one made and to get even the small chance from before, you have to spend another 100k to get up to 255.  I'm quite sad that they did this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i am waiting to skill up until we find higher level potions that cost less per combine...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sumdaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Poison awareness IV is an expensive combine. But the merchant buys it back for 126pp and change per potion. This is the cheapest route to 228. Took about 9 stacks, I had 10 stacks of the part from gunthak on me so that worked out well :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any of the awareness Iv potions triv at 228 and have the same cost to make. Cost to make is ~160plat and sell back is ~ 126pp so cost per is about 34pp on success or about half the cost of Elixir Of Divine Endurance since they sell back for next to nothing. Also takes your skill a bit farther.<br />
<br />
Obviously you want a high success rate so works best with aa's or a larger skill mod item or both. I have an umbracite orb but no aa's so it was below my modified skill from the start and I had low fail rate. Did 200 combines and got 10 points and ended up spending ~7k. Or about 35pp a combine. Definitely cheaper way to do it if you can keep the fails down.<br />
<br />
Wish I had your skill up rate tho, 28 skill ups in 9 stacks is one skill up every 6 or 7 combines and thats amazing. I ended up doing exactly 1 in 20 which is more common from what I've seen and read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Went from 200-222 using Magic awareness IV potions. Spent around 20k.</div></div><hr />

i had 405 wis and the philosofer stone (10% alchemy mod).<br />
<br />
and my first skill up went after 39th combine and after 109 combines i  am at 203 (from 200).<br />
<br />
humm this look bad? or only unlucky?<br />
<br />
a chance i didn t miss many times, i think i missed only 4 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Thats a little low but not horribly so. I did 200 combines and got 10 points and was about what I expected. I would have expected 5 skill ups in 100 combines so 3 is a little low but at that sample size I'm pretty sure it's gonna be in the margin of error. Just some bad luck really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I think I skilled up every 30-40 combines. Not sure how many combines I did total.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Did another 200 combines today and got up to 226 on awareness IV potions. Cost again about 7k. So total cost to 226 so far has been about 14-15k. Not sure if I'm going to try and get those last 2 points of skill on awareness potions. I think i'm going to stop for now and see what potions get found in DoN. ~34 pp per combine to skill up at this point isn't likely to be beaten. 72pp per combine might be tho.</div></div><hr />

Before I even started to mass produce these, I made 20 singles of each and like a drug dealer on the streets, I would hand a couple out to the casters of my group, or lone casters that were soloing. It was not long that I started getting orders..I charged below cost, figuring I was helping to pay for skillups, and as skillups increased and failures deminished..below cost became cost...Virtually cost free for skillup to 200 and beyond..yes sir..I love alchemy..it has paid for Drogs for all my toons as well as a sweet piece of armor or two. I cant wait to level beyond 65 and AA my way to 250 and better for Augs.</div></div><hr />

I was on episode 32 out of 51. so I know whats gonna happen for a little while o_o;<br />
<br />
now there is Naruto, which gave me my anime fix for a while. but it was just liscensed last week....got me pissed again....fantastic series...but it will be near 2 1/2 years from this summer (when it starts airing) before they get to the point where I am now. (this is, of course, if they are going to show 1 new episode a week, like they are currently doing with Full Metal Alchemist, currently Naruto is currently on episode 123 in Japan, out of a so-far-planned 250ish episode series.)<br />
<br />
now I get to sit back and be bitchy about bad translation...lol..<br />

sorry for the derail guys. continue :)</div></div><hr />

sorry for the derail guys. continue :)<br />
<br />
I have all 51 episodes of the Japanese subbed version on my computer :)<br />
The englished dubbed version on CN isn't too bad really, it's better than the dubbed verion of Gundam Seed(which I also have all subbed episodes of).<br />
I am an anime freak as well, as you can tell :)<br />
DBZ, Kenshin, GS, FMA, Wolf'sRain...the list goes on......and I have a big hardrive :D<br />

Anyway, sorry for another derail lol</div></div><hr />
