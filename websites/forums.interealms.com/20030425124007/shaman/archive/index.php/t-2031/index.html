<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can't find this anywhere, and does it stack with regular hastes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Haste percentage is Level+10, caps at 40% (level 30). It is a spell effect, so it stacks with Items and a couple songs but not other spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Odd.  I had a log-parsin' number-crunchin' monk friend (50s) who said it seemed about 60%.<br />
<br />
Either way, extremely helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">But the problem with it is the duration.  Is it not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup. 3 minutes for the Vial of Tamed Mercury(costs about 37pp/attempt), 5 mins for Adrenaline Tap (costs about 64pp/attempt). Definitely not cost effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fergol Phoenix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Made a couple of these tonight and gave them to the tanks in my group. Just wanted their opinions on it, and they said it wasn't worth the money to make them. Just my 2 copper.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sheymalra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is anything having to do with alchemy cost effective?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm... how to put it delicately...<br />
<br />
No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thats not true Shandy.<br />
<br />
SoW potions are most definately cost effective.<br />
The ingredients for an attempt at a SoW potion cost 5.25plat. I fail about 1 time in 20 attempts. This makes the average cost of a 10 shot SoW potion just a smidgin over 55 plat. I can always sell SoW potions at 100plat per 10 shot. So I make just under 45 plat clear profit per 10 shot - i.e 81% profit.<br />
<br />
Sure I have invested a large chunk of time and money into alchemy, but most of that has happened after SoW became trivial. I would estimate that I make around about a dozen 10shot SoW potions per week. Around half of these go to guildies for 70 plat, athe rest sell to the general populace for 100 plat. So, in an average week I make around 360plat profit out of SoW potions. On blaance, this profit will either be plowed back into the pottomless pit that is alchemy advancement, or spent on candy.<br />
<br />
Apart from SoW potions, alchemy is not profitable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;Cost effective&quot; and &quot;profitable,&quot; while related, are not the same thing.<br />
<br />
Cost effective = is it worth cost of the potion for the effect that it grants.  I find that alchemy is primarily an extension of our spell books.  I love alchemy, and keep a mixed bag o' stuff on me.  Sadly, there's not a potion in our arsenal that I could afford to use on a regular basis.<br />
 <br />
There are always going to be times that having or not having a potion is critical.  That doesn't make them cost effective for general use.<br />
<br />
There are times that I consider paying 180p to see if I can squeeze out a potion that gives me 6 mins or so of FT3.  I carry a 5 stack of Greater Rejuve.  Emergencies?  Yes.  Cost effective?  *shudder*<br />
<br />
I play alts that don't have built-in SoW.  Never bought SoW potions, don't twink them with any.  For me, 10p for SoW isn't cost effective--there's armor, weapons and/or spells to get.  I also don't beg for SoW / buffs, etc.  If I get SoW as a puller, cool.  If not--oh well.  And no, I don't die as a result of not having them.  Oddly enough, my alts are rarely without SoW. <br />
<br />
I agree, SoW potions are good sales to 30s-low 50s characters.  Are they cost effective?  No.<br />
<br />
/em goes back to eating her sour grapes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Alchemy is about as cost effective as giving a politician money to do something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sorry Shandy, I misunderstood you.<br />
<br />
I was defining &quot;cost effective&quot; from the point of view of the seller - i.e. &quot;profitable.<br />
You were defining from the point of view of the purchaser - i.e. &quot;good value for money&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess that we were both right by our own definitions: SoWs are a profitable &amp; worthwhile sideline for a youngish shaman. SoW potions are not particularly good valus for money at 10 plat per SoW.<br />
<br />
Actually, the &quot;value for money&quot; is almost there if you play on a PvP server. If you actively seek out PvP, and get yourself a &quot;KoS&quot; tag with a fair number of guilds, you definately visit your guild alchemist regularly for that PvP edge that may improve your chances of survival. There are a couple of warriors in my guild who are really into the PvP side of things. I am constantly  getting requests for levitate, SoW, cure poison, cure disease, damage shield potions etc, and they often send me tells saying how my potions saved their ass or won the fight for them - If you asked them, I am sure they would say the potions were good value for money and cost effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Weyalan, you're absolutely correct.<br />
<br />
I hadn't considered PVP at all.  I'd imagine we'd be godlike on those servers.<br />
<br />
/apologize Weyalan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the problem is how do you give alchemy some cool potions that give good effects without making certain classes obselete or promoting soloing (which we know VI doesnt want to do).   How about less effective stuff but having it stack with everything? so you could have 20 percent potion haste, 20 percent item haste, and whatever percent spell haste.  This way it would be worth it to use in group without making any class obselete, and make alchemy much more usefull and profitable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">/agree Asyn<br />
Id much prefer making 20% haste potions for 5pp each than 40% haste potions for 60pp each. Basically all potions are good for are &quot;emergencies&quot; since the cost is way to high.  Make new potions that don't have as good effects but are much cheaper so that people can use them on a regular basis.  Keep the old potions for emergencies.  We have the best of both worlds</div></div><hr />

I am from Maryland in the USA,  It just depends on the pol for the ROI.</div></div><hr />
