<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dothimgood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My first Rune today, got Quinsence, havent memmed yet.<br />
<br />
Im level 65<br />
I have Torpor<br />
I have Malo<br />
I have Focus of Soul<br />
I do not have Focus of 7th<br />
I do not have Talisman of Boar<br />
I raid alot<br />
I rarely solo<br />
<br />
My question is... in my situation, do I :<br />
1. Memoraize Quincense<br />
2. Sell Quinsence to buy other spells I need<br />
3. Trade Quinsence for either Malos or Fo7th (or a combination of other spells I need, like Talis. of boar+ Fo7th)<br />
<br />
Sooo tired of single buffing Boar and Focosu of soul..... What would be a good trade ? What would be the &quot;smart&quot; thing to do? I dunno..  Need advice, please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Memorize it and enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Scribe Q.  You'll get the others soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">mem it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Q is your buddy.  Don't ditch your buddy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Same situation (except I haven't dinged 65 yet).  I plan to memorize Q as soon as I do.  Though I'd love 7th (I absolutely hate casting single target buffs), being able to torpor w/o snare/slow will be something I think the original should have had, and I've been waiting on for over a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Q is amazing.  It's the combat spell Torpor should have been.  I use it all the time.  I can cast it on myself, and then keep on running somewhere.  You can cast it on tanks to fill them up on HPs just as they go off to pull.  It was the spell I wanted most of all the spells we got.<br />
You already have Malo.  Malos is 55 resist, while malo is 45.  No big deal.<br />
F07 is nice, but you can get by with Mass GFos and hit FoSoul on individuals that ask for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not really the subject, but why not cast group (Khura's) focus then overwrite it with Focus of Soul on the main tank? Will 100hp really be important on other people?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm, I think I just said what Juujuu said, but I didn't get his acronyms at the time. Sorry :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sell your fungi.  /nodnod</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mem Q. It is very powerful for what it is. It won't heal a main tank on a riad, but it will help counter any spikes in damage or help with lag bursts. It will let you keep your whole group alive vs ae damage on a raid many times. It.....well you get the idea.</div></div><hr />
