<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I prefer fighting in WOS, RCoD or MPG, but I sometimes have problems getting a group.<br />
Sitting LFG for a long period while doing nothing drives me nuts, but I do not want to leave the zones where I hope to get a group, as that reduces the chance of getting a group. To solve that problem, I have been looking for a solocamp in one of the three zones, and I found the murkglider cave in the east side of WoS.<br />
<br />
The exp is good (7-8% AA for each kill, at least 10 kill an hour so around 1 AA/hour), loot is definitely not good - sellable stuff at average 1K/hour. I am not elemental flagged, so this is some of the best solo exp I know.<br />
<br />
Before I even consider going here, I get a Temp or other HP buff. I want at least 5000 hp before going here.<br />
<br />
To do this, you need several dots that does not break root. I have 5 (Anathema, Bane, Blood of Saryrn, Breath of Ulthor, Breath of Wunshi).<br />
<br />
BihLi is a must to get enough distance to root the murkgliders.<br />
<br />
Very nice to have: extended range item, clickable root (ornate leggings), drogmore/horse.<br />
<br />
Extended affliction, burning affliction, affliction effeciency, afflicition haste are all nice to have, but not needed.<br />
<br />
Remember the murkgliders have a large aggro range and they see invis. The first time I wanted to try this I got too close before I was ready. Almost got myself killed.<br />
<br />
The murkgliders sometimes cast a dot (Gloom Toxin) or a snare/DD (Shade Mantle) spell. I have tried buffing poison and magic resists, but I still didn't resist them that often.<br />
They only run for 3 or 4 clicks, and are too weak to kill you, so no major problem. The only time this is bad is if the murkglider snares you before it is rooted. In that case, VP3 is very good to have.<br />
<br />
Solo pulling is easy. I have soloed at least 100 murkgliders here, and never gotten an add.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pulling and killing the first murkglider is trivial, as it can be targeted from long distance. Just summon horse, target the murkglider from maximum range and cast malos. Immediately click root on leggings, and the murkglider is rooted before it reaches you. Cast slow, and start dotting it. Refresh root very often, and dots as needed. One murkglider takes 1 BoU, 1 BoW, 3 anathema, 3 bane and 3 BoS. Using CanniV and pained memory, I am back at full mana and health when the murkglider is dead.<br />
<br />
The second is the worst to pull. It is further inside the cave, around the corner so it can not be targetted from far away. I usually cast Quies on me, move close to the murkglider, cast malos and root it. I have to channel root which sometimes is tough on an unslowed murkglider, but I usually is at 70-80% health when the murkglider is rooted and I am out or melee range. I have been down at 20% health once (out of at least 20 times I have pulled).<br />
When it is rooted, the rest is trivial - slow, heal, summon drogmore, dot, root, etc.<br />
Next time I am here, I will try to pull it by putting my pet army on it. Those 5 pets migth keep it busy enough for me to malos and root it without getting attacked - might work.<br />
<br />
Number 3 is in the first cave, close to the tunnel. It can be targeted from the tunnel, so malos, run back a little, root, drogmore, etc.<br />
<br />
The next one I pull is the one most to the left in the first cave. It can not be targeted from the tunnel, so I go into the cave, turn left and go a little up on the wall. Cast malos, run into tunnel to get some distance, root, etc.<br />
<br />
Number 5 is in the cave, almost straight ahead when looking out from the tunnel. It can be targeted from where the tunnel meets the cave, so malos, run, root, etc. When pulling this one, I normally run it all the way back to the tunnel entry, as I want to get away from where the first one respawn.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I started this at lvl 68, I could kill 4, and the first had respawned when I had finished number 4. Now at lvl 70, with better dots, more FT, a Tattered cloak of the fallen, Pained Memory, etc. I have killed number 5 before the first respawns.<br />
<br />
This camp can be done by most lvl 70 shamans. As my Magelo shows, my armor is not especially good - my armor is a mix of LDoN, bazaar and a few OOW drops.<br />
<br />
<br />
Loot I have gotten so far:<br />
- Seeping murkglider blood (once)<br />
- Rugged murkglider skin (about 5)<br />
- Kuuan lodestone (several)<br />
- The +4 coldresist stone for augments (once)<br />
- Murkglider stomach, murkglider claw (many)<br />
- Murkglider plasma (very often - junk)<br />
- Gems (diamonds, jacinths, blue diamonds)<br />

<br />
The floor in the tunnel is not even - it goes up and down.<br />
<br />
Several times where I have used VP on a murkglider in the tunnel, I have pushed it over a top and a little down the other side, so I had problems targeting it. I then had to move closer to the mob again to target it, which I prefer to avoid. The longer away I am from them, the more time I have to react if root breaks, and furthermore I can keep out of range of the murkgliders spells.<br />
<br />
Instead, I use GI on my ornate leggings to root, and if the murkglider ends a place where I have difficulties targeting it, I can use VP to move it somewhere that is better for me.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I tried to pull the second murkglider with the pet army, but it did not work.<br />
&quot;Summon pet army&quot; AA seems to work like a line-of-sight spell, so to be able to summon them I had to target the murkglider and be so close to it that it aggroed on me - exactly same as if I pulled with malos.<br />
Back to the old pulling method.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mojarda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You might try Q'ing Dogdog and sending him in.  He may last long enough for you to malos and slow the Murk.  <br />
<br />
I'll have to give this camp a try as my normal soloing spots in NC are beginning to be overrun by those pesky necros.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I gave this a try, pretty good camp overall.<br />
<br />
Use shrink x2/levi for targeting awkward mobs, this allows you to get high up the wall for LoS. I pull on foot then summon drog once mob postioned and VP is on.<br />
<br />
-pull with nihli<br />
-M.Decay<br />
-VP3<br />
-cast malosinia till on (1-2 cast usually)<br />
-click TA<br />
<br />
Then I summon drogmar and switch in dots. Bane , anathema, BoS, BoU and epic (Ba4 trib, crit aff3, 40% poison focus, no OOW dots). I usually have to refresh VP once and mob dies before second VP is needed. No downtime if you use pained memory/can5 as soon as they pop.<br />
<br />
Respawn seems to be 20mins (I have a UI timer so np there). I pull the first 2 to slope. then move in and tag first out of room, then pull centre spawn.<br />
<br />
Then hug left wall into room, kill rest of room spawn on west wall, and pull first from north tunnel.<br />
<br />
Then I move into north tunnel and kill the next 7-8 mobs round to the second room.<br />
<br />
The second room is hard to split, need to use proxitmity aggro and line of sight to get singles so I tend to just get fm,  retrace steps and rush backspawn, or gate, sell up and start again.<br />
<br />
Xp is good, Fire at 70 is 11%/4min kill 30secs downtime, this is 7% ish (sometimes 8%) for 3min kills. I made 3 aa in about 2 hours here, but cash loot is better than fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Are these any tougher than the murkgliders in NC?  Those were really easy solos, IF you could get them single.  Two are doable but I ended up healing myself a lot (over and above Quiescence) and I hate wasting that mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hello Weissblau<br />
<br />
Yes - the murkgliders in WOS are tougher than the NC murkgliders. In WOS they are lvl 65, compared to lvl 63 in NC (which is good as a lvl 65 mob gives way more exp at lvl 70).<br />
Just the standard tougher variant of the same mob - more HP's, hits harder, resists a little more.<br />
