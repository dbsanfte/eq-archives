<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just out of curioiusity, a couple of friends and I played around with pets last night.<br />
<br />
All of the following are completely unbuffed--no weaps given to dog dog, no buffs on any pet used.<br />
<br />
Further, the parsed dps is against a time level shaman with good AC--so the amounts of actual damage is mitigated for PvP issues.  That means the raw dps numbers will be misleading.<br />
<br />
Level 61 Shaman Pet (True Spirit)<br />
avg dps over a 5 minute period: 5.4<br />
<br />
Level 64 SK pet (also level 49 necro pet) (note: a level 41 skeleton)<br />
avg dps over a 5 minute period:  8.2<br />
<br />
The level 41 skeleton does 51.8% more damage!<br />
<br />
CLEARLY WE WERE WRONG!  SHAMAN ARE A PET CLASS AFTER ALL!  DOG DOG CAN DO 66% OF THE DAMAGE OF A LEVEL 41 SKELETON BEFORE BUFFS!!!!<br />
<br />
WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOO!<br />
<br />
/cheeer!<br />
/dance!<br />
/hurls in excitement!<br />

P.S.  Does anyone else find this kinda amusing?  FYI, I heard last night that SKs are being insulted with all the pet AAs in GoD, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">5 mins really isnt good for a parse, but ya sk pet is like 30-40dps i think, from reading on the sk boards, where as dogdog is like 11dps =(<br />
<br />
that pet must have been godly for necros prekunark</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually the biggest thing is that sk pet is auto duel wielding. Give our pet a weapon and it catches up and I'd bet it has more hps and it can enrage which the necro pet can't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">TT.<br />
<br />
pre-Kunark the 49 necro pet was THE best source for damage, it outdamaged most melee characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This parse is the min and is missing the other extreme, the max.<br />
<br />
Get the pet to the state you would normally have him in, ie hasted, buffed, and two weapons, and the state the SK would have the pet maxxed  in (with augment death) or whatever.<br />
<br />
I want to see the numbers then for the other extreme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yes i can believe this i went to arena and dueled a sk just to check pets i buffed mine fully with my own buffs, 2 weapons, he buff his with sk buffs, my pet lost by  along way. i think they take the fact we can slow into account and heal, but if i was fighting the sk aswell he could take my pet out with it. i didnt slow his pet (least i dont think i did) but hes green sk buffed 41 pet could take out me fully buffed (58con? going on lucy naming would guess 42 but it isnt as good as the 41 necro pet, so really more like a 39 pet?)<br />
i think we should get a pet about level 49? necro get if the naming right 61 and 65 pet , though beast says 51 and beast pet would seem higher so that level in name for lucy might not be right:) and mage and enc are summon type 15, so no help theree:)?<br />
but i would assume the higher pet classes have pets alot closer to their level so at 65 likely least 61? but then again all pets balance to what their master is:) i know confusing, i think a 49 pet level for 65 shaman is not out of order:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMHO, it doesnt matter which pet wins in a one on one duel, because sprit pets are known to have god awful defense, and get eat up easy.<br />
<br />
Shaman pets, unless I am missing something ,are about summong a pet to dog (awful pun) the enemy more like a dot than a pet that tanks or acts like a melee player.<br />
<br />
Slow dominates our balance. SoE would probably be pretty reluctant to up shaman pets from a summoned dot to a real melee, due to feeling that with slow it would be unbalancing.<br />
<br />
Like Disc Def, CH and other abilities, slow clouds their minds at all times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmm, but as we get higher level our own ablitly to mellee decreases , to begin with we were a battlepriest, same caps on our mellee as warrior just no dual/double attack (basically 200), which used to be alot better than other priest and not too bad atall, up to level  50 2hb i did reasonable dps with that., not mellee class great, but nice. then fights took longer and you would slow, dot, set pet then tank/mellee the mob.<br />
<br />
then kunark camr out and changed that.  For kurnark it still hit alot and helped but lower as our 200 cap didnt rise like mellee classes .<br />
<br />
with further expansion it has now faded to where it is not used really. surely our pet making up for this different wouldnt be that wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok i dont want to make this a BL vs Shman issue but it really pisses me off when you talk about pets.  The BL 60+ pet is awesome compared to shaman 61 pet.  As a level 60 shaman i could not wait till i got my 61 pet  guess what i was very disappointed when i summoned my first True Spirit.  I know our pet is supposed to be a dot kinda thing  and we have slow and heals so our pet doesnt need to be as tough as other pets.  HELLO BL geta a 65% slow at 65 and heals their pets pretty damn well.  As a level 61 shaman i'm finding it harder to understand what i actually bring to a group.  A BL has 65% slow, great DPS, and a pet that is actually very good.  My regular group is 65 ranger/65 cleric/65 BL/65 mage/Me 61 shaman and whatever as last spot.  What do i bring to this group?  some small improvements over BL buffs and slow, 3rd class pet and my DPS are pretty crappy.  Was just wondering =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i had a look at levels of pet to level we get them, basically each level the pet gets less close to our level starting at 10 difference up to about 20 diff at top, i look at other pet class they too genberally get further from level but on about a max of 14 levels and seem to get a huge boost in pop to become closer to level match.<br />
<br />
sk is about a 20 to 25  level difference when they get new pets, the last being a 24 level diff. so thier pets stay about the same level difference why ours rises to meet theirs!<br />
<br />
going on the orignal 10 diff our pet should be 55. on a 14 level difference 51 and i think that where it should be , that and going on per kunark spells we got a pet 34, 39,44,49, next pet should have been 54 (not 55) next 59 (not 61), and next 64. but hey ho they seem just to make arbitary decissions  to this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I went and killed Bloodmaw in the GD caves about a week ago with my 65 BST friend. We took turns killing him to parse out our pets. My pet fully buffed by myself and wielding two velium weapons clocked in at about 32DPS if I remember correctly. The BST pet was about 98DPS I think. I couldn't figure out how to get my parser to account for damage from the pet procs so that is all just the melee hits. If the procs had been counted in Dogdog might have clocked up an extra point of DPS but the BST pet woulda been a good bit higher. What was interesting is that they both had the same accuracy within a single % at 70%. Mind you bloodmaw cons as a level one MOB though and so this is not really an accurate depiction of what the same pets would do against exp mobs. However Bloodmaw is always there and is an all around good way to test DPS since he has 32k hp. I will probably go back and clock Dogdog again when I hit 61 and get the upgrade.</div></div><hr />
