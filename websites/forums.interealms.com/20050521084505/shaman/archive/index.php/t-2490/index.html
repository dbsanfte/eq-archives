<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koric Vilesilencer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail!<br />
<br />
I would like some suggestions for appropriate weapons to use as a level 34 Barbarian Shaman.  <br />
<br />
I currently have Piercing close to maxed (maybe), 2hb is a ways back, and 1hb is a distant third.<br />
<br />
I am mostly hunting Solo or Doubles with a Monk and may need to tank sometimes.  I am currently using a spear (cannot remember the name) in my ranged slot for Wisdom and another in my right hand - Dmg 6  Spd 27.   Ouch!  Low (useless) damage.<br />
<br />
Any and all suggestions are appreciated.<br />
<br />
Peace!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I solo 100% of the time.  One of the best weapons I've found to use is Blight, hammer of scourge.<br />
<br />
I've tried that, a granite face grinder and staff of living sand..but I keep coming back to the Blight.  <br />
<br />
I'm considering picking up a fungus covered tarmok staff.  That one looks like it might be pretty decent.  Guess the reason I like the Blight so much is because of the proc.<br />
<br />
We all know shaman melee isn't anywhere near what a warrior/rogue/monk/etc does, so the proc helps a bit.  Even if I whiff, I know they are still taking damage from the dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd suggest checking one of the AC/HP vs Wis threads regarding range items, etc.  Brief summary:  Wis is highly overrated for shamans.  Theres cheap AC stuff you can get for range that would help you more than that spear, especially if it's just you and the monk.<br />
<br />
Weapon-wise, it comes down to cash.  If you're going max ac using a shield, your best bang for the buck is going to be a Centi hammer.  15/32 is a nice-nice ratio for a priest 1-hander, and they can be had for under 500p, sometimes well under.  In the 600p range, the Spinechill spear isn't too bad either, though by the time it starts to proc, you'll probably want something better, like a Howling Harpoon for 1k or so.  If cash is available, look at getting maybe a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang.  These have dropped a lot in price recently, should be available for around 5k or so, and 11/18 is sweet for a 1 hander, plus an 80 point DD proc at 40 or something.<br />
<br />
If you're soloing, despite the loss of ac it will incur, I would _strongly_ suggest getting a good 2-hander.  Melee damage is mana-free damage.  At the low end, theres the Runewood staff, 22/40, couple hundred pp, good value for the money.  The Drakkel Icegrinder, also a few hundred, is just nice.  I don't know if they changed the proc level on it recently, but even without the proc, 27/45 isn't terrible, and it looks dead sexy.  I used one from about 25 to 50, when I got my GFG, and I still have the Icegrinder.  Blight isn't a bad choice, though I'm not sure what level it procs at.  Ratio leaves a bit to be desired though, and relying on a proc makes me nervous, but then again my dex was in the basement when I had my Blight so take that for what its worth.  Should be about 2k.  Fungus covered Tarmok is another 2k-ish toy, and well worth it, especially at lower levels, since mobs disease resist tends to be pretty weak.  Plus, it's slow, so you don't lose as much effectiveness by casting in between swings as you would with a faster weapon.  Higher up on the ladder is the Granite Face Grinder, 29/36, +10 Str/Int/Wis, anywhere from 4-8k.  It hits hard, it hits fast, it's got Wis.  Only problem is, it looks like a meat tenderizer.  A weapon this cool should look a LOT better.  Oh well.  Around and above the GFG are the several different kinds of Velium Brawl Sticks.  They start at 30/40 and just get better, droppable ones topping out at 32/36.  Prices will start at several k for the 30/40 up to about 15k+ for the 32/36, at least on my server.  No stats, but they look REALLY cool, so it all balances out.<br />
<br />
If your skill is lacking, particularly in 2hb where most of the weapons are rather slow, it can be worth it to grab a fast, low damage toy to raise your skill quickly before you start swinging the big boys.  The Ketchata Koro Mis is a 7/30 2hb out of the sarnak fort in LOIO, shaman-usable and usually purchasable for around 30p or so in EC/Faymart/wherever the selling happens on your server.  Neat-looking, too.  The quickest 2hb you can get nowadays is &quot;A shovel&quot;.  You can loot one off one of the dogs in the Miller farm near Qeynos, or you can just make an Iksar mule and have a bud give him a plat so he can buy one from one of the Iksar vendors in Cab.  I forget which one, but he's on an island in I think east cab canal.  Cost=5 gold and change, 4/27 ratio.  Real quick skill raises with that, downside is, you're walking around with a shovel...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  Happy bashing.  :)</div></div><hr />
