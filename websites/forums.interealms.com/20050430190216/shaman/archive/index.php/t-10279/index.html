<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have spent my 59 levels almost exclusively on the moon and in PoP. I did have a ranger back in 1999 that went to GUK at lvl 13 that got himself killed in several trains. Now I wanted to go back to that at the time VERY scary zone just to do some sightseeing. I have now seen (and killed) most of the mobs in upper guk and have made my way into lower guk undead side.<br />
<br />
Can I solo here safely? I know most/all mobs will be green, but lots of green mobs can easily kill me :)<br />
<br />
Can I do any of the camps? If so which ones. Getting a rare drop to sell or give my ranger alt would be nice even though they are outdated by todays standards.<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for a challenge, so if it isn't easy I wont do it. I'm just a tourist, this wouldn't be worth getting killed over.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You'll be fine as long as your not reckless..the only trouble lguk could possibly give you is allllll the casters..if your resists are kinda low you'd be surprised how fast they can hurt you. dogdog will pretty much rip most stuff apart there. You can do probably all camps...frenzy is good for FBSS, and king drops a nice resist crown..doesnt sell too well, but its useful.  Magus is doable also, he drops the scalp for faction and i think (not sure) the shiny metallic robe..<br />
its a pretty fun dungeon, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jowjo is 54 and can do every camp in LGuk. In fact it is quite possible to keep 3-4 camps cleared.<br />
<br />
Beware of factioners in LGuk though. People will pull trains of 15-20 over top of you. The worst of the worst are in LGuk ATM trying to get the woodie mask.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not sure about your server, but lguk is empty again on Lanys. It was like that for a few days, but now faction has been added in seb, so most people go there for some drops and exp while they faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lord drops the scalp. Magus drops the SMR as the rare and the slik legs as the common.<br />
<br />
You should be ok if you slowly move your way through the place. Let dog dog do all the dirty work while you keep him healed.<br />
<br />
When I did my wood elf crown factioning here, I could usually make an average of 2k per night selling the Guk loots. The place was usually close to empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But what's faster?  Killing tons of way green froggies for faction or killing possibly fewer higher level green froggies with lots more hps?  <br />
<br />
So far I haven't been bored enough to do this factioning/quest.   Likely my faction would need a lot of work, as I spent more than a few hours killing the Live side King for lewts to sell. <br />
<br />
Reets are laughably easy these days.  The crown is common drop.  I think me and a given tank of some sort could easily duo there and kill them.  Juggs seem quite easy too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i pull trains in Lguk .. fun stuff ... regen is nice and so is Torrent of Poison and DS =-) with 61 pet buffed ... i can take on 10 greens or so at a time ... no torpor ... i use Tnargs for quick heals<br />
