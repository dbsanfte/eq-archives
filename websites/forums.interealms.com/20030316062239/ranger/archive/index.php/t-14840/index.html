<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quebelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">has anyone here hunted much in PoJ?  I am curious as to whether or not hunting the prisoners, guards, rats, bugs will hurt me when I get ready to do a trial in a few levels?<br />
Thank you for your help, :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kalanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've hunted there a very little bit. From what I saw, the Guards were unfactioned as were the rats.  The prisoners seems to be on one of two factions. I don't recall the names, but it was basicly non-kos and kos. Killing one, raised the other.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raytheon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Factions are: <br />
<br />
Prisoners of Justice (generally humanoid prisoners)<br />
Creatures of Justice (generalyy non-humanoid prisoners)<br />
<br />
If I recall correctly, you start KoS with Creatures and non-KoS to Prisoners.<br />
<br />
Guards have no faction.  Rats have no faction.<br />
<br />
Not sure about the denizens of the Grallok caves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eynel Stormsifter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">High Guardians near the portal to the Tribunal have the following negative Faction hits:<br />
<br />
Guardians of Justice (All the black caped guys)<br />
also a minus to a factioned named after the efreeti there, don't recall name.<br />
<br />
Other High Guardians don't have the faction hit</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>redEye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I left the trial area in wolf form once. The guards and the freeti aggroed. I ran back to trials area. They followed. I ran back out. They all died and I got faction hits for all of em. Whoops :p.<br />
<br />
Anyway, factions mentioned here are right. There's also a Grallok faction of some sort, but you start kos to them anyway, so no harm in hunting them.<br />
