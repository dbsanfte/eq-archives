Modified it a little for accuracy.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have taken 10,000 points of non-melee damage.<br />
You have fallen to your death.<br />
Loading, Please Wait…<br />
You have entered Rivendell<br />
<br />
You say, 'Ach! Damn it!'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'Gandalf! Where did you come from? … You’re naked.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Stupid halflings n00bs who can’t play their class, that’s what happened!'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'What? Where?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Moria. We were in the safe hall at Balin’s Tomb and Aragorn was going to pull some orcs to clear the way to the zoneout.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'Which halfling messed it up? Frodo?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'No, it was Pippin. I didn’t even want to bring him along but Frodo did insist. Aragorn was going to pull some orcs but out comes Pippin to 'see what Aragorn was doing' and manages to aggro half the zone.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'So you got wiped out by a horde of orcs? Yuck.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Oh, no. They were green to most of us, so we cut through them all right. I was impressed by Legolas’ bow crits (I think he had one of those crafted Blessed Faydark Thunder bolts), but then the Cave Troll got aggroed.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'But there were nine of you, you could have handled the cave troll.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Oh, and we did. Except Frodo didn’t know how to manage aggro properly. The troll started beating on him.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'Oh, no. Poor Frodo.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'No, actually, Frodo was fine. He had a mithril chain tunic on.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'Jeez, just because he’s friends with Bilbo, does Bilbo have to twink him like that?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Yeah, no kidding, those things sell for like 50K in the bazaar. So the troll ran and Pippin of course forgets to snare because he's too busy trying to melee.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'I hate it when druids try to melee, but Aragorn’s a ranger, why didn’t he snare?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Even though we had the dwarf, Aragorn had ageo so he was our main tank and with his DPS was busy keeping the orcs aggroed on him. Pippin was just sleeping on the job. So of course the troll ran, and before we finally cut him down, he chain aggroed the Balrog.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'Oh, no. Stupid halfling dr00ds.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Yeah. So naturally, I decided to take it on the chin. I told everyone to run and I tried to hold off the Balrog by exploiting the pathing bug on the bridge.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'And he got you.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'No, actually, I had my shield up, then I just chain-nuked him with my best cold nukes.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'You SOLOED the Balrog? Wow.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Yeah, one hell of an XP hit too. But then when he fell, I turned and slipped off the ledge. I 10Ked when I hit the bottom of the Balrog pit. Didn’t even have chance to loot his corpse. And there went the XP from the orcs, the troll, AND the Balrog. Stupid Verant.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'Your corpse is in the bottom of the Balrog pit?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Yeah. But no worries, I think I know a way to drag it out of there.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'That’s good.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'So, can I bum a SoW off you for a CR? I want to get back there before the Balrog respawns.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'This is Rivendell. We’re high elves. The wood elves are in Lothlorien.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Nadgers. Which is where we were headed in the first place. Oh well, I’m a wizard at least, and there’s a portal not too far from there.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'Good luck on your CR. Why were you hanging out with those noobs anyway?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'I promised Frodo I’d power level him in exchange for him MQ'ing the Cracks of Doom quest with me. He has the quest piece - the One Ring.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'That’s NO DROP, isn’t it.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Yeah, that's why we have to MQ it.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'What do you get for completing that quest?'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Robe of the White and Staff of the White. Those would be serious upgrades to my Grey robe and staff. I’ve had this gear for way too many levels anyway.'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'Nice.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Anyway, I’d better go. Do you think you could get someone to go to the Moria zone to rez me once I get my corpse pulled there?'<br />
<br />
Elrond says, 'I’ll try to find a guildie.'<br />
<br />
You say, 'Thanks.'</div></div><hr />
