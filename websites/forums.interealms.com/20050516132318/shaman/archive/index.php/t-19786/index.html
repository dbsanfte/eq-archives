On a side note, not sure if it's 100% correct.  The 4 sewers lead to Vexd - Tipt...... then kod'taz?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yet to even visit GoD zones, so asking a quick question. Do you have to go through each zone to get to the next? Meaning like working from CS-SG-WW-ToV?<br />
<br />
From what I've heard so far, those first few zones are riping folks a new one. If you've got to plow or invis and sprint, that's gonna kinda stink.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If the first zones are ripping folks up, whats the purpose of invising through to get to the next ones?  I assume (bad idea I know) that the next ones have tougher mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At least some of those zones are accessed by flags, I'm not sure but I dont think that you need to actually go through the sewers to get to them. The figure in the link doesn't suggest that, since no arrows lead from the sewers, only to them.<br />
<br />
There is a second zone line in natimbi btw. It is blocked by a line of stones with a runed stele set in them. If you click the stele you get a message. I'm guessing that it is the zone in to some of the higher tiered flagged zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yes it is a marker for higher tier'd GoD zones, has anyone besides me done the sewers ? or the other instanced material and thought ... *** ?<br />
mobs start hitting for 1900 ... did any of our lame ass shaman representatives in GoD send info about our bogus healing not helping on mobs that hit for 600 points over our best heal ...<br />
this smells like PoP lite to me.<br />
anyone remember how PoP went ? if you weren't uber day 1, your still not Uber in PoP 4-5 months later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">there is no mob in the sewers that hit for upwards of what you just described Shamortal.  I don't exactly know what you are referring to, but more than likely it's a mob that's outside of the sewers, and one that is prob part of an event.  I do know of some in just about every zone that that is the case.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the chart is not correct as is expected.  You get access to Vxed through the 4x sewers events, or through the Smith event.  Vxed gets you access to Tipd, and Tipd to Kod'taz.  The entrance to Kod'Taz is the stone that Tugela mentioned, the one that is in Natimbi.  Any group made up of competent people can finish the sewers events easily, especially when the tricks to it starts flowing out.<br />
<br />
oh, and kurth, i'm seeing that you have such positive things to say towards those like myself who put alot of effort in beta asking and feedbacking things trying to get things fixed.  Don't talk unless you know what you are talking about.</div></div><hr />
