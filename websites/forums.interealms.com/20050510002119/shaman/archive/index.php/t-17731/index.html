<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm considering adding a second account.  I play on firiona vie, where its one character per account, and I'm wanting an alt for when there are 10 other shaman lfg the same time as me :)<br />
My question is, do you need a seperate cd key to run the second account?  I can run eq multiple times, but since I've only one account, I can only log in once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes you will need to repurchase everquest and all everquest expansions for the 2nd account to function =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yup<br />
<br />
Buy EQ evolutions, bout US$30 for all but LDoN.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Next question, if anyone happens to know how the cd keys are registered.  When I originally bought eq, I got the 'classic' cd, and used the cd key with it.  Later, after pop and the gold box was released I decided to upgrade to the whole package.  The cd key from the box upgraded the existing account.  Is the original key still usable?  I did buy eq classic twice, after all.  And classic is all I need, not going to be two boxing, just need both on at once to hand over plat, gear, buffs, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You should be able to use what you have then.  If you have 2 copies of EQ classic, you should have 2 CD-keys that you can make your second acct with.  I am not sure you will be able to register you expansions to the 2nd account though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You already used both of your CD keys once(even if they were on the same account), so I'm afraid you'll have to purchase the entire EQ again =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree with Einnod... if you used the CD-key, you used it up.  You'd need to buy a new one.  They even warn you about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I still wish they would sell cd keys via the website. I would pay the same amount.<br />
<br />
I've got enough frikken eq cd's already thanks! :)</div></div><hr />
