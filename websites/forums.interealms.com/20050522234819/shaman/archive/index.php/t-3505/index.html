<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When soloing, I've been mostly a root-and-rot kind of lizard until I made 60 and got torpor. Since I want to solo summoning mobs, I have been working on my close-combat fighting and I am finding that the rate at which I'm interrupted seems disturbingly high. I have maxed channeling ( 220 ), maxed defense and 1092 ac (self buffed). I was meleeing a wimpy, low level, slowed and crippled goranga and it successfully interrupted my cast of Torpor 5 times in a row. Had I been fighting something dangerous, I'd be a little scaly spot on the ground of ME. <br />
<br />
Soo... <br />
1) Is my experience typical?<br />
2) Any tricks to try to get torpor off in melee? Rooting and backing up are obviously not going to work against summoning mobs. <br />
3) I find that if I'm levitating, I seem to be interrupted on every blow. Anyone else find this to be the case?<br />
4) any other ways to decrease interrupts? I assume the answer is AC AC AC AC AC ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Increase AGI :)<br />
<br />
As far as i understand, AGI: the ability to DODGE, whereas AC is teh stat that decreases damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My Agi when I'm fighting is 202. Not super, but decent, I should think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do you have a JBB?  It helps significantly with channelling...<br />
<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If possible fight with your back to a wall.  Most interupts come from pushbacks, and having the wall behind you ill help prevent it some.<br />
<br />
If you can't fight with a wall behind you, which is most likely the case, don't use lev.  Lev makes it real easy for puchbacks to occur.<br />
<br />
Other than that I can't think of many other things that will help, cept to up the ac a bit so that the mobs will miss you a bit more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When you get whacked step forward.<br />
Works wonders underwater too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yup, Borkan and Fattn got da good of it.  Interruption chances are based on yer channeling and where yu were when yu started casting and where when da spell goes off.  Dat is, yu can move inbetween, but wen da spell goes off, make shur yu on same spot yu started castin from.<br />
<br />
Dat's why fightin in a corner be da best ting.  If it a summoning mob, don't do any damage to it until yu is in a corner.  More dan likely yer gonna pull wif Malo or Turgur's anywho so dat shudna be a prob.  If yer usin a pet, make shur pet behind mob so it be pushin mob toward yu inta da corner while yu be pushin it out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep make sure that your net distance travelled is zero when you get knocked. Turn off lev as well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">spend 18 points and get the cast time on torpor to 3.0 seconds. best aaxp upgrade after cann5 for shamans imho. makes soloing much, much, much easier. much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Maiden's Eye is where I solo almost exclusively now.  At 54, I can solo hunters and lower, but not the shaman.  I rarely get interrupted when casting during melee, usually only when stunned.<br />
<br />
As you can see from my Magelo profile, I've not got &quot;uber&quot; gear.  My AC is much lower than yours, and you can see where my self-buffs would put it and my stats. <br />
<br />
Dunno why I get lucky.  On the other hand, I was just in Mistmoore, and it seemed that every greenie that landed a blow for its token 1 or 2 pts of damage could interrupt me and push me back.</div></div><hr />
