<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Personally, I still very much like my shaman.  I don't play any other classes now and haven't for a long time.<br />
<br />
I don't think our class has many problems, either.  I DO think that the recent expansions, especially Gates, have problems.  Shaman haven't really changed, the game content has.  Yes, we all know this.  I'd just like to know why we aren't trying to get the game content to be more consistant instead of asking for so many changes to our class.  I don't want my class changed.  I like it the way it is in most of the game's content.<br />
<br />
So, why is the game now:<br />
<br />
- Short fights<br />
- Slow mitigated<br />
- Cripple immune<br />
- Mob DPS through the roof<br />
<br />
Sure, some of these type encounters are fine, IMO.  But, not an entire expansion's content.  Why is slow mitigated yet CH works in every zone?  CotH doesn't work in every zone for mages.  Cripple immune mobs . . . sure, a few of those are fine, too . . . a few.  Don't even get me started on chanter pets /sigh.<br />
<br />
WHAT IF, a zone existed where CH and charmed pets didn't exist.  Hmmm, maybe the mobs wouldn't have to hit as hard.  WHAT IF a zone existed where your stats were halved when you entered and you NEEDED those stat buffs . . . <br />
<br />
No, I don't want to get any other classes nerfed, even though some may need it, IMO; but, the fact remains, the major &quot;tuning&quot; factor for new content is slow immunity/mitigation.  I've said it before and will say it again, &quot;What's wrong with a long fight?&quot;  I can get all the short, no-brainer fights I want in DAoC.  What's wrong with engaging more that 1 mob at a time?  By content design you really can't and survive in many places now if you do so, but that's just lame game design.  I have a lot of fun on a bad pull in a normal LDoN.  Four mobs coming and no chanter around.  Now THAT's fun.  Tank is busy, offtank is busy, cleric is hectic, shaman is working, mage has one pinned down, etc.<br />
<br />
To summarize:<br />
<br />
V A R I E T Y = better game content</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Amen.<br />
<br />
Designing onesided content leads to classes being marginalized in that content. Designing a whole expansion that way will leave some classes lagging behind.<br />
<br />
For all purposes there is a single MOB type in all of GoD (and in way too much of EQ) - it deals a lot of melee damage, it has few HPs. The only variables are slowability, rootability, charmability, mezzability and stunnability. All these abilities have one thing in common - they avoid damage. Apparently this is bad, so you have to make MOBs immune. Of course if the content was varied there would not be a need to do this.<br />
<br />
If you have a swarm of 6 MOBs slow, stun and the likes are inherently devalued, while the value of AEs, offtanks(including pets) and group heals goes up.<br />
<br />
If you have a MOB with huge regeneration the value of DPS goes up.<br />
<br />
If you have a MOB with a ton of HPs the value of DoTs goes up.<br />
<br />
If you have casters that actually do damage the value of stun goes up.<br />
<br />
And if you actually combine all of those in a single zone you can have every member of your group have an area they shine in and an area they suffer in.<br />
<br />
Of course it would make the copy/paste design of LDoN and GoD harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are 100% right Turmoiltoad!<br />
<br />
It would be wonderful if mobs were varried in style, requiring differing stratigies and skills.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if there were a couple mobs that whent to one extream or the other, with many differing designs in the middle, instead of one extream or the other found consistently throughout an entire zone, or even expansion.<br />
<br />
Of course as veeshan pointed out, it would also eliminate the simple cut and paste mode, and undoubtedly be a lot more work on the part of the devs for a game that may be loosing its player base:).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i love this thread!  its not the shammy, its the dorks at SoE who made the damn expansion so stupidly :p  Shammies need a lil work, but so do other classes /points to the monks ~~&gt;<br />
<br />
But you're soo right Turm, its the game.  now if SoE realized that, and people stop buying the expansions and start stating (kinda like you did) what's wrong, maybe (in our wildest wet dreams) SoE will realize thier F-up and fix it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my opinion, CH has been &quot;nerfed&quot; more or less in the higher-tier GOD content.  Not in a bad way, or hp-per-mana context, but I know that at least my guild doesn't use CH rotations on these fights, it's all spam.<br />
<br />
That's a good thing really.  So is slow mitigation.  Slow and CH have been so overutilized and depended on for so long, it's good to see the new expansion kind of take the wind out of the sails of those two abilities.<br />
<br />
I also agree with the first poster.  I enjoy playing my shaman,  and I don't think we're underpowered or need many upgrades, if any at all.<br />
<br />
I'm getting to where I like the GoD design, except for the trial portions.  Those were poorly implemented.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
WHAT IF, a zone existed where CH and charmed pets didn't exist. Hmmm, maybe the mobs wouldn't have to hit as hard. WHAT IF a zone existed where your stats were halved when you entered and you NEEDED those stat buffs <br />
<br />
<br />
what if pigs had wings and monkeys flew out of my ass?  what if.  what if.  what if the sky was underground, would the land twinkle with stars daddy?<br />
<br />
shaman have problems.  a wide range of issues starting with the efficacy and utility of buffs to damage dealing over time to blah and x.  healing slow mitigation is a part but it's not the whole thing<br />
<br />
as for the rest of your post.  sounds like you should go be a designer for horizons.  how in the world do you expect SoE to create and balance a entire RANGE of types of encounters per zone when they can't even get ONE type of encounter... based on slow mitigating, high DPS mobs... right?<br />
<br />
fights aren't longer because long fights in EQ are boring.  and the reason it's boring has to do with fundamental game mechanics in the game engine that causes people to go afk and clip thier toenails and pick their nose during these events<br />
<br />
coming up with fun cool ideas is a great schoolboy excercise but when it comes to game design it's the details.  cool ideas are a dine a dozen.  ideas are jack it's the implementation.  SoE doesn't have the talent or the facility to develop all variations on a theme when it cant get it refrain solid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In my opinion, CH has been &quot;nerfed&quot; more or less in the higher-tier GOD content.

I sort of agree on raids. In groups it is still CH first for grinds. On the bosses it is either spot heals, or - if the fight is short enough - group CH.<br />
<br />
That's a good thing really.  So is slow mitigation.  Slow and CH have been so overutilized and depended on for so long, it's good to see the new expansion kind of take the wind out of the sails of those two abilities.<br />
I do not think it is a good idea at all. The classes being balanced around kicking ass works just as well as the classes being balanced around not trivializing some precious three-expansions-old dragon.<br />
<br />
Why not let everyone be able to singlehandedly cripple a regular MOB? Let bosses be immune, but would it really be bad if shaman could slow every MOB, paladins could stun, necromancers could fear, enchanters could mez, monks could split tight areas up, mages could have their pet offtank, wizards could manaburn and so on?<br />
<br />
Of course that would require actually deviating from the &quot;one MOB at a time, 200 kills wins the trial&quot; zone design.<br />
<br />
I also agree with the first poster.  I enjoy playing my shaman,  and I don't think we're underpowered or need many upgrades, if any at all.<br />
<br />

In that case I am glad for you being able to live with contributing less to the group then the rest of them. I wish I could say the same for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think encounter variety is an important idea. From what I understand, this is Discord's biggest problem. Encounters that are all the same in strategy 4+ hours of single pulls, 30 second fights with warrior tanking, two clerics to spam heal, and an enchanter pet kill ARE BORING.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps certain encounters could be designed so that a subset of classes are really helpful. Maybe a double group encounter where you need every class represented because of their different skill sets. <br />
<br />
Perhaps SOE could design standard group encounters where a balance of existing classes are required-1 melee plate (3 classes), 1 priest (3 classes), 2 melee dps (6 classes), 1 intelligence caster (4 classes). When a warrior, cleric, and enchanter are required for every group, it does a great disservice to the other 10 classes. <br />
<br />
As it is, however, strategic roles cut across classes so this design is difficult. Still, there is functional design-buffing, debuffing, pulling, crowd control, tanking, healing, melee dps, casting dps. Of course, the shaman complaint in current design is that shaman are essentially the east effective in every function. We were kings of debuffing until slow mitigation/immunity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well put.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;Of course as veeshan pointed out, it would also eliminate the simple cut and paste mode, and undoubtedly be a lot more work on the part of the devs for a game that may be loosing its player base.&quot;<br />
<br />
The horrible (or I guess you could call it delicious if you were morbid) irony of that is that it's their lack of willingness to really think out their expansion and do some work instead of just taking a lazy, cookie cutter approach regardless of how much it screwed up three classes that's making what's probably a serious threat to their customer base in the first place.<br />
<br />
If they wanted to be sure that EQ brought in money without too much being spent on it, they only worked out the &quot;don't spend too much&quot; part.  They forgot all about the bringing money in part when they screwed up the game long term.<br />
<br />
I think the bean counters got too flustered thinking about the short-term gains of releasing a new expansion, and screwed up their long term prospects.<br />
<br />
I don't think they meant this expansion to be the game's last hurrah, a final cash-in before it was destroyed by other games including their own EQ2.  But their cavalier attitude toward class balance and lazy, cookie-cutter design may have turned it into just that for a lot of customers, and for the game to a great extent.<br />
<br />
Because what could be a greater advertisement for the competition than this very expansion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ancere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think the big difference between the success of PoP Vs the utter disappointment of GoD is the lack of character advancement. When PoP came out, doing the lower tier zones at level 60 with the then equipment was difficult for the majority of folks. Sure, the content was hard, but through items/raiding/equipment/aa these things were at least eventually conquerable.<br />
<br />
 For GoD there is seemingly little way to prepare and improve yourself for the new content that is offered. The new AAs do not really offer a significant power improvement (in offense or defense) that would help the average player feel they could accomplish a lot. <br />
<br />
 Now they are planning on a new expansion with new levels and AA. Things that should have been added when GoD came out. There are arguments that increasing levels is bad, but I disagree. Sure it can trivialize older content, but it is required to give players the needed sense of achievement that it is possible to improve themselves! The best thing they could do is come out with a expansion that would wipe the floor with 95% of the best equipped players in the game but that offered a way to improve your character so that the content would be conquerable.<br />
<br />
 I really hope SOE takes a look at some of the new games coming out and implements some of the features from them. I have been playing CoH recently and the fact that a group of players can effectively and quickly tackle a group of 12-24 mobs is incredible. And the down time does not suck. Perhaps Sony can learn a thing or two about increasing the pace, while keeping the challenge intact.<br />
<br />
 With this new expansion and increase in character development, I think a lot of concerns that affect shaman currently have the opportunity to be dealt with. Hopefully this next expansion will be good, or else I foresee even more people leaving the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think the player base is partly to blame as well.  The game has turned into being &quot;fast food&quot; for guilds.  Gotta be the first.  Rush rush.  It use to be a year before an expansion would come out, now it's just a short few months.  Why?  SOE's unoriginality and the players who &quot;finish&quot; it in just weeks.  Maybe we're too smart for SOE.  I don't know.<br />
<br />
In the early year(s) of EQ, it felt gear helped you, unlike today, where you are totally dependant on it to get you through situations or even be recognized to join an xp group.  When AA's came out, it became the same way.  You can't even join some guilds if you don't have an X amount of AA's or certain types.</div></div><hr />
