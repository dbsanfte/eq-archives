<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks, just figured I'd get the info thread rolling about epic v2.0... I'll start with pretty much the only info I've seen anywhere (which really isn't much):<br />
<br />
New epic start mobs are in PoP, require you to hand in old epic to start the quest (you get it back right away).<br />
<br />
Please post any info you think is relevant, and lets get this new epic solved!! Good luck, Heyokahs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A little more info I've gathered through checking out various other boards:<br />
<br />
There are a group of NPCs in the library in PoK who hold the epic of each class, hailing them seems to yield a relatively simple &quot;collect these things and bring them back/take them to someone&quot; type quest. Possibly the beginning of Epic v2.0.<br />
<br />
The initial quest for the Wizzies seems to involve Plane of Innovation and Ak'Anon (collect 4 items from PoI and return them to an NPC in Ak'Anon).<br />
<br />
Would verify myself if I had PoP... damned shipping issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fenweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would likeyou to help you out with this new epic quest once my PoP comes in, I don't quite have my epic yet, i am on final CoM fight i just havn't gotton a raid party to help me with kill yet.  Contact me in game i am also on Tarew Marr name is Fenweir</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Top floor of the library there are some NPC's with their epics, but I don't see a shaman one. There are two wizards, two paladins, one shadow knight, one necromancer, one monk, and one druid up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">These aren't epic quest mob, but there are 3 quests, one for each type of alignment.<br />
<br />
There is a neutral quest, but you need to be a trade skiller for it.  There is an evil quest, and there is a good quest.<br />
<br />
There are 8 NPC's up there.  Two for each Alignment (a council person and an aid) and then the Head librarian and his aid.</div></div><hr />
