<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have completed the shield part, Black Dire part and first CoM part. I also can kill the Black Dire anytime I want and just port to EJ and Return the hide. Does anyone have any idea how many turn ins I'd have to make to get to Ally with the TrueSpirit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Black Dire is on a four hour spawn, and you have to kill the advisor to get him to pop.<br />
<br />
That being said, he's a pain, even if you can solo him. I'd rather do woe &amp; envy &amp; marr's promise to raise my faction, as those are on a 2 hour timer, and can be bought in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Razukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, in my oppinion hes pretty easy, 4h spawn or no, just wanted to know how many turn ins to get max faction? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think anyone has done max ally through black dire.<br />
<br />
The answer will probably be somewhere around 10-15 tries, as that's about how many woe &amp; envy &amp; marr's promises it takes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or, maybe you could just do your epic normally? content is there for a reason... skipping it is kind of lame :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Razukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, theres this tiny problem. I live in europe and theres only 1 european guild on my server, Veeshan, the guild is Valhall. Everybody in Valhall is like 60+ and im 52 at the moment. So it's really hard for me to attend any raids, actually Ive played the game for 3 years and only been on 1 raid in PoH. But I believe if I will be able to skip The Hole part and Lord ghiosk part I could get the Tear on Christmas holidays and gather a few mages and clerics to kill Lord Rak. I figured that the Black Dire part is harder and has to wield a better faction hit than Woe and Envy, and when youre doing the Woe and Envy you gotta search the bloody willowisp in karanas wich pisses me off, thats why I would rather kill the Dire, less running to do. I can bind in MM, kill Dire, port to EJ with my druid on seccond account and gate back to MM, then kill Dire again after work or the next day.<br />
done it 3 times now, if I've got only 7 times left I will be soooooo happy )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did my epic with no help from my guild, and during off-peak times.  The multiple raids to Fear were the hardest part.<br />
<br />
The Hole was a pain, but it's much nicer now that you can mez things.<br />
<br />
No reason to skip Ghiosk, even if you're not able to help kill the reavers, I saw the books shouted out frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Razukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">WOHOO! just found out that our small lil newbie guild is going on a raid to The Hole, maybe I will be able to get them to kill Kirn =) One Problem though. Can I give the thingie to Kirn and kill it then get the ring and turn it in if I haven't killed Ghiosk? <br />
<br />
On my server (Veeshan) CoM is empty most of the time so I can't get the books (. Maybe some of you Great Oracles and Prophets on Veeshan could help me out on Ghiosk? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No, you must do each step in order.<br />
<br />
If you are having troubles getting folks together to kill Ghiosk, see if you can find a druid that still needs the reaver for their epic and run a joint raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Razukaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks a lot for all your replies, I really appreciate it! I'll go and try to get some raid together before saturday =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oracles and Prophets can't help you with Ghiosk.<br />
<br />
Ghiosk spawns off of a reaver, and fights like a reaver - IE, extremely high MR, procs blind. It's always a tank fight. Or a pet fight with the mage's epic pet.<br />
<br />
This is why I hate reaver raids.... I buff, then I sit on my butt, occasionally throwing in a heal or two. If I really wanted to do this I would've rolled a cleric.... I've tried throwing all my dots and slows and debuffs on the reavers, the only thing that stuck was a JBB blast for 5 points. Woo. Go me.<br />
<br />
I'm more than happy to help guildmates and friends out, but I hate reaver raids with a passion... I just get so bored. And they tend to go on for four hours or more if they are after JR's.</div></div><hr />
