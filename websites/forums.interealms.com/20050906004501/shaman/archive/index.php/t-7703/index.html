<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I use 9 right now and yesterday it was the difference from casting in the 10th ring war and not even being able to mem gate so i could leave in frustration. im just wondering what experiences you have had with certain settings<br />
<br />
I know back in my FPS days where you would change the bitrate in the .cfg to mirror your line capabilities. then it was 5000 = aprox 5000 kbps or in my case 25000 = 25kbs which more accuratly fit my upload and made the game so much more smooth.<br />
<br />
Has anyone tried to go higher and had succes ? i wont be able to check it untill the next huge raid cause 9.0 is doing damn fine. But if it can be even better , by all means i would like to know :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm. I'll have to bump mine up to nine then, as I'm on a dedicated DSL. <br />
<br />
Although I do ok, in most situations. My main problem is lag from spell effects and too many models. So what I do is I turn all spell effects off (but leave epic effects on :)), all the time. That way when we start ToV, or we're working on Fay, I'm not lagged down or having my vision blocked by sparkles.<br />
<br />
It's less &quot;pretty&quot;, but I can at least see what's going on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IIRC setting data rate above 9 sets you at the default of 4 or 5.

thnx for your replies <br />
<br />
Taladaen : in evey game i have played over the years thre has always been a point that you cant go past in which the setting in returned to the default ot keep the load on the servers from getting too high. i meean you have someone on a t1 sucking down all the bandwidth and then add a few more people doing that and it can get nasty.<br />
<br />
so sounds logical</div></div><hr />

<br />
ding ding ding !<br />
<br />
Plus the fact that you seem to do nothing but insult me upon anything you have to say to me in any thread lately.<br />
<br />
You got nothing positive to interject , then dont.<br />
I would much rather NOT had that link then for you to insult me then give it. <br />
<br />
thnx for the link though, oh and FYI the only reason i posted this was cause i was laggin out in the 10th ring war and someone in my guild mentioned data rate so i logged out and tried it and it helped . didnt have time to play with it since i was in the war. the rest of it i put it together cause i used to compete online in quake/quake2/sin/quake3/unreal/unreal tournement so im a tad familar with data transfer and how to tweak it. if you feel so inclinded to learn something browse the forums at www.speedguide.net ,i learned a ton from there. but hey , thnx for the insults and insinuations of ignnorance before even asking.<br />
<br />
Anyway , feel free to flame away here to great and knowledgable fountain of flowing light. You might wanna continue this positive and &quot;intelligent&quot; debate , i however to not.<br />
<br />
peace 2 u</div></div><hr />

I did interject something positive, I answered your question... so I must be a fountain of flowing light. Even though I get the feeling you read that thread before you thought of posting your question here and bumping up your count a bit more.<br />
<br />
You sure you don't want to continue this intellectual debate? You can prolly get a few more posts out of it.<br />
<br />
All in all, lighten up Francis.</div></div><hr />

Damn, thought you were staying away from this thread friend... but you have a tendency to say your not posting again but come back anyhow.<br />
<br />
In  2.75 years, I have 922 posts. In 7 months, you have 50 posts more (970). What exactly was your point, other than proving mine? Thanks, drive through.<br />

Chill little man. Am I the first who has said this about you? Actually, good advice. How do I add you to my ignore list?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Pretty sure I have mine set at 9. But then again I have had some major lag spikes lately so maybe I should check it out.<br />
<br />
When you said that above 9 sets to default 4 or 5, does it actaully change the datarate.txt file? Because I had mine at 12 for a while and when I looked at datarate.txt it still said 12 after I had played.</div></div><hr />
