<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kelshir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading the board about everyone ranting on the new npc caster being smater and would just like to say I agree with you. I know some of you like Gloriana have been keeping up with my post but I desided to make a troll shaman and as soon as I got to lvl 9 I ran to Oasis to get my new spells there. Well on the way to the tent I saw a madman who conned deep blue to me and I desided to try him out. I went ahead and casted Drowsy on him not knowing what class he was and this was the next message I got.<br />
<br />
you have been hit for 246 non-melee damage by a_madman<br />
You have been slain by a_madman<br />
LOADING PLEASE WAIT.....<br />
<br />
uhm....he conned deep blue to me so lets say he was lvl 8 because I was lvl 9 and since in the past I played nothing but pure casters (except wizard) I was never never able to do that much damage. :mad: <br />

The new Shaman kick toy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">*** kinda stuff is that Verant ? lvl 8-9 Madmen now casting DD's that a wizard of much higher level would possess ? What next, North Freeport Moss Snakes that proc Envenomed Bolt when they bite you ? Better be quiet don't want to give them anymore &quot;bright&quot; ideas ! (note my sarcasm)<br />

/RUDE Verant !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yesferatu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Saw a cleric pal of mine get whacked for 2 1120 ice comets out of nowhere in Sebillis this morning.<br />
<br />
Little frog bastards just kept chain casting.<br />
Nice that they still hit like warriors too.<br />
<br />
Got venomed by a 40 level shaman in TT I think too.<br />
Tried to double dot me...<br />
Pretty soon they'll be stacking dots of the same line cause they know they stack.<br />
<br />
Bah<br />
<br />
How bout you make it fair and left us cast sow indoors like mobs do.<br />
<br />
grumble grumble</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a question for Yesferatu:<br />
Did you mean you got Envenomed Bolt casted on you by a level 40 Frog in TT.....or did you mean you got DoTed by one ?<br />
If so Verant really &quot;screwed the pooch&quot; on that one...Shaman don't get EB until 49. Whatupwitdat Verant ?  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I was planning on soloing some tough caster mobs in the near future too. Forget it now ! (I solo quite a bit due to RL time constraints) Which is another reason why this so-called upgrade completely sucks ! What about those of us who solo most of the time and don't have alot of time to look for a group to do some leveling/exping ? I'm forced to group to keep from getting my lunch handed to me by some caster mob or stick primarily to all warrior non-casting NPC's.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks Verant ! (note the sarcasm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was exping in sebilis last night on the easy frogs (bok and lower). I didn't think it was so bad. Several of them cast Entombment of Ice, but I resisted it completely at least 70% of the time. I only got nailed good once. I had &quot;my skin ignite&quot; for over 600 dmg once, dunno what spell that was. A wiz cast it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At level 60 things are going to be different then for those at level 55. Players in higher end raid gear are going to have a much easier time then those on their first characters with minimal hp/resists. That bugs me. I can understand it when we're dealing with dragons/boss mobs but your everyday xp giving froggy? It's a tad extreme.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Amen to that, Azz.  I still get mad when I see the shaman mobs in Ssra casting level 59 shaman DoTs on me (pox!).  If I had to wait until 59 to cast it, why should he get to cast it on me when he is 54?  Bastiges!  :)<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I noticed that some of the alien mobs are casting &quot;something of the earth&quot; root spell on me and my dawg a lot last night. One mob attempted to cast it on me eight times. I resisted every attempt. I'm glad that I casted Resist Magic buff on me.</div></div><hr />
