<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am going to start the Cudgel Quest but as stated I need 8k of bone chips.<br />
<br />
Once I have the bone chips who do I give them to in cabilis?  Will I be KOS  to the person I give the bone chips to?<br />
<br />
Also I am going to Kurns to farm bone chips, good place? Any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">have you hunted much in Sebilis?<br />
<br />
If you have, your legion of cabilis faction should be maxed out.  <br />
That makes you indifferent to the troopers.   If you haven't maxed your legion of cabilis, then you will probably be KOS.<br />
<br />
You hand in bone chips to the guard on the right, at the entrance to Cabilis, in the Field of Bone.  Just hail him, he will tell you something about bone chips.<br />
<br />
You gotta be really careful on the hand ins though, as there are wandering crusaders in the area that are on a different faction and are KOS to you.  They are pretty mean...they don't see invis.  So when you are doing hand-ins position yourself so you can see if they are coming and run away.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Even better - if you stand way, way back in the corner behind Trooper Mojo, you can stand close enough to hand in the chips WITHOUT being spotted by the Crusaders.  It's a little scary the first time it happens, but it's true. Just back straight into the corner and edge in a bit at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm ok another couple of questions.<br />
<br />
I never fought in Seb but I did kill alot of sarnaks if that makes a difference, if it doest and I am still KOS what must I do? Fight in Seb? Wolf form? <br />
<br />
Next question, I was checking the quest out and the final part I will be destroying my VS faction which means OT will hate me.  I enjoy my Gating Hammer to OT and the convience of banking, is their away of rebuilding faction once quest is complete or to avoid this all together?<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fighting in Seb would be an easy way.  I would imagine wolfform is KOS too.<br />
<br />
Killing enough sarnaks might have done it for you.<br />
Here is a list of things you can kill to raise Legion of Cabilis faction.<br />
<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=154<br />
<br />
Easiest way to check and see if it is high enough would be to run over and Consider one of the troopers.  :)<br />
<br />
Regarding ruining VS faction...not a lot you can do to raise it again I think.  Killing dragons (Esorpa of the Ring, Faydedar, Gorenaire, Phara Dar, Talendor) and Xygoz will give you positive faction hits.  (Run out and farm Phara Dar for faction!! lol)<br />
<br />
and this quest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah thats the quest I did to get the hammer but I am not sure if I would even be able to get in OT to do the quest.<br />
<br />
Hmmm going to have to make a decision on whats more important hehe.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmmm another thing I was thinking, maybe just have the raiding party fight while I sit back and watch then loot, no killing involved, is this possible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The safest way i've found to check out your faction with the troopers is in Field of Bone.  There's a path that leads from Cabilis out to the pit area.  Trooper Taer will walk up the path from the city entrance to the pit area.  You can con him from a distance, and not have to worry about wandering crusaders.<br />
<br />
Fulaq posted a nice guide on Cabilis faction here<br />

Notice his disclaimers at the top.  It's a little out of date, but still an excellent guide</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anyone know specifically which vendor in which zone sells bonechips?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Vendors only sell bonechips IF a player has sold some to them, as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">But if you try the right zone and do a bit of merchant mining after your server has been up at least a couple weeks, you'll get more bone chips than you can carry.  Any popular newbie zone featuring skellies will be good, just find the nearest vendor that a newbie would be likely to use.  The tailoring vendor in Everfrost at the Halas ramp is a very good one, and I'm sure the vendors just inside Neriak would be good too.  I'm sure there are more, too....  Just be prepared to invest a bit in getting to the bone chips in the first place.  There's a good guide to Merchant Mining HERE (http://www.eqtraders.com/prices/mining.htm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ragnarita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You can still use the OT hammer when KoS, the skelly on the boat isn't on VS faction (on beta neutral I think) You may sometimes agro another skeletal Worker, but they are green and rather easy to kill.<br />
The bank is a bit trickier, but you can use it at night when the general goes out of the outpost. The bankers are not on VS faction.<br />
<br />
btw if you wonder why the bankers and the skelly on the boat aren't on VS faction, they are used for the Cabilis necro skullcap quests</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ragnarita, that is awesome news, thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just FYI if it makes your decision any different, the first 6 cudgel quests are very time consuming and tedious.  There were on average 2 - 5 iksar shaman per server who had the 6th cudgel before this quest went live, and for good reason =)<br />
It can all be done solo, but you'll need foraging for a few parts, and spending lots of time in kunark dungeons for semi-rare drops.  Good luck =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Some where else someone hinted at a vendor that had unlimited bone chips. This was a luclin vendor.<br />
Just wondering if it was real or not.</div></div><hr />
