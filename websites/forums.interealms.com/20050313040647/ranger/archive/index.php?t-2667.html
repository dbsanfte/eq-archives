<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, only on FV server.  Anyone else can choose Agnostic.  Except maybe Iksar...  But I know Enchanters can choose agnostic.  In fact doing so is the best choice for enchanters because it allows them to use their race changing illusion spells to get into the home cities of that race without any problems.  Otherwise the Diety part of faction kicks in and their KoS even though they look like a DE or whatever</div></div><hr />

On a bad note it takes a bunch of blue diamonds to smith that, and I only have a couple.  On the last note, I am running off to Alaska to play in the wilderness for a month so I wont be doing anything in EQ till I get back.  Maybe I can talk someone into collecting BD's for me......... yeah right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hawkwind</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree I am glad they finally made cultural armor something that would be used, however you have to realize how hard it is to make this armor. First off this is not even trivial at 250 skill. To even get to 235+skill takes many many months of farming/buying components and smithing up to skill not to mention the thousands of plat to get there.  Not to mention it takes 3 Blue Diamonds to make the temper for the sheets needed to make this BP, and the failure rate? Pretty damn good even with a Geerlock hammer so don't expect to see a ton of these around ;) <br />
<br />
As for the people who are able to make the velium cultural congrats, I see it as something for them to strive for and a &quot;reward&quot; of sorts for sticking with tradeskills that were for the most part useless imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well theres likely to be chain based stuff as well, and as was also pointed out, this stuff is very hard to make ; You can get in a Seb group and work on getting the gems you need and spend the $ and time to get your smithing up, without requiring a guild raid for rare armor drops in SS, Kael, etc)<br />
<br />
 I like it personally ; Note everyone can participate in raids <br />
<br />
 Everyone can work on trade skills</div></div><hr />

Her skill is only 176 or so though.  Collecting the padding ingrediants for fine steel (to get skill ups) is a pain in the neck even for my ranger.  So maybe not. :\</div></div><hr />

Tunare worshipping Human &amp; Wood Elf Rangers only of course . . .  Nice stats though; I gotta find me a tailor.  ;)<br />

Or by the logic that we can already wear the Mithril Plate peices from Sol B...... (granted it took 2 years to be able to wear the BP)</div></div><hr />
