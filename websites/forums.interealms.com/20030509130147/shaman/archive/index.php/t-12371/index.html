<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, first of all I was wondering if there is still an xp penalty for trolls, and if so how big is it (15%)?<br />
<br />
Second of all, I am badly in need of some suggestions for where to hunt.<br />
<br />
I hunted in the Dreadlands from 39-47, and then killed plaguebone thieves until 49.  Then I solo'ed in CoM until 50, and then began grouping in Velketor's.  I'm now level 51, and XP sucks everywhere.  I get 1% per 4 kills in the Hole, and about 15% of the mobs con green to me.  Velketor's XP isn't much better although I've never seen how many solo kills it takes for a %.<br />
<br />
Anybody have some suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a Troll, you do have an xp penalty, it's 20%. It suxor, but that the price you pay for being the best race out there. (hehe)<br />
<br />
At 51, I was soloing in Echo Caverns, there's a huge room, near the Deep zone, you can pull solo's if careful. If not root the adds, use doggie and whip those underbulks and fiends. Cash is not that great, but I found the XP to be okay, not sure how much, because I didn't keep track.<br />
<br />
Good Hunting My Troll Brother..</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's not heavily camped, do the nobles and bards in HHK, at 51 you should get 1% per kill.  I did 52 and 53 there in the same day (about 12 hours of playing) at about 0.75% per kill.  On my server, they're usually pretty well camped Fri-Sun, but during the week, they seem to be open.<br />
<br />
They're also an easy source of AAXP up until level 53 (might be green at 54, haven't been back to check).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got through 54 on the nobles in HK; about half were blue but it still was excellent exp.  You can ride them out till 57, but at 55+ they're mostly light blue and arent' the phenomenal exp they were in the 40's and lower 50's.  In the upper 50's you can solo in velks for pretty good exp and loot.  I got a few pairs of schw and some silver chitin wristbands over the course of a few levels there.  If you don't mind a DL/KC-like atmosphere, with constant bickering and idiocy in ooc and shout, you could try grouping (or soloing :p) in tier 1 planes, although a friend of mine who plays a now 52 mage said that HK is much better exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At 51 I did the gnome guards in Echo Caverns.  All dark blue at 51 and go dark blue at 52.  This area is the first right before you hit the taskmaster area.  2 gnomes at top of ramp.. 2 gnomes to the left guarding entrance to throne room.... and 2 of the gnomes in the throne room (court jester and herald, both come single)... dont pull the kings you'll get a train.  Get almost a blue per 6 or 7 gnomes iirc.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, these gnomes are on there own faction so no probs there.  Like you care :) EZ, EZ kills.<br />
