<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was grouped with a mage this weekend.  The mage gave my pet summoned weapons to use (Kedge blades?).  Anyway, I watched my pets hits and he was only biting and kicking.  Did pet weapon use change after the last patch or do I need to use non mage summoned weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Were they 1 handed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Kedge blades are 1 handed.  I will look at this tonight.  Currently have other hits turned off because of raiding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no change . either they werent given or you only gave them 1  or something.<br />
<br />
I have been heavy using mage weapons this week and they are working as intended , which is GD well ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always bug mages for weapons.<br />
2 h2h weapons = 4 bites btw...didn't know that myself until I saw it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Our puppies are simple creatures.  Giving them too much confuses them.  If you gave him everything at once, he won't equip it properly.  Give him one item at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lol my experience is just the oppisit, I always give pets both weapons at once, else he wouldn't equip one from time to time. What can I say, it's strange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Also, if your pet is biting after giving the weapons, he didn't equip them. I have yet to see 61 true spirit use a 2h-weapon, so keep with 1hs/p/b. <br />
If you can get a 61 mage to summon you 2 &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28595&quot;&gt;Blades of Walnan&lt;/a&gt; even better, mainly because of the proc (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3038&quot;&gt;Wrath of Wind&lt;/a&gt;), decreasing HP by 22 (lvl 1) to 150 (lvl 65).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ixi fists proc when the doggie uses em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">he also bites 4 times in a row with ixi fists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just turn on others hits and others misses after the mage claims to have given the pet weapons.  It's pretty dam easy to tell if the mage did or is just saying he did.  Gotta watch those mages, they're sneaky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">something to think about ..<br />
<br />
walan are 1hs  fists are h2h , 61 pet is a 58 warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ixi fists make the pet appear to still be biting but he does proc and quad with them, I usually get walan blades if I have the choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Pet is also an NPC. I doubt weapon caps matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Pets will use h2h weapons. Try giving dogdog one crappy ulak and one crappy slasher or something... bite bite slash slash kick etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The difference ixi fists and walnan swords made with my 44 and 49 pets was phenomenal; with them, he could easily kill mobs that were blue to me with just a haste and a slow on the mob (don't forget Muzzle of Mardu!  30% haste that stacks with our haste buffs)  Without the gear, he'd need alot of help from me.  If you can get it, also get a Belt of the Magi'Kot for him - it has 250 hp.  Maybe I'm just weird, but I buff his dex for ixi fists / walnan swords, for the procs.  I give him everything at once and have never had problems with him Alpha'ing.  Thanks to those in Crucible channnel who pointed out to me the benefits of summoned mage pet gear! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Don't forget armor.  It's been proven that the mage pets wear armor (although apparently not all slots), but it's never been proven if Shaman pets wear it.  I would imagine that summoned Plate would work.  :)  Nothing like adding some raw AC to the Puppy.</div></div><hr />
