<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in TM for the first time ever, and scared ****less all the time :) Way to many wandering agro thingies in there.<br />
<br />
I did one of the Grimling caves, but I have a feeling I didn't do it the best way.<br />
<br />
I camped high up on the mountain side next to the cave and pulled from the cave. Didn't have much problem taking on the duo at entrance or the first duo inside. Should I have fought the first pair at the entrance and then made my camp inside the cave instead? How far do they agro? The orefinders are easy xp at lvl 40, and the geomancers are not hard as long as you keep an eye on your health.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eepjr24</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends on which cave, really. I stuck with the first cave (also called small cave or non-laborer cave) at your level. If you do that on, just invis in past the first two, and get a pet next to Felodious Sworddancer. Pull the right hand mob from entrance as you face them. Kill. Then wait a minute (canna, med, whatever) and pull left. Wait another minute. Pull right hand mob at bottom of ramp. I think you see the pattern. At 39-40, you may only be able to do these 4 spawns, but if you are keeping up okay, the next 2 at the bend work the same way, pull right first. Pulling left may get you two mobs (one around the corner), seems to for me about half the time. I just made 45 and I can take the whole cave this way now. XP is very slow at 45 (almost all LB, with a few DB), so I have moved on, although I may come back for more acrylia as needed.<br />
<br />
Things to watch: If no one is in the other cave, the laborer will wander in to your cave as well. Surprise! =) Also, the grimling runner paths past the cave if you keep an eye out. Nice cash in bazaar for the pattern if you are not KOS in Katta.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info. At my current lvl (40) I have no problems taking 2 of them at a time. Downside to that is that I have a long time to med and get health. I have not been able to pull them one at a time. I will try the invis thing.<br />
<br />
/Merry<br />
<br />
PS I do know that one orefinder, one geomancer and the runner is too much to handle. I was doing the first two, and couldn't for the life of me figure out why my helath was going down so fast. Turned out that the runner was backstabbing me at the same time. Had to sacrifice cujo and run towards zone. Luckliy the runner didn't follow, so I got xp for two of them without having to zone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you hunt the Laborer Mine, you can set up your camp in a *absolutely* safe location.<br />
<br />
Standing in the entrance of the Mine, step out and turn to the left, run up the hill towards a boulder.  There is a space of about 10ft or so between the wall and that boulder.  NOTHING paths up that area, and it is a good place to go /afk, or med, or whatever.<br />
<br />
I hunted this zone in my early 40s, and the laborer cave is much better than the other one.  Easy to single pull mobs all day long, and the laborer drops a nice little bonus.  Plus, since you are outside the cave, much easier to disengage and head to zoneline if you get in trouble.<br />
<br />
at 39 - 40 I could clear the first 4 or 5 mobs, once I got a REIF I could clear about 7 or so.  Good loot for the level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks,<br />
<br />
I have hunted the other dungeon, and it is just not safe. Always 2 at a time, and for some resaon I always get the runner or the laborer adding at the worst possible moment. Have yet to die in there, but it sure gets my adrenalin going :)<br />
<br />
I will try the laborer mine instead. I don't mind the acrylia either :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tried the new spot at the Labor camp. Much better. I have no clue on how you manage to do single pulls from within the cave though. I always get two. Would be much faster xp for me if I could pull them one at a time.<br />
<br />
/Merry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Snapdragn is not quite correct,  the spot is pretty safe but I have aggroed a dire sonic wolf on very rare occaisions when setting there.  The incidents are rare (two times in about 30 hours) but it does happen.  Dire sonics are hard to outrun without SoW so keep it up at all times at this camp.<br />
<br />
Beware of the Manacrafters from the laborer cave too.  They don't have many hitpoints but they can nuke the hell outta a 40th shaman.  Do not try to root/rot them.  Nuke them or tank them with your pet or you will be in a heap o' trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juxtadude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am having a lot of fun at the laborer grimling caves as a 40-41 shaman.  This is the camp described above behind the rock near the wall.  Yes wolves do roam nearby, but I either kill them or stay behind the rock and they don't aggro me.  <br />
<br />
I have found the grimlings to be very easy blues and I can get by with a simple slow and melee debuff.  The reason I am not using dots is that I am working on raising 1hb and Evocation since they were both around 90 when I started this camp.  Now they are both around 110 and I'm halfway through 41.<br />
<br />
I am using a centi warhammer, fbss, ikky regen bp, and 2 6ac/65hp rings.  My AC is around 700 and my hp are 1111.  So with Fury, Haste, Chloro, Bear form and standard AC and stat buffs, I simply pull with slow (Tagar's, not the newest one to save mana) follow up with Listless Power and tank it.  Once it gets low on health I zap it with Spirit Strike (81 dmg) and once it flees I hit it again so I don't have to chase it.  That's it.  I usually take so little damage that I can even use Canni 2 a couple times during battle to keep from regening to full hp.  I usually only pull the roamers and the 2 outside, then either break the guys just past the entrance (watch for geomancers) or I will single pull a wolf or bat.  When fighting wolves or bats I also use a VoS to augment my damage.  Also the foreman is tougher and I use VoS on him.<br />
<br />
I use a slightly different strategy on geomancers.  I don't bother with slow or debuffs.  I VoS from max range and run over the hill so it can't cast on me.  Once it appears on top of the hill, I sick pet on him and run over to attack fast and interrupt.  Use fast weapon and drop bear form so you can slam.  I generally drop a couple larger nukes (149 or 216 variety) to kill him fast.  Problem is, as with all casters, sometimes I end battle with full hp, sometimes I have 2 bubbs left.  Not very consistent but I can kill them.<br />
<br />
I like it because I can raise my skills, the loot is decent (Katta nearby for selling), and I have killed a couple runners (see Rallic Pack quest).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah great spot.  I have found the best way to take the geomancers out is to Sick the pet on them first.  This way thier first nuke will be on the pet.  If you get lucky they will attempt to root and snare your pet right off.  Just before your pet engages the Geomancer Start your Rain DD (Gale of Poison I think) so it will be causing DD damage to the mob with slight possiblity to interupt for next few sec.  Not bad Damage ratio too.  With your pet Bashing and Taunting the Geo you whould be able to get at least one more nuke off before you catch the attention of the Geo ensuring your pet does not take too much damage.  By your second nuke you should have it dead or near run mode.  I ussually go ahead and nuke it dead due to they like to nuke to the last some times and who ever starts casting first is who is going get thier spell off first.  I personally use the Poison Nuke as I find it seems to be less resisted then the magic ones.  Remember these guys are wizards so have Snare, root, Magic Stuns and DD.  They some times cast Ice and Fire less often so buffing your Fire Ice and magic is very good idea as you will resist alot more of thier damage.  And as your pet uses the same resists as you have.  make them go down very fast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can a 34 shaman and 34 wizard duo in those caves?  It's easy exp at 40+, but my shaman and his wizard partner are looking for a new place to get exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well from what I have seen there main thing would be what type equipment you have and your tactics.  It really just boils down to if you can attually kill them effecently.  I started there at level 39 solo.  So adding one more person and going there one spell level sooner would not be so unbeivible.  With both your roots and the wizards Snare you should be able to take the caves.  What I would do is zone into TM and sit at the cave you zone in from and wait for an Orefinder to wonder by.  That should not take too long.  Pull the Ore Finder to zone and start beating it down your favorite way.  If you can take them down with more then 3/5 to 4/5 your mana left then you should be able to hold at least four of the spawns in the cave for a while.  The one tactic I would use though is on the Geomancers (Wiz Caster) is to not pull them.  Every one get thier Fire, Ice, and MAGIC resist up as high as possible.  Then have the shaman send in his pet to attack the Geomancer where she stands.  Once pet engages it will end up eating the first nuke or so.  If your lucky the Geo will deside it needs to root and snare you all and you will only have deal with losing your sow possible and getting rooted for little while.  After the pet hits the Geo and you see her start to cast open up with your fastest nukes and take her out.  With wizard might be good to throw in his stun spells to as that will prevent the Geos from getting thier nuke off at all.  Over all the Geo's have alot less HP just do alot more damage faster till they run out mana.  Though with slows they really are much easier to kill.</div></div><hr />
