<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Great, that was a nice little bonus to the spell, and none to overpowering.  Why are they wasting thier time with a nerf like that when there are important issues to deal with?  At least its not in the game yet..........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh, with that kind of directional focus I am anticipating either a nerf to True North is next or mebe they will finally release the fabeled addition to the Vision line of spells:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmmm, I wonder if it's because shaman can use group sow to drop druid wolf form?  Would be a mean thing to do if a druid was banking in a KOS city or some such.<br />
<br />
Probably for the same reason that torpor is still group only, Verant wants to limit our ability to wreak havoc on other players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yer argument is very silly Gloriana, you sound like a VI employee even!  Yah I know, that's a mean thing to say, so reconsider your statement and I'll reconsider mine. <br />
<br />
Sides, if I want to drop a druid's wolf form on him, I'll just use Avatar.  This works best right after you cancel three of the snares on his quadkite.  Oh, after 2.5 years of playing EQ, I have WAYS of dealing with annoying droods!  <br />

<br />
Wow, terribly sorry you had to waste your time reading and then posting on this thread.<br />
<br />
thanks for sharing though, I will make a note that you don't care about this issue for my future reference.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:<br />
Thanks for stopping by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Is it huge? No.<br />
<br />
What it is, though, is us suddenly not having something that we did have before.<br />
<br />
It just sort of bugs me.<br />
<br />
We get SoW first, then druids, but for the longest time, they got group SoW and we never did. Not only that, but with Luclin they got an actual upgrade on SoW. Something that goes faster than SoW. Imagine that. So our upgrade was group SoW with an attack buff. <br />
<br />
They've taken away the attack buff. So I say, give us something else to make up for it. Let the druids have SoE, and give shamans something else. Spirit of the Cougar, an 85% moving speed increase that lasts 30 minutes or whatever. Spirit of the Mountain Lion, a 70% moving speed increase that also gives Safe Fall 100.<br />
<br />
I don't really care. I just want two things. 1) It should stack with all of our other buffs, so nothing that will overwrite acumen. 2) It should be faster than SoW with none of the restrictions of Scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">lol, indeedy yessir! our grpsow is overpowering and unbalancing in the extreme!<br />
<br />
whats the point of this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Ya'll are failing to see that VI has realized that the +ATK buff on our group sow was overpowering on those huge outdoor raids, causing the tanks to outdamage the Manaburn wizzies.<br />

HAhahaha .. after 3 beers.. I almost fell off the chair... That was funny..... Gonna have to use that line for other annoying sh!t.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SoE is annoying, and you all know it. In fact, you said as much in other posts about druids drive-by-buffing it on you. Who wants to be bobbing up and down for an hour? I still use SoW and Levitate over SoE since some zones strip the lev component and thus the entire buff. SoE was a rather lame Luclin spell that &quot;passed&quot; as an upgrade; its only redeeming value is its duration. <br />
<br />
By every indication, SoW II should have been the real upgrade -- see invis, Scale speed without restrictions, self-only :P, no damn lev, and a long duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If they turn this into a regualr group sow for a level 39 spell I will be really bummed. This is one buff that people request from me a lot in places like CT etc, 15 atk is 15 atk. <br />
<br />
If they are taking out the atk component I think bumping it up in speed would be a fair compensation. My  gut feeling is they will just leave the atk portion off and we will never hear another word about it again from VI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;IF the reason is to keep Shaman from killing Wolf Forms, then this is one dumbass way to do it.

<br />
Easy reasoning...  Because all those Druid's you did take advantage of come back, group wolf form you, drop your faction by 2 levels and watch as you just barely dubious ogres, trolls, and ikkies get the crap kicked outta you.  &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The difference of course being you must be grouped with a druid before he/she can cast share wolf form, whereas you can cast group sow on anybody.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Why why why why....<br />
<br />
I hope this is some experimental stacking test they are doing.  I sure most see it as trivial but where does the nerfing end. If this goes live a shaman under lvl 50 will not have any group buffs worth casting.  The 15atk was nice, very nice.<br />
<br />
So now instead of shaman's spell line having some unique Varity in it we are casting like druids. Don't make spells all have the same effect but name them differnent. If we wanted to play a Druid I sure we would have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well if they happen to remove the ATK component from Spirit of Bih'Li then I wouldn't mind if it was then castable indoors. <br />
<br />
Xhosa <br />
56 Shaman<br />
The Nameless Server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Maybe they removed it because they're adding a line of ATK buff shaman spells like I've been suggesting for a year! :p  And they'll add a mid 40s level Group SoW that moves you at Scale speed, then a mid 50s one that moves you at Cheetah speed!<br />
<br />
I can always hope!</div></div><hr />

but make it FASTER!!<br />

I also liked the idea of SOW II<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">just making the sow booties targetable would make me so happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hmmm 2 things ... <br />
<br />
1).  If they take the ATK piece off this spell without adding or improving something else ... Expect Creative Writing Allen 101 for  some whacky statement on the goal of 'overall balancement of the game'.<br />
<br />
2).  As a peace offering ... a new Grp True North will be added.   But expect that it will over-write and can be cast outside your group.   Emg patch will follow within 1 hour to remove the &quot;outside grp&quot; part ... followed within 24 hours to remove the &quot;over-write&quot;.    Then statement of working as expected to follow ... /shrug.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Hmmmm ... wonder if that was from surfing here?<br />
<br />
When was the last time someone from VI posted on Crucible?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They fixed a stacking issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Fixed?  They broke ;P<br />
<br />
Now it won't stack with  Rabid Bear, Avatar, Wolf forms, Boon of Garou, Aura of Battle, Force of Nature, etc :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Hahaha. Idiots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I don't want the black fur booties to be targetable on other people because it would reduce their usefulness as an insta click buff.  Or, if you're fighting a mob, or on the run someplace and your sow fades, do you want to have to take a half second to hit tab, or do you just want to click the boots?</div></div><hr />
