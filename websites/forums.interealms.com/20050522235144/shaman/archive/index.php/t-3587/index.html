<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Skaeyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering, what kind of personality commonalities people who play shamans have.  I mean, there are better tanks, better healers, better nukers, and clerics are better buffers in a sense(AC and HP).  Yea we are the DoT kings, but we are mostly a conglomerate of different attributes.  I was wondering if there are any MAIN commonalities Shaman players have.  Be it interestes, introversion/extroversion, jobs, degrees from college(if any), books, movies, etc.<br />
For instance, I am into computers and Archaeology.  I am working on 2 degrees and the books i read are mostly sci-fi and fantasy....now i know that sci-fi and fantasy books are probably common among ALL eq players, but im sure there are specifics that just shaman players have.  Any thoughts or comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Probably the &quot;I am into computers&quot; bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">All Shamans:<br />
<br />
1. Have massive ego problems (cause we r0xx0r so much, of course.)<br />
<br />
2. We all fear Sunmoon.<br />
<br />
C. We all love pudding, even old, stinky, warm pudding.<br />
<br />
4. We all have a sore finger from pressing the slow button over and over and over and .....<br />
<br />
D. Did I mention we all love pudding?<br />
<br />
6. Um... ill edit as i think of more ;) peace out.<br />
<br />
7. This doesn't go for our scaley friends but I JBB myself like every other mob by accident hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Good question.<br />
<br />
I play a Monk as my main. I love to pull, to split, to break spawns, to constantly feed the group with 0 downtime.<br />
<br />
As my Enchanter alt (55) I do the same thing. Only instead of a fully ticked off MOB I can lock, slow, and mez them all in a pretty row.<br />
<br />
As a Shaman I honestly never found my niche. Now I really love to solo as a Shaman. Me, Jobarer, JBB, Fungal + Epic is my idea of fun as a Shaman. <br />
<br />
Oh and it's not the slow key that has made my finger calloused - it's from Canning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sometimes my finger gets so sore canning I start clicking :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Most 60 torpor \ malo shammies I have ran into have the same mentality as me...and that is that shamans are gods and can solo just about anything that is slowable, and some things that arent!<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I like Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance \ Death Gate Cycle books.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT : BTW, the whole sunmoons pants thing and liking Wildaar's pudding is freaking me out Coraz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've read 2 of those Death Gate books.. I don't remember either :(<br />
<br />
Edit: I like sunmoon's pants cause that is the root of all evil in the universe<br />
<br />
And Wildaar is God obviously, his pudding flows to us all<br />
<br />
Nother Edit: Fine I get a better location :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being a cleric or a druid would drive me insane.<br />
<br />
I also like to push the envelope of where I'm supposed to be: &quot;Hm, I wonder if I can kill that yellow goranga&quot;<br />
<br />
a few minutes later:  &quot;Hm, I wonder if I can kill that red goranga&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hehe I am with Asheran on books. I have liked all the Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman series I have read so far. I originally read the first dragonlance trilogy when it was first published. Just got done reading the Rose of the Prophet series first two books and am going to buy the third one from amazon thinger since it is no longer in print and the series is really good (first book starts out kinda slow, but about a third of the way into it it really picks up the pace and the second book continues with it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I enjoy computers (well, most days I hate them), and work for a major PC company repairing workstations at the &quot;Big 3&quot; automakers (printing out my expense reports as I type, :) ).  I have read and own all of the Death Gate Cycle, and almost ALL of the Dragonlance books (and I mean all).  Am I the only one who is glad they brought back the Gods?  Took me forever to track down a complete set of the Mithgar books in used book stores and on Ebay.  I'm also married, own my own home, and younger than you think.  Gotta run and replace a hard drive, stay safe....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am with Shandy on this one - I stay busy, even if it is just dropping JB armor buffs on the &quot;rest of the melee&quot;<br />
<br />
if there are two good solo spots, one with non-stop pulling and one with med every two kills, I will be at the non-stop pull spot, even if loot is worse and exp is less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Have an arts degree. Love mythology, history of peoples and races, folklore, fairy tales and the like. Read up about fairy tales some time - the Grimm brothers sanitised them when they wrote them up, originally these stories were really horrific.<br />
<br />
I'm probably more into Sci fi than fantasy as far as fiction goes, Iain Banks and Neil Stephenson being firm favourites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Reading wise, I used to be into fantasy novels, and read the Dragonlance trilogy, the Twins trilogy, Death Gate Cycle, Shannara, David Eddings stuff, etc.  At the time I read it, I enjoyed them immensly.<br />
However, I've changed my reading tastes a few years ago and almost exclusivly read non-fiction military novels - i.e. memoirs or biographies, or accounts of battles.   I'd rather study the battle of Arnhem that read a novel about Pern.<br />
<br />
I dunno what I have in common with other shamans, but I know what I have in common with other Ogers:<br />
The secret knowledge that we are the best race in Norrath.<br />
shhh!  Don't tell anyone, or Neriak will be empty and Oggok will be swarming with twinks. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am just like joo on reading.  <br />
<br />
At one time I used to read lots of fantasy and such and now it is almost exclusivly none fiction.  I go back further in time thow...  lots of rev war stuff,  founding fathers and such along with some early history like the punic wars.<br />
<br />
It is just amazing that people are just as stupid now as 4000 years ago.  LoL.<br />

I was grouped with a chanter &amp; druid in SD, our usual pull was me slow, druid snare while inc, then I would root it and the chanter would stand next to it until he would be attacked and his pet would agro.   He actually had time to type &quot;Damn shaman slows&quot; while waiting to be hit :)<br />

I believe it's because, at one time, there were less than 10 lvl 50 shamans on the server (over a year) and after the expansion less than 10 lvl 60 shamans until about 6 months ago.  We are so rare we are sought after, which makes have big egos.<br />

If anyone ever came out with a good game based on either, I would most likely sell my EQ camp and start playing more than I do already.   BTW Coraz, Brittney \ Rastin (you didnt say who) arent that tough.  Run in, Insidious Decay, Pox o Betoxx, Plague, and maybe malo and try some poison dots if you have any hps left after that.  They will fall fast :D wizzies, even FoH ones, have crap hps and that should take em unless someone heals them.</div></div><hr />

I hadn't even read Tolkien until earlier this year in fact...<br />
<br />
I love my shaman dearly, because I feel like my personality fits the shaman mold, if that makes any sense... I love to be able to take charge of things and make sure everything is working optimally in a group (perfect example was last night in Chardok, we had a full group with no cleric and I was healing, slowing and buffing with no problems...).  <br />

<br />
For Shaman personalities you have to distinguish between &quot;Old school Shaman&quot; and newer Shaman I guess.<br />
<br />
Old School Shaman are mostly not into it because of power, we knew nothing of the power we could attain. Damn, I remember, the first time I saw Cannibalize I thought &quot;What a useless spell&quot; :)<br />
<br />
For me it is utility first. We can turn other classes into gods (well theoretically, if the stats would work like we thought they did), and we can debuff the enemy to hell. And we can heal, till Level 30 we make damn good mainhealers.<br />
<br />
Then there is diversity. We are the swiss knives of the classes, and we can turn around an xp-group from a wipe to a success in more than one ways (Im talking lower levels here, not the level 60-with Torpor variety). I had groups that saw me in three different roles as people left the groups and others came. That meant it wasnt boring for me and that was a good thing.<br />
<br />
And I wouldnt say Ego-Problems, I would say pride. Back in those days clawing yourself through the lower levels into the range where the power slowly came meant something to us shaman. It felt like we accomplished something. Of course we were proud of it! :)<br />
Something easily forgotten when you twink and powerlevel your Shaman through the hard stages. Along with the pride comes humiliy, and that does wonders handling the powers we finally get at the high levels ;)<br />
<br />
And no, we arent the DoT-King, Necros are!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like to be the puller also, and I do a pretty good job at it.  Naturally, since I cannot FD, I have to be able to handle adds.  But 3, 4 or even 5 slowed mobs aren't much of an issue.  Slow 'em and root park 'em.<br />
<br />
Normal pulling I pull with slow, bring it to camp, epic dot, cann a couple times while a melee gets agro, then go pull another.  Hopefully I get back with the next mob just as the previous one dies.  Usually have no downtime, since I only spend mana on slow.</div></div><hr />
