<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Those of you already in the elemental planes and working towards Time don't need much of a reward for the zones that are being opened up to the masses. You already have a reward - namely the elemental planes and Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
People like my guild stand to get really screwed by this change. My little guild just completed pretty much all of the alternate entry quests for all of our members. We have been working on this almost NONSTOP since since PoP came out. As a reward, we have some fairly low competition exp zones available to us, and some minibosses that are usually up for us to kill.<br />
<br />
After this change, we will be exactly where guilds that have never set foot in PoP will be. Our zones will be crowded and our minibosses will be permakilled.<br />
<br />
The reward for having done all of these alternate entry quests had better be substantial. I don't want some aaxp points. I don't want a charm.<br />
<br />
I want what I worked for - access to content that is not overcrowded. I think the only fair solution possible is the give &quot;exp zone&quot; access to Sol Ro Tower and the Elemental Planes to people that have completed all of the alternate entry quests. Leave the alternate entry quests in place and allow this to be a path for small guilds to work toward.<br />
<br />
We would NEVER have wasted the time working on these quests if we knew our reward was a few aaxp points. We would instead have been grinding exp, of course. If we wanted a charm we would have gone to LoY and camped one.<br />
<br />
I understand the need to make the Tier 2 and 3 planes more available to the playerbase. Just don't screw over those of us who WERE motivated enough to pursue these zones aggressively in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, essentially Ximix while you did a bunch of pathetic quests to get rid of cockblocks to content, I was just rewarded for cancelling my account for a few months.<br />

<br />
Hahaha. I've read this discussion somewhere before!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guild is in a similar situation. We recently worked our tails off to get AD killed for HoH flag, MB killed for PoTac and Grummus killed for CoD. We have just started going to these places in force for exp and minis. Now all that work will be a joke. I think a better solution would be to make the trials possible to get through with many combinations. I hate the fact that shaman, druids and others have to be helped through many times thus slowing down their ability to advance. I wouldn't even mind if they opened up the tier 2 planes to everyone as long as they upped the population in those zones, but don't open tier 3 to everyone yet. I don't see them opening sebilis, VT, VP or other old world zones and tweaking them so more people would go back to them. It just seems like a slap to all the guilds who have played by their story line up to now. Makes the hole expansion seem meaningless to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If they give elemental access to people as compensation for already having pov/pos/whatever access, then what are they going to give to people that had elemental access?  SOE isn't going to give compensation flags to anyone, I am sure of it.  They have never tried to make ammends for ****ing people over before, and I don't think they're going to start doing it here.<br />
<br />
The sheer stupidity of even THINKING about removing flags for the lower tier zones just amazes me.  The only people are going to benefit are the gimps that STILL can't get through the poj trial.  If you cannot get together 5 friends that don't suck at everquest, then you don't deserve to be in valor or storms, imho.  All the people that are already in these zones are going to be flooded and surrounded by newbies.  PoV is already a newbie zone, but god... its going to be so much worse.<br />
<br />
The people that get screwed the worst are the ones that did all the alternate flagging quests.  I really sincerely feel sorry for these people.  I worked for my flags, but all I had to do was go to a few raids, really.  People that are in small guilds and had to quest their flags really busted their asses and removing flags is, really, a slap in the face.<br />
<br />
The term &quot;slap in the face&quot; gets thrown around a lot on these boards, but this really is one.  Ugh.<br />
<br />
On the bright side, I don't think they are going to go through with it.  There are way too many pissed off people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I very happy with these changes - was worrying about what I could do with my guys - all mid 60's no flags and wanting to see DB mobs - HIP HIP HOORRAY!!!  And on other boards I see people worrying because &quot;the crappy&quot; people are going to get into their private zones and contaminate their perfection.  Gees get a grip.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is the worst change, ever.<br />
<br />
All this really does is force everyone to move up the ladder to harder zones where you won't be surrounded by morons. I'm only level 58 and i'm flagless, i've never tried to get flags. This is a stupid change. If you can't get flags to go to these zones you don't belong there. I could have done that quest for CoD if I wanted to solo, in maybe 2 days of soloing in PoD a few hours a day. I didn't because I don't belong there yet so it would be a waste of time for me. If i can solo a damn flag you can get one too. This is just sony trying to keep as many idiots playing as long as they can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rexxor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hi, I'm a longtime board lurker.  I never had the motivation to post anything until now.  I cannot believe the angst on these boards about the removal of flags.<br />
<br />
Do any of you realize that they are not taking anything away from you?  I would understand the venom if they instituted an entirely different prerequisite to get to those zones and you had to start over, but they aren't.  You can still go to all the same places you did before.  Is it really so bad that other people have what you have?<br />
<br />
The basis of everquest (as I see it) is it makes you set goals and strive to reach them.  That is the hook of the game.  Did you set a goal?  Did you reach it?  Did you feel a certain sense of accomplishment when you finished your flagging quests?  Of course you did, and if I know anything about you people, its that you will always hold &quot;well you never had to get flagged&quot; over everyone elses head forever.  No one will ever be able to take that away from you.<br />
<br />
Now, if you think this game is being made too easy, why not stop and play a game with sufficient challenge?   The dirty truth is that so many of you guys have inextricably woven your personal identity into this imaginary world, that you cannot stand to have anything happen that makes you less special.  For you being flagged is the physical evidence that you:<br />
1. Have high level friends.<br />
2. Are a skilled player<br />
3. Have a devotion (time commitment) to the game that exceeds that of the unwashed masses.<br />
<br />
Now that the flagging for tier 2 and 3 are gone, that means you aren't that special anymore.  I want to assure all of you, though, you will always be my hero.  I hope that makes you feel better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why must everything be &quot;a slap in the face&quot;?<br />
<br />
Seriously? damn near every complaint on this board describes something as a slap in the face.  Come up with a more creative way of describing something ya dont like, please!<br />
<br />
As for the change... I have mixed feelings.  On the one hand, I have friends who dont have all their flags, and this will allow them to come hunt with me -instead of requiring me to go hunt with them in valor.  On the other hand, my favorite exp spots will now have a lot more people in them.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is a bite on the elbow! :)<br />
<br />
Nah, seriously, Rexxor is right. You guys aren't losing squat. Think your zones are suddenly going to be overpopulated with dunderheads that can't assist, control aggro, or anything?<br />
<br />
Yeah, they will. For a while, until they either get better or leave the zone because it's too hard.<br />
<br />
Then it'll belong to you again, as well as people like myself who are good players, but haven't had the time or resources (I'm an Alaskan in a small friendly Euro guild - Think about it) to gety keyed / flagged.<br />
<br />
Dunno about the rest of you, but when I buy an expansion with 18 experience zones, I expect to be able to use more than 4 of them once I reach the needed level.<br />
<br />
And really... Did you all think flags would stay around? Kunark ports only working from Kunark dungeons was changed. The need for velious teeth was changed. Luclin didn't really have any travel issues. All after players had reached a certain point. Flags were going to last until someone walked into Plane of Time. When that happened, the whole point of flags (tracking your progress through a supposed story) was nullified - Someone else finished the story before you.<br />
<br />
Now they've been reduced to key quests for the upper crust of the planes. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think anyone likes the keys ... what they don't like is a timesink factor that gets thrown out the window.   My guild is small but I'm flagged for many zones in PoP.   Why ... because we worked in our 2-3 party raids killing things for quests or keys.    <br />
<br />
It's not going to kill us to lose the keys ... heck we'll get access to zones that we currently have rights ... but a few AA's or a charm does help a bit for our troubles.<br />
<br />
But it's always the same on this board ... those that don't have something &quot;for whatever reason&quot; whine that it's not fair they can't get it easier.  Then once they get the magic item ... they whine because others may get things easier than them.   Talk about walking both directions up hill in plane of storms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My biggest complaint is the fact that we're going to have level 54's in those zones who are going to go in thinking that it is no different than mobs in PoN/PoD.  I didn't get flagged until I was almost 63 (and no I wasn't carried through trials either.  With the DS method, I cast Tnarg's and kept most of the agro while keeping Torpor on myself).  Ever since then I've had to listen to all these people in their 50's want to know why those of us few who have gotten through haven't gotten them through.  They don't understand what levels those zones were geared for since SoE and their infinite wisdom marketted PoP as 46+.  They don't understand the concept of mana pools and agro management.  And if anyone tries to tell them about it, they just won't listen.  All they see it as is &quot;cliques&quot; keeping them out of zones so they don't have to be &quot;bothered&quot; with them and can horde all the loot and xp.  They don't understand that it's game mechanics dictating this and not those of us who made it through.  We even tried to take them through trials and put our best foot forward to try to succeed (failed miserably I might add).  Did this detour them at all?  No!  They stated that we didn't try hard enough, that we did something wrong.  It couldn't possibly be that they were underequipped or have too low of a mana pool.  It couldn't be that they didn't have the levels or the spells needed to succeed.  It couldn't have been that they didn't have enough hps or ac to tank in there.  No! It HAD to be something that WE were doing wrong because we didn't want them in the tier 2 zones!  <br />
<br />
Well I guess now all those clickers that have been gotten since they made Ragefire a triggered mob will really get put to use in more zones now.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Do any of you realize that they are not taking anything away from you?<br />
<br />
Yes, they are.  PoV was the best zone ever in the first month or so of PoP.  Why?  Because everyone in the zone was competent.  It was not full of newbies or anti-social *******s.  It wasn't very crowded, so if I wanted to solo I could, and if I was grouping, I would have a group that had plenty of spawns to itself and wouldn't have to both with long pull times or a complete absence of mobs to pull.<br />
<br />
PoV since then has gotten a little worse.  Some idiots have managed to get flagged.  The right castle camp is no longer worth taking because mobs that got trained to zone will be pathing back over your head and aggroing you every 10 minutes, often causing a wipe.  Inner caves sucks, because there is always an outer group and the entire cave gets cleared with 10 minutes to spare, so you have to sit and wait for spawns.  If you are camping any part of the desert, your exp is slowed down because your puller has to run out to BFE to find a mob to bring back.  You can forget soloing, because there's never a camp for you.<br />
<br />
If you go during off-time hours, like 3am american time, things are much much better.  Usually less than 20 people in the zone, so you have plenty of space and mobs all to yourself or your group.  You can set up at once of the castle walls and solo golems all night if you want to.  This is how it used to be when PoP came out.<br />
<br />
If they go live with these flagging changes, though, it all gets much much worse.  We will have a new influx of people to the zone, most of whom will be incompetent and/or *******s (if they don't have pov/pos flag yet, its because they are one of these two, or both).  The quality of people that will enter the zone isn't really my main concern.  My main qualm is the sheer QUANTITY of people that will be in PoV.  Everyone in their high 50's is going to be there.  The people under 60 aren't going to be getting in to any decent groups, so they will band together and make groups that really are too low-level for the zone.  These groups will die/train me constantly, and occupy all the camps I want to go to.  My favorite exp zone will go to hell.<br />
<br />
So yes, they are taking something away from me.  Not directly, but indirectly they are screwing me over.<br />
<br />
Is it really so bad that other people have what you have?<br />
<br />
If I had to work for it, and they didn't, then yes.  Say what you will about me, but I enjoy the fact that I have better gear, spells, aa, and flags than most shamans.  I like to know that I am above average.  You might be content with mediocrity, but I am not.  I have these things that most people do not have, because I have invested more time and effort in to the game than they have.  If everyone else has what I had, and they didn't have to work for it, that pisses me off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you think that all the people who are in PoV now are competent? If that really is so, grats to your nice cozy server you play on.<br />
But I really doubt what you say. People playing in Tier1 planes now because they are stuck there cause they have no higher level friends to get them through trials (or miss the DPS because they all have no big raid loot) are no worse than some of the dumbsh*t people playing in the higher level zones right now. Most of the ret@rds bought their way into PoV.<br />
After a few weeks things will get sorted. PoV will get a playground for lvl 46 twinks (getting 1 spot in XP groups), people who can't handle the damage done will leave aftert making some pretty corpses and heavy trains.<br />
And just because you had to do some crazy flagging stuff to do doesn't mean all the others have to do it too.<br />
And just to clear this: I am in Tier3 zones (not elemental though). I am not afraid or angry of this change. Finally I will be able to play with some friends of mine again, who don't have the time to flag their chars for all those zones. Each time I want to group with them I am forced to go back to the crowded and most boring of places (PoV). No more.<br />

<br />
Like I said, my biggest concern is not the quality of people, but the quantity.  People in PoV are definately not all good players, but the average player in PoV is better than the average player than can't get flagged for PoV.  PoV is already overcrowded, and this will make it ridiculously overcrowded, to the point of unusability, and that is what worries me more than anything else.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Also, when I talk about people's competency, I include their gear in my assessment of their competency.  Gear counts for a lot, especially for some classes.  I don't care how talented that warrior is - if he is wielding a frostbringer and a snowchipper, I do not want him tanking for me.  I also don't want rogues wielding exquisite velium spears and epic, or clerics with no FT and smaller mana pools than me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The damage has already been done, guilds already broke apart because of this, people already quit, other people already endured timesinks (try camping Diaku Raiders for 6 people and then tell me you wouldnt be pissed off now).<br />
<br />
About the overcrowding: People dont care about the new zones. They only care about the godly xp in new zones. So, what would somebody with half a brain do? Maybe same xp for mobs of the same level in old zones? Naah, too easy and logical a solution.<br />
<br />
But Jinheim, you are talking crap. An idiot with good gear is still an idiot, nothing can change that. And there are only so many errors good gear can compensate. The most obvious example is a warrior with mediocre weapons. See casters die in dozens because they dont know anything about aggro management, are unable to adjust, and blame it on the tank :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">News just reached my ears about this change and to be honest I have mixed feelings about it<br />
<br />
On one hand, it will be nice to see BoT and HoH as i am first and formost an explorer and love going through new places and experiencing new zones.  But to be honest i see this as mostly a negative change.  For the longest time i had only 1st tier access and to be honest it drove me insane.  If any of you have spent time in PoN you will know that the place is so full of morons that if you are hunting there for a period of time and dont get trained, consider yourself lucky.  As for PoI and PoJ they were fine at the early 50s and even good to solo in but PoI gets boring quickly due to lack of real camps (minus factory), and fast respawn times.  Not to mention the people that train the zone in like they were taking a stroll.  PoD is really the only decent tier one zone and up til 59 you can get levels very quickly in the couryard groups.  <br />
<br />
My feelings are this, if all the tier 2 and three zones open up to all then it will be a big slap in the face to me, and others from similar level guilds who have fought thier way to get flagged for these zones.  At this point in time almost all of us are flagged for up tier three and with the help of an allied guild a great deal are flagged for the elementals as well.  Most of the flagging events I have been on however were all done within the guild and although at times it was tough, it was also rewarding when new zones started opening up.  At the risk of sounding elitist giving all access to zones that we worked our asses off to be able to hunt there does nothing less than cheapen our accomplishments.  Lets face facts,  SOE took a unique and imaginative idea and turned it into chowder.  Giving all access tier 2/tier 3 wont fix that.  The only thing that will fix it is a total revamp of PoP.  Personally I think they should improve the quests to get access to the higher tier zones so at least people that complete them will at least feel some sort of accomplishment, while at the same time not make them feel frustrated because they have to kill some rare ubermob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">1.  PoP is too small for the number of people playing there.<br />
<br />
2.  PoP needs for dungeon-style zones instead of DL style no-brainer zones.<br />
<br />
So SOE ought to stop tweaking stuff, and adding extra chrome, and create a new, full-sized, dungeon off each PoP zone.  Keep the flags, but the flags are now for the dungeon not for the DL style zone.  So the noobs are happy - they die in dungeons anyway, the leets are happy - the keys they worked for still have value.<br />
<br />
Make the dungeons multiple-copy (ie. a group creates their own version of it when they enter) and things would be better still.<br />
<br />
Sadly this would require genuine development effort from SOE, so its a non-starter.</div></div><hr />

       Your zones and YOUR minibosses ? You must really miss a point.<br />
<br />
Oh and people who have all flag are absolutly competent or more competent than people without flag ,they're just in ubber or big guild ,that all. Or they mad enough to do alternate boring and very long quest for crappy zone  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As far as I care, they can remove all the flags from the game. Why have areas in the game, which are personal playgrounds to the guilds, where most members have no real responsibilities and can sit 8 hours per day and play the game?<br />
<br />
Then again, not like I care. From 5 years of EQ (that's together with beta), I have been frankly tired of the game for last 3 years. Simply the people have been so great around me, that I hung around still. Good company overweighted the crappy game. Now, though, that many are leaving and have left, there's no need to remain either. SWG beta is handy too. So, grats to those who will be able to access these planes now too, flagging idea was one of the stupidest idea of Verant anyway. Press more and get all them stupid flags removed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Let's take the Plane of Tactics as an example.<br />
<br />
Initially, this required a Manaetic Behemoth kill to access.<br />
Then, an alternate key quest is put in place.  You need to kill Daiku Raiders in PoS for 4 sections of a talisman.  No-one complains.<br />
Then, they make the quest group only, meaning the quest that people were achieving before is now effectively 6 times easier/quicker.  No-one complains.<br />
Then, any effort and time people spent via any of the above ways means all of Jack.  *Now* people complain.<br />
<br />
Group quests were perfectly fine, and none of the 'elitists' complained that people unable to kill the MB were 'intruding in their personal playground'.  No-one is *unable* to complete the alternate access quests, just *unwilling*.  (Barring the PoJ trials, which I would like to see relaxed)  Therein lies the problem.<br />
<br />
How would you feel if the annual salary you take, which you worked for, was handed out to a slacker who can't be bothered to work and still lives with parents, just 'to make it fair' ?  What would you say to them when they told you that 'you hadn't lost anything' ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">If I knew that Ximix hadnt been playing for long I would certainly feel bad for him that something changed and in a way he didnt expect. But I know that Ximix has been playing for a loooong time so he and everyone else like him knows that things in EQ changes. Many of the changes have been whats know as nerfs - things that will negatively affect people. Most of the nerfs have affected almost all players and yet SoE went ahead and did it anyway.<br />
<br />
Now with this zone-access change it is a nerf to some people (a minority) and positive change to far more people. Trying to get SoE to avoid this seems rather futile to me since they will clearly make more money this way.<br />
<br />
The fact that a few people accept having to jump through boring hoops for months to gain access to some zones doesnt mean that all the people that didnt accept these &quot;hoops&quot; as a way of having fun are slackers, newbs or whatever else. It means they found other things to do in the game while some of them hoped the stupid design of PoP would change.<br />
<br />
God knows there have been many changes that I didnt like but I guess I accepted them since I am still playing. Normally changes have negatively affected the many and benefitted the few. Now we have the opposite situation. If you cant accept that then its time to consider quitting EQ.</div></div><hr />

Thats not correct - those people still had the benefit of being among the few to have access to the zone for a while. And they are still among the few. The change hasnt been implemented yet. So even if you JUST completed the quest you will still have this advantage for atleast a month I bet. So please quit whining.<br />

This analogy only works if you compare to people that complete the alternate access quest on the same day the changes makes it to live servers. For once SoE is announcing what they are planning way in advance and all you do is bitch and moan *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Benefit for already having the flag should be the ability to banish a person from zone (like nag/vox) who doesn't have the flag.   :D <br />

I weep for the people who'll have to group with the momos who couldn't get through a PoJ trial.  If I still did pickup groups, I'd be extra wary about people who were anon/role....they con blue, but are they 64 or 56?<br />
<br />
And god damn...thinking of HoH trains caused by gimps....with its straight, walled, high-agro mob containing corridors...*shiver*<br />
<br />
It's not elitism when you're simply competent and fear the consequences of the consistently incompetent practicing their inadequacies near to you. (Mostly about PoJ trials, the alt quests aren't really hard, just annoying camps.)</div></div><hr />

I'm unhappy about the content of the change, not the fact that they've announced it early.  Not sure what your point is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Taking away the crappy flags is a great thing. It's not going to change the number of &quot;incompetent&quot; people you run into, just the location you meet them in. <br />
<br />
I did the CoD alt quest, I spent 14 hours getting flagged for PoV/PoS and I finished my BoT key. Am I upset that everyone else won't have to do that now? Not in the least. <br />
<br />
Coming from a mid-sized guild I see this as a great change. It means more of our people can join us when we're XPing in the higher tiers without spending forever doing the trials over and over again.<br />
<br />
Besides, if you cant find a place to XP in PoV go to one of the other zones that are now open to you whether you did a crappy alt quest or killed some mob or not. People at low 50's zoning into these places will quickly learn that they aren't going to get in groups unless they know someone in there and they're going to leave. Unless they really enjoy sitting somewhere and shouting for a group for 6 hours.<br />
<br />
So move yourselves deep into the zone of your choice and keep on grouping with your own. The new people will spend months learning the front areas of the zones and there are always empty places. Find one and camp it. Now your range of choices are even wider than before. Myself, I'm looking forward to checking out the deeper parts of CoD, now that I can put a group together without waiting for flagged people to be online.</div></div><hr />

and if ubber elitists complain of the invasion of incompetant twink doodz neebs... well... that's their fault !!<br />
<br />
why didn't they took the time to educate theses peoples at lower levels and teach them how to play ubber competent style?<br />
<br />
why didn't they took the time to spend 24h/day flagging them at the trials so they can follow their exemple and learn from their knowledge of the game?<br />
<br />
why didn't they took the time to equip them with ubba stuff so they will have the requiered items to match the zone expected equipement?<br />

why? huh?  give us a good reason why not all the above..<br />

oh wait.. weren't you too buzy exping and farming good loots for your twinks perhaps?<br />

well.. time to share your knowledge... errr sorry.. your kindergarden. :D<br />
<br />
but as i said to guildies.. do you see a lot of 46+ in TOV? CT? WW? DN? SSRA? not that i know..<br />
so just have a 2 weeks break when the flags will be removed so the youngsters can have a look and test the playground untill they realize that they will loose more exp than grabbing some and the zone will be back as before.<br />
<br />
maybe a little more crowded.. but hey.. don't expect 61+ people who are not so lucky as you to have all their flags stay in POD /POJ /PON /POI forever.<br />
<br />
and in this 2 weeks break.. take the time to camp your VP, ST, VT key before they will be removed :)</div></div><hr />

Because I'm not there to babysit anyone.  EQ is not Quantum Physics, it's not Brain Surgery.<br />

But then again, I'm apparently the bad guy for not being your shepherd, earning your keys for you and equipping you.  If I ever had a lawyer who debates as well as that, I think I'd just hang myself in the dock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">You know what's funny about this whole thing ... besides the magic that improving in EQ = 100% increase in elitist status (doh pure envy) for some people.   What's funny is most of these people that whine about flags are the same people that complain that EQ is supposed to be fun.    Questing for keys to gain access to new content/experience isn't fun?   It's supposed to be easy - walk in - take what you want - type stuff?    <br />
<br />
I'm all for adjusting the access means to PoP zones.    I would like to see more quests to gain access to PoP zones.   Quests that are take time and effort ... not walk up to a vendor and pay for your key type thing.   <br />
<br />
But there should be some task/effort put into reward ... unless it's not a reward but a gift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Here is what I don't understand. They JUST changed the alternate entry quests a few patches ago to key 6 per completion, rather than just keying 1 per completion. Why not let that stand for awhile? I personally have seen many more people getting motivated to group up and complete these quests since that change. I have seen other small guilds pulling together and working on these quests for flagging. Why take that away from them?<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the challenge of working through all of the alternate entry quests with my guild, because the goal was meanigful and the content was challenging, but doable. Are they simply going to remove the quest givers and the quest items from EQ? That seems unlikely - the game needs more content of this type, not less.<br />
<br />
Whatever &quot;reward&quot; SOE gives for having these keys and flags needs to continue to be tied to these quests in the future. It needs to be a meaningful and significant reward or no one will ever work on completing these quests again.<br />
<br />
The best idea that I can come up with is to complete all of the quests for exp access to Sol Ro Tower and the Elemental planes.</div></div><hr />

Um, if I am ever paid to play Everquest, that argument might have some merit.  In the meantime, Everquest is a game to me - not &quot;work&quot;.

Before this hopefully upcoming change was mentioned access to the zones were obviously considered enough of a reward for doing those boring quests. And now after you have had those zones &quot;to yourself&quot;<br />
for a while and you will continue to have them &quot;to yourself&quot; for a while until the change is implemented AND you now have minibosses that always drops loot you still want an extra reward? <br />
<br />
I understand your frustrations but I think they come from the fact that you are a very ambitious player that &quot;finished&quot; EQ in the sense that the rest of EQ is primarily designed for mega-sized guilds. I know its called EVERquest but thats not really true. People actually do stop playing for various reasons and having nothing left to do is one of the bigger ones I think.<br />
<br />
I know WoW isnt finished just yet but that game looks like it could keep you busy for a while :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That way, there's still an advantage to getting flagged, and unflagged people not really ready for the zones may well decide the experience isn't worth the risk, and go back to PoD/PoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">i'm glad they removed these flags but they SHOULD set a level requirment to enter the tier 3 zones. the trials were a complete failure to the casual eq player. sorry, sitting in poj 4 hours a night to get a trial group is NOT fun. many classes have a big disandvantage in getting a trial group. it's all about dps after all. the majority of eq players are casual players who don't have the time to devout to this game as you &quot;uber elitists&quot; do. SoE got a whole lot of complaints about the flagging system , and they acted accordingly by removing it. it's all about keeping the majority happy. majority unhappy = ex customers.<br />
<br />
i don't want to hear the garbage about the noobs will ruin the tier 2 and 3 zones. there are plently of level 65 noobs training the zones as it stands now. also , pov has plently of toons under 60 in it already.<br />
<br />
this is a great change . soe should reward us for getting flagged,as they stated they would, and set the level requirment to 60 for tier 3 zones.</div></div><hr />

I think the need for a &quot;reward&quot; feels a lot different for someone who quested for zone access vs. someone who raided for zone access and is now in the elemental planes.<br />

I guess I just don't get this attitude.  I work because I have to, but aside from that - if I go to the movies, I suppose you could call it time invested, but I don't view it as &quot;work&quot; and I don't expect to get paid for it.  If I go to the beach I am investing time, but again I don't expect to get paid for that.  We all make choices about how to invest our time, but we only get paid for it if it is something someone is willing to pay us to do.  Again, I've not found anyone to pay me to play Everquest.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">First let me say I think this whole discussion is borderline rediculous, but I need a break from work so I decided to respond in some detail...  <br />
<br />
Your cheese has moved...get over it and figure out how to have fun in the new environment, or find something else to do that you enjoy.<br />
<br />
When I first started playing EQ, a few months after it came out, I didn't have all of the resources that exist on the web today.  There was no such thing as EQ Atlas (although I did eventually find a Japanese site with a few decent graphs...but I had no idea what the words were :p )  Now newbie zone maps are included by default, heck they even get journals to help track NPC conversations when I used to have pages and pages of scribbled notes!!  I don't see people yelling at Sony for these changes, but they are very similar in nature.  Sony felt that the player base they were targetting would enjoy the game more with these changes so they implemented them...the same as they are apparently doing with some of the new PoP zones.<br />
<br />
To the people that are mad because others are getting something they worked for...I hope you don't take this approach in life because I can't imagine it's very satisfying.  Just because someone else gets something for free that you already worked for doesn't make it wrong.  As an example, my dad regularly worked 80 to 90 hours a week to support the family...I got a job that pays more and I work less hours...does that mean I should turn down the job because I now have it easier then he did even though he always worked harder?  Well...I didn't turn down the job and somehow I don't think he would have been complaining about the situation if he were alive today.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, if you don't like the game then don't play.  If potentially having less skilled or less dedicated (read 'willing to spend more time on EQ') players adventuring near you is that upsetting, either find a new location or a new hobby.  <br />
<br />
Life is way too short to waste time doing something you don't like.<br />
