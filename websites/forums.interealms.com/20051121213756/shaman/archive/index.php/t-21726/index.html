<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All-<br />
<br />
Retired from EQ, and CoH sounds good for me as a casual player.<br />
<br />
One problem however, I'm both cheap and poor (they are mutually reinforcing) so my old PC is a PIII 700, with a Nividia card with 64K (I forget which one, bought it about a year and a half ago for $150) and 512 ram.  Far too cheap to buy a new box just for an hour or two a week gaming.<br />
<br />
I meet all minimum specs on the box, execpt for the processor, it says a PIII 800.<br />
<br />
Based on your experience, do you think I'd be OK if I turned graphics down, etc?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I bet you'll be fine, though you might have to turn some of the graphics settings down.  I'd say definitely go for it if you know you could throw $100 at your comp if you need to toss in another 512 stick of RAM.<br />
<br />
For comparison, I can tell you I'm running a 1.2 GHz with 1 gig of RAM, and a similar Nvidia card - nothing crazy.  I have all the graphics slammed up to full and only have a slight bit of video lag in certain situations.  It runs a lot smoother than EQ did with all of the freaking luclin models turned off, that's for sure.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A friend of mine is playing CoH on his PC with:<br />
733 mhz processor<br />
512 mb ram<br />
Geforce4 (the cheapest one in stores for ~$35)<br />
<br />
He can run the game in 1024x768 pretty well with most settings at the lowest, which is not really that bad, it still looks quite nice!<br />
<br />
There will be a fps drop in areas with lots of effects though, so you should stay away from using dark armor and other powers with loads of particles. I would also recommend playing a ranged kind of AT (defender/blaster/controller) to get away from the close-up effects.<br />
<br />
Doing missions etc in smaller groups you will be fine even with some AE effects. Solo should be no problems at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks folks!<br />
<br />
Heh- its funny even not playing EQ anymore I still come here twice a day, probably more after I get CoH.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm running CoH on my freaking GeForce2 and Pentium III laptop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ouch!<br />
<br />
I get a big kick out of reading the CoH threads here.  Might be because every CoH forum I see elsewhere is just painful to read....  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just FYI-<br />
<br />
Bought the game runs great on my crappy old system.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Running CoH on a P3 700MHz, 512mb sdram and a GeForce4 4200.  Nothing overclocked and pretty standard system settings on WinXP Pro/SP1 with dx9 installed (not even the newest nvidia drivers, using version 52.16).<br />
<br />
It runs great.  I set world detail from 100% to 50%, left char models on full detail and turned down particles about halfway.  It amazes me that this game looks better, has huge outdoor zones with tons of detail, greatly superior models and animations/particle effects and runs 100% better than EQ.<br />
