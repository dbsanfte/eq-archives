<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know this aa doesn't blow the shaman community away but an extra 50 hp regen for 5mins (maybe more if extension aa/focus adds to it) every 30 mins is not all that bad.<br />
<br />
I just drop it when im xp'ing in a group in our camp spot.  Every bit of regen helps imo.  Was useful last night in time also.  Dropped it in our kite/root camp for Inny and it healed the kite team while i spammed root and vp.  So i didn't need to switch targets to heal them.<br />
<br />
I don't think i will buy any more of the levels till i have bought the more useful GoD aa's though  ;) .<br />
<br />
Back to the original question, has anyone figured out the activation code yet?  Had a quick look on lucy but couldn't see it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haha!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Couldn't find it anywhere else so went through them all.  Its /alt activate 298 for those that want to make a hotkey.<br />
<br />
I also timed my ward (level 1) today and it lasted 6 minutes, not the basic 5 mins on lucy.  So i am guessing the extra minute is down to my time shawl focus effect (buff extension) and/or aa skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
according to the ingame description our ward should be regenning endurance, and not hp, shouldn't it? but it seems to cast the same spell as the cleric ward. am i missing something?</div></div><hr />
