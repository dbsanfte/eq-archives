<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oishii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey all! :)  I know this is a bit of a weird question/request... but I'd really like to see any drawings/artwork of your shaman that you might have :)  It can be either done by you, or one that you had done of your character :)<br />
As an artist who is also trying to start out, I like to see artwork from lots of different people, I think it helps keep us artists motivated ^_^<br />
I also think it would be neat to see how shaman look outside of game :p So if you have any pics, post them here!<br />
<br />
Here's one of Oishii that I did a few months ago... not really the right season, but it's the most recent one I have :o<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ive got access to everything I need to create this sort of stuff. A computer with Photoshop, scanner and a modicum of drawing ability.<br />
<br />
But I've still never got round to creating anything coloured using a computer. I think I know how to go about it. Pencil, ink, scan, colour using fill and then make use of dodge and burn to create some depth.<br />
<br />
Is that about the long and short of it, or am I missing something? Any tips? Give me good enough tips and I may be forced to have a go!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cant say i like the chin in the neckwarmer thing, because it gives it wierd proportions, but other then that, its absolutely fantastic :D<br />
<br />

Anyway, i cant draw worth crap, well i doodle alot, but nowhere near the guy here :)<br />
<br />

Gloriana, gotta give Saraquael lots of credit for doing so much artwork... amazing!  Need to see what kind of drugs he is on so I can get me some of that!<br />
<br />
Haleice, your pic is cool!  Really nice when I saw the full size pic ^_^.  Very unique style of colouring.. :D<br />
<br />
Seredith, there are a lot of good CG tutorials on the net :)  Of course, nothing beats lots and lots of practice ^_^  As long as you know the basics of colour/shading, you will have no problem doing it in Photoshop as well... but don't just rely on Dodge/Burn tool to do everything (I personally don't even know what they do...)!<br />
Check out Polykarbon (http://www.polykarbon.com) for some tutorials.. Julie Dillon (http://www.jdillon.net) was the first place I saw that had a good tutorial that I learned from (*WARNING* anime related site!!!!!!) :)<br />
And if you really want to go hardcore, visit the Sijun Forums (http://www.sijun.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi), there are a lot of amazing digital artists there (I assume no responsibility for depression or feelings of inadequacy which may follow)!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Saraquael has a very nice galery!  I'm impressesed, and inspired to boot, too.  Time for me to figure out this new fangled internet thing and paste up some pictures of my own.  Definately time for me to learn myself how to draw anime too. ;)<br />
<br />
Now to strong-arm my little brother into teaching me photoshop and rustle up a decent copy of it....... :D</div></div><hr />
