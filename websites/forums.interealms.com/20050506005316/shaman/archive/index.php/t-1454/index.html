<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Make them also affect pets.<br />
Maybe even make it able to be switched back and forth.  Like: /tgb on/off (for just getting players, as it is now) and /tgb p on/off (where the &quot;p&quot; stands for pets).<br />
<br />
Just something I think would be kinda nice . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Amen to that! It sux that group buffs don't work on pets. Definitely something that needs to be changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, haven't used this in a long time, but pretty sure there was a way to target group members by the F# buttons.  What would be real nice is being able to hit a group members button twice to get his pet much like if we hit F1 twice we get ours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a nice idea there Jenguaran, and shouldn't be that difficult to implement either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always thought a cool idea would be to use the fuction keys to target group member's pets as well. Like hitting f2 once would be the 2nd member in your group - hitting f2 twice would target his pet if he had one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And if they lasted as long as KEI I wouldnt be complaining :)</div></div><hr />
