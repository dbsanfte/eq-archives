<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok.... i was grping in OT with my shm till i hit 40....(now im 40)<br />
any way, im in a grp doing my job, slowing and buffing and sometimes healing. Grp was me, war, ench, clr ,rog, bst. the grp was fine until we replaced the wiz with a necro. the necro started talking trash at me how i dont play my class right :O<br />
Sure, ive pled my shaman to 40 but so wat? i know how to play my class... so hes still yapping how i suck and hes using lich or some type of thing like that hp to mana... hes at low health, and he gets wacked and dies. and ofcourse he starts complaining again. and ofcouse he does the same thing and dies again. and then he said im gonna /report u ! and then disbands and leaves. then he says /ooc (my name) doesnt know how to play his class! dont grp with him! he lets u die.<br />
<br />
so can anyone tell me what im doing wrong? this is wat i do when i join a grp <br />
<br />
1. buff everyone<br />
2. heal up anyone thats hurt.<br />
3. when mob is inc, i slow it<br />
4. rebuff/heal if anyone needs it<br />
<br />
wat do u guys think?<br />

<br />
<br />
Sounds like you are doing a good job to me.<br />
<br />
necro's need to ask for a heal if they are to lom to tap a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you cast regen on him, it's his own damned fault.  Slow always comes before heals and necros aren't suppossed to lich below 50%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">and then he said im gonna /report u !<br />
<br />
LOL That's pretty funny. <br />
<br />
I pray for a new semi-private server, you'd have to pass an IQ test to get to play on it.<br />
<br />
Don't worry man, that guy was a moron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In my experiance. If someone pisses you off, let em die.  Alot.  Doesnt solve anything but it makes you feel better. And thats what matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sure, ive pled my shaman to 40 but so wat<br />
He would have been better off /reporting you for spelling and grammar!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It sounds to me like your routine is fine.  I usually cast a regeneration spell on necromancers, but bottom line -- a necromancer needs to manage his own health.  When I use my cannibalization, I do not expect the cleric (or anyone) to heal me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He could have lifetapped himself back to full health with a minor bit of effort. Apparently this was too difficult for this particular Necro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dunno seems like PERHAPS we're only getting half the story here.<br />
<br />
So he joined group and just all of a sudden flew off the handle at you huh?  If so then let the bastard die...<br />
<br />
...but I find it improbable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brazarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Only thing I don't see mentioned is casting Regen. I group from time to time with necro's in guild and to them, regen is kei. Even if he asked for regen and you didn't though, that alone is not reason to take the actions he took, more over he should have explained regen on a necro but also watch his own health, sounds like the necro went overboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brazarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grp was me, war, ench, clr ,rog, bst. the grp was fine until we replaced the wiz with a necro. <br />
<br />
One thing extra......why with the clr in the group, why was it the shamans fault he died</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Most of the good stuff has already been said. To include, next time, don't speak in '1337' and spell (correctly). Helps endear you to the locals.<br />
<br />
What you are finding out is that each class has special or specific buff requests.  Enchanters don't need Strength and Monks don't need Charisma.<br />
<br />
Now I was always a minimalist Monk when it came to buffs. I wanted Haste, Regen, and Stamina.  And that's ALL.<br />
<br />
Use your mana to slow the MOBs and root. If I have aggro - I'll handle it. (IF or FD).  If a MOB gets on you I will unload the Pimp Slap of Doom on them (IF) to get aggro.<br />
<br />
Necros - odd bunch. See The Quon's take on them. Regen is godly for them. I actually had tell me once &quot;You do know I trade life for Mana?&quot;  I remember thinking 'No sh!t Sherlock - join the club.'  Anyway, you're doing fine, don't let the occasional social misfit get you down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Murgok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yeah, you'd think he'd be pissed at the cleric.  i'd like to see what he reports about you though.  that necro is a moron.  Thual makes a good point there.  as does Wally6500, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Grp was me, war, ench, clr ,rog, bst. the grp was fine until we replaced the wiz with a necro. <br />
I see something wrong... i dont find the wiz in first group. <br />
<br />

war<br />
ench<br />
clr<br />
