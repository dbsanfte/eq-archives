<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Based on the comments of some folks here, I took a chance and picked up a copy of City of Heroes when it was released last week.  Here are my initial impressions:<br />
<br />
1.  Graphically it is a beatiful game.  The costumes, animations, particle effects and the world are very well done.  Each ability has its own unique animation, and I'm guessing there are well over 100 different animations.<br />
<br />
2.  There is a huge potential for diversity in creating your character.  I have seen a bewildering number of costumes and body forms, none of them remotely alike.  The down side of this is once you make your costume your stuck with it for the life of your character.<br />
<br />
3.  The skill sets available make nearly every character unique in one aspect or another.  I grouped with a person who had the same archtype as me (defender, more on this below), but had trained a different set of skills.  We complemented each other nicely.<br />
<br />
4.  Game play so far has been engaging.  The quest system at the low levels, at least, is well thought out and expands in flexibility as you level up.  I have been very impressed with it so far.<br />
<br />
5.  Grouping is a whole new experience.  My experince thus far is that the flexible and overlapping roles ensure that everyone makes significant contributions to groups.<br />
<br />
6.  Of interest to shamans is the defender archtype.  There are several different roles that this archtype can take, including a cleric-like role, but I wanted something that loosely paralleled a shaman.  I came up with a radiation skill set defender (both the primary and secondary skill sets), which allows me to solo nicely, but buff and debuff well in groups.<br />
<br />
7.  There are guilds (called Super Groups) and raid level encounters (called Task Force missions).  We got a GM announcement that said the Task Force missions were bugged last night. So far I haven't been involved in either of these.<br />
<br />
8.  There is no elaborate player based economy.  Besides skill points, rewards for victories are &quot;influence points&quot; that you can spend at NPC stores.  You also rarely get two other types of items, inspirations, which are short duration buffs, and enhancements, that are used to increase the effectiveness of your super powers.  These latter two can be traded among PC's.  You use your influence points to buy inspirations and enhancements.<br />
<br />
9.  The game runs very well on my system (Athlon 1.4, ATI Raedon 9600, 1mb ram), and seems remarkably free from bugs.  I haven't had too many problems with lag, and experienced only a couple of LD's.  Easily as stable as EQ, and with less overall lag. I haven't tested CS yet, but I did send one petition that netted me two emails.  I figured it out myself tho, so I never read the emails.<br />
<br />
All in all, I really like the game.  I'm not sure it will replace EQ at this point, but it has been a real breath of fresh air.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is it an item-centric game or how does character progression work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've also picked up the game after getting rave reviews from 3 buddies who used to play EQ (all three were level 65 who have quit in the last 3 months) and were in the CoH beta.  Have to say I'm having a ball.  <br />
<br />
Everything mentioned above is accurate, but bottom line, it is just plain fun to play.  I kid my friends that it is a &quot;light&quot; MMORPG, but to be honest, the way they've set up the environment, the possibilities are almost endless.<br />
<br />
What I like best is that I can solo or group with my Super Group, and accomplish a mission in 20-30 minutes.  Most missions are instanced, so no camping or getting 3 persons minimum to do one (ala LDoN).  If you take a mission and realize you don't have the firepower to complete solo, just come back with a friend or two.<br />
<br />
The Task Force missions are like mini-raids, perfect for groups of 6 or so.  I've done a couple and they are hectic but fun.  But what is most impressive is the attention to detail and well thought out and implemented game play.  Heck, when you are a Super Group member, all of you can switch your costume look to the Super Group colors.  Very cool being able to walk around with the same &quot;gang&quot; colors.<br />
<br />
There are too many positive things to say at this point.  On the down side, there is no down side.  You can't burn endless hours getting flagged to kill super boss mobs to get into restricted zones so you can kill and get super loot.  Oh well, I don't do that in EQ either.<br />
<br />
Giac, to answer your questions, no it is not item or &quot;loot&quot; centric.  You do have drops and &quot;inspirations&quot;, which are primarily short term buffs.  Which are great, because with the right inspirations, even a tank can heal and rez, for a short period.  And character progression is exp based, generated by killing mobs and completing missions.  Also, dead results in an exp &quot;debt&quot; which cuts your leveling down to about 50% as you pay the debt off, however, no undinging and you continue to make progress, just at a slower rate.  Takes the stigma of dying away and makes for more daring and adventurous game play.<br />
<br />
With the release of City of Heroes EQ seems to have a very short life expectancy on my computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Is it an item-centric game or how does character progression work?<br />
<br />
<br />
Character progression is pretty much based on powers you choose and stuff called enhancments that you can enhance current power sets with to increase the effectiveness of them.<br />
<br />
I played beta a while not really my kind of game. it is fun but it seems pretty repetitive for myself kind of like the whole mission system in SWG not really my cup of tea but a fun game none the less. i still enjoy EQ more for my preference just alot more gameplay wich is understandable being that EQ has a 5 year jump on it.</div></div><hr />

Very interesting. Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Before you buy this, understand that for all it's character generation and levelling up for more power, in many ways this game is a lot like a first person shooter (FPS) game.  You can log on, wander around and kill some mobs, then log off.  You don't spend hours trying to get camps or items.  You get enhancements (and so far there is no real difference between store bought and dropped).  The game goes out of its way to be egalitarian.  It doesn't appear to give hard-core folks any kind of edge other than fast levelling.<br />
<br />
Fun to play in small doses, but it probably won't suck you in like EQ does.  It just doesn't have that immersive feel.<br />

i bigtime agree its a casual gamers dream. its the kind of game you logon for a few mess around and logoff.  Hit the nail on the coffin chutoi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I spent 4 hours on Saturday night designing costumes.<br />
<br />
After creating at least 15 characters on 2 servers, I finally got an Ice Blaster to level 5. I'm afraid of messing something up. What if I pickthe wrong spells? What if I don't get the right enhancements? (I already think &quot;ice sword&quot; is pretty lame, but now I'm stuck with it).<br />
<br />
I kind of appreciate EQ's spell system, it's impossible to &quot;mess up&quot; a character.<br />
<br />
Here, the tree customization baffles and scares me.<br />
<br />
Plus, I had to kill some visigoths (or something) and I spent ONE HOUR running around King's Hill (or whatever) and never found them. I did find tons of high level mobs who were happy to pound me flat.<br />
<br />
I'm just in it to fly. Must fly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Allot of the people who post on these forums sound totally bored yet still unhealthily obsessed with EQ.<br />
<br />
I changed games for 2 years and when I came back to eq it was way more fun than I remembered. I was very frustrated with the game my guild etc when I left. Sometimes switching games is for the better even if its just a temporary thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I also agree with Chutoi, but only to a certain extent.  This is a &quot;light&quot; MMORPG at the moment.  But hey, so was EQ 5 years ago.  It is way to early to judge the entire game.<br />
<br />
Although I will admit, that on the surface, it is definitely too light for you hard core 40 hour a week plane of time types, but perfect for me, casual, 10 hrs a week type of player.  As has been stated, I can log on and do a mission in 20 minutes, or I can join my Super Group (pretty campy) and go after bigger fish.  Also, don't judge the game solely by the first 10 levels.  They have already stated that the first 10 levels are the honeymoon period, with more challenging and complex missions as you progress.  Obviously, the jury is out on the long-term viability of CoH, but for now, it is a fun diversion that a casual gamer can enjoy at thier own pace.  <br />
<br />
And, by far the biggest attraction for me, is the sidekick system.  You can play with anyone, no matter what level, as long as the higher level character makes you his/her sidekick.  This way I can play with my buddies every night, eventhough they are already 10-14 levels above me.  Was very frustrating when I joined EQ and they were already levels 55+.  But in CoH we can play together and all get exp, regardless of levels.  In my opinion a real stroke of genius.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its silly, corny, and fun!  5 &quot;classes&quot; so its pretty easy to balance between them. The powers are unique enough to allow diversity, I really like how they dont become obsolete as you level up. I wouldnt worry about picking the wrong powers gloriana, you get them fast enough (every other level), same with enhancement slots (power boosters). I picked a controller character, with mind control primary and empathy secondary. I cant wait for area of effect chaos (to make an entire swarm of bad guys battle themselves). Every class can solo to some degree, which is nice.<br />
<br />
Its a very casual friendly game, hell, the sidekick feature is designed to help casuals play with hardcore, since if you become someone's sidekick, it raises your level near theirs while you are close to them. So if your pal joins the game 3 months into it, he can group with you almost on the first day. No tradeskills, no loot, no hassle. Is there less depth than eq? Yeah. But its also fun to wade into a group of 20 goons with 2 other people and kick their asses in a very hard fight. The game also feels more active than eq. Monsters dont stand there just trading blows. They fly to vantage points, jump around, kite you, etc and when you connect with blows, it looks a lot better than 2 retards just flailing their limbs at one another. I love levving someone up to get shot out of the sky by my blaster buddies.<br />
<br />
I think the best is the costumes and schticks people come up with. I know some &quot;role playing purists&quot; will bristle, but I get a kick out of seeing someone who made johnny bravo, or strohm thurman etc into superheroes. I really hope they keep naming filters and such lax. The Wee Monsieur (a tiny mime) and Pizza Delivery Guy are among my favorites that I have seen. A bunch of real life friends who had never played a MMORPG got it, so we are having fun with it.<br />
<br />
Will I play it in 3 months? I dunno, but its certainly fun for a few hours, a few nights per week.  I think people who go hardcore 30+ hours/week on it wont like it, but it you want something on a casual basis, the game definately is worth it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The game lacks some depth. I mean it seems like you just pick missions, blow through them, level up and repeat. If it hold up for a while and they are smart, they will add some longer quests and introduce some good stories and i hear they ar implementing a super friends fortress thing.<br />
<br />
Its very unique in maybe ways and its a game to watch. If i could afford to play it i would be playing it right now. Its nice to not swing a sword or wave a wand for a change. Maybe in a month or 2 after i buy me truck.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i recommend it. The beta was a blast</div></div><hr />

An useing my combat jumping to get somewhere I should not be and then seeing some thugs breaking into a window on top of building is just the coolest thing ever.   <br />

Will it last 5 years.. I don't know. But the potential is there. Just cause they don't have 5 continents and such doesnt matter. The Framework is much much Better than EQ's was at the begenning. <br />

<br />
I was hesitant to pick it up, didn't sound like my kind of game but I am glad I did. Only thing that has bothered me so far is not being able to change your look at all after you create it. Was also worried about choosing the right powers to start but I think you can make anything you choose work.<br />
<br />
Hasn't been mentioned but one big difference between this and EQ is.. no corpse runs. When you &quot;die&quot;.. you don't actually die but get &quot;defeated&quot;... a message box pops up that will transport you to the nearest hospital and heal you. Or if there is someone nearby that can resurrect you can wait for that instead and pop back up at the same place you got wooped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Any City of Heroes players out there?<br />
<br />
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but here are my impressions.<br />
<br />
With only 5 &quot;archetypes&quot; (classes) they have really pared down the group dynamics - a Good Thing, in my opinion.  The Shaman's role would seem to be a mix of the Defender and the Controller classes, although the Controller has more of an Enchanter feel to it.<br />
<br />
Defenders get more and better buffs.  Controllers get more and better debuffs, including mez, slows, and minor DoTs, but Controllers are going to be hurting bigtime without a group.<br />
<br />
All in all, good graphics; a few program glitches but not as many as I saw after the new EQ engine shipped; apparently a well-designed combat system, but mid- to high-level content may be skimpy for a while.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it's Very Easy, especially in a group.  Not that EQ was rocket science, but this is so easy I'm worried it will get boring quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Plan to try it tonight.  Looks and sounds really cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes im playing it and loving it atm.  Very easy to adjust to the UI.  Graphic engine is smooth. I have yet to see the same super hero in over the thousands of players who play.  The selection screen is massive!<br />
<br />
Unsure about high end content but then again its still only been out one week.<br />
<br />
I do love how they did debt exp.  You can solo or group.  Yout dont need class/hero X to do this task, etc.<br />
<br />
Still I have run into new MMORPG players who have no idea how to play.  Trying to say the least but still loads of fun.   Will wait for the newness factor to wear off before I can say yeah or nay.<br />
<br />
I play on Liberty and im called Wytchone :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">CoH is a lot of fun, especially as a diversion from EQ.  While you can solo, getting in a group with a few other people is where this game shines.  Fighting 10-15 villains at a time is much more fun than single pulling and attacking one mob at a time.  <br />
<br />
Another thing I have noticed is that there is little pressure to level.  Sure, you want to get to 14, so you can get your travel power, flight, superjump or whatever, but there is no feeling that you need to be level 40 (the current max level) to accomplish anything.  There is never really a grind to your progression, and I've hardly ever noticed how fast or how slow I've been leveling.<br />
<br />
Only thing that has bothered me so far is not being able to change your look at all after you create it.  <br />
They are working on a way to &quot;tailor&quot; your costume after the character is created.  I'm not sure if you can completely change the costume, or only make smaller modifications, however.  They are also adding capes in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Is there currently, or planned, any pvp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I hope they do implement the ability to change your costume at some point. Heck, if it's good enopugh for Spiderman, Green Lantern and the X-Men it should be good enough for us.  :D <br />
<br />
I'm really wanting to be a villan though. I may hold off until that expansion is released. Sounds promising though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jamorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I picked up CoH on Friday and I'm really enjoying it.  What I love is that I can take a mission and if something comes up like company or whatever, I can quit, and when I come back my mission is right where I've left it.  I've only seen one mission with a time requirement of 60 minutes.<br />
<br />
I also like being able to solo if I want.  It's faster to group obviously but you can solo if you want to (you may have to pick your targets though).<br />
<br />
Oh and Glorianna, you can pick the 'wrong' power.  My fiancee clicked the wrong button at level 6 and ended up with invis other instead of stealth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People amaze me; how can you compare a game, any game, to one that has been patched at least monthly for the past 5 years, had 7 or 8 expansions, etc. to one that was released a week ago?  Of course there's not a high level game..it works out well, since there are no high level characters!  <br />
<br />
With that said, I love the game myself.  The mission system keeps it from getting overly repetitive, and advancement can be made either solo or grouping.  The enhancements make for a fair amount of character development, even if 2 characters have the same skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Fantastic game, I gotta say.  At least the 6 times I've played to level 5, and the controller I fell in love with - all of level 10.  *laugh*<br />
<br />
Soloing is NOT terribily difficult with the controller, btw.  Mental control spec gives you enough stuns to keep one busy while you kill a second.  Throw in the charm and you can juggle 3 evens with relative ease.  Your DPS is fairly sucky compared to blasters, but you can still pull it off with some skill.  Partnered with a blaster... we chew through a dozen or so evens.<br />
<br />
It's so nice being a superhero.  ;)<br />
<br />
I LOVE creating new characters, almost as much fun as playing.  I can also (and have) spent way too much time just standing at the trainer - watching all the names and costumes flash by.  People are really a lot more creative than I give them credit for.  My current favorite character looks like a Japanese schoolgirl zombie.  The possibilities of what you can make are nearly endless.<br />
<br />
As was said above, I don't know how LONG this game is going to hold my interest - since I don't know anything past level 10.  But so far, I'm enjoying it the way I enjoyed EQ my first time.  With a few small differences.  No corpse runs.  No getting lost and wandering around for hours (literally!).  Grouping is easy, fun, and rewarding - so is soloing, though less so.  The mission (quest) system makes it very easy to keep busy and progress without any grinding whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Fly and super run/jump are both incredibly fun to take for your 3rd line of powers.  I recommend trying both with different characters.  *grin*<br />
<br />
I've heard there's a full respec at level 20, in case you decide that you picked the wrong power trees.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't care if this game stops being fun at level 20 or 40.  I've already gotten more fun out of it than probably the last year I played EQ.  It was DEFINITELY time to get off the dead, rotting horse and rediscover that feeling of not knowing EXACTLY what's going to happen.  Mystery, excitement, discovery.  (I LOVE the video game honeymoon phase, can you tell?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">This game has completely spoiled me. There is no single pulling. If there's a group of MoBs, chances are they'll all come after you, so you have to rush them and pick them off strongest to weakest. There's no more fun feeling than having your task force run into a group of about 12 Vahzilok in the sewers and tearing them to shreds while getting shot at and vomited on by the undead, keeping your friends alive, and watching all these enemies die.<br />
<br />
I picked Empathy/Psychic defender so I could heal and slow/deal damage. The combination at times feels overpowering (I can long-range snipe a target for heavy damage, root it on incoming if the power holds, and then nuke it with my slow before it even touches me) and at other times just isn't enough; not to mention enemies always have two ways to attack: close range and ranged, so even if I'm hovering in the air out of mele range they can whip out their guns and get me. <br />
<br />
There's an odd sense in the game I never felt in EQ. Balance. You may be very strong against one type of enemy, but weak against another. The enemy types are developed in such a way as any super group will have difficult times with any of them, and certain power archetypes will be weak/strong against certain foes. No generic my same sword can hurt anything like in EQ, or having a poison DOT work on a skeleton with no veins and blood.  <br />
<br />
This game has so much potential it's staggering. I see it going places that will keep it alive and fresh in five years' time.</div></div><hr />

ANYONE can choose a rez/healing line - not that you need to, because you can carry around rezzes (much like potions) that you can use after you &quot;die&quot; - you can even hand one to your friend lying on the ground.  Dying is still something to be avoided - but it's not the game-stopping thing it is in some other games.  It doesn't make me want to hurl my keyboard into the nice new plasma monitor...

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">LW I'm with you!  Got the game a few days ago and can't be happier.  3 friends in beta are already levels 12-16, but with the sidekick feature, even my level 5 Lightning/Ice Blaster (must be my 4th or 5th character, what a hoot) can play with them.  We have an 8 member Super Group and have gone after some rather challenging mobs.  Yeah, my days of single pulling and helping the tank kill the mob before we pull the next, wave after wave, ad nauseum, are over.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Is there currently, or planned, any pvp?<br />
<br />
From what I've gathered, City of Villains (1st expansion) should supply the bad guys for the heroes to fight PvP-like.  As it stands, there's no PvP.  What I read on the subject (before CoV announcement) said that they weren't going to put in PvP unless it would be fun and balanced.  How very un-EQ of them.<br />
<br />
Basically, I think I played the CRAP out of all the things I liked about EQ.  All that was left were the things I didn't really enjoy, but was doing out of habit, or to hang out with EQ friends.  CoH has a whole new set of classes, abilities, and fun to experiment with.  Every day I'm reminded of how NOT EQ this game is.  Every time I try to pull a few, get a lot, and my team mashes them into paste - I remember &quot;oh yeah, I'm a superhero, not an EQ gimp&quot;.<br />
<br />
NO MEDDING.  Good lord, I'd almost forgotten how much fun an online game could be.  I'm sure there would be some things I miss from EQ about it, if I weren't so sick of that game I'm ready to burn the CD's.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hmm the prospect of superheros sounds kinda childish, but this thread has me wanting to try it now. The unforeseen eq contender?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'm playing on Protector server ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, maybe &quot;playing&quot; is too strong of a word.<br />
<br />
I'm making characters over and over, logging them on, looking at them, looking at other characters that pop up in front of that police guy, then /quitting out to make another character or go play EQ or Baldur's Gate on the gamecube or something.<br />
<br />
I'm VERY happy with what I've seen of CoH though ... it's incredible to look at.<br />
<br />
I do not know how to bind my look up / look down keys to the keyboard yet, but I've managed to figure out how to rebind most everything else.  After 5 years, I'm so used to EQ's basic keyboard configuration that it's just what I prefer.<br />
<br />
My characters on Protector are:<br />
<br />
Bugai - Defender<br />
Walker - Scrapper<br />
Anvil - Tanker<br />
Proteus - Blaster<br />
Cicero - Controller<br />
<br />
I don't especially remember what powerset configs I chose for them offhand ... <br />
<br />
BUT - if I were to remake them, can anyone recommend which sets are good / fun / recommended to try out?<br />
<br />
Are there any additional powerset skills that show up later that aren't visible at creation?  Does the powerset skilltree get bigger?<br />
<br />
I really like the controller idea with the strong pets under illusion, fire, earth, etc., so it seems like you could make a strong pet class that can also solidly heal and rez using empathy as a backup?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Mintyfresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">In this post I will try to go through some of the basics in CoH, I may miss some importent stuff but ill try to list the basicis.<br />
<br />
First of all, heres abit of info on how the game works:<br />
It's a twist game, you're constantly active unless you dont want to be(and it shows) or you simply dont have enough endurance, I dont even watch tv when im playing anymore :P<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
The 5 different classes is :<br />
Defender<br />
Blaster<br />
Controller<br />
Scrapper<br />
Tanker<br />
<br />
The 5 differend classes, each contain 4 to 6 differend primary power sets and each class has a secondary power set containing 4-6 secondary power sets. Each power set got around 9 differend powers.<br />
<br />
Some of the powers may overlap each other but not so much that they all blend in together. For instance, defenders share 5 of their 6 primary power sets with controllers, controllers gain those 5 power sets as secondary power sets however. Which means their slightly weaker at utilizing those powers then defenders(healing from the empathy power set is around 25% weaker for controllers).<br />
<br />
Defenders is basicly a support class, they got various debuffing/buffing powersets as primary, usualy 1-3 differend heal types thrown in there.<br />
Their secondary power sets being DD's, debuffs and some CCs. <br />
<br />
Blasters is what int casters is in EQ, they deal alot of damage, either in single target form or AEs, they have some abilities to CC but not as much as controllers. Primary powersets is such as assault rifel, Ice Blast, Fire Blast ect. Secondary can be Electrical mainpulation, gadgets ect.<br />
<br />
Controllers is the enchanters of CoH, however, each powerset does it differently. Mind Controllers does it via mez and stuns, earth does it via AE roots and single target roots ect. Their secondary powers is usualy based on healing, buffs or debuffs.<br />
<br />
Scrappers is the melee power house, they deal huge amounts of damage, but have to be in melee range. Their primary power sets is based on damage, such as Katana, Martial Arts, Claws ect. The secondary power set is defensive, regeneration, super reflexes ect.<br />
<br />
Tankers, pretty self explainatory. Their primary powerset is defensive such as Ice Armor, Stone Armor ect. With secondary powersets being offensive, Super Strength, Energy Melee ect.<br />
<br />
All in all, I havnt seen a single class that I would say is totaly over or under powered yet. Everyone got a place in the food chain, and everyone is more or less able to solo(some more then others due to their powersets being more geared towards it).<br />
<br />
<br />
All classes can chose up to 3 differend power sets from the common power pools, these include but are not limited to teleportation, Super Speed, Leaping and Leadership. <br />
<br />
<br />
My Class<br />
<br />
<br />
Im playing a controller in CoH. Tons of fun, im a Mind Control / Empathy archtype. <br />
Means im basicly a hybrid of a enchanter with a cleric thrown in, I can CC perfectly, and easily be the main healer for my group. I am quite able to solo even at the level im at(18) and the class is the cornorstone of any group. MC/Emp class break down is like this:<br />
<br />
Mezzes(got a single and a AE) breaks easily, this is more of a issue in CoH then in EQ, because nearly ALL classes has AEs, alot of the Blasters is even strictly AE based. Which in the end renders my mez almost 100% useless, I suspect this will be less of an issue further down the road as people get used to the fragile mezzes. <br />
<br />
Stuns is wonderfull however, I use them all the time, no matter what group im in, or if im soloing or not. I havnt actualy timed it but single stun is around 20-45 seconds im guessing(varies on mob level and rank too), more then enough to take out most minions while it's stunned the whole time from only that one stun.<br />
<br />
Then there's charm, or as their called in CoH, Confuse. I havnt bothered with it, MC get a single and a AE version, utterly useless for gaining XP as you get NO XP from the charmed pet killing anything, and the pet takes away considerbly amounts of XP even if you do help it kill the mobs. Utterly useless.<br />
<br />
Healing is hardly needed at all in big groups, 6-8 players. Only time I really use healing is when I duo or is in a small group(3-4 people). Not much to be said about that really, I have a AE heal with short range and a single target heal. The AE heal does around 45pts worth of healing and the single target one is 80ish something. Empathy does get a 3rd heal, but I never chose it as it felt like a waste.<br />
<br />
Buffs, well, I havnt actualy gotten any at my level, but their supposbly really nice from Empathy I get Mana/HP Regen and some sort of melee buff.<br />
<br />
Levels:<br />
<br />
What levels gives you is, new skills, new enhancements, more damage/accuracy to your previous powers, more hp/endurance(mana).<br />
You can only chose powers from your skill tree(archtype) and you can only put enhancements into powers you allready posses. Starting at level 6 you can chose a power from a common powerpool(Travel powers, minor non-combat healing, minor group buffs ect.).<br />
<br />
If you're playing with a bunch of friends even if you get ahead of them theres still options to play together unlike in EQ. <br />
You can /sidekick someone 3 levels or more below your own level, which means they fight almost as good as yourself(1 level below you for 3-10 lvls below yourself, 2 for 11-25, 3 for 26-40 levels below yourself).  They wont have the diversity(they dont gain any powers atall from this feature) or the HP as a guy the same level as yourself however, which means they have to be extra carefully. It is extreamly easy to catch up with a buddie just playing along side each other, atleast in the begining.<br />
<br />
Enhancements is how you boost and make your powers &quot;unique&quot;. There's tons of different enhancements, first the 3 types is Training, Duel Orgin and single orgin, with the first being the weakest and the last being the strongest. You can place enhancements into your differend powers depending on the type of power. Take a damage power, you can place damage enhancement, range, re-use time decreasement, endurance reduction on. Some powers my have duration, knockback, stun component or some sort of root component in them and theres enhancements for that too. The maximum enhancements you can add to a single power is 6, each start out with a single enhancement slot to beging with.<br />
<br />
XPing:<br />
<br />
First of all, downtime:<br />
It's almost none excisting compared to EQ, there will be times ofcourse where you or your group need to take a minute to rest, but you gain endurance fast enough to not make it an annoyance. And theres a rest ability that everyone gets that lets you gain hp/end at a extreamly improved rate.<br />
<br />
Theres 3 ways to gain XP, camping(like in EQ you chose a area or run around in a area killing off whatever is in your way), Door/dungeon style and kill X. After you've completed a mission you gain a bonus amount of XP.<br />
<br />
Killing XX mobs of faction Y in zone Z doesnt yeild as much xp as the other two options but it's still nice for a slight diversity. <br />
<br />
The door missions, being the most fun is what im doing the most of, it's basicly LDoN style instanced dungeons. However these are actualy fun, their balanced towards your group and you can do them solo also. I dont have a clue how many differend layouts there is. I have however gotten the same excat dungeon a couple of times, but at no where near the same rate as in LDoN.<br />
You get a rather huge XP hit when you complete them(gain like 8-25 xp from normal mobs usualy and get around 150-300xp for completeting a door). They are easily doable solo or grouped like stated.<br />
However, the more people you add, the more need for specific classes you need in these type of missions, with a 8 people group it's extreamly easy to get overwhelmed by clusters of mobs. <br />
<br />
Contacts is more storyline/quest givers, you can buy a few enhancements and/or short term buffs/heals/endurance(mana) from them.<br />
<br />
Aside from levels the mobs got 3 ranks: <br />
Minions being the easiest spells generaly last longer on them, they take more damage from your spells and got small amount of hp.<br />
<br />
Ltd(cant actualy spell lieutainet or whatever :P) abit tougher, stuns/mezzes ect. last a smaller amount the on minions and they got abit more hp.<br />
<br />
Bosses is ofcourse the toughest, even if they are effectivly a even con(white) they can sometimes give you the fight of your life, they got minor versions of their archtypes abilities(DDs, Heals, life taps ect). Stuns ect. only last a few seconds on these so their damage output is generaly much higher then minions and Ltds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With all that said, I am enjoying this game alot. I have some doubts on the end game, but every new game allways has some issues there. There is NO items whatsoever out there, the only way you improve your character beyond levels is enhancements. Im not sure if it's a plus or a negative but so far I am not missing the item hunt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Ciccero - seems like you could, though the pets don't seem to appear until the very end (2 levels before max?).  I personally enjoy the mind control line for Dominate - because that puppy lasts a good long while, and you can whittle em down while they stand there writhing in agony.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Storm control gives a nice, cheap AE snare/slow.  Though it's good to have something for AE damage, as a good number of my groups seem to just charge around AE'ing big groups of baddies (crazy fun).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I was in the beta as well, and enjoy the game.  I haven't logged into my EQ account for a month because of RL being too hectic, but with CoH I can log on for 20 minutes, wack (or arrest as they say ;) ) some villians and log off.  Can't do that on EQ.<br />
<br />
During Beta highest I got was level 9, you don't get fly until 12 or 14, but can get Hover at 6.  Think of it as an Insta-Click Levitate but one that you can actual move up &amp; down with.  Slow as heck to move around with (that's why there's fly) but it's great to be out of the melee range of mobs.<br />
<br />
Another thing I think EQ should do is falling.  You can jump off the highest building in CoH and not die.  I've died repeatedly falling off some jackhole who goes afk at the port in spot in Nexus or PoK 3 times now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Is there currently, or planned, any pvp?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes but it won't be enforced.  I think they will have PVP zone.  Don't know much about it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Plus, I had to kill some visigoths (or something) and I spent ONE HOUR running around King's Hill (or whatever) and never found them. I did find tons of high level mobs who were happy to pound me flat.<br />
<br />
Vahzilok's are not that easy to spot in Kings Row. I found them in the garment district, but considering that they are CoH's version of undead, they are more easily found at night (yet I have seen some in the day--just not as many).<br />
<br />
Like you, I spent TONS of time making characters. I've lost track of how many I have made. I had a very good time playing at character creation screen. So much so, I wasn't sure I would actually enter the game itself. :) However, I have finally committed to PLAYING rather than just MAKING characters.<br />
<br />
I was concerned about screwing up my character based on the tree structure, but I'm discovering that it's not something that actually happens. I take my time reading the spell descriptions and trying to decide what I want my character to DO. Do I want to focus on single target damage/debuff? Do I want to provide multiple target damage/debuff? Do I want more powerful single target buff/heals or less powerful but very effective group buff/heals? Do I want to focus on neither and be able to offer both? What would be the most fun FOR ME? After I've decided what is the most FUN in my opinion, I then consider what kind of impact MY FUN OPTIONS will have in a group. Certain damage, buffs, debuffs, and heals have longer recycle times than others. If I think it would benefit a GROUP to cycle through those faster, I start augmenting it with enhancements to do just that.<br />
<br />
The part I found myself agonizing over the most is when I reach levels where I get to add two more enhancement slots to my powers. I had a hard time deciding which power is more critical at that particular juncture to require multiple enhancements. One way I stopped &quot;stressing&quot; over possible wrong choices that I could make was to utilize the inspirations more frequently. So far, they have been dropping like crazy. I get them often enough to make up for any possible &quot;poor&quot; choice. The +25 Accuracy, Rage, and +25% Endurance Regen inspirations seem to make up for any lack I might have by &quot;poor&quot; enhancement choices. I spend time patrolling just to get influence points and enhancements I don't care about to sell for more influence points. This gives me enough points to fiddle around with enhancement options until I feel like I have figured out the &quot;best&quot; way for me to augment my powers---at least the &quot;best&quot; for my style of play and grouping functions.<br />
<br />
I'm just in it to fly. Must fly.<br />
<br />
Flying is good. Now all I need is a cape that flutters in the wind while I fly. :)<br />
<br />
I LOVE creating new characters, almost as much fun as playing. I can also (and have) spent way too much time just standing at the trainer - watching all the names and costumes flash by.<br />
<br />
Me, too! People have been amazingly creative with their costumes and the names that go along with them. I spend a lot of time right clicking people in hopes that they wrote up a Description...the back story that explains how their character &quot;came to be&quot;. Sadly, not as many people have done this as I had hoped, but some of them are really great.<br />
<br />
My favorite that I have spotted so far is &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; on Champion. His look is great! Reminds me of Disco Stu from The Simpsons. <br />
<br />
There is no single pulling. If there's a group of MoBs, chances are they'll all come after you, so you have to rush them and pick them off strongest to weakest.<br />
<br />
That's not necessarily true. I have managed to &quot;pull&quot; singles out of packs but it takes some doing. My goal isn't really to pull singles all the time since just about all of my characters can take more than one, but I do like having the packs broken up a bit if I'm soloing. Four + orange cons are a bit more than I can handle all at once. I've been in a few groups where rushing a pack is their tactic, but when everything cons red and pink...it spells disaster. Pulling CAN be done, it just takes a lot of practice and I haven't figured it all out yet. The tactics for pulling don't quite work the same way all the time. So, it's been fun trying to figure it out and not having it down to a science. One GOOD thing that I do happen to like is that once you've engaged a pack, if you overpull...that's the way they will come every engagement after that (until they despawn). They reset to their points, but you can't try &quot;another&quot; tactic and manage to succeed. One attempt at getting it &quot;right&quot; is all you get. After that, it's just a matter of bludgeoning them down to manageable numbers or having them despawn.<br />
<br />
There's no more fun feeling than having your task force run into a group of about 12 Vahzilok in the sewers and tearing them to shreds while getting shot at and vomited on by the undead, keeping your friends alive, and watching all these enemies die.<br />
<br />
I totally agree that it is fun. It's fun when the enemies die. It gets annoying when they con red - pink and you continually get pummelled and repeat the attempt and get into massive exp debt. For that reason, I enjoy breaking the large groups of mobs into reasonable numbers. Even if we can only get the group of mobs split in half, that's significantly better than getting wiped out by acidic vomit time and again for a bum rush.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I must say, I'm disapointed.<br />
<br />
On the recomendation of most of you, I went out and picked up a copy of CoH (well, you're recomendation and crashing 18 times a day in EQ).<br />
<br />
So I get the game ($50) and install it.<br />
<br />
I load the game, and it looks *horrible.*  It seems that when they say you *need* a Radeon 8500 series, you NEED it.  My Radeon 7200, on which I play EQ with 100% plane and every graphic turned on with no lag, messes up CoH REALLY badly.  I'm talking instead of characters I see wire frames.<br />
<br />
So I get past this and make a character.<br />
<br />
Now, the nice thing is there are *alot* of choices.. the bad thing is that all the choices are the same.  Let me quote an example if I may.<br />
<br />
Arch-Class: Scrapper<br />
Sub-Class: Broadsword<br />
Skills: Hack, Slash, Slice, Build Up, Taunt, Parry, Whirling Sword, Disembowl, Head splitter.<br />
<br />
Arch-Class: Scrapper<br />
Sub-Class Katana<br />
Skills: Hack, Slash, Slice, Build Up, Taunt, Parry, Whirling Sword, Disembowl, Head splitter.<br />
<br />
This is just an example of the &quot;diverse characters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, the weapon thing is a nice idea, only it's poorly implimented.  This is going to sound wierd, but I'm left handed, so seeing a super hero wielding a weapon with his right hand seems off to me.  It would be a simple matter to make a character be able to swing with either hand, but you can't.<br />
<br />
As for creating a unique character, yes, I guess you could.  However I was grouped with 5 people today, all of which didn't know eachother, and 3 of the characters had identical characters (unique, eh?)<br />
<br />
<br />
So I get past this and get into the game.<br />
<br />
The game virtually has no explaniation of the important things.  For example, the upgrades to your weapon.  I would say weapons, but you are stuck with one weapon for the entire game.. for that matter, as far as I know you only get one costume as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the game has no easy way to explaining the different ways to &quot;upgrade&quot; a weapon.<br />
<br />
Gameplay, however, was a refreshing suprise.  /sarcasm off.<br />
<br />
If you've ever played SW:G, then you've basically played CoH.  I'm not positive, but I wouldnt' be suprised if the two games ran off the same engine.  That annoying background noise in the SW:G space ports is evident in about 50% of CoH.  Although most the sound in the game is amazing, this background rumble will most likely have you turning off your sound within minutes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the basic premise of the game, and as far as I can see, only one of two things to do in said game, is to go to your guide, get a mission, finish the mission, and then go back and repeat the process.  While this might be fun if there were dynamic differences, I went to 3 dungeons in two cities and fought *exactly* the same monsters.  Yay!  Remember how tired everyone was of seeing the Guk frogs everyplace?  This is worse.<br />
<br />
The only other thing to do, as far as I could tell, was to randomly walk around trying to find enemies to kill.  This was more entertaining for me than the missions mainly because there was dialog.  <br />
<br />
However, after the *second* time of fighting a bunch of blue's (yes, the game basically uses the con system as EQ, only with one higher than Red) and in mid-fight having some guy point a gun at my head and shoot me for 86 damage (roughly 50% of my hp) and consequently dying, it got old.<br />
<br />
The default keys are garbage as well.  It uses the antiquated &quot;WASD&quot; key configuration, and although it has many of the same feature of EQ, they reconfigured things to make it &quot;different.&quot;  IE - the Map is &quot;m&quot; and not &quot;Backspace.&quot;<br />
<br />
All in all, the game offers exactly the same thing that comic books do, pretty art, shallow storyline, and the promise of being another object that sits discarded on your shelf in a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Out of curiosity, what level did you play up to? The extreme diversity comes as you level, and get more choices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">/shrug, my 64MB geforce2 looks quite good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">A couple of more things to note.  I just got Gard L Tron to level 10, and picked up my first mission from a guy in Steel City that wanted me to go into a warehouse in Perez Park.  PP is a zone that is nearly impossible to solo in, so I got into a group of about 6 players.  We zone into the instanced mission and right at the door got met by like 10 level 11 mobs shooting concussion grenades at us.  It took us 3 wipes to get through the door, but wiping was relatively easy to recover from.<br />
<br />
So after building up a healthy experience debt, we left and ran around killing lower level stuff in the park.  I actually leveled up before I paid off my experience debt, which totally surprised me.  Apparently the experience you get is divided between paying off your experience debt and adding new experience.  You just level slower if you have an experience debt to pay off.<br />
<br />
I found two really neat powers that I have found to be extremely useful.  The first is called accelerate metabolism, which is a radiation skill a defender gets.  Basically, this buff increases the amount of damage of all melee and spell attacks for everyone in your group.  Every group I've been in have really been impressed with it.  The second is a general ability called transport foe.  Basically, if you time it right and don't get resisted, you can single pull from a crowd and tp the foe right into the heart of the group.<br />
<br />
Level 11 and still fun.  We shall see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Meglo,<br />
<br />
You are entitled to your opinion, however, you sound like someone who got the game and played for a couple of hours while looking for things to complain about.<br />
<br />
For example, does EQ give you a choice as to which hand is your primary?  No.  Would be nice, but certainly not a &quot;major&quot; issue.  Also, you played a few of the &quot;starter&quot; missions with a level 2-3 character.  Yes, many of these are simple and use the same mobs because you have not progressed far enough to see the story tree branch and get introduced to different gangs and mobs.  Believe me, by the time you get to level 12 you have plenty of different missions and enemies to fight.<br />
<br />
You also went out of your way to pick the most similar of all archetype (class)/powers trees.  Yes, the broadsword and katana are very similar in abilities, would you expect otherwise (they are both swords)?  Main reason for having both is to allow playing as a knight or ninja, not really to give you radically different abilities.  Now compare either sword skill tree to the other Scrapper selections and you will see much more distinction.  Please tell me, in EQ, where are the skill/spell trees that allow me to make myself different from every other character of my class?  A level 65 shaman with 0 aa's and all spells has almost identical abilities (except for gear) as every other 65 shaman with 0 aa's and all spells.  At least in CoH, when you make a choice, it does make a difference in your characters abilities.<br />
<br />
So, when you say that three of the guys had the same class/archetype and power (primary/secondary) group selections, it does not mean that they all have the same abilities.  Sure some combinations will be more popular than others, but there is still plenty of variety.<br />
<br />
And please, you are complaining about the default keyboard layout?  How silly.  The CoH UI is the most flexible and customizable one I've ever seen.  You can remap any key to whatever you want.  In addition, you can build some fairly complex macros that allow you to do just about any function.<br />
<br />
Also, you complain of the &quot;do mission, succeed, get the next&quot; syndrome.  At least there is always a mission (usually several, each with it's own story line) waiting for you (most are instanced), no camping, and you can solo many, no lfg.<br />
<br />
You mention technical issues, such as your graphics problem.  Well sorry, but to play newer games with a modern graphics engine and features (not a 5 year old engine like EQ's) you may need a modern card.  Obviously, since you cleared up your problems, it was probably just a driver issue (yes, having up to date drivers helps).<br />
<br />
Finally, you complain of lack of information.  Gee, this is the most baffling one yet.  The CoH manual that comes with the game has 10x more information on archetypes, powers, enhancements, inspiriations, game mechanics and customization than any document I've ever seen on EQ.  And if you get the Prima guide, all the info you would ever want is there.  When I joined EQ 2 years ago, if it had not been for Caster's Realm and for paying to join Allakhazam, I would have been completely lost.  The tutorial in CoH alone gives you more information than you will ever get in game in EQ.  So please, if you going to complain, make them valid.<br />
<br />
Now, read the other 40 posts in this thread for all the positive comments folks are saying about CoH.  Then try to balance your &quot;review&quot;.  <br />
<br />
BTW, how long have you been working for Sony?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Is it an item-centric game or how does character progression work?<br />
<br />
The short answer is no.  You don't have to find items, there is no currency, etc.<br />
<br />
Character progession involves 3 things:<br />
<br />
1.  Acquistion of new powers from different power sets.  You get two power sets when you create your character, and one power from each of these.  On each even level (2, 4, 6, etc) you get to pick a new power.  At first you're limited to the two power sets you chose upon character creation, later you have access to more.<br />
<br />
2.  Additions of new slots to powers you already have.  Each super power has slots that you can use to enhance that ability.  On odd levels you get two new slots that you can use to put on any existing power.<br />
<br />
3.  Enhancements. - These are items you obtain in battle, purchase from npcs using influence points (earned as a reward for defeating foes), or trade with other pc's.  The go into the slots you have for each super power.  You can modify the performance of your super power by changing enhancements.<br />
<br />
I find it a very unique, intuitive way to use your powers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Yeah, the broadsword/katana are the most similar power sets, and seem kind of put there to let people customize their look of martial weapon (though they do attack at diff speeds/damage). Other power portfolios are much more different. Moreover, you will have different character builds, depending on how people play. Unlike EQ, where every shaman can get every shaman aa, you do have to make choices in this game, which is good in some ways and bad in others.<br />
<br />
As a side note, its the smoothest release of any game ever. I have found zero bugs, never crashed or went ld, not been stuck in anything, had no problems with the functioning of any of my powers, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This game looks better then EQ but thats to be expected with a newer game engine. <br />
Sorry but you are in the Minorty.  Still I did have this sent to me.<br />
<br />
I'm disappointed <br />
<br />
...in the lack of problems with this game on the first day of going live. Not only was I creating my first hero with 10 minutes of cracking the seal on the game box, but I also played the ENTIRE night without a server crash or even a disconnect. As a long time EQ player, I feel I must object to this level of stability in a game system. <br />
<br />
In addition, I'd also like to see the following changes implemented so EQ players like myself can feel more at home in the game: <br />
<br />
1.) For the next couple of weeks, between the times of 3 PM EDT to 3 AM EDT, completely unplug the login server. Wait 30 minutes, then turn it back on and tell all the players that the login server is back up. If the server doesn't crash due to large volumes of people trying to log into the game, unplug it. Repeat as necessary, and after every patch. For a more permanent effect, pour coffee on the computer and/or drop it from a height of 3-4 feet. <br />
<br />
2.) After the server selection screen (but before the character selection), add a progress bar that will slowly fill over a period of 45 seconds, whether it takes that long to load or not. Also, inside the progress bar, add mildly humorous comments which only someone who watches shows like 'Barney the Purple Dinosaur' for its comedic content will laugh at. <br />
<br />
3.) Change the number of available helmet designs to one, and make that one look like a huge coffee can with a slit cut out for the eyes. <br />
<br />
4.) During gameplay, force the game's FPS to drop below 20 if more than 7 people are visible at one time. <br />
<br />
5.) In Atlas Park or King's Row, add a high lvl NPC who will attack the hero if he/she is fighting with a certain type of mob, and add a huge faction hit if the hero kills the NPC. <br />
<br />
6.) Finally, consider adding a couple of NPC's who drop really nice enhancements, then give them an 18 hour respawn time to force people to wait for hours in line to kill the NPC. <br />
<br />
And for future reference, make an expansion that only the top 10% of players on a server can access, but everyone pays for. That would be swell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Hrmm... couple things.  :)<br />
<br />
First, I don't work for Sony, and I'm insulted that you even suggest it.  To me, it says &quot;either you hate sony, or you are forced to say good things about them because they pay you.&quot;  Not true.<br />
<br />
As for the graphics issue, I never got it fixed.  I just dealt with only seeing wire frames.<br />
<br />
And no, I didn't get the game looking for problems, that's just stupid.  Why would I buy a $50 game just so I could hate it?  I went into the game expecting great things like you all had stated.  But you're right about the complaint.  Maybe I should &quot;balance&quot; it as you say.  I mean, after all if 40 people jump off a bridge, I guess I should as well.<br />
<br />
For every side, there is a positive and there is a negative.  CoH is no exception.  Learn to live with the fact that not everyone is smitten with the game.<br />
<br />
Also, understand that not every game out there is EQ.  Anarchy Online has as much, if not more, options for clothing / armor.  Only it's swappable, so you can change how you look.  SW:G has more customization as CoH.  For that matter, SW:G has an insane amount of customization as well.<br />
<br />
As for the mission thing, guess what, SW:G does the same thing.  You can choose missions and then go fulfil them.. The difference?  SW:G has MUCH MUCH more content than CoH.<br />
<br />
Ahh, but I guess I must work for Sony, because I say good things about SW:G and EQ.  Sorry, I'll stop the propaganda.<br />
<br />
But, for the record, let me say this.  CoH wouldn't be bad if they would develop ALOT more content.  As it is, the game is very superficial.  The entire thing smacks of tradeskills (IE: doing the same thing over and over and over again)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Considering the fact EQ has been out five years, and CoH has been out all of a week, I'd say they're off to a damned good start. Better than EQs thus far.<br />
<br />
You still haven't answered what level you played up to? That could affect your opinion as well. Lower levels, in every game, are all about gaining levels to do a little more. Your powers differ as you gain levels, enhancements, additional enhancement slots and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>BluntDoctor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Mezzes(got a single and a AE) breaks easily, this is more of a issue in CoH then in EQ, because nearly ALL classes has AEs, alot of the Blasters is even strictly AE based. Which in the end renders my mez almost 100% useless, I suspect this will be less of an issue further down the road as people get used to the fragile mezzes. <br />
<br />
Minty<br />
<br />
You might want to look into another primary power set for controller. Something that uses holds instead of actually mezzing for this reason. Not root, hold. It looks like the root icon, but the band covers the stick figure's arms. Much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Meglo,<br />
<br />
You were so busy being defensive that you totally missed the point.  You criticize a week old game that you played for a day or two as having too little content.  How do you know, you haven't even gotten to the mid-game.  I know for a fact, since I'm in a super group with level 12-18 characters, that the missions variety, complexity, length and challenge all increase as you level.  Sure, the beginning can be a bit repetitive, they want you to learn how to play.  Giving a new player 30 different mission choices immediately would only confuse them.  At this point, my level 15 blaster has 6-7 different contacts with missions that each have their own storyline.  That is about perfect in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Man, you would have an once of credibility if you had played to level 40 and could in fact state through experience that the game lacks content.  But to play a couple of levels and make that broad statement is just asinine.  Your statement is based on what you saw in a few hours?  Gee, if I created a character in EQ and zoned into a newbie area and never left for the next 3-4 levels, I'd say the same thing.  Beyond retarded.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you never corrected your video problems then I can see why you are not objective.  I would have a negative outlook on a game I could not run properly also.  However, this is because of your PC, not because of the game.   If you want to play new games, then your gear has to meet minimal specs.  I for one do not want new games built on old engines (such as EQ's) just to appease those that can not or will not upgrade their PCs from time to time.  Remember how Origin used to release games that pushed the envelop and required most poeple to upgrade their hardware.  Man was it worth it.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, sure, the game is not for everyone.  But to make it seem as if it is lacking because other games already have some of the same features, like AO or SWG is just stupid.  They took some of the best features of other games, with a totally original environment and cast of characters, and added their own unique interface and storylines.  I haven't seen superdude flying around with electrical powers in any other game.  But I've had my stomach full of elves, gnomes, dragons, etc., in just about every other game.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying you are not entitled to your opinion or that everyone will like the game.  I just hate to see totally nonsensical posts.  Wake up and get a clue.  Do us all a favor, delete the game and eat the CDs. <br />

No worrying about loot, or getting your corpses... <br />
<br />
The challenge comes mostly from taking on the eq equivalent of deep red (red and purple cons)... Yesterday myself (14, friends at 16 and 18) were taking on a mission full of 17s (the level 18's mission)... every fight was a challenge.<br />
<br />
Single pulling? what single pulls? =P   Mobs tend to be linked together, pull one, get all of them.<br />

This game reminds me a lot of Diablo2, simplistic but fun.. now imagine an online version where you can play with your buddies.  <br />

I agree one of the reason I love CoH so much.  It looks AND plays smoother on my system then EQ does.  Still if he want to play EQ2 he will have to upgrade.  If SoE 'dumb' downs the specs in EQ2 I think WoW will trounce them.  What upsets me was I was expecting a new graphic engine for God and all I got was DX9.</div></div><hr />

The sidekick system needs to be mentioned. You dont have to worry about being left behind by friends, my friends are all in there high 20's and i'm in my teens after restarting so many times.

This alone is MAJOR.  None of my  other friends can keep up with me in play time or gear in EQ so im the only one in Time.  In CoH I can bring them along for some fun.     EQ and COH both have stong points and are both fun games.  Just COH looks better and untill im higher I KNOW EQ has more content since its 5 years old vs CoH which is a little over a week old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">I just wanted to show how when you look at the game with jadded eyes, you will always find something to hate.<br />
<br />
I must say, I'm disapointed.<br />
<br />
On the recomendation of most of you, I went out and picked up a copy of CoH (well, you're recomendation and crashing 18 times a day in EQ).<br />
<br />
So I get the game ($50) and install it.<br />
<br />
I load the game, and it looks *horrible.*  It seems that when they say you *need* a Radeon 8500 series, you NEED it.  My Radeon 7200, on which I play EQ with 100% plane and every graphic turned on with no lag, messes up CoH REALLY badly.  I'm talking instead of characters I see wire frames.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont buy it, I can't belive you can play EQ with a ati 7200, it doesn't fully support DX9. I might be wrong, but sorry, I dont buy it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the nice thing is there are *alot* of choices.. the bad thing is that all the choices are the same.  Let me quote an example if I may.<br />
<br />
Arch-Class: Scrapper<br />
Sub-Class: Broadsword<br />
Skills: Hack, Slash, Slice, Build Up, Taunt, Parry, Whirling Sword, Disembowl, Head splitter.<br />
<br />
Arch-Class: Scrapper<br />
Sub-Class Katana<br />
Skills: Hack, Slash, Slice, Build Up, Taunt, Parry, Whirling Sword, Disembowl, Head splitter.<br />
<br />
This is just an example of the &quot;diverse characters.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Dont forget darkness attacks, martial arts, mace, axe, super strenght, etc. But ok, yea a lot of the same types of attacks for the same archtype, look at blasters, or tanks for more attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the weapon thing is a nice idea, only it's poorly implimented.  This is going to sound wierd, but I'm left handed, so seeing a super hero wielding a weapon with his right hand seems off to me.  It would be a simple matter to make a character be able to swing with either hand, but you can't.<br />
<br />
Can EQ do this?<br />
<br />
<br />
As for creating a unique character, yes, I guess you could.  However I was grouped with 5 people today, all of which didn't know eachother, and 3 of the characters had identical characters (unique, eh?)<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
This happens eairly on, its how you choose your powers (if you want other power pools like flying, jump, super speed etc, you cant take all your primary/secondary powers) that defines your class.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The game virtually has no explaniation of the important things.  For example, the upgrades to your weapon.  I would say weapons, but you are stuck with one weapon for the entire game.. for that matter, as far as I know you only get one costume as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the game has no easy way to explaining the different ways to &quot;upgrade&quot; a weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I got it right on, although I read the tutorial and manual. Training:Damage seems very easy to under stand or Training:REsist damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gameplay, however, was a refreshing suprise.  /sarcasm off.<br />
<br />
 Yes, it is a mmorpg after all, kill, kill, kill, kill. what do we do in EQ again?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you've ever played SW:G, then you've basically played CoH.  I'm not positive, but I wouldnt' be suprised if the two games ran off the same engine.  That annoying background noise in the SW:G space ports is evident in about 50% of CoH.  Although most the sound in the game is amazing, this background rumble will most likely have you turning off your sound within minutes<br />
<br />
Oh god i hate those noises....darkness tanks are the death of my speakers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, the basic premise of the game, and as far as I can see, only one of two things to do in said game, is to go to your guide, get a mission, finish the mission, and then go back and repeat the process.  While this might be fun if there were dynamic differences, I went to 3 dungeons in two cities and fought *exactly* the same monsters.  Yay!  Remember how tired everyone was of seeing the Guk frogs everyplace?  This is worse.<br />
<br />
This only happens in the begining. As you level you find new bad guys. You have hellions, skulls, undead, forgotten, demons, trolls, clockworks, skyraiders, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only other thing to do, as far as I could tell, was to randomly walk around trying to find enemies to kill.  This was more entertaining for me than the missions mainly because there was dialog. <br />
<br />
Dont forget watching police get mugged :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
However, after the *second* time of fighting a bunch of blue's (yes, the game basically uses the con system as EQ, only with one higher than Red) and in mid-fight having some guy point a gun at my head and shoot me for 86 damage (roughly 50% of my hp) and consequently dying, it got old.<br />
<br />
are you sure it was blues? I bet it was purple. If you died to a blue you must really of gimped your character. I have never had trouble with blues, whites, or reds. If you are, something is wrong with you, i'm sorry.<br />
<br />
<br />
The default keys are garbage as well.  It uses the antiquated &quot;WASD&quot; key configuration, and although it has many of the same feature of EQ, they reconfigured things to make it &quot;different.&quot;  IE - the Map is &quot;m&quot; and not &quot;Backspace.&quot;<br />
<br />
I happen to like WASD, its used in ALL my favorite games, but ok to each his own, remap em.<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, the game offers exactly the same thing that comic books do, pretty art, shallow storyline, and the promise of being another object that sits discarded on your shelf in a year.<br />
<br />
Time will telll, wont it. Sorry to fight back, but i didn't want to read the whole article and wanted to say somethings.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I run on an ATI 7200.  With the best drivers available, I've run UO, AO, EQ, Horizona, SW:G, and a host of other games without a problem.. but not CoH.  I forget who, but I've come across a few other players who have had problems.<br />
<br />
As for levels, I've run a fire/fire blaster to 13, and a katana scrapper to 8 or so.  The scrapper is the one that kept getting beat down at early levels.<br />
<br />

Uh, this was not commonplace in UO. It *seemed* commonplace because they used sprite mirroring, so that when you were facing in certain directions, it appeared as though your shield/weapon hands were reversed.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, I often would turn myself to give this appearance, since I am also a lefty, and my character attacking with the right hand just looks so *wrong*.<br />
<br />
<br />
***EDIT***<br />
Ohyea, another way that CoH has it all over EQ...today they put in a pretty large patch which changed a bunch of things. In the process, they broke some skills that weren't touched and they aren't sure why it happened. Their solution? They roll back the servers to pre-patch code (not characters, just code) until the problem is remedied. The devs went onto the official boards and apologized for the errors. No 10 hour downtimes, no &quot;patch the patch&quot;, no &quot;working as intended&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Flying is well worth it!  Got it as soon as Virago hit 14.  By far the best ability purchase I've made so far.  Very entertaining to swoop through the city.  I've tried landing on the blimp, but slid off.  Fell all the way down and landed with 1 hp.  <br />
<br />
My &quot;main&quot; so far is a level 15 controller on Guardian.  Now I'm the one squacking about broken &quot;mezes&quot;.  My slow is an aoe that radiates ******d from my main target.  When my target dies, the slow drops (and takes a bit to recycle).  If something moves within range of my target, the new mob is slowed.<br />
  <br />
This game is campy, and allows you to play around with your character.  You can have a battle cry - F-10 sends your cry out into whatever channel you've selected as your main.  <br />
<br />
You can change your battle cry by selecting ID under the main menu.  ID also has your profile - so you can change your story and background as you go.  <br />
<br />
It is fresh enough that it encourages those small acts of creativity that made EQ fun and entertaining way back when.  While fighting &quot;The Lost,&quot; a homeless gang, we competed for the honor of having the worst battle cry.  &quot;Take you tax cut and get a job!&quot;  &quot;Tax Cuts Save Lives!&quot;<br />
<br />
Makes me think back to the fun EQ days - when I'd come out from behind my spell book to find myself face to face with the glowing eyes of a troll.  &quot;Pretty lady read book?&quot;  Ack!<br />
<br />
Supergroups are fun to design -- Salvation's Army's leader is the Grand Pooh Bah, the captain is the Only Slightly Less Grand Pooh Bah.  The members are the Bottom of the Pyramid Scheme.   <br />
<br />
It's got fun animated emotes - you can haul out a newspaper and start reading.  You can roar, do jumping jacks, or lecture.<br />
<br />
As you move from contact to contact, some random stories begin to emerge.  Unfortunately, as each of the group works through their missions at the early levels, the stories are often repeated.  But as you move up, the number of contacts you have increases.  Presumably this will cut down on story repeats.  <br />
<br />
One very handy difference - when a zone gets too crowded, all future visitors to the zone are give the option of going to a copy of the zone.  Kings Row, or King's Row 2.  There is a lot of kill-stealing, in part because sometimes it's hard to tell that someone else is working on a group of mobs, in part because the game encourages you to attack random mobs as you wander along.  But it's really not the issue that it was in EQ -- everyone just moves on, no one gets upset.<br />
<br />
All in all, CoH has done a good job of giving me a break from EQ.  It's fun to play for fun again, if that makes any sense.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Ohyea, another way that CoH has it all over EQ...today they put in a pretty large patch which changed a bunch of things. In the process, they broke some skills that weren't touched and they aren't sure why it happened. Their solution? They roll back the servers to pre-patch code (not characters, just code) until the problem is remedied. The devs went onto the official boards and apologized for the errors. No 10 hour downtimes, no &quot;patch the patch&quot;, no &quot;working as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the time they took them down to the time they were back up was about 10 minutes!<br />
<br />
I haven't touched or even really thought about EQ since I got CoH, I love it.<br />
<br />
Every class -can- solo decently at least through the teens(Meglo, RTFM, it tells you your scrapper isn't a tank..don't play him like one and he won't get beat down ). <br />
<br />
The missions(quests! REAL, WORKING QUESTS!) can be soloed, but the more people you add to your team the tougher they get. Sure, you start off fighting the same thing the first few levels - that's because it's based off of your archetype/origin! When you play a defender for example, you fight Vhazilok(zombies) alot to begin with..with a blaster you'll get clockwork. <br />
<br />
That's a -good- thing.<br />
<br />
Yes, if you make another character you might end up on the same mission as before, but they are instanced and will be different maps.<br />
<br />
So far I have a 15 blaster, 12 tanker, and 10 defender on the Pinnacle server, and the only reason I can see to stop playing them and log on eq is to sell my stuff and give the plat to some friend who could use it.</div></div><hr />

I don't think one thread about a MMORG in a MMORG forum is out of line. After this thread appeared, a separate COH forum was created in the &quot;Other Games&quot; section.<br />
