<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">like.. 30 some hps short of 10k :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">put your stone of horrid transformations on your chest. get a gemstone of fiery might for the ear.<br />
take the azure trinket of dispair and put it on your legs, then get another 70hp aug for that ear.<br />
the 40hp gain will put you over 10k!</div></div><hr />

<br />
:( I don't even have half that.  <br />
<br />
But, I'm slowly moving up.  I ONCE buffed out over 8k for raid, and I was so excited.  Think we had max leader abilities, raid leader abilities, personal tribute and guild tribute running.  I got a screenie of it somewhere</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You need to pick up a Fabled Mrylo bracer before they're gone, then just get augments :)  That'll get you over 5k for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Halybuton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">man i am soo far behind it not funny unbuffed at level 70 and just teh gear on you see in my magello (click onthe sig) is 3976 without gear  cant even use Canni V lol without killing myself lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">. . . without gear  cant even use Canni V lol without killing myself lol<br />
Well, the only think that allows me to use canni 5 wihtout my gear on before DoN was tribute. Otherwise, I would kill myself as well. I think this was probably the case for everyone.<br />
<br />
DoN has changed that, of course. Get your +stats and +hps and you can Canni 5 nekkid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sinron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am 4700HP and 5880mana with DoN boost :) no tribute and only ND 2 :) hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no tribute <br />
Tribute is pretty much solved. Basically, a few hours farming some common tradeskill items, a 100 vendor purchased items, and a 100 low-trivial (under 30) combines and you can have 100K tribute in a snap. No reason not to use it these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">which combine do you use for tribute?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lemy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Only have 6798 HPs unbuffed atm<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">4296 HP's, but I haven't played in 6 months and I have no HP Augs.  How many HP's would I likely be able to get from adding the easy to get DoN HP Augs ? (Will be home and able to play again within the month)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">7737hp/8513mana unbuffed with no tribute....not sure why my mana in magelo doesnt match in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I keep myself near the 200k tribute max. I go donate when I get to 190k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Only in the third category, working on 12 k raid buffed/tributed.  Less then 100 to go, I need realistic targets ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What item are people talking about thats easy tribute? only have about 47k tribute atm. Have parts to make 3 incense burners of ro atm, I tribute those as they are worth 26k trib and sell for 6k if you are lucky on vazaelle. Once I run through that i'm out of ideas.<br />
<br />
I won't vote, since i'm not 70. At level 67 shammy, I have 3472 unbuffed hp, my ultimate goal being to reach 4k. I figure I shouldn't have too much of a problem with it, once I get dranik loyalists faction to warmly and get a few fabled things. Also looking at don hp augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Beorg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">7524 HP / 8618 mana unbuffed<br />
<br />
(7688 hp / 8753 mana With mirrored mask in Anguish.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">About 40% of the respondents here claim to have 7k and more, whereas EQrankings shows 376 shaman with 7k+ out of about 1600 level 70s, or roughly about 23-24%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">About 40% of the respondents here claim to have 7k and more, whereas EQrankings shows 376 shaman with 7k+ out of about 1600 level 70s, or roughly about 23-24%.<br />
<br />
Eqrankings does not have every shaman, nor is every shaman magelo authenticated. It would stand to reason that someone posting here would therefore have better information at their fingertips than eqrankings.....<br />
<br />
Does it not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You also have to remember that not every shaman knows about the Crucible.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, about 4530 unbuffed HP here.</div></div><hr />
