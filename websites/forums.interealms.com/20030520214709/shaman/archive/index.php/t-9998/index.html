<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SamTheMan67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I finally put together a magelo , and I want any suggestions. I'm also looking for good farming spots since im still 20k from Girdle of mith..<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gotta lose that +wis ring bro - that is so '90s! If you are poor, buy a Velium Fire wedding ring (6AC 65hp). If you got plat, mebbe a Circled toe bones would hot the spot.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that the Chryso Talisman is well past its use-by date....apart from root, how many spells do you use that are low enough level to be modified by this focus effect? Not sure what to suggest as an upgrade tho - I use a Ivory impued collar, but that is kinda succkass too - Mebbe a dragon talisman - Yeldema's is the easiest to get<br />
<br />
The shoulder slot is kinda weak. Even an Elder Wolfhide would be an upgrade, and you can solo that.  Imbued Granite Spaulders are nice if you can afford. I use Obulus Death Shroud, and I am pretty happy with that.<br />
<br />
The tin shirt is ok I guess, but really you should be able to get your hands on one of the Velious quest BPs soon...The Thurgadin is the easiest to get in terms of level (KD arena is pretty easy), but kinda a rare drop. The Skyshrine is a more common drop, but ToV HoT is harder than KD arena by an order of magnitude.<br />
<br />
I would go a chitinous belt over the spider fur, but thats me. Girdle of Mithaniel seems popular these days.<br />
<br />
The legs are a little weak IMO. Again, Velious quest legs would be better.<br />
<br />
The range slot item is horrible except agains fire/cold AoE mobs and PvP. Depending on your budget, things like Ceremonial Smudging stick or Seal of Thoridain are easy to get, but Gantru charm is nice if you can afford</div></div><hr />

btw spent 8 hours in the arena , no shaman drops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your gear looks decent. Definitely better than mine in many slots at that level. I'd rather buy better legs than a Girdle of Mithaniel. You could get Night Terror, Jaundiced, Barbed Rubicite, and Artificer's for about the same price as the belt, at least on Emarr. A better plan may be to start building up that spell fund now.</div></div><hr />
