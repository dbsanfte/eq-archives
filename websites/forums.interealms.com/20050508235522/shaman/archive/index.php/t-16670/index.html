<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darngudlukenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">like the title says lets say i find him up and i am only 1 in zone at lvl 60 or lets just say 61 for new pet. what are the tactics? like what buffs do i need and what should my base hp/ac be? thx to all who respond. with helpful strategys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>writher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Before fight have pet buffed with haste/focus/pe(or avatar)/maybe AC buff and give 2 weapons if are available.<br />
<br />
1. Pull with Malo(s)<br />
2. Get good distance <br />
3. Root<br />
4. Malosinia/Slow/Cripple/Decay<br />
<br />
Here you have two options (dependant on gear/AA's).<br />
1.  (If you have over about 1050 AC, and 2500 unbuffed hps)<br />
You can tank Lodi torpor'ed and have dogdog tear away at him while you toss in the occasional disease/epic/poison dot as mana permits.<br />
<br />
2.  (if you have low ac/hp's)<br />
Your pet can tank Lodi all the way with your pet torpor'ed.  Only use epic dot and your pet should keep aggro.  Keeping Lodi Rooted should help for this.<br />
<br />
I have done it both ways.  The First way is a quicker kill, and more &quot;shamanly.&quot;  The second way can be safer if you don't have high AC/HP.  Also: Conserve mana and reslow before it wears off!<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :-)<br />
<br />
*EDIT* I have only tried the pet tanking method with the 61 pet.<br />
Also, if Lodi is dual wielding clubs, your pet won't be able to tank...you'll have to zone to ToFS...and let him respawn in 10 minutes with a new drop table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Belor Pyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The same way you (well hopefully) solo any other mob that summons.  Buffs: all you can get, KEI of course, I prefer virtue to symbol and 9 when I try big solos (of course lodi doesnt have enough hps to worry with loosing buffs during the fight) and of course your buffs. You better have torpor, I would be more impressed with a 65 maxed aa shaman soloing him without it (or qheal) than a lvl 60 no aa shaman soloing lod with it.  Basically just run him around until you can get him debuffed, then just turn around and start doing damage until he is dead.  (Mobs wont summon until a reasonable amount of damage is done)  Make sure to keep slow on him, DOT him till he falls.  And keep torpor on yourself. Dont even try to tank him with a pet, in my experience a lvl 3 cleric could out taunt a shaman pet, and I can keep myself alive easier than my pet.  I keep the same basic stratagy when I try big solos, only I usually dont mess with a pet, of course my guide went by my rules, which assume you have some prep time with other classes, if you cant get outside buffs just do the same thing and hope a little harder.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In general with summoning mobs the key is to keep dogdog OFF the mob until you have fully debuffed it.  The mob will not summon until it's lost a certain amount of health, so if all you're casting is malo/malosinia/turgur's/cripple you will not be summoned.<br />
<br />
One other tip - keep an egg timer or something nearby and set it for 5 minutes.  Reslow and reset it when it goes off.  You don't want Turgur's wearing off, even for a few seconds.</div></div><hr />
