<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Rant on:<br />
<br />
Why does every Dr00d on my server feel the need to give me SOW or SOE?  I have my own damn movement buffs, thank you, none of which come with the nauseating up and down motion of levitation.<br />
<br />
It's even more annoying when I'm on one of my melee alts that just shelled out some plat for buffs, got a bihli, and then five minutes later has it overwritten by SOE.  Same with raids.  I don't want your ****ty speed buffs.<br />
<br />
Why does Druid SOW/SOE overwrite Bihli anyway?  When I'm stabbing things in the back I'd rather have 15 attack then Levitate, see invis and ultravision.  Hell, if I want ultravision, I'll click my mask or buff myself, depending on the character!<br />
<br />
UGH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why does Druid SOW/SOE overwrite Bihli anyway?<br />
Because it makes you run faster. These types of spells commonly have a &quot;highest %&quot; type of parameter when overwriting, similar to slow. <br />
<br />
It can be annoying, I prefer asking for the buffs I like to have up, rather than having them casted on me blindly. I have a macro for LDoN and other group situations that says &quot;Billy inc before we go in, click off Eagle if you want it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Well we group with a ranger from time to time and she likes to overwrite my Bih'Li with her SoW.<br />
<br />
Anyways one night she started SoWing everyone right after I cast Bih'Li. Our Enchanter (whose main is a Druid) asked why she overwrote the Bih'Li. So she explained that Bih'Li is SoW+ATK but that her SoW is better. She did not give a reason as to this mysterious extra power of her SoW but I assume it was because she was like 3 levels higher than me.<br />
<br />
Most of the group including the enchanter clicked off SoW and had me recast Bih'Li. I have noticed that she only overwrites on herself and her husband now. :)</div></div><hr />

Bat wings?  Levitation don't need no steenkin bat wings...<br />
<br />
Or do they go with the whips?  :D <br />
<br />
(See? some of us read titiles)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Druids are bad about buffing people without first being asked.  When I work on h2h I like to pull a soft hitting dark blue and then slap him around for a good long time.  I can go afk for 20 or 30 mins at a time unless some well intentioned but ignorant Druid drops a damage shield on me without asking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Simple. When you join a group mention: &quot;I have Bih`Li at the moment. Do not SOW/SOE/FOE me. I want the attack buff.&quot;<br />

Generally when a group gets together the buffers auto buff without really thinking about it.<br />
<br />
Petition in game to have Bih`Li changed so other speed buffs don't overwrite it.</div></div><hr />

Maybe so but he wasn't complaining about someone buffing his group, but about someone buffing him and he doesn't need the atk bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
im helping my friends monk get to 45 last night in CoM and a druid comes in and obvious see's the named we were going for, tries to pull it and fails a few times, so i guess as a appoligy for trying to pull a named in out camp that we were heading too, he casts SoE on me.<br />
<br />
Well right in front of him, in less then 3 seconds i automaticly clicke dit off and clicked my boots, which i always have in my 8th slot in inv and the lev was gone.<br />
<br />
<br />
I appreciate the buff, but i hate the lev, i dont see why we have to bob up and down for lev, which only serves to drop your FPS.<br />
<br />
Anyway, like i said, i dont bother getting pissed about it anymore, its just a automated response.  Click of, click boot, have a nice day.</div></div><hr />

What in gods name has the bobbing to do with FPS? Your 3d-card is still drawing as many polygons, just not in the same place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Dont ask me to technicaly explain it. Unless cause things are stationary they dont have to be redrawn till you move and since your bobing up and down each pixel has to be redrawn from changing angles over and over.<br />
<br />
<br />
All i know is. lev = Lag like hell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most likely the culprit is the cpu. The GFX card should easily cope with rendering, it does this every frame anyways, no matter if you move or not.<br />
<br />
Most noticable on large raids. So, no matter why, levi on = less fps.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that would be nice. Maybe a bit extra duration as well .... ;)<br />

It's improved somewhat, as it checks only at the top and bottom of each &quot;bob,&quot; whereas it used to check through the full range of motion.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe a class which attracts a55-hats like roaches to D-Con, a class with ports, tracking, 2nd best heals, 2nd or 3rd best nukes, 2nd or 3rd best DOTs would try and KILL STEAL YOU?<br />

<br />
If I may quote my recent post on Monkly Business:<br />
<br />
I know more than one (!) level 65 Druid who thought that they could slow after reading the in-game spell description of one of thier Ro's spells. No PLing or Ebaying involved, I have known them for a couple of years and they got their levels by soloing or grouping with caster friends. Hence almost all of their XP came from root/doting or kiting and they never learned how to group. When we do group, they root mobs and mess up agro, override Bih Li with SOE, fill the 15th buff slot with junk buffs and generally make a mess of things half the time.<br />
<br />
They are good folks too, just tend to be older (not '35-40ish older', but rather 'grandparents older') and have trouble learning new things.<br />
<br />
And it's OK, really - they found a class that matches their playstyle quite well and lets them enjoy the game on a certain level. The only time they start having problems is when they try to do something that they are not equipped to handle (insert a picture of 3 Druids trying to do LDON when it first came out and dying a horrible death) or try to do regular groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">SoE is faster and i get it cast on me a lot, and EVERY TIME it is cast on me, I click it off and click my black fur booties.  I cannot STAND levitate, the constant bobbing up and down makes me feel like i'm gonna vomit!  Only time I've ever used it is when I NEED levitate for something, in which case SoE is preferrable to having to refresh levitate over and over.<br />
<br />
I'm also not too crazy about the acronym they use for it.  I'm surprised they didn't give us a buff called Gift of Divinity that doubles your chance to melee crit, JUST so they can quote players saying &quot;I absolutely LOVE GoD!&quot;<br />
<br />
And about the see invis, am I the only one who still uses Acumen?  And calling it spirit of the buffalo wouldn't work because most of the buffalo are dead and if you were buffed with a buff like that you'd probably drop dead from a rifle shot within minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">SoE is faster and i get it cast on me a lot, and EVERY TIME it is cast on me, I click it off and click my black fur booties.

<br />
<br />
I do the exact same thing everytime. Not only because I don't want a sow that will get stripped the second I enter some zones but because it's pretty insulting that being the original sow class we have druids and even rangers able to overwrite our best sow which is only level 34. <br />
<br />
Billy really needs an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Hmmm yeah that's a good point about it dropping in the anti-levitation zones.  And yeah, didn't we get SoW at 9, to their 14?  I would like some type of upgrade though... it's often hard to notice the difference between our SoW and Run5/FabledJboots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">It seems like everytime I'm in a group with ranger/druid they cast SOE after I cast bihli and ask the group if they want bihli for atk buff,  or of course it could just be bad luck.<br />
I hear you Faern, in my early 50's before I knew what SOE was I was clueless why I kept going so slow in velks even though that ranger cast it on me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your brain's the cliff and your hearts the bitter buffalo<br />
<br />
Also, calling it SoB would be great simply for the acronym. <br />
&quot;Hey you SoB can I get an SoB?&quot;<br />
&quot;Gotta love that SoB&quot;<br />
&quot;Bring that SoB over here and give it to me&quot;</div></div><hr />

Shield of Striding (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27840) means never having to Load up on Bat wings. and it's insta clicky!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Vigdis, a couple of hours of your time in the deep and you can have levitation. It drops off one mob and there is a PH for it. You can sit in the spawn point and get no roamers. Its just boring to sit and wait for the pop. No more batwings ever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">you can also buy a pg. 70 left and a dew clover for probably under 500p in the baz and have a friendly int caster research it for ya.  (or a rune of conglomeration and rune of current - need a wizard) (or a pg. 65 left and pg. 65 rt - need an enchanter)<br />
<br />
I think you're on a zek though so prices probably aren't the same.<br />
<br />
Lev doesn't cause lag just like the swaying trees in velious don't cause lag  or so SOE/Verant used to tell us.   Yeah....right!</div></div><hr />
