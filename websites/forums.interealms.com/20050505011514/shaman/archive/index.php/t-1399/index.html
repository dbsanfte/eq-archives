<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yah so I&quot;ve been doing a hell of a lot of CT hunting, usually at planks where the Boots of FLowing Slime with the FT3 effect drop.  I've seen 4 pair now, and rolled on 3 of them.  Haven't won, but I was just considering something . . would I use them?  <br />
Stats are something like 7 ac 20 hps 40 mana 10 MR.  <br />
It would be a large drop in AC from Wolfcallers and also wis.  Would the effect justify it?  I have canni5 and pretty nice mana regen.  Would increased vulnerability be worth 3 mana/tic?  <br />
<br />
What are your thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What's your current AC ?<br />
<br />
If you can get 1100 buffed i wouldn't worry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SCM3 &gt; FT3<br />
If you don't have it yet I'd work torwards getting it and selling these boots for phat cash to a dr00d or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They're definately worth it in the high end... if you're not a shaman.  We regenerate mana so fast that 3 mana/tick is just a drop in the bucket.  I'm sure it's nice to have, but I would much rather have the 70k+ that these things sell for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">situationaly useful, grade B-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">IMHO the boots are the most useful when soloing for exp. Obviously the faster you get mana the better. They are worth getting for soloing alone.<br />
<br />
On raids the boots aren't that much of a help, since you can get KEI and PoG if you think you need to get higher mana regen.I' prefer to wear equipment on guild sized raids that helps with getting whooped on from casting Turgurs.<br />
<br />
I'd agree that the boots are situational though, I wear them on the guild raids where it takes extended lengths of time in encounters (rooted mobs).<br />
<br />
Time involved is kind of like camping ghouls for an FBSS. You can get lucky or sit there for huge amounts of time without seeing the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Worth having over Wolf Callers?  Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a tome of self reflection that goes in the range slot and has FT2 and no other stats.  My normal range item is talisman of benevolence.  I use the tome to recover mana after death, or when I'm low on hp but need mana recovery.  So it's situational.<br />
<br />
Would I use the boots instead of wolf callers?  Same scenario as the book (with which it would stack).  I'd use it in certain situations when I had no C3, low hp, or to recover mana quicker after death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Depends of what you're not wearing instead.<br />
<br />
If you're a yellow boot shaman (heh... I stilll see some of those around), they're definitely worth wearing over Golden Effreeti. Are they worth wearing over Wolf Caller's or PoM's boots? Situationally at *best*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wouldn't wear them over my wolf callers. Hell I probablly wouldn't wear them over Jaundiced. But then again I have Cann4, aa Cann5, and Torpor. I am rarely low on mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wear the Slime covered boots when I solo or am in a small group.  <br />
<br />
If I'm raiding, I go for the extra hps from my Shamanistic Shennanigan Boots.<br />
<br />
Don't knock Flowing Thought till you try it.  3 mana / tick doesn't sound like much but it really adds up over time and you will notice it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Theoretically more mana regen's always helpful. However, mana regen only seems to be an issue while soloing, and sometimes while grouping. On a raid, your mana regen is insain already, and you are mostly FM anyway, so adding 3 pt to is insignificant. I'm far too attached to the HP given by mith boots to swap it out on raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here Litchebane. While not the best equipped Shaman on the server (/peer Kazlaaz), I do have Canni4, MC3, Canni5, Torpor, FT3 (FT6 if I use Boots). Throw KEI and PoG on that and you have insane mana regen, but still... there are times when I *DO* get LoM on raids.<br />
<br />
The more mana you can get the better off you are, and I would take FT over HP depending on the encounter. I try to equip according to the encounter and like flexibility.<br />
<br />
Get the boots just so you have some flexibility in equipment. If you get FT15 without the boots at a later time then you have something you can give to a guild member to help them out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sidenote: FT15 is not a cap anymore.  There was a thread here discussing this a couple weeks ago.  Before FT items of the same vale stacked, and before ft6 items existed, the best you could get is 1+2+3+4+5=15.  It never really was a cap, it was just the best you could get at the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's probably true, but I have no intention of asking for any FT5 or FT6 items before clerics and druids who play consistently get them.<br />
<br />
I think the Shaman has huge mana regen compared to any other casting class. I'd rather see the guild clerics and druids get the FT5 and 6 items before me, solely to help the guild.<br />
<br />
Once the clerics and druids who play consistently have them then I would consider throwing my name into the pool, but not until then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">FT3 is similar to having a regen of 6hp/tick if you consider it from a Cann view point, without having to actually Cann for that mana.<br />
<br />
Pre-Torpor this would be a pretty good thing although still slightly situational if the lost AC were to put you under a cap or not.<br />
<br />
Post-Torpor, most shaman are trading in their fungi for the higher AC BPs.  I'd put these boots on par with the fungi for swappability at 60, and break them out around whenever you were usually putting on the fungi, if you ever did.<br />
<br />
However, this is only my view at 58.  If I had these, I'd wear them over Wolfcaller's if I didn't drop below 1000 unbuffed to wear 'em, but I'm on a bit of a FT craze atm too. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Veranon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have those boots, and I have them on when I solo and when I'm in group where I don't take a lot of beating (use the PoM boots in those types).<br />
Yes, I have SCM3, CannV, and I still think they're useful.<br />
<br />
1. When soloing it's an extra dot every 10 minutes, but with the combination of SCM, Cann, FT and some AoB items/Dain Ring it's literaly no downtime when soloing as long as you don't have to cast more than slow/pox on a mob.<br />
<br />
2. In those longer fights (cursed, AoW, Burrower) where you never get hit anyway, it doesn't hurt, and gives you a few extra heals.<br />
<br />
FT is like Regen, 1-3 points barely does a difference, but it all adds up.<br />
I have MC3 and FT9 when soloing, that coupled up with SCM3 and CannV makes a huge difference.<br />
In big fights it basicly lets you chainCB and with FT/SCM/MC/Bardsong/Clarity/CannV you can pretty much keep up with the mana you spend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd feel pretty guilty taking FT items before clerics or druids or other casters, at least in a guild group.  They need the FT soooo much more than I do.</div></div><hr />
