<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few weeks ago about I found Gore up in DL.  Well about 10 or so guildies came and we took him down.  No big deal.  But since we were very unorganized, the MT went down quickly, along w/ the shms trying to slow him.  We gore went down, he was killed by a Mage Pet who wa holding aggro over 2 rangers and a monk (they lived).<br />
<br />
Well earlier today I was getting a xp grp going in PoV, and no MT was available.  We'll mage suggested using his pet which stuns (he was hydraing the cleric).  I (with ranger) pull and golem pet went in and took aggro and kept it even after I slowed (w/ my shaman).  The pet required 2 CE's for healing.  No CHeals necessary (pet had focus, virtue).  <br />
<br />
Can someone tell my why I should pick a warrior, or even pally/SK over a mage for MT role?</div></div><hr />

<br />
well you see, the mage....<br />
<br />
hmm.<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it there is no reason. Mages are also infinitely more fun to play (how exciting can it be to hit &quot;autoattack on&quot; for 65 levels, and your defensive disc once every two days on raids?)<br />
<br />
Just the other day I was in a PoD pickup group in Castle. Our MT said he had an urgent something to do in bazaar and had to leave, so we let him. The mage let his pet tank and the thing held aggro, took damage, and arguably DELT damage better than the MT which left. I almost didn't want him to come back, we functioned perfect without him. Mages are very powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As time goes on i think you will realize the advantage of having a thinking human behind the taunting/aggro instead of a pet that only has /pet back off  /pet attack<br />
<br />
i can add this ...<br />
<br />
I dont know who you are having as your MT's but i can promise that any SK/Pally/Warrior with spells gear and knowlegde can out aggro a mages pets.<br />
<br />
Thats just my world though ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm curious how a pet can hold aggro over a person.  They changed pet aggro code so that mobs ignore pets if a person is closer.<br />
<br />
That point aside,  Playing a warrior can be a demanding role if they are any good:  Here is something one of our wars posted about a sontalak raid the other day:<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a midlevel bard alt. All the singing and changing targets to mez, slow and buff is a bit tricky sometimes. Of course you get used to it with the time. However tanking Sontalak is like threeboxing 3 bards. He dispells, 4 buffs at a time. I only have 2 instant self only cllickers (9th rng and jboots) and a bracer of the hidden, where I need to target myself first. And for the forth and last buff, which gets dispelled every few secs, I have Geant throwing an endure poison at me. However, have you ever tried to click 3 items, for one you have to change targets, keep a mob in position, stay in range with a 2boxed character for junkbuffs, dispelled ds and heals, while watching to not in any case to lose agro on the other puter (Sontalak hates heals, he hates all clerics, I think thats because he never gets a rez)? This is such a stress, I went to drink two beers right after he droped. I managed to keep virtue, haste, focus und GoD on me for 2 mins, then he dropped my GoD and got me feared. Feared characters cant be healed. So I died and could focus on nukes for Geant. Man, all you wizis have such a relaxing role. Well it was top fun after all, grats Flu on key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The pet was the only melee so no other melees around to take aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With the kill speed of that group, you are better off soloing golems. Why group at all? <br />
<br />
There are always situations where one class comes out on top compared to some others. There's a reason why people don't use mage pets as tanks in optimal groups, because they aren't good enough as tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Once again your inexperience shines through Litgruv, with a complete pet kit and tricksters, high end mage pets generate incredible amount of agro, way way more than any warrior without EB, try asking the warrior to move the mob without backing off that mage pet and you'll see what I mean, the warrior probably won't be able to without getting a successful taunt check then running back and sitting whilst they still have enough hate to move the mob that way.<br />
<br />
However yeah, pets will generally not have agro under normal circumstances if ANY player is in melee range and on the mobs hate list at all, there are a few oddities (Rampage and a few quirks with evade also, I've personally managed to evade a mob onto a pet and get backstabs in the past as a rogue, no idea if it still works or was fixed though).<br />
<br />
The biggest problem though is that a player will usually be prefered as a tank simply because of issues with pets such as pathing and the way they taunt (I'm pretty certain that pet taunting simply generates additional hate rather than working like regular player taunting).  But they are still a very viable option in places especially outside of PoP where they are just sickening =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get a real pet(61+ and charmed) and try to steal the aggro from it. Stack 15 poison DoTs or whatever...Nothing compares to these monsters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As to the DPS comment with the golems dying slow, that was not what I found.  With 2 Rangers (an EQ/AM3 and AM2) hitting w/ bows, the pet itself doing a crapload of damage, shamans dots, and the mage tossing a nuke on it, they died pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've personally managed to evade a mob onto a pet and get backstabs in the past as a rogue, no idea if it still works or was fixed though.<br />
<br />
Yup, still works a bit.  Goner (well equipped) was MA for a 58 rogue a couple times last night.  Doesn't take long for the rogue to reintroduce himself (&quot;say hello to Mr Pointy Blade!&quot;) to the critter though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You were trying to apply one specialized circumstance in general. Following your logic, why group at all when you can just smooch from a charmer? Obviously a charmed pet out performs anyone.<br />
<br />
Btw, Mage water pet caps at ~75 sustained dps from the back, and ~45-50 from the front. Even paladins can do 50 dps from the front. In most situations, players will out perform summoned pets as a tank, unless the player is extremely poorly equipped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What exactly are you guys arguing about?  The only way you are going to be using a mage pet as a tank is with a group full of casters and rangers.  <br />
<br />
No pet in any situation ever, is going to hold aggro over any melle regardless of equipment or level.  If a melle is close enough to hit the mob, the mob will hit the melle and ignore the pet.<br />
<br />
Yeah, rogues might be able to evade for a few seconds, thats not going to be an effective way to run a group though. <br />
<br />
We gore went down, he was killed by a Mage Pet who wa holding aggro over 2 rangers and a monk (they lived).<br />
<br />
The pet was the only melee so no other melees around to take aggro.<br />
<br />
I'm still confused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No pet in any situation ever, is going to hold aggro over any melle regardless of equipment or level.<br />
<br />
Only true if there is only a single pet. Add a second pet, and the pets can (and frequently will) hold agro over PCs.<br />
<br />
The general presumption among people that don't know what is actually going on is that they coded it it be &quot;Pet can't hold agro over a PC&quot;, when what they actually did was &quot;If pet is top of list and there is a PC in melee range, attack 2nd target on list&quot;. Sick 2 pets on a mob and if both are outdoing all PCs one of the pets will get beat on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I know it's a crazy idea, but perhaps you actually have friends in the game that play a melee/hybrid, and you'd rather hang with them than a pet. ;)<br />
<br />
I suspect that basically a pet is a fine tank as long as you're in a fairly controlled situation - always single pulls, etc.  I'd much rather have a live person tanking once a few mobs show up.  But maybe I'm biased, because I play a warrior as well as a shaman. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Once again your inexperience shines through Litgruv,<br />
<br />
you just wanted to say that. cause in everything you go on to say agrees with that i said heh /boggle.<br />
<br />
Stop hating dude , insults get you no where.<br />
<br />
I said :<br />
<br />
 As time goes on i think you will realize the advantage of having a thinking human behind the taunting/aggro instead of a pet that only has /pet back off /pet attack<br />
<br />
i can add this ...<br />
<br />
I dont know who you are having as your MT's but i can promise that any SK/Pally/Warrior with spells gear and knowlegde can out aggro a mages pets.<br />
<br />
Two very direct points i made here. SK and Pally are going to out taunt any pet and its better to have a human operating the main tank role.<br />
<br />
First point , Pally and SK ... Well just by radius alone the melee will have aggro over the pet. The only way the pet will gain aggro is if everyone moves back , so on that point you are correct , but since that was not a point we are addressing to begin with i fail to see how im inexperienced for not addressing it when the  issue was them being the main tank and holding aggro over the SK/Pally i believe.<br />
<br />
Second point , Human operation vs a pet.... My &quot;inexperience&quot; Shows me that if you got your uber pet holding aggro and maybe a add comes , what you do now ? you back off pet and have it go after the add ? Pet will turn back to the original mob everytime he gets hit , slower cant slow untill sufficient aggro is built, but a SK or pally simply turns stuns/terrors and goes back to main mob.<br />
<br />
There is no way i would ever have any pet as a MT , i would tank first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pets make great xp group tanks, if you're pulling only one or two mobs at a time. (or more, if you have an all pet group - those are fun, but tend to be chaotic.)  Pets can't:<br />
<br />
1) grab aggro on a mezzed mob<br />
2) choose the right target to kill next<br />
3) pull and tank on the way back to the group<br />
4) choose the right place to die so the rest of the group doesn't get aggro from an overpull<br />
5) taunt things off the damage dealing classes when they're in melee range<br />
6) switch targets reliably<br />
7) reposition mobs reliably (A good pet handler can do this, but it doesn't work well when the pet is MT for a group.)<br />
<br />
If you're willing to give up all those things and spend a lot of mana healing the pet (pets have tons of hitpoints at upper levels, but never get the defensive skills/spells a decent tank will have so they take more damage) go for it. Personally, if I'm in a group I prefer to have a warrior, SK or Paladin who knows his job. (If one isn't available, then sure, I'll use a pet for MT.)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Had a mage pet tanking in POStorms the other night, it worked great, our bard would dot the mob from range, and would run in when the mob hit 15%, so the pet wouldn't take enrage and die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">2 things have kept me from playing a mage:<br />
<br />
1. BS research (they get the worst of all int casters)<br />
2. Mages cannot deal with adds in any way shape or form when soloing.<br />
<br />
<br />
They have to atatck 1  mob and 1 mob only. If they get adds they must have sow up and run like HELL.<br />
No snare and no root :(<br />

Pet root is quite easily resistable.<br />

<br />
Just because a player is getting hit, doesnt always mean they have agro (IE are at the top of a mobs hate list), 2 examples = the mob is rooted, or a the mob's target is using an invunerability effect.  Good to see ye suddenly forgot about the warrior too, was you around for the couple of weeks between pet hate being upped and the code stopping pets from tanking for players being implimented?  A high enough level mage pet was pretty much guaranteed to be the groups tank unless you had a pally/sk that knew how to generate lots of hate or a well equiped warrior.<br />
<br />
First point , Pally and SK ... Well just by radius alone the melee will have aggro over the pet. The only way the pet will gain aggro is if everyone moves back , so on that point you are correct , but since that was not a point we are addressing to begin with i fail to see how im inexperienced for not addressing it when the  issue was them being the main tank and holding aggro over the SK/Pally i believe.<br />
<br />
Actually it is a useful issue, one quirk of the pet hate code is that someone with 1pt of hate can tank despite the pet and mage both having much more hate than the person who is tanking.  As long as the mage doesnt surpass the pets agro, the mob won't bat an eye lid at them but instead will remain focused on the person in range.  Quite a useful thing to keep in mind if you have a low taunt warrior tanking for you.<br />
<br />
Second point , Human operation vs a pet.... My &quot;inexperience&quot; Shows me that if you got your uber pet holding aggro and maybe a add comes , what you do now ? you back off pet and have it go after the add ?

<br />
/shrug, thats a difference in playing style, equipment level and choice of hunting grounds, if I'm CC and an add comes, if it goes for someone beefy enough to take a few hits from it, I'll be malosing as its charging then take agro myself with turgurs/disemp, then reposition it for parking, if there isnt enough room to park it or its just plain root immune, I'll either torpor/disemp tank it myself or just kite it if need be.  And you did slow the original mob right?  ~3 seconds is plenty of time for a quick reacting pet owner to switch a pet.<br />
<br />
There is no way i would ever have any pet as a MT , i would tank first.<br />
<br />
Then you need to open your eyes and experience more variety, I've had pets tank for me several times, yes there are situations where its not a viable option, yes dogdog isnt really a viable tank, but theres also plenty of situations where some pets make a better tank than me.  Think you can't get good exp without a plate tank?  Think again =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">/shrug, thats a difference in playing style<br />
<br />
That lil quote pretty much sums it up for me.<br />
Frankly i cant muster the desire to debate with you quote for quote. Your insult right off the bat tells me where your coming from and what your looking to gain from our interaction. I have no desire to give it to you....<br />
<br />
I stand by my comments.  Never did i say a pet cant tank , never did i say i can tank as well as a plate class. These are words you put in my mouth ;)<br />
<br />
In anycase, have fun with your pets tanking. As for me the only pet ill have tanking in my groups is a CoD enchanter pet or a Mage charmed pet <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>adayoner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I agree with litegruv on the fact that i wouldn't want a pet tanking in most situations for the simple fact of adds.<br />
<br />
Unless you're hunting somewhere where you can pull to a completely isolated spot w/o roamers, you always gotta worry about them, and sure root parking will work for a mob or to, but i would like to know that we would have some chance of surviving if we took 3 or more adds or got trained on us.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I've duo'd with mages, i've grouped and seen their pets offtank a mob and end up mting it fine, but when it comes down to it I would still prefer a semi-decent tank over it.<br />
<br />
If you want to start taking mages over tanks your entitled to do so.  but I'm gonna stick to using a tank unless i really dont have a choice.<br />

I tried them all a few times, no slow stuck (except Gimpfire, but no use to slow a dragon which is dead in 1 minute or less). But you don't get a client message, they just resist every slow.<br />
<br />
On the topic:<br />
It's good IMHO to have different ways to do a XP group. I don't want to be forced to go looking for a tank to start one. More choices=good.<br />
