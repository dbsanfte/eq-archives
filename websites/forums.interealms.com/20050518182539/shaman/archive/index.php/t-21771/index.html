<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are there actually any GM's still working?  Does the new ticketing system even get read?<br />
<br />
I am thinking not.. <br />
<br />
I have had a char stuck and unplayable for going on 4 days, and I have had tickets sitting in that system for all of those 4.<br />
<br />
Not replies, no help, no guides, no nothing.<br />
<br />
I mean yes, the service is a LOT worse than it used to be, but going on a week and I cannot play.<br />
<br />
This is just beyond belief.<br />
<br />
What is the point of this new tik system.. if noone reads the damn things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That is terrible. Nothing should be higher priority than the complete inability to log onto a character, other than a serverwide or game wide inability to do so. Four days is a ridiculous time to wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had a problem about a month or so ago. I alternated between petitions and emailing every other day. There were sometimes a guide would answer my petition and say they were passing it on to a GM. After about 2 1/2 weeks of this I got an email from a GM.<br />
<br />
Don't bug them enough to piss them off but keep the pressure on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I read somewhere that if you are stuck you should head to the Stuck Character chat room.  I think it was a MoTD or something.  Never had to use it yet tho (knock on wood), maybe you would have a faster response there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try changing your password via the account manager.  I've had a couple of guildmates locked out of game until they did this, even though they weren't having password errors.  I'm guessing that the act of changing it resets something somewhere and gets you unstuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A character stuck in game?  or can't get into the game?  If it's stuck in game, talk a friend into bringing you a port potion or something (turn off autoduck!)<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">they put the /rewind command back in a few patches ago, you could try that. no idea if that would help in your situation though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have used the stuck character room a couple times.  It did work for me.  All they ask for is your character name, server, and race and they will port ya to east commonlands.  At the right time it is not to long of a wait for a gm to attend to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I will have to try that chat room..<br />
<br />
I am stuck under the world, and for some reason I cannot cast, so I cannot gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Halamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Use the &quot;stuck room&quot; , I used it once, and was ported out within 5 min of my request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had my shammy (then level 3) stuck in a crevass, ticketed for 1/2 a day and realized that a GM just didn't exist on my server, then decided to go into the chat room, got directed to the stuck character room       ( #join stuck  character )and within minutes was ported to East commons, at which point I got mangled by a red to me cat and died. I think if they are gonna put you in EC they should at least put you in a place where your toon ain't gonna get killed as soon as you log in. Pissed me right off.<br />
<br />
Not to mention my growing disallusionment with the game, where's all the low level characters? almost all I see are 65+ or there abouts. Once in a while i'll actually see a lower level toon, but geeze, there used to be 100's of low levels. now... i'm almost always the only one in Everfrost.<br />
<br />
Terris Thule sure has gotten empty.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">All the lowbies are being PL'd in high exp mod zones by their level 65 mains. Alt accounts are really the only growth in EQ these days, sad to say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimleaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just reciently used the new petition system to make my last name &quot;Donteatmylegs&quot;. Only took about a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">All the newbies/lowbies are on Morden Rasp server these days. There are still a ton of people starting everquest for the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Guides no longer even see petitions, if you see one online they should respond to /tells if your stuck under world though. <br />
<br />
One of the reasons I left the guide program after 2+ years</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Friend and I had 2 accounts each stuck in a LDoN we'd had to abandon in the middle due to RL - right before a patch day.  After the patch, couldn't log into those characters at all.  This lasted about a week.<br />
<br />
Being polite and patient will get you shoved to the end of the queue.  I finally got so disgusted that I fired off a petition and email saying that we were canceling all 4 accounts, and if they unstuck our characters we'd consider whether we wanted to turn them back on.  (and then canceled the accounts)<br />
<br />
Results within HOURS.  On ALL accounts.  It's ridiculous that you have to be a complete prick to get service from SoE, but that's the way it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mysticrhythms64</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I hate to say it but from what I have seen so far, SoE's ticket system is nothing more than an excuse to ignore the userbase. Guides are never on that I have seen (I play about 10 hours a day, and frequently do /who guide all and of course, there is never a guide on. That tells me that those who are guides (if any anymore) are playing their mains and screwing SoE out of work due them. Pisses me off to have to leave game and go to chat to find a GM to get anything done. I told one GM that unless SoE did something really fast about the lack of aid on the server that I would end billing and make dang sure everyone I know, know about it.. I then told them that I am a member on 29 different boards (I am) and the general userbase for each board is numbered in the thousands. Thats a lot of people to let know how SoE sux. I got fast results with my (latest) stuck toon, but still... why a toon will get stuck in a wall just by jumping blows my mind.<br />
