<br />
Congratulations on getting into the Elemental planes. There's a lot of wonderful loot to be gotten here with raids, but some of the most satisfying items are ones you can camp yourself, with a group (or less!)<br />
<br />
Reef of Coirnav is the very definition of such, with fairly easily camped loot with comparative goodness to loot off tier 2/3 raid bosses. The underwater fighting takes some getting used to, and melees will whine and moan about having problems meleeing. In general though, it's a dark and quiet zone, and you won't see another soul here, let alone have someone bitch at you because they're kiting where you want to hunt.<br />
<br />
The zone is divided into 3 main areas, with sub areas of each:<br />
<br />
The upper (zonein) area is what I'll be discussing in this thread, and contains 3 main camps: Sharks (Southwest) Trilouns (North of sharks, or also the most southeast room) and Fish (East... Also called the &quot;Bard Weapon&quot; camp)<br />
<br />
The Lower area is past the drop down, and contains an upper ring around the Hydrotha room, and a lower ring south of Ofossaa the Enlightened, which has several side rooms full of Regruas and Hraquis. Krizzik the Mighty is in one of those rooms.  It's dark and scary down there, and the fights are insane, but there's lots of tradeskill items to be had (as well as exp that rivals PoFire tables) if you can handle it.<br />
<br />
The third and final area is where you do the Coirnav event, and there's no real point to it otherwise.<br />
<br />

Important Fact: Spawn time is 40 minutes on the dot.<br />
<br />
There are 2 camp spots other than the zonein in the northern half of the zone. The first and easiest to get to is one spot which is used for either Sharks (The best loot) or Trilouns (Getting people the damn fragment for the Gate Necklace). To get there, Invis up at the zone in, make sure everyone has an Enduring Breath item (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemswitheffect.html?id=86), and swim down to the first room. From there you are going to hug the left wall, and swim to a tunnel. Go into the tunnel and stop about equidistant from the fork in front of you, and the room behind you. This camp has access to Hammertooth, Gigadon, Razorfin, the Triloun Seer, and the Monstrous Sea Turtle (if your puller is good). There are two roaming sharks to the west, and if you don't see him at the fork, wait a few minutes before pulling him. One shark actually paths into the hallway where the camp is, but he pauses at the fork before doing so, giving you time to kill whatever you're fighting before engaging him.<br />
<br />
The second camp is near the frogs room (Frogs drop oil for making the water sprinkler thing, so are sometimes worthy of camping), to the north of the room with Swordfang and the Ferocious Barracuda. The Triloun Egg Keeper is also nearby. To get there takes a bit of fighting, or a lot of luck. From the zonein, go right instead of left, and into the tunnel. There will be a triloun champion there who always sees invis, though he might be to the south (he roams) and you might be able to slip past him. He hits for 900ish and is Mostly Slowable. From there, move north, and go left (north) at the next fork. You may have to kill 2-3 more roaming triloun champions. Turn right at the next fork, and you'll be in a long tunnel heading east, with a static frog at the end. <br />
There's a single triloun champion who wanders through here now. If he's dead, it's safe to AFk there for a little while.<br />
<br />
The Named, their rooms, and how to pull them  <br />
<br />
Camp 1: Sharks.<br />
<br />
Sharks is the best camp in the upper area of this zone. This camp services four named, three of which can drop the sharkspine club. It is possible for a shaman and a shadowknight with decent quantities of elemental gear and AAs to actually duo this camp, then call in guildies/friends for reinforcements should a named pop. Having personal experience doing this, it is quite viable, but it's pretty tough. Healing AAs and a mana pres item are reccomended.  At the very least you can keep 1-2 placeholders down.  You want your club, and SKs want thier pet weapon, so it's perfect harmony. About 1/3 of my total time spent here was duo action, though sometimes we added a cleric or druid to loot a freebie mace/shield.  As a bonus, you can rarely get &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=21732&gt;Shimmering Fish Gills&lt;/A&gt; here, which are used to make &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=Farwater&gt;Farwater Scale and plate&lt;/A&gt;armor, which is arguably the best chain/plate elemental armor.<br />
<br />
Sharks hit for 1029 (Hammerheads) and 1048 (Normal) Max hit. They're &quot;Partially&quot; slowable, and most of them are level 65. They don't hit particularly fast however, and Quiescence was able to keep my buddy Reyortsed alive most of the time, although I kept tnarg's up to counter spikes in DPS. Here's the 4 named you'll encounter here:<br />
<br />
(Numbers correspond to the attached map)<br />
<br />
1) &lt;A HREF=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11596&gt;Gigadon&lt;/A&gt;: Normal Shark look, Max Hit of 1259, Slightly Slowable. Rampages.<br />
<br />
To reach Gigadon's room, from the camp spot you will need to kill the wandering shark near the camp, then turn north, and hang a left at the next fork (There's a trap, don't go near the sponge thing). Go straight at the next fork (another trap, again mind the sponges) and you will see an opening with many sharks swimming around in it. His room has 7 wandering sharks none of which see invis (although he does), as well as his placeholder (doesn't see invis). About 2/3 of the time, the placeholder is a blue con &quot;a reef shark&quot; which makes it easy to single out from the others which are always level 65. Sometimes it does spawn as an even con though, which makes you clear the entire room to be sure you've killed the placeholder. Rest assured that only one shark in the room is capable spawning as gigadon, or the reef, it's not random like PoFire nameds are.  Gidadon drops the &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=27318&gt;Shield of Coral&lt;/A&gt; (DRU, Common), &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=22899&gt;Coral Headed Mace&lt;/A&gt; (CLR, Common), &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=26038&gt;Opalescent Two Handed Sword&lt;/A&gt; (SHD, Rare), and &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=21885&gt;Sharkspine Club&lt;/A&gt; (CLR DRU SHM, Rare). <br />
<br />
2) &lt;A HREF=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12431&gt;Hammertooth&lt;/A&gt;: Hammertooth is (gasp) a hammerhead shark. Exact same situation as Gigadon, however his room is to the south. From the camp you go south at the fork instead of north, and south again at the next fork. There is a static shark here as well as a wanderer. This room also has 8 wandering sharks in it, and the exact same placeholder setup, though it is called &quot;a reef hammerhead&quot; when it cons blue. Again, if you see that mob up, it's the only one you need to kill and you can work on clearing other areas/spawns. The sponge thing right at the entrance to the room can be a trap just like the others. Hammertooth hits for the same as Gigadon, but he flurries instead of rampaging. He drops the same loot as Gigadon.<br />
<br />
For both these rooms, your best bet for pulling is to either have bard do it (duh) or have a SK, Necro, or Monk pull and feign, then you pull the last remaining mob back to the group (pull using malos). The pathing is surprisingly good, and it's hard to lose a mob really. Failing that, if you have a cleric or enchanter, they can pacify 2 to 3 of the sharks and making the break a little less shaky.<br />
<br />
Every mob before the drop down is mezzable, barring any named. Nothing summons either. If you have crowd control don't be too squeamish about bringing two, as you can just keep one mezzed fairly easily (they aren't too resistant after malos.)<br />
<br />
3) &lt;A HREF=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12783&gt;Razorfin&lt;/A&gt;: To the east of the camp is the first large room in the zone, with many wandering mobs, all of which con blue, except potentially the placeholder which will usually con even. If you see a level 65 &quot;a greater piranha&quot; (cons even) then that is the placholder. It can spawn as a normal, blue con one though. If they're all blue, simply pull all the piranhas in the eastern half of the room to be sure, as there's only 4 or so of them in there. I'm not sure how hard razorfin hits, since surprisingly I was never hit by him ;) I hear it's in the 1100ish range. Razorfin was partially slowable, so he's definitely not as hard as the named sharks. Razorfin also drops the same 4 items as both named sharks.<br />
<br />
A benefit to pulling this room is you can sometimes spawn dire charmable mobs (A young sea turtle, for instance), which crank out some nice DPS if you have an enchanter or druid along.<br />
<br />
8) &lt;A HREF=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11311&gt;Triloun Seer&lt;/A&gt;: Head as if you're going towards gigadon's room, but go east at the 2nd fork instead of west. There's a large room here with a trap near the entrance, and many roaming trilouns inside. Not advisable to pull much here if Grioihin the Wise is up. Promising people you'll pull trilouns to get them pieces for thier gate necklace is a good way to entice people to camp this zone with you. He is an enchanter, and most likely hits for the same 1-1.2k everything else does (Was too busy trying to nuke me for me to actually get an accurate representation of his melee damage). Just be wary because he'll come hasted. This guy drops the &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=25986&gt;Plankton Laced Greatsword&lt;/A&gt; (WAR PAL SHD RNG, Common),  &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20889&gt;Pearlescent Gemstone&lt;/A&gt; (MAG, ?Unknown Rarity), and &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=21852&gt;Oblong Seashell&lt;/A&gt; (WAR RNG MNK BRD ROG, ?Unknown Rarity).  It's unknown what the placeholder for him is. I don't recall anything in that room being blue.<br />
<br />
Camp 2: Swordfang/Ferocious/Turtle/Keeper.<br />
<br />
There's really no convenient name for this camp. I usually got stuck doing it when either 1) Someone else was at sharks, or 2) I had a whiny bard in tow who wanted a shot at thier weapon. There's only one mob at this camp who drops the sharkspine club, but this camp is more likely to make more people happy.  Once you set up in the tunnel, the first mob you're going to pull is the static frog to the east of you. From that point, you can pull more frogs... The benefit of killing them is they drop &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=21740&gt;Oil of a Frog&lt;/A&gt; which is used in making a &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29032&gt;Ceramic Water Sprinkler of Marr&lt;/A&gt; which sell extremely well, or are useful for guildies without mana pres (or yourself!) Also there's &lt;A HREF=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12784&gt;a named frog&lt;/A&gt; there who is about the same difficulty as Razorfin, however he drops no loot (he can drop a Rune though)<br />
<br />
Sharks are significantly better exp than this camp, as well.<br />
<br />
(Numbers correspond to the attached map)<br />
<br />
5) &lt;A HREF=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12780&gt;Swordfang&lt;/A&gt;: Swordfang spawns on the north end of the room south of where you are camping. His placeholder is usually a blue con reef swordfish, though it can be a level 65 one (Notice a trend here?). You're going to want to enter this room from the northeast corner (go south past the frogs room and hang a sharp left), and his PH should be wandering near the entrance to the room. Swordfang hits for 1k, and is a warrior unlike other swordfish, so he can't backstab. He's &quot;Mostly&quot; slowable as well, so tanking him isn't too bad at all. He does flurry. There are a few traps in the room also. Again watch out for sponges, each one can spawn mini fish which are level 61 and hit in the 400ish range. Swordfang has the same drops as the named sharks, and razorfin, though he's probably the easiest of all the mobs who drop the club.<br />
<br />
6) &lt;A HREF=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12430&gt;Ferocious Barracuda&lt;/A&gt;: Same situation as swordfang, but he's in the southern end of the room. Placeholder is a blue con reef barracuda, but it can spawn as an even con normal one. For pulling him, you should work your way south along the eastern wall pulling what you can, until you can get a clear shot. Like Swordfang, the Ferocious Barracuda is partially slowable, and hits in the 1100 range. He can drop a &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20887&gt;Coral Shard&lt;/A&gt; (ENC, Common) or &lt;A HREF=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=24594&gt;Coral Hilted Shortsword&lt;/A&gt; (BRD, Rare). I've seen at least 5 shards drop personally (one of which I looted on the outside chance it was inventory clickable). I don't think there are any of the bard weapon on my server :(<br />
<br />
7) &lt;A HREF=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=12781&gt;Triloun Egg Keeper&lt;/A&gt;: A named mephit. I've never seen him to be honest, but he spawns in the room with the mephits south of the static spawn frog near this camp. He drops the same loot as the Triloun Seer, and I'd assume he hits for the same. Let it be noted that there are many traps in his room, so going inside isn't a very good idea.<br />
<br />
4) &lt;A HREF=http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11025&gt;Monstrous Sea Turtle&lt;/A&gt;: This guy spawns in the first room, on the east side (Opposite where Razorfin does). Assuming you have enough DPS to clear the Swordfang/Fero room, you can move west at the south end of that room, kill a couple triloun champions, and pull the placeholder (An even con Greater Sea Turtle). Once again, the placeholder can be a normal, blue con turtle like the others in the room. Usually best to leave this one to a bard to pull, since the only reason you'd really bother with him is for the bard sword. He can also be pulled to the sharks camp, albiet with a bit more difficulty. The Monstrous Sea Turtle hits for the same as Razorfin, and I'm not aware of him being able to rampage/flurry. To the best of my knowledge he is slightly slowable, though I could be wrong. I never bothered with him much. He drops the same loot as the Ferocious Barracuda.<br />
<br />
Final Notes, oddities, tips, and advice <br />
<br />
1) The best way to get people here to actually camp this zone is to promise them loot. People will argue that the water piece for the gate necklace is the hardest to get due to the fact that nobody comes here. Most melees will be happy to help you out here in exchange for you pulling some trilouns. You're after the club, and you'll see several cleric maces and druid shields before your club drops, so entice a cleric (even a bot) or a druid to come along, because a 100 hp/mana primary weapon that doesn't suck is nothing to sneeze at, nor is a 40ac shield with 85hp/mana, awesome saves, and clicky evac. Decent shields are hard to come by in the elementals, and I know a lot of my druid guildies were using Tactician's Bulwarks before people camping this zone got them one of these.<br />
<br />
2) The experience at sharks is surprisingly good. If you are tired of the ****-brown of Plane of Earth, and the constant red of fire makes your optic nerve want to detach from your retina, the cool blues and dark and mysterious tunnels can be a pleasant change of scenery. PoWater is one of the nicer looking planes. I would rate sharks somewhat below PoFire tables as far as experience is concerned. It's leaps and bounds better than PoE trash.<br />
<br />
3) Sometimes when pulling Hammertooth's room, if the puller dies or feigns, it's possible for sharks in his room to wander north randomly and not reset, eventually stopping somewhere between Grioihin the Wise's room and the lair of Coirnav Himself. I had to petition once and get a GM to revert them when the placeholder got stuck down there :( be wary when using FD to break the south room. If you notice the sharks are swimming north instead of back south to the room, send a sacrificial lamb in to agro all of them, and die in the room so they'll go back where they should be. This is a fairly rare occurrance however, so don't fret about it too much.<br />
<br />
4) Once the spawns are broken up, shamans make excellent pullers in PoWater. Tag the mob with malos and high tail it back to the group, where a stun or darkness will most likely land and get it off you (or Incite), so you can promptly slow it and get busy.<br />
<br />
5) Virulent Paralysis is your friend. When I was in a group with just me, a rogue, a warrior, and a druid, I was stuck being the puller. If you get one add, hit it with VP and it will not only throw the mob back (and up) considerably farther than it would on land, but it'll most likely hold for at least a minute or more while you get the other mob under control.  It takes balls of steel to break the rooms as a shaman, but it's doable. Detrimental haste helps immensely :D<br />
<br />
6) The more you hunt here, the more this zone grows on you. People who actually bother coming here often tend to be more mature and patient.  This is a great zone to enjoy with a group of friends, and is very rewarding.  People who refuse to come here... well you probably didn't want to group with them anyways ;)<br />
<br />
7) Traps: Usually it will be a placeholder so even if you get close to a sponge, it's not very likely that one will actually be there. Sometimes the trap-spawned mobs can see invis (though not usually) so take that into consideration. They tend to depop after 10 minutes if not agro'd.<br />
<br />
8) Be sure to check for roamers before starting pulling repops, it can be deadly. Spend some time here and you'll get it down to a science.<br />
<br />
9) Coincidentally, the classes most likely to want a rare drop from named here make an extremely good trio to handle camping. Bard/SK/Shaman is a great team, and if your gear is good you can probably keep both shark PHs, razorfin, and the turtle all down with just these 3 classes once you've spent some time here and learned the zone. The club, sword, and bard poker are sadly very rare, but when you finally get it it will make it all the more special :)<br />
<br />
Personal Experience <br />
<br />
It took me 33 AAs spent in this zone to see my club drop. For some people this is an incredible number, for others it is not. I'm still not sick of this zone yet. Hammertooth is the mob that dropped it for me, and strangely enough, Razorfin popped not even an hour later and my SK guildie scored his sword.<br />
<br />
Self buffed, with Swift like the Wind and FA, and a 41% haste item, I average around 45dps when tanking, and 50-55 when not. I augmented my club with a Silver Flecked Crystal of Agony (540 points in EC) which is a 125 poison DD. The actual proc on the club seems to go off 2-3 times per fight, and getting crits with it is nice. The Bile proc from the augment procs about twice per minute.<br />
<br />
I haven't had Rabid Bear long enough to do some extensive parsing, but it seems to kick the DPS up into the 70s, possibly the 80s. With raid buffs, rizlona's, and SoP/SoT and more Vengeance gear, I wonder if I could push 90? :) It's a great weapon, and very fun to be able to smack things around some and actually do some decent damage. With 280 strength, my max hit is 134. This thing easily outdamages any non-PoTime cleric hammer.<br />
<br />
Good luck getting yours! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Regrua Overlord is a seriously tough mob. I managed to kill him with 5 people (the puller [necro] died). Paladin (Tank), Me, Cleric, 2nd Necro, Enchanter.<br />
<br />
He hits for 1250, Flurries (a fair ammount), and has somewhere between 60 and 70k hit points. He's capable of 1 rounding anyone with less than 8k hit points, so be very careful. Slightly Slowable. This is probably the most intense fight I've ever done with 1 group. 10% aa for killing him with 5 people though! :D<br />
<br />
Regarding getting down to Crabs/Slugs:<br />
<br />
You're going to want to go like you're heading to the swordfang camp, but instead head north instead of east. Eventually you'll get to another fork (with another triloun champion nearby). Kill it and from there you can either fight down, or invis. There's a drop down when you go north. Swim down the tunnel, and you'll probably pass a squid. At the fork you want to go left, and that will take you to the Ofossaa/Hydrotha prep/fight area. From there you are going to swim north until you see a fishlord guy and the ground starts to slope down more. Halt here and make sure EVERYONE is together. Regruas (Crabs) often see invis. Hraquis (slugs) almost never do (I haven't encountered any that do).  Ofossaa (obviously) sees invis, and is not to be ****ed with.<br />
<br />
When you're ready, swim down the slope very slowly, and you're going to see a house thing with a hraquis inside it. You may also see a wandering regrua near the entrance. Wait until he moves further into the cave before you move in and engage him.<br />
<br />
Regruas come in 3 flavors: Sentries, Defenders, and Guardians.  Sentries hit the hardest, 1262 max (quad) but are mostly slowable. Sentries also see invisibility. There are 3 of them, and they wander the &quot;ring&quot; around the bottom of the lair. The defenders and guardians hit for 1150 quad, and are partially slowable. The difference between this camp and sharks is Regruas Innately Quad. They don't double/triple like sharks do. This means that you can expect to get clobbered for upwards of 3-4k in one round if you get sloppy. These are not mobs you take lightly, they do about the same (or more) damage than Castle 2 mobs in PoFire.<br />
<br />
The experience on a per mob basis is better also. Expect to get 5% to a mind blowing 7% per kill with 6 people. Just expect slower pulls, so it evens out.<br />
<br />
Once you're in the tunnel, you are going to move south until you see a cave off to the west. Inside this  room is where the Overlord spawns. I think Krizzik the Mighty could spawn in there too, but he's usually never up because he's quickly ganked for easy to obtain molds on my server.<br />
<br />
Inside the room are Six mobs, all regruas. I don't have enough experience here to know which one is the Overlord's PH, but it's always the same mob every time (I.E. one mob, not a possible spawn out of all of them).<br />
<br />
Lulling this room is impossible, and breaking it is going to involve 1) Feign Death, 2) Real Death, 3) A combination of one of the above and Root/Snare. Bring a cleric or don't come here. A necro to feign and res a cleric is also highly reccomended, because clearing back down here sucks, and you're on a harsh timer should the group wipe (quite possible).<br />
<br />
The best place to camp is either the corner north of the room, or on the slope south of the room. I'd choose the slope because you can see when the wanderer is nearby (he stops below you and in sight before moving in). I don't know if these things are mezzable, but you can pretty much count on a wipe if you get 2 and can't root/mez the other one.<br />
<br />
Once you've pulled the room, a good idea would be to pull wandering hraquis from ofossa's room (just be very careful) as they drop bricks of E'cian ice, which are used for armor. Regruas drop claws which make excellent food (and they are common drops, often two per). Hraquis also can drop kelp which is for the tailored caster armor.<br />

Again if you plan on going down there, I'd reccomend bringing a bit more than a group (8-12 people) for your first trip. It's definitely on the edge, but very exciting. Once it's all split, A shaman makes the best puller here due to the ability to have a mob malos'd before he hits the camp.<br />
<br />
Also Divine Stun + Rush to judgement 3 owns here. Paladins can't use thier normal stuns on these mobs like they can on sharks, so plan on them taking considerably more damage than they would fighting normal mobs. Actually I'd forget the paladin tank altogether unless they're in full elemental with 9k or better HP.<br />
<br />
Good luck, the wand seems to be the common drop (I've seen 3, 0 swords). Damn lucky casters :(<br />
<br />
Graphic is the same as a wand of the ice storm.<br />

BTW here's what a sharkspine looks like:<br />

I made some edits to the original, and submitted to the cabinet. It basically has a pic of the item in the thread, explains traps a bit better, and mentiones to be careful of 1 shark roamer.<br />
<br />
I'll also try to update the map a bit more with the pathing of mobs and more trap locations.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions about the camp or are attempting it for the first time and need some pointers, shoot me a tell at seventh.Grizlor<br />

Once you get some experience here and get the timing and stuff down, it's an absolute blast to duo this camp with a shadowknight. Simply call in the cavalry should a named pop :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Great thanks for the info =-) Looks like I should try getting my girlfriend and some friends down there for her mace before going for my club =-p I knew it was going to be a much harder fight/area as I've talked to some guildies about it a little before. And the club doesn't look too bad, though I prefer 1hs weapons (druid), don't find many of them with good procs though, especially damage ones =-( Shame no particle effect, kind of fond of them hehe. Sharkspine would be a damn nice item to have until a Hammer of Hours though =-)<br />
<br />
Thank you once again for your wonderful guide(s), gives me renewed desire to get in there and actually try camping the club/mace.<br />
<br />
[Edit] It's a good thing the mace is more common then the sword though, lol. The sword is kind of cute, but not that many people would want it for much more then a toy =-(<br />
<br />
Also it seems the Regrua Protector can drop both mace + sword, any idea on his spawn position?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'd rather have a sharkspine for meleeing than a hammer of hours. The proc doesn't contribute *THAT* much to DPS... I'd say about 75-80% of the damage from the club comes from melee hits, and the hammer has a bout  2/3 the ratio. Only advantage of the Hammer is the focus effect (which rocks) :(<br />
<br />
Regarding the protector: If you look at a map of the zone (like on EQAtlas or similar) the Protector spawns in a room symmetrically opposite of the Overlord's room on the &quot;Lower Loop&quot;.<br />
<br />
Location of Overlord's room is around (450, 250) whereas the Protector is around (450, -500)<br />

Though I'm also not sure how well my DPS would compare to yours, as I don't have FA, though I could have Night's Dark Terror constantly, or Illusion: Werewolf, so probably around 950-1000 ATK once I got 1hb up.<br />
<br />
Hammer also has the better look(in my opinion), and the stats/focus effect hehe. The Hammer crits would also be more fun.<br />
<br />
[Edit] Lowered estimated attack after going over numbers again =-p Think I was remembering with FA/beastlord buff hehe.<br />

<br />
Anyways, Just make sure you check for the roamer before pulling anything when you're down there. He wanders a lot. If you can dedicate someone to looking below, he stops at the bottom of the slope for a bit, giving you ample time for Preparation.<br />
<br />
I'm just shy of 1k ATK with focus (or over it with Bih Li) without FA on, hopefully I'll have a Veng IV aug to slap on my clay bracers soon :)<br />
<br />
FA is getting really cheap, it's worth it to snag it for like 5k, you don't have to tell anyone you have it, just use it on yourself :)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, the named crabs can drop specs, and possibly even runes. Score!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hastily done or not, it's nice =-) Thanks again for all of the information, in the original guide and the Regrua area. Looks like if I can find out which are the PHs, might be able to pull Overlord + Protector PHs and increase the chance of named per round and all. Either way, good to know where they are and maybe get down there and start camping =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I dunno if you'd be able to pull both PHs with just one group, Crabs have a LOT of hit points, and splitting both rooms and keeping them that way would be indeed an impressive challenge. We didn't have the DPS to manage 2 rooms and keep them clear, so we just pulled trash until the roamer repopped. It would be a very intense group for sure if you could keep 2 rooms down. Maybe with time gear it's possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hehe, it's not that I can't buy FA or something. I'm a druid not a shaman, so my only form of self attack buff is Firefist/wolf forms, woo! And can't use wolf forms indoors(Except LDoN one, which I don't have), and don't stack with Night's Dark Terror(though that wouldn't be self..but always with an enchanter so!). Hence the comment about druids having a lower skill cap too. I'd have 25 points less of 1hb then you, which means more misses and stuff, so my pure melee DPS would probably be a decent bit less then yours.<br />

[Edit] And fair enough on only being able to keep one room down, one PH &gt; 0 PHs =-p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Oh yeah, I forgot... It's probably a good idea for you to know that while the Regrua Overlord flurries, the Protector ramps. Have someone who isn't healing and isn't tanking pull him (which is automatic rampage when the tank gets agro). Preferrably a monk, or heavy plate class.  Very easy to lose someone important (like the cleric?) to the rampage, so be very careful with him. He's less likely of dropping your tank but much more likely to wreak havoc on unprepared people.</div></div><hr />

You're not gonna be able to duo it with a SK who has 5200 unbuffed HP, 1450ac, and &lt;200 AAs without a lot of downtime. I'd reccomend Shadowknight, Shaman, and druid/cleric (there to loot a freebie mace/shield). Most clerics and bot clerics in my guild have the mace, and I think every elemental flagged druid on my server has the shield...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Again some stuff on the map isn't exact. The roaming sharks roam a bit more than the paths I indicate, as well. It just generally indicates where you'll find the roamers. Regarding the champion, might actually path there. I never went through the wise room because nobody actually kills &quot;groin&quot; on my server. his AE is too much of a pain :/<br />

... So he's usually up, hence inability to go through there =b<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">in terms of the look, i think the sharkspine club is a lot nicer.  everyone and their mom has the HoH/Hammer of the Timeweaver/Coirnav Mace/HoHV graphic on their weapon hehe.  uniqueness is nice in eq.  in fact i think i have access to characters with 3/4 of those lol.  the only thing that gets me about this camp is the amount of time it takes, certainly not for the faint of patience as you said, when Hammer of Hours is a relatively common drop compared the ridiciulousness of TA.  tho lately i've been desperately wanting a weapon and my patience with Saryrn has been fading considerably, not sure i'd be willing to commit the time that the camp requires unless my sk twink somehow had access to the zone to come in and loot the sword should it drop hehe.  if i were to do this, though, what would you reccomend in terms of the maximum efficiency to farm the mace, and perhaps the opalescent sword?  retired sk friend i always wanted to get him his hehe.  <br />
<br />
my gear isn't anything special really, but i can bring some pretty hoss people should the need arise: ranger, sk, paladin, monk, rogue, cleric, other shm, etc.  what i mean is to not exp it at all, kill the least mobs possible, just kill the phs and enjoy afk bliss. what setup of classes would you reccomend?  1 fd puller/bard and myself?  a cleric needed?  etc.<br />
<br />
i'd searched the sk forums for a guide like this and it's very well done, thanks for sharing all your experience and knowledge w/ us.  funny that the shaman forums have a better guide to camping these than the sk forums since the mobs drop their pet weapon hehe.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Awesome guide.  Had been planning on going here for a while with a few guildies to farm this stuff.  Went this past week with a few guildies and hit the Hammertooth, Gigadon spots.  Had 5 names in about a 4 hour period.  3 Hammertooth, 2 Gigadon.  Ended up with 3 druid shields, 1 coral headed mace, and 1 sharkspine.  First shark spine went to other shaman in group.  Figured no biggie, I'll get mine.  Went back the next 2 days for a total of well over 20 hours of farmage.  I lost count of how many  place holders we got.  Needless to say my luck is not helping out on this matter, still no sharkspine.  But, I WILL NOT GIVE UP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I doubt this camp is boxable, it would really suck.<br />
<br />
Like I said, Shaman/SK with decent gear can at least keep 2 PHs (Not sure if you'd consider razor + a shark or both sharks to be easier)... with some luck you might be able to kill all 3 in the western camp.<br />
<br />
It's not bad experience either, so just enjoy yourself, it's not too hardcore with a solid group, nice casual pulling and good scenery</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">few tidbits.<br />
<br />
1) Yeah Club is crazy rare.  Think I've gotten 10+ Cleric Hammers 10+ Druid Shields, 1 SK Pet, 1 Club *rar*<br />
<br />
2) Named in POF aren't ph by &quot;anything&quot;.  distinct Phs there too but most wander so hard as hell to find.<br />
<br />
3) Trackers are your friend.<br />
A lot of times when doing this on track-sort normal.  I'd go in after a server reset and hit a named anyway.  But soon as I was sure I killed a PH or a Named.  I despawned/respawned Dog-Dog.  Way track works on &quot;normal&quot; is that newer spawns on top.  So once I got the PH/Roamers down consistantly.  I'd set Dog-Dog back on top of the list.  This meant with a quick track check I could see if I was getting a respawn or not.<br />
((anything above Dog was respawn)<br />
<br />
((this same trick works great in POF too if you wait things out with a tracker))<br />
<br />
Using Dog-Dog as your own personal tracking bloodhound booster works great</div></div><hr />

Taking this road allows you to have only one wandering champion to avoid until you're down to the Hydrotha camp , BUT be aware that there is a slighty chance for him to be waiting at the tunnel entrance of Grioihin room while he wanders .<br />
<br />
About the club , I saw in 6 nameds : 2 SK sword , 3 shield ,  1 cleric mace and zero club .<br />

<br />
Regarding the first series of named you described (i.e the shammy and sk weapon drops)...<br />
<br />
Do you need a full group to take them out or can they be done /w less ?<br />
<br />
We'd be talking about a warr,sk,cleric,shammy combo, /w from 275 to 500 AA each, we can handle Vxed and Tipt if that's an indication of our level.<br />
<br />
Ygnir<br />
7th Hammer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">A 9k SK can tank the named. I can't really compare the dps they put out to anything, but quad 1250 and slightly slowable should give you a fair idea. You don't need defensive, you just need solid healing and good DPS. the named have about 70k hit points. I'll talk to you ingame, and give you a tour of the zone if I'm not busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Ygnir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Being the nosey peeps we are, we zoned in today and gave it a shot for an hour or 2, just 4 of us... Killed a named, Hammersomthing, fairly easy kill. Dropped a rune and a druid shield which we gave to a friend )<br />
<br />
Noticed the 'roamers' don't roam so much.. they almost statics with some occasional movement. Camped in the first tunnel to the left after entering water as you described. Found it to be a tranquil and relaxing zone, will most surely go there more often :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">a decent way to pull the named out of a fully-popped room is to invis, swim on top of the sponge trap outside his room, spawn the trap and flee.  then have a FD class agro the trap mobs, swim back toward camp a bit, and flop.  the named has a huge radius of social agro, whereas the other sharks in the room for some reason don't chain social agro off the named.  so you'll get however many trap mobs + the named, who can then be tagged and split without too much hassle (or a substantial amount less hassle than splitting the 7 sharks from his room, or whatever).<br />
<br />
this strategy is for gigadon and razorfin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Hail,<br />
<br />
/bump :D <br />
I wasn't flagged for the EP's when this guide came out, nor was my gear such that I thought I could handle the camp even if I was.  Now I am, and while my gear isn't amazing, I think I could handle it the way Grizlor describes it after reviewing it again this week.  Recently getting the clay golems bracelet w/ 41% haste has put the Sharkspine off of my 'someday' list and onto my 'I want now' list. ;) <br />
<br />
What I'd like to know before dragging people to PoWater:<br />
1. Can the regular sharks be charmed by an enchanter?<br />
2.  If charm works in PoWater, would a shaman/ench duo for killing the club-dropping named work when you don't have a 9k+ tank available?  I'm married to an EP flagged enchanter is why I ask. :D   Most of my 9k+ SK tank friends are in busy raiding guilds who might not be in the mood to camp a club with me for however long it would take to get one, even with the possibility of getting a sword.  I can buy my spouse dinner or give backrubs or something. ;) <br />
<br />
3. What's the minimum group (w/o a charmed pet) for Gigadon, Razorfin, Hammertooth, and Swordfang to be doable?  I'm not so much worried about camping the placeholders, but more concerned with being able to slay the named once we get them to pop.  Would SHM/SK/DRU work?  SHM/PAL/DRU?  Is a cleric on the named a must-have?  Is 3 people enough DPS considering I'll be part of the trio (&amp; relatively low DPS)?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the guide Grizlor, it is really amazing. :cool: <br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
