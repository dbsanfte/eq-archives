<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ZernSaintwinter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So there we are in SF. Silly Shaman goes out and pulls, snatches a wurm and runs back to group. turns around and finds himself face to face with Named wyvern! What does silly shaman do? Every thing wrong of course. Instead of leading said mob to zone line he tries to root it. Silly shaman, root doesn't work on this mob, just like it didn't work the last time and the time before that. Sooo Silly Shaman(SS) tries to slow it! Good idea except that slow doesn't work on named mob just like it didn't the last time and the time before that. So SS decides it time to run for the zone. SS takes 2 steps and...... Returning to home point, LOADING,PLEASE WAIT.<br />
<br />
 Our SS in now at his Bind point. Where is that, u ask? OT down in the gorge out side of HS. SS hasn't changed his Bind yet like he demaned of his wife! Ok, SS returns to his senses and mems and cast invis on him self. then sits down and mems the rest of his spells, inclouding sow incase he has to run for it. Meanwhile group is looking for a rez. Does SS stay still and wait for Rez? Nope! He decides he can just run out of this place with invis on. I mean after all it's the zone right next door, right??<br />
<br />
 Off our SS goes headed to the ramp to get out, does a /rude to the mobs that can't see him and snickers. a few sec's later SS relizes that he hasn't casted sow on himself and is moveing to slow. SS now stops and cast sow on himself and of course losing invis. But spell is intrupped!! SS doesn't take the time to look around and make sure no mobs are standing next to him. Now does he root mob? No he takes off runing with out the sow. amazingly he almost makes it out of the gorge before...... Returning to home point, LOADING,PLEASE WAIT.<br />
<br />
 /sigh<br />
<br />
 Darkstar tells u: are u rdy for a rez?<br />
You tell darkstar: Yes! In the name of the Gods! Please! <br />
while SS is Loading, please wait, he wonders why he didn't just sit tight and let his friends get him rez.....Silly Shaman!<br />
<br />
 Shamy LFG! ..... anyone? ..... no??<br />
