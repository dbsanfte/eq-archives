<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am curious as to whether the Ancient Spells ever made it live.  Would really just like to know if they are in-game now and don't give a rats rear end where you found it.<br />
<br />
I know druids supposedly had Ancient spells dropping in seb, but that was a mistake and they were removed.  It would be nice to have a few more spells to look forward to :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So far we've found absolutely nothing.  I think since they were dropping in Seb has something to do with that fact~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They are live, just no one has killed the dropper. Only one way to find out for sure tho, someone will before long I imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Take this with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
  I seem to remember reading here, that someone heard reports of some ancient spells droping of aryronar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just read today that someone remembered reading here that someone else heard reports of some ancient spells dropping off Aryonar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I vaguely remember the Aary ancient spell incident.  I think it was ultimately decided that the person mistook a regular spell for an ancient spell with a similar name.  That is just what my old college roomate's brother-in-law told me, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">But my ex-girlfriend's roomate's friend's uncle's father's co-worker's son said....  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">thats why i said take it with a grain of salt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They were dropping by mistake off Broog once on my server. A lot of them had the wrong class listed on the scrolls, or the listed classes couldn't scribe the scrolls. A mage did manage to scribe his Ancient pet buff, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">After surveying quite a few of the L60+ mobs around I am betting that these spells are coded to drop off random vendors in Rivervale :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My sister's cousin's aunt's boyfriend's neighbor's dog's best friend heard from his teacher's brother's butcher's nephew that they were not dropping at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That's a nice thought Jenamdar, but your statement begs the question:  What mobs haven't yet been killed?  <br />
Are there some uber secret baddie mobs we haven't heard of yet?  <br />
Oh, and by putting ancient spells on these particular uber hidden mobs, that will balance casters?  <br />
<br />
Verant lied as usual.</div></div><hr />

*cough*VT*cough*  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Think of a mob that used to be killed all the time, and has not been killed now for months. There lies your answer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grogsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">For one night they dropped off Brogg in Sebilis, but an emergency patch that morning fixed it.     One of our wizards managed to scribe one of the Ancient spells(which completely owns in pvp), but unfortunately he dropped abunch of druid spells after that and we dont have druids on our team ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You ever gonna log onto VZ again Groggy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I always find it disturbing when people know what a mob that is not in the game drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They're in the Warders loot tables... DUH! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">And warders are in the game!  :)<br />
<br />
Per the last patch, VI accidentally reset the warders, and they are spawning.  They noticed this, and promptly GM death-touched all of them, and are keeping them killed until next patch (per my admittedly limited understanding).<br />
<br />
ST has some changes too.  Invis doesn't work anymore.  Everything sees invis, so no easy CR, and if you want to kill all 3 remaining named for primals, you have to clear out the front and clear all the way to the Final Arbiter.  :p<br />
<br />
Talk about an ass change.  :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hey, while I think of it, can anyone tell me if the Ancient Spells are flagged no drop from the warders loot table?  It'd be nice to know (if they ever start dropping) if we can pick them up for others if we get extra spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ancient :Feral Avatar drops in ST of named mobs and is no drop , as for Ancient :Scourge of Nife no clue haven t heard of anyone having this spell yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Primal Avatar drops in ST, not Ancient Feral Avatar.<br />
<br />
Think AFA is +120 to atc, str and agi instead of 100 for Avatar/Primal Avatar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Doh that right me bad ) well i have no clue then I,ll slink to the corner now</div></div><hr />
