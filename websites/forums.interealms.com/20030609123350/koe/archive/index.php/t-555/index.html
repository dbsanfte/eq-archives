<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just some info for others.. Our normal Wed night crew (used to be lezzard night with some KoE and some friends of Bear and I and Bear's wife) are relocating from our long haunt of the Lake and Warsliks Woods to our first dugeon in Sol A, where we plan on staying for a couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
I believe most of us are now 26 give or take a level and we generally get going about 7 CST and play until just after 10 CST every Wed night. <br />
<br />
Any KoE or petitioner is welcome to join us, although tonight might be a bit slow as we get everyone relocated. We generally have anywhere from one group to two groups and there is certainly plenty to kill in Sol A. <br />
<br />
Look me up as Calon or Bearan as Griss and we can give you more information. This is a weekly event and a good chance to meet people in the guild you don't normally see. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Or Bemidian as Beridian or Draganite. :)<br />
<br />
I am going to port Draganite over there. Beridian is in BB so I'll either wait for a port or take the boat early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/who all keep 20 40 <br />
<br />
and noone was on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We decided to go to the Hate run last night. Too good to pass up. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mydain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When /Anon is on it is hard to find folks in your range..<br />
<br />
Does /Roleplay hide the level as well?<br />
<br />
I think I will be putting a suggestion in to the EQ message boards to see if they can make it so you are only Anon to non-guildies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When running Anon, you will not show up for any /who all keepers filter. <br />
<br />
When running roleplay, you will show up for a /who all keepers, but not for a number range. <br />
<br />
Guild policy is to at least run in roleplay (we are proud to display our name), but it is not a requirement and it is understandible if you wish to run anon for either raid purposes or for a break. <br />
<br />
Sorry Helek.. as Bem said; the Hate raid was a golden opportunity. I am itching to get to SolA with Calon and we hope to resume action next Wed night.. <br />
<br />
Both Terackia and Lassha were on last night and did play. Bomar and Morssia did not make it on last night either. (Those mentioned are not members of the guild; but are a staple of the Wed night crew).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would like to join you guys on these runs in the future if you have room. This Wed may be bad if the Leafs go to game 7. If they win tonight I can make it. Let me know if you need an UB3R 25 cleric with 199 wisdom :) I would like to level my alt up a bit. If you are full up np. Just let me know guys.<br />

Proud Member of KoE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kilstorm (and anyone else) is welcome to join us. Sometimes we have more than 6 and run two groups; often close to each other for mutual support and sometimes we don't have 6. This continues to be our plan.<br />
<br />
This Wed, we plan on starting on SolA and all are very excited about going there, particularly the ones that have never been. <br />
<br />
Tenative itenerary (subject to change of course) is to stay in Sol A for a couple of levels and move back to Dalnirs when most of us are 29 (particularly the casters).<br />
<br />
We usually play from 7 CST to just after 10 CST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kly this sounds like a good time...I'm not sure if you know it but I have a alt necro that is at lvl 26 right now too. I barely get on much as is so I don't play him often. I'll look you guys up...His name is Yimmlaar FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Overflow will make the trip to Halas to get his spells this evening.<br />
he will be able to level in Sol A on Friday and be able to put those to use for you guys.<br />
Hes about two bubbles away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cyrssi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When 31-33 isn't too high, please let me know :) Brigadiir (31 chanter) and Elandarielle (33 Rogue) are itching to get out again, and I'd love to work either of them with you guys on Wed. nights.</div></div><hr />
