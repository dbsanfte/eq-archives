<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">recently hit 58 scribed canni4 and now cant really decide if it is better than canni 3.  the mana to hp ration not much differnce cast time is longer, that is what really bugs me but i am just curious what does everyone else think?  canni 3 or canni 4?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Canny4 is essentially identical to casting Canny3 twice.<br />
<br />
The advantage to Can4 over Can3 is that you don't have to hit the button as many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">58 levels, give your fingers a rest, cann4!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont know if it is only my overactive imagination, but i feel like i have a lower fizzlerate on canni 4 than i did when i used canni 3.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm this or draw me of out my deluded state?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Canni 4 fizzles MUCH less than Canni 3.  By far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye Canni 3 was plagued by fizzles.  If you consider the fizzle rates and the number of times you have to mash the damn mouse button, Canni 4 just kills Canni 3 imho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Canni4 is also better in another way.  It has just about the same casting time as canni3, the reason you can get teo cann3's off is because of the recast delay.   Because they cast about as fast, take two shaman and one casts cann4 and one casts cann3 at the same time once, the one casting canni4 will get greater mana.  This advantage can be very useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The HP/Mana ratio is better with Can 3 but you can get mana much faster using Can 4.<br />
<br />
I allways use Can4 cause getting mana as fast as possible is what i want.<br />
<br />
You can get 200 mana much faster with Can4 than with Can3, the time you saved you can med or combat or whatever.<br />
<br />
If you have enough time and dont care to hit your button MANY times you may use Can3 but i never used Can3 after i got Can4.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 60 and have torpor there is no question that you will use Can4 (until you got your AA skill Can running that is hehe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One thing I've noticed alot lately is my inability to SIT down during a raid.  You can't sit during Fear breaks, you sure can't sit during Kael or ToV pulls and after you slow/debuff you sure as hell can't sit.  So I'd just be standing there chain casting Cani3 to try to get mana.  Very much looking forward to Cani4 for this.<br />
<br />
I also have all the rangers I hang with to heal me when I Cani while buffing ;)  It's better than a fungi tunic ;P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aside from swapping spells, why would a shaman ever sit?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What Glor said!  Why sit?<br />
<br />
Look at it this way.  Sitting at 60 is something like 25 mana a tic.  Add in KEI and mental clarity, and you are still at 43 a tic.<br />
<br />
With Canna 4, if you have torpor or someone healing you, you can get off about 1 canna 4 a tic.  That's 82 mana a tic.  With KEI and mental clarity, it's more like 100 mana a tic.<br />
<br />
Why sit???<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&gt; What Glor said! Why sit? <br />
<br />
Because we still only have 8 spell gems, and we're CONSTANTLY being nagged during the fights for x, y, z buffs in addition to the debuffs and cures (now that mob slows can be cured...) and root and canni and slow and chloro that take up 4 slots permanently?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fenira is lvl 57  No Torpor  /boggle<br />
<br />
Dat is why he sit...  he/she be a guud hard working shaman maximizing his/her mana recovery.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Daxon Fatebringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/nod Radag<br />
<br />
If not 60, you need to sit for good mana regen.  Canni 4 and regrowth (standing) makes for slow mana regen compared to sitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I might be wrong since it's been a while but I'm pretty sure that cann 4 is double the dmg and double the mana returned compaired to cann 3. The over all cast time for 1 cann 4 with the recast time is slightly less than 2 cann 3's with thier recast times. <br />
<br />
Also as noted it definitely does fizzle alot less. Yeah at 60 I pretty much never sit down except to swap spells.</div></div><hr />
