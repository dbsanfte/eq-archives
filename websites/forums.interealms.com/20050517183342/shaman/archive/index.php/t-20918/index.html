<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">personally you can probably relate what you said about brenlo to most of SoE that deals with EQ. I worked in customer service, and if poeple where asking direct questions we had to give them answers, not pick and choose what we wanted to talk about or not. brenlo does seem abit happy to pick and choose only things that are easy.</div></div><hr />
