<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jebuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We prefer to group, but sometimes we don't feel like waiting for a group so we are looking for duoing alternatives.  We were doing toiler hill, but that is heavily camped.  We tried shrooms in FG, but pulled 3 and that was too scary.  We did Katta, but it's kind of mind-numbing ;)<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jebuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ok, I'm breaking down and need xp, so we'll stick to Katta.  /cry<br />
<br />
Right now we do the bank guards (courtyard?) or TS zoneline guards.  Up until what level are these guards dark blue until?  Also, are there any harder guards in Katta, besides Nathyn's guards?  Those are always camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">could always try PoJ now, like the first floor of cells and sentrys of justice, I can solo them at 56 and tried with melee friend that was 56 to.<br />
<br />
Was great exp for both of us, and I dident have a single ressist on turgurs wthout debuffing them at all</div></div><hr />
