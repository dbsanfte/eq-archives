<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm intrigued what the biggest nuke ever done by a shaman is, just from his equipment (ie no bard/cleric help).  I have currently squeezed 2155 out of Velium strike (using maxxed nuke aa and a bracer of precision) and was wondering if anyone has clocked a bigger one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
2155 seems kinda low for a 35% item, keep trying</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Theoretically, the highest nuke you can (assuming 40% is the highest DD focus) have is:<br />
<br />
23%: 1138 + 925 = 2063 (2062 if rounded down)<br />
35%: 1249 + 925 = 2174 (2173 if rounded down)<br />
40%: 1295 + 925 = 2220</div></div><hr />

At the time the beastlord in our group was talking about how much more MAX damage he could produce in a *short* time compared to a shaman nuking.<br />
<br />
BAM!  About 3.5K damage in one spell from me, that shut him up fast.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a Fury of E'ci item (cloak) so I have seen some fairly big numbers.  I didn't know that the crit damage (x2 multiplier) didn't work for focus item enhanced damage.  No wonder I haven't ever seen any truly huge numbers like I thought I would.  I see 1240 nukes solo and over 1300 with a bard playing Rizlona's.  But I've never seen a nuke crit more than 2200 or so.  I guess that's true then, that a crit just adds 925 to a nuke, and doesn't truly double that nuke's damage.  <br />
<br />
On that note, the biggest nuke I've been responsible for was during a Lurker ring (PoE) when I was helping AE the mobs with Tears of Saryn I got a quad crit for a total of 5200 damage in one nuke.  I think that's about as much as any shaman anywhere could hope to do with one spell.</div></div><hr />
