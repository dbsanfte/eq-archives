<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tailz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A word of warning, those of us who moved to Ubisoft's Euro servers were lured in by promises of &quot;no transfers for 6 months&quot;, but just after two months there were 1000 transfers allowed and I think the total was more..you might remember the news at the time.<br />
<br />
This is a SOE server though so it might not swing that way :) ..and Paludal was CRAMPED the first few weeks on Venril Sathir at least.<br />
<br />
If you can get ahead and get cash together to make sow potions you'll make a fortune (for anyone planning a new shammie ;))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>HermanaCruzadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They need more Euro Servers and not &quot;start from level 1&quot; servers!  I play on Karana and it's simply insane the amount of Euro (mostly french) players who have the blessing of servers coming up after patch times at their prime playing hours.  This means the 2 or 3 Euro based uber guilds run around getting anything that spawns on server reset, it's frustrating as hell to be picking up the remains 8 hours later.</div></div><hr />

Ya know what?  I tried sullon.  I found it to be populated by griefers and 12 year old wanna be griefers. Not my idea of a fun time.<br />
<br />
Tried FV too.  Same thing as SZ, but I couldn't try and kill those that bothered me.  <br />

Ill just try fresh thanks.  And even if they do allow transfers in a month, Ill be high enough to not care.</div></div><hr />

I started on a blue server only to be told that I have to be lvl 65 and 50 aa's to get into a decent guild.  It will be fun to see who gets to 50, 60, 65 first =)<br />

Did they have an official date that this server is going live?</div></div><hr />

Couldn't agree more Thor . I'm in the same boat ,tried sullon,left sullon to the people who deserve it.<br />
<br />
I'm gettin a little sick of the superior attitude that those people seem to have. It's just a game,if you think it means anything , then you need to prioritize.</div></div><hr />

Not sure about thott off hand but I know for sure that furror couldn't legitimately be the name for this server, at least not FoH's guild leader. That charcter was made well after release after he got his original character banned. Heck thats even where he got the name for the character =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kreskk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hmm the new server is appealing to me, being someone who doesnt have the money to twink on another server, this will put everyone on equal terms lol.<br />
<br />
Also, there will be no KEI for some time. This is a good thing for classes like Shamans who are not reliant on KEI to regen mana fast. Also its extremely good news for those who like Enchanters, because people will want Enchanters in their group for their &quot;awesome&quot; Breeze and Clarity. <br />
<br />
I think KEI has really ruined that spell line pre-KEI for pre-60 Enchanters, I think I just may take the opportunity to play an Enchanter this time around since KEI will not be at every door step for awhile.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of items having to be earned once again, instead of just buying them for extremely low PP that you earned in OT or other no risk zones.<br />
<br />
Not everyone and their brother will have a high level cleric, enchanter, wizard, or druid to provide KEI, 96% rez, virtue/aego, or ports. No real power leveling for awhile either.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uber&quot; guilds wont exist right away, and you can be one of the ones who builds up the guild that newbs drool at 6 months down the road.<br />
<br />
Less lag and maybe therefore less LDs.<br />
<br />
Yep.. I think I'll stop my 40 shaman and move to the new server to start fresh there.. Only problem now is that until the new server is online, I am not really motivated to keep playing on my current server :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's tempting here as well. But as soon as they allow transfers, the place will go to hell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been thinking about playing an enchanter as well. I had one before but I played my shaman instead, but the enchanter was pretty fun.<br />
<br />
But as soon as they allow transfers, the place will go to hell.<br />
<br />
They said they are seriously considering not allowing transfers per the feedback of lots of people. And I hope they dont allow it. Starting all over again will be kinda cool, I don't want it to be ruined by a bunch of level 65 people who transfer and farm everything in sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This sounds cool, starting afresh, some of the best playing moments is when you are low lvls. I for one am contemplating this option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">OK, I don't want to be argumentative, but what's with all this stuff about a &quot;fresh&quot; server and whatnot? What's preventing anyone from starting truely fresh on any existing server? If you don't twink, work your way through the levels, earn your goodies and not buy them, then any server will do. However, given the history of EQ and its players, I will predict the following for the new server:<br />
<br />
1) The same groups of peeps that control the &quot;uber&quot; and other guilds will start with level 1 chars on the new server. Within one day, there will be &quot;uber&quot; guilds PLing themselves through the levels. The difference is that they will be PLing through their teens, twenties, etc. If you think the top-level content has too much competition now, I bet you haven't seen anything yet. 200+ new toons in ButcherBlock, Everfrost, East Commons, etc. Paludal will be a nightmare. Fun.... Unless you play 24x7, you'll fall behind the leaders on the new server just as you have on the existing servers.<br />
<br />
2) The first peeps, groups, and guilds that get to key levels and obtain key equipment, skills, and spells will get uber-rich selling stuff. All of you 60+ players that are used to having certain things will find yourselves a bit frustrated at not having those things, and will be willing to pay the price. It will be some time before competition and availability drives prices down, just like the existing servers. Camps and rotations will be unknown as FFA takes reign as hundreds of peeps try to make it through the same levels. <br />
<br />
3) No matter what you do, you can't get away from the kiddies, jerks, and other &quot;no life but EQ&quot; peeps that swim around the waters on all of the servers. You won't get away from them on the new server, either.<br />
<br />
The ability to start fresh has always been there. You don't have to twink or help your new toon in any way. In fact, working a new char on an older server can be quite a challenge. You have LOTS of old world content that's little used. Low level farming for tradeskill items is not as lucrative as people assume. Groups are few and far between. Give it a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Loreddar,<br />
<br />
The problem isn't starting over and not twinking, it is other peoples expectations.  <br />
<br />
Have you attempted to play an enchanter alt lately?<br />
<br />
My husband did, and he couldn't get groups.  No one needs the lower level chanters anymore, because everyone and their brother runs off and grabs KEI before they go hunt now.<br />
<br />
Also, even if you don't *twink*, if you go to the bazaar and buy anything, it is at the fraction of the cost of what it would be to buy items on a new server, because there is much better out there that people sell cheap.  <br />
<br />
So in essence you need to decide not only not to twink, but not to buy items that would be beyond your reach at the level you are in to truly get the 'new server' experiance.<br />
<br />
And also, have yhou seen how deserted old world zones are now?  It is almost like they don't exist anymore.<br />
<br />
If I hadn't *finally* gotten to a place in my old age where I was nearing some goals as a shaman, I would consider this, but I still have things that I want to accomplish.  Heck I still have 13 Aa's to Cani-5, still don't have Torpor or Malo, and haven't ever gotten that 'so this is what they were talking about' game changing experiance yet!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Shaman65, that signature pic is hilarious.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I believe Loreddar has it exactly right.  I restarted on KB (euro server) when it was brand new and character transfers were not allowed (and I dont think they had any for 6 months).<br />
<br />
Because of what people know and understand of the game, there will be level 65's in NO time at all (less than a month).  What happened on KB was an entire guild moved there and started from scratch (an uber guild from another server trying to avoid competition).  <br />
<br />
The server was also very underpopulated (a good thing imo) and if you needed a group it was difficult to find (bad thing).  I played 2 chars (enc &amp; war) and my wife played 2 chars (clr &amp; dru) so we pretty much had a group and could add 2 more as we needed.  It was great hunting in dungeons at low levels that I missed the first go round (and almost never anyone in them) but I imagine it could be a lot harder on someone that didnt have a lot of friends there or didnt like to solo.<br />
<br />
Prices in the bazaar however were not exceedingly high (as one might expect), but they were a little higher than an old world server.  I ran the stien of moggok quest and did jewelcraft (very viable on a new server) and made tons of coin for my level.  I was able to buy equipment for my 2 chars and wifes 2 chars and felt like they were all twinked.<br />
<br />
All in all it was a great experience and I really enjoyed starting over (made it to level 35), but my wife missed all our rl friends and guildmates of our old characters so we came back to our old high level toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Sordia - No, I haven't attempted an enchanter alt. I have only one char that I play. My barb shammy who is now level 37. He's been soloed the entire way, and I expect that he will be soloed until retirement or until I find a really good guild that meets my expectations (and vice versa).<br />
<br />
I've played my main from scratch, and bought only items that I could afford with plat earned in game. I don't see any problem with buying items that you might not have normally been able to get so long as you do the work to earn the plat to pay for the item. It's those peeps that start a new char and then ask advice on how to spend the 10k+++ plat on gear that miss out on the &quot;new server&quot; experience. Of course, anyone can play as they wish, and if twinking out a new char is how they want to do it, then fine. <br />
<br />
I don't think you're going to get what you're looking for in a truely &quot;virgin&quot; experience by starting a char on a fresh server, which is what I think is being talked about in this thread. Hence my somewhat negative comments. As you said, you've already leveled a char to the point where there are high end things you want to get and tasks you want to do. I sure don't blame you for wanting that - there's LOTS of content I have only heard about and have yet to see. And because I've read so much about that content, it really won't be a truely &quot;virgin&quot; experience once I get there.<br />
<br />
Yes, the old world zones are nearly empty these days. I kind of like that. It lets me explore without getting in the way of others, and I can see content that might not have otherwise been available. Of course, to be able to do this requires a strong solo character and mentality, which is what I have. I can see that there would be problems for other chars that don't solo well and need groups. In this respect, a fresh server might indeed serve a good purpose. <br />
<br />
I guess my main point is that there is so much to EQ that just about anyone should be able to find fresh perspectives to the game without the need for a &quot;fresh&quot; server. If you can't, then it may be time to move to another game. SWG will be going live soon (I think), and probably represents the next best opportunity to get in on the ground level from a truely virgin perspective. But even there, the nature of these games is well known, and unless you're playing 24x7 with a group of friends you're going to fall behind the leaders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">*chuckles*<br />
<br />
Yes, there is plenty to see still for me.  But I do understand the appeal of starting over where everyone else has also started over.  <br />
<br />
I started a few alts in the time that I have played, and only one of them has been twinked in any manner, and that is my warrior alt.  None of my alts are above 30 yet, that is because I put too much of my EQ time into playing Sordia (like all shaman do).  Whenever I do level my alts I work to level them in zones that were not there or that I did not frequent as Sordia grew up, so each of my alts are a new EQ experiance.  I would not have know how difficult it was for classes that are dependant on groups (my warrior, my husband's short lived enchanter) had I not made those characters.  <br />
<br />
I guess my point is that it is entirely understandable to wish to start over with a new server.  It does bring a fresh perspective to things.  And yes there will be people who race to 65 to be the 'uber guild' on the server, but there will be fewer then an established server, so there will be room to grow.<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
I am not moving myself, but I could see where someone who was planning on making an alt, or starting EQ might want to seriously consider this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>psykopath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Looks like they have decided to make this server no transfer for atleast 12 months, and I think that is awsome.  I am starting to get excited  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I plan to try this for at least a week. I know that it will not be a &quot;true&quot; fresh start but it will be as close as I can get to it without a time machine. I started the game in June of 2002 and sometimes feel like I am behind everyone else. I also want to see how the economy works on a fresh server and watch it go through its growing pains. It will also be cool to make banded armor and have it be uber for at least a few weeks. I am really into tradeskilling and it would be fun for me to be the first GM in a skill on a server. I know that within two weeks a group will have pl'd a toon to 60+ and will turn around and pl the rest of the group to form an uber guild but they will be in the minority as compared to the existing servers. If I don't like it or the experience is not as good as I thought it would be, Quinner will be waiting patiently for me. <br />
<br />
(BTW, I know exactly how this is done. A good friend who has played since 2000 explained it to me and it can be done. I'm just not sure exactly how high.)</div></div><hr />
