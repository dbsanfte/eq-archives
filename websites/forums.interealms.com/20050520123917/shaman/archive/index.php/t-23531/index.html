<br />
The seem to have taken care of all the Shaman-omen-Ph spells. Some have been convered to spells others have just been removed it seems.<br />
<br />
Yoppa's Spear of Venom <br />
Name change since last post. Otherwise same as before. Ends up being less efficient and roughly the same dps as our cold nukes. Increase efficiency and decrease cast time more or make a larger nuke to up the dps some.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Sense and Tailsman of Sense<br />
Once again name change only from Ancestral Grace. Check last thread.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Perseverance and Tailsman of Perseverance<br />
Once again name change only from Ancestral Regrowth. Check last thread.<br />
<br />
Putrid Decay <br />
No significant changes to the spell. Check last thread.<br />
<br />
Crippling Spasm <br />
No significant changes to the spell. Check last thread.<br />
<br />
Spirit Veil <br />
Looks to be a self only fixed duration invis. Not a bad thing to have and had been requested by some. One of our shaman-omen-ph spells converted. Nice addition if a relatively minor one.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Might and Talisman of Might<br />
Spirit of might got lowered in level to match a druids level on their spell. Druids is still slightly better tho with slightly less mana cost, faster cast time and slightly longer duration. Again just don't see why druids should all of a sudden match shaman on thier &quot;strength buff&quot; and even have slight advantages given past advantages shaman had.<br />
<br />
The group version of the spell gets kinda funny. The group version that was in last time is gone and I was unable to find what it had been changed to if anything. The shaman-omen-ph that had been the group haste spell got converted to talisman of might. The spell still has some reminants of the being a haste spell, namely the spell category and description but I see no reason to beleive that it's actually still a haste spell in any way.<br />
<br />
Farrel's Companion <br />
No real changes to spell. Check previous thread.<br />
<br />
Breath of Wunshi <br />
Name change from Breath of Wanvu. Check previous thread.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Bulwark <br />
No changes at all. Check previous thread.<br />
<br />
Yoppa's Rain of Venom <br />
Name change from Obkin's Rain of Venom. Check previous thread.<br />
<br />
Yoppa's Mending <br />
Name changed from Obkin's Mending. Also got amount healed increased and mana cost decreased. Now at the predicted 47% of a clerics heal and slightly more efficient than previous spell. Still beleive shaman and druids need to be much closer in healing to clerics but thats another arguement. Givens sony's current healing plan the spell is now what I'd expect.<br />
<br />
Wunshi's Focusing and Talisman of Wunshi <br />
Name change from Wanvu's Focusing. Also knocked 27 hps off the spells which I'm not sure why that was needed. As noted previously would still like to see the dmg mod added to spell instead of having to cast this and other buff.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Fortitude  and Talisman of Fortitude <br />
Changed name from Ancestral Vigor and bumped both spells up a level. Still only seems to go 40 sta above cap instead of entire amount of spell. See previous thread for more comments.<br />
<br />
Pained Memory <br />
No changes from last post. See previous post for notes.<br />
<br />
Ice Age <br />
No changes from last post. See previous post for notes.<br />
<br />
Curse of Sisslak <br />
Name change from Ancestral Vengeance. See previous post for notes.<br />
<br />
Vindictive Spirit <br />
Another one of one of the omen-shaman-ph spells converted to a useful spell. PB ae 50% slow. Neg 100 sv magic and autocasts a a buff on the shaman that will absorb 50% of incoming dmg for the first 3200dmg (1600 dmg absorbed). Not a bad looking spell. Somewhat small ae range and shorter duration than recast time. Still looks like a good way to buy yourself some time to get things under control with out killing yourself, hopefully. Seems to mirror the druids snare spell.<br />
<br />
Still some issues that need to be addressed with the spell. Spell type is still benificial, category is still hastes and game description still describes haste too. Might effect the functionality of the spell.<br />
<br />
Spiritual Serenity <br />
No changes from last post. Still needs to be upgraded to match upgrades other HoT's got.<br />
<br />
Pure Spirit <br />
Another one of the omen-shaman-ph spells. Has the potential to be interesting. Single target &quot;cure&quot; that has one chance to remove a detrimental spell. Judging from my experience with Radiant cure one chance to remove a detrimental spell is not that good. Radiant cure 3 seems to have a good chance of removing a deterimental spell but doesn't always and it has 6 chances to remove detirmental spells. Up pure spirit to this level and I'd say we've got a pretty good spell and a new role on some raids. It's possible Pure spirit has a better chance to remove a spell than radiant cure does but if it's the same only 1 chance isn't gonna cut it.<br />
<br />
Champion <br />
Several changes since last time. It got the attack and stats dropped back down to the level of the previous version and converted into a group spell. As it is I'd call it a pretty nice spell but would still ask what is so powerful about this spell that it has to still have such a short duration, long recast and high mana cost. I'd also ask why drop the stats and attack down so that it's just a group version of previous spell with the dmg mod added. Up the stats and attack back up to 160 or better. Also while group spells are nice for when they are needed not having a single target versions means always casting the group version even if only 1 person needs. To sum it up bump the stats back up, make the spell less of a hastle to use still and add a single target version or retoractively change ferine avatar so we have a single target spell too.<br />
<br />
Blood of Yoppa <br />
Name change from Blood of Obkin. See previous version.<br />
<br />
Ancient Wilslik's Mending <br />
10% more healed and slightly more efficient. Pretty much same thing as clerics ancient heal. As I said with the other heal, i think shaman and druid need to be closer to clerics on heals but this is parr for the plan sony seems to have for now.<br />
<br />
Ancient Ancestral Calling <br />
Nothing changed since last post.<br />
<br />
All in all some nice improvements, some new spells but there are still a number of things that will hopefully be addressed. If i wasn't so sceptical i might think that sony actually read my last post and addressed some of the issues raised.</div></div><hr />

 I was looking at this, it does not say chance to remove, it says Removes 1 detirmental. So, this seems to be a for sure remove 1 dot/debuff/aoeeffect not a much potentiel removeal, but this is castable outside of your group, and while it has a simi large recast time (12 sec) thats a lot better than RC's recast time. Looks to me like a keeper. Its a new ability, and only for Shaman (right now).</div></div><hr />

OK from lucy<br />
Radiant cure 1 (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3297&amp;source=Live) <br />
Radiant Cure1<br />
1: 	Decrease Curse Counter by 9<br />
2: 	Decrease Poison Counter by 9<br />
3: 	Decrease Disease Counter by 9<br />
4: 	Remove Detrimental(1)<br />
<br />
pure spirit (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5410&amp;source=Test) <br />
Pure Spirit 	Detail | History | Raw Data<br />
 <br />
Slot 	Description<br />
1: 	Remove Detrimental(1)<br />
<br />
Identical in the description of the remove detrimental effect. From personal experience and anyone who has radiant cure one can confirm i'm sure it most definitely does not cure 1 detrimental item per cast. Like I said it might be different than radiant cure but I see no reason to beleive it is currently based on the info in lucy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Raidant cure 1 has a chance to cure detrimental, from my expereience its about 50/50 on stuff like malos. I sitll haven't gotten anything above 1 on my cleric and it still works a decent ammount of the time.  Our new raid role will be spamming this on the MT (guess with the remove 1 they figure this will fix all our stacking issues).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Radient cure 1 is Remove Detrimental(1), 2 is Detrimental(3) and 3 is Detrimental(6). I thought it applied to the chance of removing detrimental spells from your group, which would typically have 6 people in it, so RC1 would cure one (randomly I would guess), while RC3 would cure all 6. If it works that way then Remove Detrimental(1) applied to a single target should allways cure them.<br />
<br />
Another point worth stessing i think is that Putrid decay's poison debuff would appear to stack with malos, according to the Lucy data, which means that it could be used to good effect when our poison dots and nukes are being cast.<br />
<br />
I don't consider the might line to be much of an issue. The group one, when the spell becomes available, will be the spell that will be generally used, with the single target for patching late comers or dead people. That's basically grunt work and I dont have a problem with druids sharing that workload. After all, druids do have a long standing STR buff line (Nature's Might  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3439&amp;source=Test) for example, and earlier spells), and having a larger version of those buffs is just as useless for them as it is for us.</div></div><hr />
