<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i don't come here as much as i should, but in the small amount of time i spend here, a lot of the posts and threads i read are about how horrible the shammy class is.<br />
<br />
i don't understand. the shammy is the best class in EQ. so many people envy what an effective shammy is capable of doing. if you feel you're not an asset to a raid, chances are you're not playing your class effectively.<br />
<br />
i'm not trying to say anyone here sucks at their class. there's no way to tell just by reading some threads. but i enjoy the shammy and i personally do not see a need for any drastic changes.<br />
<br />
what category do we fall under? i don't think we do, i think we have our own category. that's what's so great about this class. we're so unique in that after the mob/s is/are slowed/malosed it's up to the player how effective the shammy is to a raid.<br />
<br />
i ask a simple question. what do you do on raids? i'm curious what people have to say. also, if you could include what content you are raiding.<br />
<br />
for instance, i presently raid the Ele planes. i don't cast DoTs hardly ever. i also rarely nuke. but what i don't do in dots and nukes i make up for in healing and buffing people automatic.<br />
<br />
so...<br />
<br />
what do you do on raids?</div></div><hr />

<br />

Is that a trick question? Are you seriously suggesting that we should just heal and buff and find all of our issues gone?<br />
<br />
By the way, I have a lot less raiding issues then grouping issues at the moment. But my main raiding issue is that my heals are not big enough. My last raid was in Txevu in case that makes any difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most of my raiding issues are with stackability. If I was the only Shaman on a raid, or perhaps 2, no problems whatsoever. The first 2 shaman on any raid are awesome, no question about it. But in general, here is how I break down our stackability.<br />
<br />
There are some raids I feel enormously useful:<br />
Xegoney, most of Air in fact, Babs, Arch mage, Coir (I always die before the final Coir, so I must be doing SOMETHING useful, heh, GO CC TEAM!) in the EPs, stuff like VZ, Bert, Sol Ro Minis, Grummus, etc in the pre-EPs, VT, Emp Ssra, and a lot of other Luclin mobs are OK for shaman too. <br />
<br />
Then there are some raids I just feel like I am . . . there: <br />
Fennin Ro. Most other Fire minis. All Water minis. Earth rings we AE. Basically any mob that doesnt have excessive adds, and that is usually fought alone. <br />
<br />
Why do I feel more useless? Well, my heals seem like nothing. 1700ish against theses guys isnt a big deal, especially not when most tanks have 11K hps. A 9 second 1K nuke, or a faster 675 one, is also just to small to actually matter. Honestly, stick a druid in my raid slot and you get double the healing power and nuking power. <br />
<br />
Now granted, there are a lot of raids where half the classes are kinda useless. Any mob that is Range-killed. Any AE raid. Etc. But geez, is it TOO MUCH to ask for a heal that does a bit more than 1/6th of the tanks hps? Is it too much to ask for a faster nuke in the 1200 range we can crit for 2400? This isnt cleric-druid-wizard level stuff. Its simply a request to stack a LITTLE better on raids. <br />
<br />
We don't totally suck in any situation, even the trials people whine about. Shaman is an extremely powerful class. But it just seems like the EQ world is moving by and leaving us behind at the Bus Stop. Most of the raids we do (EP mold farming) require 1 shaman. Most of the groups at the higher end would be MUCH more solid with another class in the traditional &quot;Shaman&quot; slot. Being the master of Trivial Content isnt really cutting it for me anymore. I wanna heal a tad more, and nuke a tad more, or have my DOTs not cause me to get summoned. I really don't think thats too much to ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From a glance at your magelo id say give it it a couple of months and you will find the answers. You're pretty close to that point where shaman see major diminishing returns in new content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wich is the least desireable class in GoD? That alone is reason enough for the devs to think twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tew is correct, Speng.  You're right at the cusp where things are about to go to heck for you.  Mob dps is rising steadily, but your healing is heavily capped.  You say you buff and heal--okay, so exactly what are you bringing to the table that another cleric and a buff-bot or another druid and a buff-bot can't bring better?  Answer:  nothing.<br />
<br />
It's not a question of playing your class well.  It's a question of more fundamental limitations in our spell choices.  We are the only class who's ability to heal is adjusted to account for slow hitting fully--in a world where mitigation and immunity to slow is reasonably common.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the first time his group runs up against a 1000 quad, slightly slowable mob he'll understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ok here is where I felt stupid and wished i was a cleric/druid/chanter<br />
<br />
Doing the ikky one groupo trials requier massive heals on all and on some of them also CC.<br />
<br />
cleric is always needed only one to have the heals to handle it, BUT he/she also need a backup healer but here a shaman cant do the job cause the heals are to small so there goes another cleric or druid, then a slower is needed. well better have one chanter to CC(chanters even got better annull then we do) and slow and a dps class then shaman and chanter  which leaves no room for a DPS class.<br />
what would you take ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">posted by SPangaloid: i don't come here as much as i should, <br />
<br />
This statement pretty much disqualifies you from posting any intelligent statement here bud.  I am a firm believer in the the superior collective intelligence.  Without mind-control devices like television and given enough time to sort out the issues, a body of people of any decent number will come to the most rational conclusion.<br />
<br />
Are you trying to tell me that you are smarter and more skilled than the collective wisdom of a few thousand experts?<br />
<br />
From top to bottom Shaman are broken vis a vis Raid.  Blazz is bang on with the stackability issue.  I quit my guild in frustration when a Cleric/Officer decided to stealth level a Shaman up to 65 and then switch it in as her Main.  She thought (and apparently correctly since everyone went along with it) that the status afforded her Cleric should be transfered to her new Shaman, thus knocking me further down the Totem Pole.  And I do mean POLE!<br />
<br />
Now this has a lot to do with guild politics but it is also a matter of game mechanics.  Had I been able to contribute more than slow and invisible patch heals, I would not have been so frustrated.  If a person is not in a raiding guild of some size they are also not going to witness this issue.<br />
<br />
You say you raid in elemental planes and healing is your main gig?  In addition you say that effectiveness is up to the player of a Shaman?<br />
<br />
I would say it also depends upon a player's ability to delude himself that his heals actually make a difference in the outcome of the raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The nice thing about shaman on raids is the trash control. Most trash is fully slowable, and most can mess up a chanter who lags even a little trying to get a rune off. However, most cant 1 or 2 round me, so I can usually get my stuff done and live while the Add tanks get to it. <br />
<br />
Water minis just suck for shaman though. I dont even pay attention half the time, honestly. We CoH to one spot, and pull everything there. There is minimal trash. There just isnt anything for me to do that a Druid, Wizard, even Paladin cant do better. Same for Fire, but at least a few Fire minis need me for spells like RGC and Blood of Nadox (pretty sure Babs can be 2 grouped with a shaman in each group timing Blood, shes such a wuss without her DOT, maybe we will try that one, heh).<br />
<br />
I am still powerful. I am desired in groups. I get tells all the time for groups, even trials groups. Its not so much that I am not effective, its that I dont FEEL as effective anymore, a gradual decrease, to be sure, but as soon as you start hitting mobs that regularly mitigate slow, you will understand. <br />
<br />
Its my understanding that in KT we become highly effective again. DOTs are good, Malos is good, Slow is landing and fights are longer. But we have run the numbers, and they are discouraging in ANY content. A druid heals more effeciently vs an unslowed mob than we do on a fully slowable mob for any fight under a minute in length. I realize it doesnt SEEM possible, but even if you fudge the numbers in OUR favor, its still there. <br />
<br />
Here is what I want to do in most fights. Debuff (Malos, slow), fast heal the MA while a CH (dru or cleric) is going off, drop a decent nuke that actually budges the mobs health, then HoT whoever took damage when it dies. The problem is if I do thatone fight, then don;t do it the next fight, there is almost NO appriciable difference between battles. If a wizard doesnt nuke or a Rogue doesnt backstab, you notice. If a cleric doesnt heal you notice. If an MA doesnt taunt, you notice. If we dont slow or heal or nuke, its hard to notice, especially in a 30-40 second fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im becoming more of a believer of something else.  Hear something enough times and you tend to start beleiving it, right or wrong.  Your statement and this site seem more like a mob recently, and mobs dont always come to the most rational conclusion, more like might makes right.<br />
<br />
Im not arguing that shaman are in a perfect state and couldnt use some help/changes.  As things are, we are not at the end of the world, I think too many are buying into all the whining and complaining that we are useless.  I visit this site more out of habit and lack of things to do now rather than the good information it used to hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">*swing and a miss*<br />
<br />
No one has said we are useless.  The commentary, complaining and calls for re-balancing are based solely upon a limited scope of encounters.<br />
<br />
These encounters include high end PoP and GoD group based trials.<br />
<br />
High DPS, Low HP mobs.  Fast fights.<br />
<br />
If this type of content were rare, you probably wouldn't hear much.<br />
<br />
However, the point is that the &quot;vision&quot; of the Dev team is for more and more content of this type.  All of the things a Shaman is really BAD at.<br />
<br />
As the &quot;vision&quot; is now, we must ask for our class to be balanced against the content as it will come, not as it once was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Elemental planes is not where we're currently having major problems.  Please take into consideration that others might be experiencing things you haven't yet gotten to in content exploration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I highly doubt it has anything to do with where this guy is raiding.  I think it has more to do with the fact that he rarely visits the Shaman's Crucible.<br />

Give him a chance guys; once you all have had a go at convincing him how horrible the class is that he's been having a blast playing, he'll come around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL Haagen!<br />
<br />
The some of the basic issues with our class are:<br />
<br />
Shaman usefullness is directly proportional to the length of the fight, where longer is better.<br />
<br />
The 100/74/49 healing ratio imposes a cap on our effectiveness as a priest class. <br />
<br />
SoE's view of Slow and Canni making us a class that has to be closely monitored so we do not become too UBER does not take into account the changes in the game where fight's have changed from long battles to DPS fests.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I for one am glad to hear you have found a style of play that allows you to both enjoy the class, and allow you to feel you are contributing to your group/raid. <br />
<br />
Please share more about your style of play, it may help others extend thier own enjoyment of the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The EPs were, mostly, great for us.  We have real, defined roles for all the Air rings plus Xegony, three Earth rings (we only AE Peregrin) plus TRC, about a third of Fire (Babs!  I, too, want to try her with 12), and Coirnav in Water.<br />
<br />
But the game doesn't end with the EPs anymore.  Even in Time, it starts to show.  Yeah, I keep busy on Saryrn and Terris Thule ... but what am I supposed to do on Tallon Zek?  Nuke him 675 damage at a time?<br />
<br />
And the game doesn't end with Time anymore.  I'm not at the far end of GoD content yet.  I just did Glorification last night.  It was, on the whole, a fun little raid.  Except that if I hadn't been there, no one would have noticed.  We had 4 shaman along on an event where none of the bosses are slowable, nothing lives long enough to dot, and single hits from even the trash are so much larger than our heals to render them comically inadequate (mobs hitting for 1700?  Um, go go Tnarg?).<br />
<br />
The point that BlargX has made in his modest proposal is really the accurate one.  As long as you are playing in a section of the game where slow is useful, then shaman shine.  They don't stack, but they do still shine.  But when you move past that, and slow changes from being an essential mechanic to having about the relative utility of Bulwark of Vie ... then we feel the engine start to sputter, as we have no other purpose left to fall back on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">cool, good responses, thanks. so in GoD and maybe even a bit in Time the shaman class becomes less and less effective? if i understand correctly?<br />
<br />
my guild and the majority of my raids are in Ele's but i have seen mid-range GoD...i've seen 2 Ikkinz raids and exped in Yxtta. i'm not saying i'm an expert in GoD, i'm just saying i've seen it.<br />
<br />
however, i still don't think any less of the shammy. i played teh same way as i have in PoP and the content prior.<br />
<br />
someone said a bot could buff as well as a real shammy. i'm gonna have to disagree with you. i do not wait for people to ask for buffs...i'm looking for naked people once the mobs are slowed. when ever i see a naked person i'm casting focus and stamina if they need it. if a Bot is doing that, that person is not playing their main. when somoene joins the raid...i look for that message and buff em.<br />
<br />
here's that quote<br />
<br />
You say you buff and heal--okay, so exactly what are you bringing to the table that another cleric and a buff-bot or another druid and a buff-bot can't bring better? Answer: nothing.<br />
<br />
i'm not trying to be cocky, i just don't know any other way to say it...no one boxing a shammy is buffing people as quickly as i am. if they are, they are not playing their main as effectivaly on a raid as they could be. if somoene here boxes a shaman, prove me wrong, please.<br />
<br />
i wish i could say more but i gotta get ready for work. hopefully we can get some more input in this thread. i'll be checking back here more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just because I can buff someone 8 seconds faster than a bot is no reason for me to be on a raid . . . or in a group for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Spang . . . I suspect most of us buff the nekkid people on raids.  If we see them, we buff them.  So what?  Are you trying to tell me that your ability to buff a nakid person while they're looting their corpse makes you more valuable than having another cleric at the raid for healing and a buff-bot for a shaman?  I don't see it.  Focus is not a make-or-break buff that must be on within XX seconds.  Any tank with rez effects is going to be hurting anyway due to the innate slow.  It won't make them any more effective,so they don't HAVE to be buffed quickly.  It doesn't make your shaman any more worthwhile, whatever you may tell yourself.  Speedy rebuffing only makes a difference in mid-fight, if you're battle rezzing (which is generally a bad idea anyway--zerg tactics suck).<br />
<br />
Want a fast buff bot?  Get it quickbuff3.  Set up an afk message: Tell both Bob (shaman) and Jeff (guy botting shaman) for buffs.  Make a hotkey for the shaman--<br />
line 1: /rt<br />
line 2: /pause 3<br />
line 3:/cast X<br />
<br />
3 seconds after a tell they're buffed.  It's not difficult to bot a character effectively.<br />
<br />
I stand by what I said--right now, a raid is better off with another full time cleric and a botted shaman.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There are programs out there that make boxxing a shaman as effective if not better than it being a main.  I've seen people using these programs in game and you can't tell the difference unless you try talking to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Maybe buffing is the thing that makes you feel most useful but it's not mine. And there is only so many times you can spam Tnargs/Daludas and see it land for 0 healed on a raid or land it for 1800 and the target dies to the next hit anyway till you feel useless. And DoTing is great fun too on a raid...if you like seeing your bind point often. There are problems that need addressing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">What do I do on raids? Mostly screw around on the clear chatting. I loot corpses (sometimes its not even my own!) and take tells on loot. I hand out stuff from the bank people need, spells, and reagents (hear that clerics... your GUILD should cover dots, stop whining, k thx). I discuss strats, and targets, and whos doing a good job, and who is wiping us.  I talk w recruits to make sure they know whats going on.  My officer duties are far more useful and interesting than my class duties, and of more benefit. There are normally 2-3 other shamans who can do the exact same thing that I do, and they are normally bored as well.<br />
<br />
Mobs die so fast that I really question the point of me doing anything, including debuffing. We decided to do nothing one raid, and no one even said anything lol. I pretend to heal my group and sometimes try and sometimes compete with the other shamans to malos on inc, and thats really it. Our beastlords slow, because they can handle the aggro better, and theirs is just as good. Sometimes I nuke, but really... HOW long for a 1k &quot;big bomb&quot;? la-de-da. Good luck landing it before the mob dies.<br />
<br />
In typical boss fights, we take bets on if the cleric who stuns on inc dies or not, malos, slow, then I normally spam my stupid piece of crap heal because its marginally less useless than my stupid piece of crap nuke. I might throw a FA on one of my friends. FA is the key to shaman stacking you know. Sometimes I torpor a sk in revenge for voiceing me. In general, I am aware of how little it means to have me there. Sometimes we get together and decide to all mgb our 544 heal at the same time for ****s and giggles. Or group charisma. Nothing swings a battle more!<br />
<br />
Oh, and I shrink and grow tards who forgot their shrink device $$.  The leetest class ability evar according to Dirtnap!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">One of the universal issues that causes a disagreement among shaman, and the biggest issue that prevents devs from considering it, is that our usefulness changes so DRASTICALLY in different content.<br />
<br />
It's not that they designed the classes poorly, because they did a pretty good job at that (I know I know, boo, hiss, but humor me, I think classes, at some levels, mesh together quite nicely).  It's the sort of shortcut-ish way they chose to try and re-implement challenge into the game.  I think they were going for a change of pace, rather than just upping the difficulty of big, slow fight mobs, etc.  I've been over this point way too many times though... sorry...<br />
<br />
I stayed with my shaman because I LOVE(D) him!  He always had group invites, could solo nicely, and it always felt like I was always casting furiously and contributing hugely when the crap hit the fan in earlier content.<br />
<br />
My first couple GoD trials pretty much slapped me in the face.  I'm not trying to say we shouldn't be looked at, but HOW do you make GoD easier without trivializing old content?  People at end game are suffering, whereas those who are casuals, are not... or at least, not as much.  The unguilded LDoN hog probably loves his shaman, or the BoT obsessed fellas...<br />
<br />
I know some people might hate me for saying this, but the fact that GoD spells are no drop gives the devs a chance to put in some great spells that, while they might trivialize old content, that wouldn't really matter, as you would have to be at end-game already to receive them.  Nihil is a good start, but I think they need more...<br />
<br />
I'm not a dev though, so I can't truly make fully educated comment... wait, did I just say that?  Erm, Nevermind...<br />
<br />
I will tell you that I love the heck out of my shaman, and through lasting friendships and a great guild I have managed to semi-overcome the stress that was induced on my first couple of trials.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't change my class for the world... I might PL another one up, but my shaman will always be my favorite, and a lot of people who are dissatisfied will tell you the same.  But that love will only last so long, if things are not at least slightly retuned at that level of play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think you can see the changes as a non elemental shaman in a hard LDoN dungeon.  I can't think of a less desirable class to take on a LDoN hard encounter unless it's a charm group.  Unfortunately I've only met that &quot;brave&quot; enchanter once.  <br />
<br />
A dungeon full of 900 hitters that ALL migate slow favors healing and DPS.  It takes away all the advantages I could provide a group in a &quot;normal&quot; LDoN dungeon.  <br />
<br />
Being that I only have average equipment my chances at CC are slim.  I normally pull an add with slow and then root park.  Well if I get a resist with a 900 hitter and follow it up with a root resist I'm usually toast.  In a &quot;hard&quot; dungeon I need to leave CC to the big boys:  chanters, bards, druids, or rangers.  I wish some of the former would realize how terrific snare can be in a dungeon that doesn't respawn.<br />
<br />
DPS - Sorry this is not my specialty.  Besides I'm usually maloing and slowing for the first 10+ seconds of the fight and throwing in a patch heal if needed.  Either way I decide my high aggro dot or 9 second nuke I can average around 900 damage a mob.  Luckily Scooby doubles my DPS.<br />
<br />
Healing - Well let's just say I can't imagine I'd ever be picked to do a LDoN &quot;hard&quot; as main healer.  As a back up healer I'd be needed in the case of adds.  Now in a &quot;normal&quot; dungeon this would be the time I'd be slowing the adds.  Unfortunately in a &quot;hard&quot; I need to spam my weak healing and hope someone else can either slow or CC the adds.<br />
<br />
Slowing - Yes I'm the best.  Unlike most shaman I'm actually fine with other classes being able to subsitute in a group for me.  Want superior CC, mana regen, and better haste get a chanter.  Looking for DPS take a Beastlord.  If you have enough healing and want a puller and can live with 52% slow a bard(yes bards provide alot more) is a great choice.  Looking for the best slow, ghetto healing, CC, haste, and stat buffs a shaman is a great choice.  Unfortunately when Sony decides to gimp the ability that they have chosen to balance us around it completely skews our effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Buffs - I've always been a believer in HP.  Normally the two buffs I keep up(besides haste) is stamina and Focus.  All the others are fluff and if asked will provide them.  I find even in pick up groups alot of people have maxxed their buff slots.  If I meet one more paladin that filled his last buff slot with agility so I can't Q him I'm going to pull my last remaining hairs out.  I will admit I've been unable to acquire the componentless avatar and at 13pp every 5 minutes this spell is rarely memmed.<br />
<br />
For a succesful LDoN hard I feel I need a good puller, a good tank, a good cleric( Sorry I'd take a cleric over a druid anyday for the  their HP buffs and rez alone.), CC, and DPS.  That completely pingeon holes my grouping choices.  Granted a good bard can both pull and CC but what does that leave two openings? <br />
<br />
I am in not saying a shaman can't contribute in a LDoN &quot;hard&quot;.  I just can't help feeling that my group carried me when we win one.  On a LDoN &quot;normal&quot; I can usually carry a bad pick up group.  I'll continue to do LDoN &quot;hard&quot; everytime I'm asked.  I like a good challenge.  Sadly I have very little motivation to suggest doing a &quot;hard&quot; adventure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Its my understanding that in KT we become highly effective again. DOTs are good, Malos is good, Slow is landing and fights are longer. <br />
I was in KT the other day doing xp with a decently designed group.<br />
SHM-CLE-WAR-NEC-BRD-WIZ<br />
<br />
I'd malos the mob on inc.<br />
Slow it with nihil.<br />
Land Blood.<br />
Right click ele legs waiting for spells to refresh.<br />
Land Bane.<br />
Become the main tank.<br />
Wince back where I can.<br />
Watch the mob die 1 or 2 ticks before Bane wears off. (Time BP focus in effect)<br />
Great mana efficiency there on the 2 dots.<br />
<br />
I tried other stuff.<br />
malos-slow-bane-right click as before.<br />
Then land AE rain on the mob.<br />
Sometimes the wizard/necro pulled aggro and the rain did 1 or 2 rains.<br />
Sometimes the rain would land all three times.<br />
The mob would usually die about 5 seconds after bane ended.<br />
<br />
The mobs were all dying in 45 - 60 seconds.<br />
There's no time for disease dots to do anything more than 600 or 700 damage.<br />
&quot;Fast&quot; poison dots only go 1/2 duration.<br />
I become the MT if I try doing any significant damage.<br />
<br />
The best use I was for the group was when the cleric had to afk here and there, where I'd malos-slow-Q-chain heal the warrior on each pull.<br />
If we got an untimely add though, we woulda been f'ed though.<br />
<br />
<br />
if you feel you're not an asset to a raid, chances are you're not playing your class effectively.<br />
So I'm on this Uqua raid today.<br />
We have a mob incoming.<br />
It looks relatively harmless as those Legend of Zelda/Link looking ghosts do *cough* ripoff! *cough*<br />
I see the 9k hp paladin in my group go from 100% health to 45% health in 1 round of melee.<br />
I cast my mighty 1547 heal on him (max healing aas) and see him go up 2/3 of a bubble of health.<br />
Please tell me how to play my class more effectively.<br />
<br />
We go raiding Yxtta.<br />
There's a bug incoming in the primal caves.<br />
I malos the mobs so the rest of the raid's spells land easier (and mine).<br />
I slow the mob asap.<br />
The mob is at 50% health already.<br />
The mob dies 10 seconds later.<br />
Why am I slowing?<br />
Perhaps I should be using my uber heals instead.<br />
<br />
Hmm.  Let's try nuking these mobs instead so I can add some dps.<br />
Malos the mob.<br />
Cast my ice nuke.<br />
Mob takes 1k damage.<br />
Wizard tells the group, &quot;Woo.  Another 7k crit!&quot;<br />
I look at my spellbook thinking how nice it would be for my fastest of fast dots, Bane, do it's 2100 damage (plus focus) to a mob, instead of doing about 800 because the mob is already dead.<br />
I look at my spellbook thinking how nice it would be for poison rains to not be resisted 1/3 of all rains, before determining partial damage for resists on mobs, assuming the mob even stayed in 1 spot for all 3 rains to hit it, and not break mez on nearby other mobs.<br />
<br />
Even on some fights where I'm chain healing the entire fight, I can't run out of mana.<br />
For the TZ fight in time, I malos, send in mass pets, then spam heals on the MT for the entire fight, only stopping to hit c5, or heal a group member with more fast heals.<br />
I'd love to be able to dump my mana into something that was noticably useful.<br />
1500 heals vs 3k melee doesn't stack up right.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do what I can with what I'm given.<br />
What we are given is fine up to and including the Elemental Planes, and a fair portion of Plane of Time.<br />
There's a significant portion of Plane of Time, and anything raidworthy in GoD, and most of the XP content in GoD that's either too much for shaman healing to be noticed, or mobs die too fast for shaman debuffs to be noticed, or mobs die too fast for shaman to do any noticable damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
In GoD shaman cannot reliably be the main healer of a group.<br />
In GoD shaman cannot do any decent DPS.<br />
There are BST, Enchanters, and Bards that can all slow, and contribute to groups.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I liked the idea of cursing, weakening the enemies &amp; empowering my allies in fight. So i guess the whole package (debuffs, buffs, heals, dots ) not just a specific part.</div></div><hr />

When shamans started their shammies part of the reason was because they had a group role, and maybe some a raid role. What is happening is that shamans are more obsolete in terms of a group role.<br />
Shamans are not asking to be Wizards, or Clerics, but more of an adaption to the quick fights of GoD and maybe Ldon normal.(although a shaman can heal these)<br />
When slow is not important, for Clerics it would be kinda like a Cleric's heal being useless. It means shamans need a backup role. Different shamans have different ideas how this can be done the first suggestion is;<br />
Improving heals, although personally I am not too keen on this one. Since when you look for a main healer for a group, who needs backup healing when the main healer can do the job with no problem.<br />
The second suggestion is an improvement to dps, this could be done by several means, for example, putting a -resist on Bane, improving our quickest nuke or a thought I had was if Malos was reduced to the casting time of tash with a longer recast time or a new version of maloxx, which is a -50resistadj, 200 mana -45 to all resists. By doing this, it would reduce the amount of time spent on this role and more likely to do additional dps on top of this.<br />
<br />
Or alternatively a completely different backup role (or perhaps with more meaningful buffs it could not be needed.)  An alternative backup role could be along the lines of another debuff which I think they are doing in OoW.<br />
<br />
In terms of raid stackability, I think this is harder. Since we have taken on the perception that all classes are raid stackable. In reality I think its only a minority of classes that actually need an abundant number of the class for the raid to take place. The most obvious is druids and clerics. I mean 5 shadowknights aren't needed apart from the minority of raiding situations. Most of the classes that don't have a main role can play a backup role of dps, for shamans esp when I was raiding to time the backup role was healing. I think all that is perhaps needed here is more meaningful buffs. Although I think it could be useful in next expansion for shamans to have something similar to paragon except it provides an attack bonus to the group you are in or some other worthwhile aas.<br />

<br />

<br />
I did make my shaman to heal.  When the game originaly came out shamans were healers.  The need to nuke is a new priority, as SoE has designed content were dot's are not effective.<br />
<br />
Slowing was not at all a priority when I made my shaman, of course the big slow had nto been made yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Shaman's have always had the ability to heal.<br />
<br />
From L1 - 50 (the original level cap) the Slow ability was not mitigated and the heals we had were adequate to the incoming damage our group received.<br />
<br />
When the cap was raised, so were *some* of our heals . . . but then came mitigation.<br />
<br />
Mitigation is what unbalanced Shaman healing.  When a mob mitigates Slow, it is, in effect, mitigating the Shaman heal.  No longer can we heal in proportion to the damage incoming.<br />
<br />
That is the crux of our healing problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
In nuking we were originally on par with Wizards.  No, not nuke for nuke.  Our DoT's though were the equal of Wizard nukes . . . less mana but over time instead of all at once.  Compare Ice Comet to Envenomed Bolt.  Over the course of time, our DoT's just haven't kept up.  If they had, I doubt anyone would be complaining about our DPS abilities.  Even if our DoT's weren't running full course.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
When did you make your Shaman Spang?  <br />
<br />
I started Sion as a healer in March of 1999.<br />
<br />
At that time there WAS no slow that we were aware of.  Within about 2-3 weeks of being in the game the highest level character I knew was a 34th level Warrior and I thought that was insane.  (it was back then)<br />
<br />
I picked a Shaman because it was the HEALER class for BARBARIANS.  I was not min-maxing.  I was not picking the best class for the role that I wanted to play.  I started Sion back before we knew what those roles would be.  At that time we had no idea that SLOWER would be a role.  <br />
<br />
To be honest many of us old timers went into this class with little idea about what the class would become.  Most of us selected our class based more on roleplay or &quot;what we thought was cool&quot; as opposed to any tactial raid value.  All this raiding stuff developed later.<br />
<br />
Some jerks may say, &quot;Well then if you are playing a class that you think is cool, it should not matter what abilities or limitations the class has.&quot;  BS!  I pay the same price as players playing non-Shaman or the deluded folks who are content with being second class characters.  It was and is the job of the game Developers to make sure that my class and every other player's class is viable.  <br />
<br />
I have said before that I started out soloing a lot because that is wha t I did in UO.  Verant made it clear that GROUPING was the way they wanted the game played and tweaked the game accordingly.  They were right.  The game is better played socially.  NOW after spending years getting used to playing with other folks, I am being told that I am a great SOLO class and that is why I suck (relatively) in raids and in groups.  That is freaking cruel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is the class description from Kunark (and it hadn't changed up through Planes of Power):<br />
Shaman. Similar to a Cleric, but closer to a tribal witch doctor, the Shaman can be found amongst the more primative races. Her primary focus is healing, but she can employ many augmentation and offensive spells as well.<br />
<br />
When did you make your shaman, SP?  And was it your first real character (so you had a chance to see other shamans in game before starting your own)?<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be antagonistic...Ive found that people who have an OLD shaman look at us as healers and slowers.  People who have a NEW shaman think we slow and DoT.</div></div><hr />

so yea, i'm not an old timer and would have never known that slows, at one time, never existed.<br />
<br />
anyways, pardon me for maybe coming off harsh on this thread, it was just upsetting to be a shammy, in a shammy community and seeing all this hate towards the shammy.<br />
<br />
but after reading just a couple answers to my most recent question, i understand where people are coming from now.<br />
<br />
i still love the shammy and i don't think it will ever change. if it does, it's teh day i quit playing EQ.<br />
<br />
thanks for the responses. by all means, please continue discussing :)<br />
<br />
oh yea, i guess i should tell you why i picked the shammy...<br />
<br />
i was sitting on the shoreline on ogre island waiting for the raft to come take me away to Oasis. i was a lvl 24 rogue at the time (Funderbunk Bunderfunk). an ogre shammy was sitting next to me. (i just grouped with him not too long ago too...but his name escapes me atm) i didn't know *** he was, just that he was an ogre. at the time, yes i was a n00b, i didn't think ogres could cast spells.<br />
<br />
anyways he stands up and starts casting. i was blown away. honestly, i thought that was the greatest thing since sliced bread. i didn't even know what he was casting, it was just amazing to see an ogre casting spells. after becoming one i later realized he was canni'ing.<br />
<br />
so anyways, i go to the net and do some research on the shammy. i look at the spells they get and, again, i was blown away at all the shammy could do. heal, nuke, dot, cure, debuff, slow, buff, summon stuff, pets, etc...the list was endless.<br />
<br />
pretty much the versitility of the shammy got me hooked.<br />
<br />
at the time i was bored with the rogue. i wanted a class that could heal and buff. but i wanted to do more than just heal (i didn't want to be the primary healer). so a cleric was out of the question. plus i wanted to be an ogre. so a druid was out of the question. i also wanted to be able to solo.<br />
<br />
the shaman did and still fulfills those needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">At that time there WAS no slow that we were aware of.<br />
<br />
So few remember this...<br />
<br />
The first time I used Slow was in level 39 and no one really knew what the spell was doing(or how good the effect was going to be). I tested it on a HG and I didn't notice much(hard to notice when DoT kiting~) till I finally figured it out a few hours later. <br />
I then proceeded using it in Lower Guk and people started to notice how mobs were hitting Slower, and that's when I started using Slow on a regular basis.<br />
This was in June 1999, I believe.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">What do I do on raids? Mostly screw around on the clear chatting. I loot corpses (sometimes its not even my own!) and take tells on loot. I hand out stuff from the bank people need, spells, and reagents (hear that clerics... your GUILD should cover dots, stop whining, k thx). I discuss strats, and targets, and whos doing a good job, and who is wiping us.  I talk w recruits to make sure they know whats going on.  My officer duties are far more useful and interesting than my class duties, and of more benefit. There are normally 2-3 other shamans who can do the exact same thing that I do, and they are normally bored as well.<br />
<br />
Mobs die so fast that I really question the point of me doing anything, including debuffing. We decided to do nothing one raid, and no one even said anything lol. I pretend to heal my group and sometimes try and sometimes compete with the other shamans to malos on inc, and thats really it. Our beastlords slow, because they can handle the aggro better, and theirs is just as good. Sometimes I nuke, but really... HOW long for a 1k &quot;big bomb&quot;? la-de-da. Good luck landing it before the mob dies.<br />
<br />
In typical boss fights, we take bets on if the cleric who stuns on inc dies or not, malos, slow, then I normally spam my stupid piece of crap heal because its marginally less useless than my stupid piece of crap nuke. I might throw a FA on one of my friends. FA is the key to shaman stacking you know. Sometimes I torpor a sk in revenge for voiceing me. In general, I am aware of how little it means to have me there. Sometimes we get together and decide to all mgb our 544 heal at the same time for ****s and giggles. Or group charisma. Nothing swings a battle more!<br />

Oh, and I shrink and grow tards who forgot their shrink device $$.  The leetest class ability evar according to Dirtnap!<br />

First of all, let me get a tissue, I think my eyes are bleeding. Secondly, you are obviously not reading all the posts, or not understanding what you read. No one here thinks shamans suck. We simply think that we are being left behind in the upgrade department while other classes are being given much more efficient abilities. You need to relax a little, too, and wipe the spittle off your screen. I think your missing the point.<br />
<br />
I dont want to be a cleric.<br />
<br />
I dont want to be a wizard.<br />
<br />
I dont want to be an enchanter.<br />
<br />
I dont want to be a tank.<br />
<br />
I want to be a little of each, a combination no other class has. <br />
<br />
Saddly, when SOE decided to add the Beastlord class, they must have also decided to make them considerably better than us. They buff better, they provide more DPS, they tank better, and they have an amazing pet and a pet heal that is bigger than our biggest heal. This, more than anything, is what chaps my a$$. BLs have been able to maintain desirability and effectivness in groups and stackability on raids because of what they bring to the table in addition to what they inherited from their &quot;parent class&quot; (us), namely solid DPS and an MGBable hp/mana regen. <br />
<br />
If the people here didnt care about the class, they would probably have given up long ago. Perhaps you are one of those &quot;new age&quot; shamans who started your character in Dec of '03, so you have nothing to compare your abilities too. You have been the same all your &quot;life&quot; (/snicker). <br />
<br />
Personally, I dont wanna be the guy who is responsible for healing the clerics all night, or buffing the dead, like some other joker posted on another thread. I want to contribute and be effective in my own, special way. I used to. I stll can with some MINOR tweaks. But right now, I dont feel that way too often.</div></div><hr />

Here is what I want to do in most fights. Debuff (Malos, slow), fast heal the MA while a CH (dru or cleric) is going off, drop a decent nuke that actually budges the mobs health, then HoT whoever took damage when it dies. The problem is if I do thatone fight, then don;t do it the next fight, there is almost NO appriciable difference between battles. If a wizard doesnt nuke or a Rogue doesnt backstab, you notice. If a cleric doesnt heal you notice. If an MA doesnt taunt, you notice. If we dont slow or heal or nuke, its hard to notice, especially in a 30-40 second fight.<br />

There is some raid content that will wreck you bad, but then again, there is some that wont. I realize the trash in Gates is bigger than the EPs, but still, with LR5, 7K hps, and a knight ready to snag aggro ASAP, odds are I won't get 1 or 2 rounded, even by 1K hitting trash. <br />

There is a thread here on this board now descibing a different situation in KT. You cannot universally blanket every situation the same, even within the same zone. As I said, I am not KT flagged, I simply cannot play the 4+ hour chunks straight that are required to get by Tipt and Vxed. My guildies, however, are telling me MOST fights in KT last longer than those trial zones. As far as the &quot;KT and above&quot; I would put it even lower, Tipt/Vxed and above its all about DPS. /shrug, I will see when I get there. <br />
<br />
Oh, and yes, my guildmates often asked me along for Tipt and Vxed trial groups, knowing full well that I am far less effective in these zones than another class would be. However, they are my friends, and we like to play with each other, and there is something to be said for the challange being a bigger part of the game than the flag itself. 90% of todays problems in EQ is that the ROAD has become trivial and the DESTINATION is all that matters anymore. <br />

Exactly I do all that **** but it makes no difference. Except the ds on the tank makes the mob go down faster..<br />
I don' exactly understand where you think I stand on Shaman issues. Perhaps you should do a search and read some of my posts. I have been in the EPs a while, I am one god from Time, I have solid gear (havent updated in a while, but I break 7100 hps now withuot leadership), decent AA (200+), and I consider myself a fairly skilled knowledgable player. Looking at your magelo, I would say we are fairly equal, perhaps your guild is pushing into Gates faster than mine, we are concentrating on Time for now. But either way, the yard trash in Gates raids are probably about the same as Ice, Water and Vapor on Coir, and although those guys kill me eventually, I can take a couple rounds, for sure.</div></div><hr />
