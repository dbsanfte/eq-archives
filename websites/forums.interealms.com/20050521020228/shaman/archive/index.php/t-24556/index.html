<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I know Gloriana might move this to the alchemy forum but I wanted to post it here to get everyones opinion as that forum see a lot less reading. <br />
<br />
Would anyone beside me like to see a new item or two added to the game that has a &gt;5% alchemy mod on it? The philosophers stone (10% mod) from Griegs no longer drops (well the mob that drops it no longer spawns but it amounts to the same thing) and Vex Thal is several expansions old now so most shaman will never have a shot at the 15% mod. <br />
<br />
I know this wouldn't be high on most shamans lists but with all the new uses for alchemy in oow it would have seemed appropriate to me if they had added new 10 and 15 % items to go with the expansion to give those of us who enjoy alchmey something to strive for. As is in a raiding guild there is a near zero chance of ever seeing the inside of VT again and well the other mod is no longer available. Granted not all of oow has been seen and so there may be one out there. <br />
<br />
Like I said before though, we have many serious issues to address and I don;t want to take any attention away from those. However if one of those with the devs ears has the time maybe pass along this thought. It would really be nice to have a decent mod available somewhere that could be abtained by players working on the current content. Personally I would think making a 10% available to non uber-guild shaman and maybe a 15% available somewhere in the high end oow zones would go a long way towards reinforcing the idea that they do care about alchemy and the shaman that practice it.<br />
<br />
(honestly i think its time for a full set of tradeskill mods accross all skills to come out with the new expansion. We tradeskillers have all been waiting since luclin to see any significant new tradeskill mod items.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you prolly have better luck and support if you post at eqtraders</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kinadorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can get a tinkered item for 5% I think but I agree that they should have more 10-15% items available as drops for all tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yah I have the 15% items for smithing and alchemy, but have always wanted the tailoring one. No one ever wants to do SV though so new items would be great. Make them quested or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe its nice and all if your guild does VT... my guild did it a LONG time ago, never saw a single orb, and now would never go back to a zone so many expansions back. Granted, VT has nice items for a raiding guild to gear up for a march to the elementals but for a guild that farms time weekly and is pushing deeper into god and oow as a focus theres just no way to get a good tradeskill mod for alchemy these days :(<br />
<br />
(and yes I am well aware of the tinkered and trophy mods but 5% really is not much of a boost when the new oow combines have such high trivials. If you use the formulas for a success, a 10 or 15% mod makes a rather large difference in your chances to suceed. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Before I retired, I put my Philo stone up for sale.... it was gone in minutes at 20K.<br />
<br />
I think there is definitely a demand for the higher skill mod items.</div></div><hr />
