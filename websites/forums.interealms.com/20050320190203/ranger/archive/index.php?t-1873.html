<br />
As youth, we learn a lot from our friends and our experiences. If we never stick our hand on the match, and get burnt. Later we may stick our hand into a campfire, and lose the arm. AN analogy obviously... if a parent doesn't let the kid out hes either A) Not gonna learn any of the things you need to learn from experience, or B) End up hating himself, his life, and his parents because he doesnt know how to live.<br />

Seriously, it's what I did.  My ultra-conservative, believes-every-aids-needle-in-coke-machine- lie she hears, constantly worrying mother now lets me stay out until 1-2 in the morning and such.  I can dye my hair, listen to pretty much any music I want, and so forth.  <br />
<br />
Or run away from home for a little bit.  Give 'em a good scare.  <br />
<br />
Or try to spend endless nights rationally debating them about it.  Even when they tell you you're going to be grounded if you don't shut up, keep at it.  Just tell them over and over they need to back off a little bit.  I spent a lot of time grounded, but now that my parents know they can trust me, I do pretty much whatever.<br />
<br />
Then I discovered EQ, and I never wanted to leave house again anyways.  Hooray for burn out and real life!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still agree with vader though.  If you are going to have a choice between two unhealthy extremes, overprotection is better than neglect. It is easier to learn something later that you missed if you are alive to learn it.  With neglect you are not always given this chance. :(<br />

Her mother wants to know what time she will be home. .and I mean EXACTLY and not ONE minute off.  ..She was worried about her staying the night at my place in case my husband corrupted her with alcohol or something. . .  She was and IS truely off the wall.  They get along GREAT so long as my friend doesnt stay home long lol<br />
<br />
I think all that saved me was my sister. She was such a wild thing that they were practicly thanking saints to find me so agreable to a curfew hehehe, and consequently, since SHE knew that my friends mom was worse, we got to stay at each other's houses CONSTANTLY overnight to escape, I ended up with a midnight curfew on weekends and an 11pm on school nights.<br />
<br />
If I was you, i would emphasise the supervision that would be present at any trip or party you want to go to.  Make a point of whining at how overprotective they are(the supervision)  or how overly carefull and they may feel more comfy in lettin ya go and not flip flop like they just did ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My parents were extremely protective and strict. I learned at an early age what they would be willing to say &quot;yes&quot; to and what they wouldn't. I just learned not to ask about the things they wouldn't like.<br />
<br />
After graduation, most of the class was having a kegger/hot tub party at a rented warehouse outside of town. My dad, a HS teacher heard about it and forbid me to go. He was also a volunteer fireman and EMT. At about 3:30 the next morning, he had to go drag some of my classmates out of a ditch where there drunken driving had landed them. No seatbelts, and two of them nearly died. These weren't bad kids you expected to see in this situation some day. It was the salutatorian, his twin brother and the senior class president. If Ihad been drinking at that party, there's no telling if I might have been in the car with them. I always hated it when my parents were right.<br />
<br />
My freshman year of college I was a little wild, but actually not nearly so wild as the experienced partiers around me. I tried a little, and figured out that my parents were actually right. It wasn't worth it.<br />
<br />
I would have to say that much worse comes from neglectful parents than from the overprotective ones. Of course, I don't really like the word &quot;overprotective.&quot; Most parents that would be called over protective by their kids, I think are the ones actually parenting instead of standing back and letting their kids run the show.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't allowed out with my friends in the evening you know stuff like that. However as I grew up they came to trust me more and eventually realised that I was capable of deciding right from wrong and so relaxed their hold a great deal and allowed me to live my life as I pleased.<br />
<br />
I used to severely resent them but now I realise they were only looking out for my best interests.</div></div><hr />

They may be clueless about a lot of things, but then they've been there and done that and know how they were as kids.  They probably played every angle you've thought of and a few more besides.  Work with them, eventually they will loosen the leash, keep the rebellion sensible.<br />

Life gets better, trust me.</div></div><hr />

Overprotection = bad<br />
Neglect = more bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deeger</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd recommend every parent (especially parents of girls) to read &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot; by Mary Pipher.<br />
<br />
In her practice she found that girls with parents who set rules and boundaries (ie. something that could be construed as strict and overprotecting) often had a better sense of self and were better prepared for later life.<br />
<br />
Obviously this is anecdotal and hardly universal, but it's something to think about.</div></div><hr />

Just be glad they care <br />
Do they care or are the just glad to have someone to exert control over? Or are they neurotically nervous? I've known parents of each type... <br />
<br />
My girlfriends ROOMMATES do this stuff to her... she gets yelled at for being late home from classes, they want to know where she is anytime she isn't in the apartment. They HATE me because she was over at my place, passed out from blood sugar trouble, and I refused to allow them to take her back to their house (where no one would be home). She tried to come visit me one night and the alpha dog of the house got in her face and physically blocked her from leaving! Now... this roommate may say 'she cares so much and doesnt want people getting hurt', but really, all she wants is to show her power. Parents can be like that too.</div></div><hr />

My questions would be is how many adults were going to be on this trip and do your parents know them?  I love my son to death and worry about him every second of the day but still let him have as much freedom as any other kid his age.  Thats very little, he is only 7 going on 18(in his mind).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rogan</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am proud to say that between myself and a friend of mine we have resqued one of our mutual friends from an incredably overprotective mom. We had to practicaly kidnap him on weekends leaving messages that hes at one of our houses or gone to a movie be back later but after a while she caught on and now my friend has about as much freedom as I do so in other words get your friends to leave the messages and ask your parents because your parents cant get mad at your friends or ground them and if they ground you for your friends asking them if you can go over then seriously consider running away but I doubt they are THAT over protective<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phantom042</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It needs to be pointed out that good intentions, while necessary for good parenting, do not by themselves make for good parenting. Although my parents had good intentions, my father wasn't good at dealing with the irrationality of a child (he's an engineer), and my mother couldn't handle me being no longer a child, but not yet an adult (she's a social worker, but has only worked with young children since before I was born).<br />
<br />
Consequently, during my entire young life, one of my parents was &quot;the mean one.&quot; Although still only slightly removed from this time, I know that this wasn't a construct of my imagination.<br />
<br />
Running away is NOT a solution. I tried it twice, at about 10 and 12, and it just made things worse. If your parents agree on something, but you think its irrational or unfair, you've got two choices. If they strongly agree there's no way to change their minds. You can either deal with it and be unhappy, or just tell them you're not going to follow their stupid rule, do your thing, and deal with the consequences.<br />
<br />
Due to the state of things, I've hardly seen my parents since last June, never feel like I want to talk to them, and doubt this will change. I do get along with my father, except on the issue of my mother, so this is the only reason I consented to come home at all. My little bro is also growing up, and becoming more fun.<br />
<br />
Being neglected would have been worse, but not being able to stand the presence of your mother is pretty bad too.</div></div><hr />
