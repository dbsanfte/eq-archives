<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure some of you have experience with Faydedar, specifically the druid epic version.  My guild tried him yesterday, and failed, mainly to the fact that not a single spell landed, not even necro lifetaps.  Has his MR always been that high or is that something from the recent &quot;Caster NPC&quot; tuning?<br />
On a side note, I burned through a whole mana bar of resisted slows and cripples, without drawing aggro once.  Was the last man standing, felt kind of ignored :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Worked on this guy for my friends epic.  Had quite a bit of trouble but finally killed him.  You need to have a melee heavy group of people...prefereably 55+ but definately 50+ (Under 55 get hit hard with proc and fear).  Main assist should be 55+ and use defensive.  Buff up with a few dummy buffs (he dispells on his ae) and then usefull one.  Fire, AC and HP buffs are most important.  It also really helps to have a bard with the AE fire resist.  All casters move on to the hill, they can avoid the AE here.  Main tank sits on beach with other melee back near the hill.  Druid hands in piece spawning Fay,  Main tank engages and hits defensive.  Clerics come down to beach to keep MA alive but avoid agro.  After 30 seconds or so, all other melees attack.  Healers heal main tank.  Around 30% health, casters dump mana, I believe that you can only hit with cold based attacks.  Main thing is for the MA to keep agro.  If he doesnt, then Fay will either pingpong or summon healers and caster which was why we failed so many times.  NOTE:  if you are wiped by Fay, then have all log onto an alt or chatroom for a while.  Fay has been know to corpse camp that beach.  Fay will despawn after a while but each time it agros, that timer is reset.  Another option is to summon bodies.  Neither being very fun.  Good Luck i hope this helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fay fights for me have gone either Super Easy - or  Ugly wipe outs.    If you wipe doing the Druid Epic ... CR can be a problem due to the small area that he spawns.   SK/Necro corpse summoning is the best bet for quick CR's.   Best Method I've seen is duo summoner's with a Enc/Mage.   Summoner's and Enc set up on the Boat Island and Mage sits inside the first ring for CoH.  That saves tons of time but it's costly (ie coffins).<br />
<br />
The super easy fights had a common factor.    A few Lvl 60 Tanks with good gear (resists included) will make this a cake walk.    Add a few Damage Dealers with good gear to the mix and Fay has no chance.    <br />
<br />
I have seen Fay get killed by a party of 9 and heard that a strong party of 6 can do it quite easy.    The fight I saw was 3 lvl 60 Tanks with Kael gear - 2 lvl 60 Cleric's - 1 lvl 58 Monk ( resist gear) - 1 lvl 59 Pally (resist gear) - 1 lvl 60 Shaman ( SS - plus resist gear ) and lvl 57 Druid (for the quest).   I was part of the earlier group that wiped - and this was guild/friends that had come to help.   They setup - started - finished the fight before the rest of the first group could get back from CR's to help.    It was a walk in the park compared to our wipe.   We almost made it on our fight (got Fay to 10%) but in the end we wiped because our tanks were 58- 59 - without good gear.    Being lvl 60, AA pts, and right Gear changes the whole prespective of the game.<br />
<br />
BTW - I have been the last one standing a couple times on this fight as I've got ok resist gear but once Fay turns his attention to you melee you're toast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We used two groups and mopped him up with me casting Torpor on my group when they were 1 bub down just because i was bored.  Didnt bother slowing him, had a 60SK as Main tank.  Not one person died..... okay the bard but do they really count? :)  I agree as long as the agro is on the MA you are golden.  Dont get agro because the bard went down in litterally 3 seconds.  Biggest thing was the melee damage since the wiz was not landing anything other than lures for 1/2 damage.<br />
<br />
60 sk MA<br />
58 sk<br />
60 rogue x2<br />
60 warrior<br />

56 cleric<br />

was a done deal.  *shrug* you got unlucky i'd say is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is the one Raid style Mob I have had some experience with.  I have been on enough raids with different people running them that I have seen different tactics put to use.  The main thing is keep the casters and healers out of the range of the AoE.  I am only level 49, and have done Fay several times since turning 45 or so.  I have NEVER been feared though, so I am not sure why some say the fear is a problem.  I don't have much MR gear, and only wore FR gear for the raid.  My general tips.<br />
<br />
Let the main tank build agro for a good 30 seconds before calling assist.<br />
<br />
Fay agroes on low HP, so keep everyone above half life if at all possible.<br />
<br />
Have everyone MAX their FR.  summond mage blankets and shields are a big help.<br />
<br />
I tell the melles in my group to stay on the near side of Fay, so I can dart in to heal them, and back out.  Alternatively I have seen a guild call for their melees to leave combat and run toward their appointed healer for a heal.  This keeps the healers completely out of the AoE damage.<br />
<br />
The last raid I attended featured only one 50 plus cleric.  In this raid I was appointed the task to keep him alive from the AoE damage he was taking.  An interesting feature of this raid was that the lack of MT healing was compensated for by having the 4 pallys on the raid set up a LoH order.  Once the MT engaged they walked up one at a time and stood next to him.  When the MT reached 2 bubs or so of health the Pally would LoH and call it out.  This saved the clerics all of the healing in the beginning of the fight.<br />
<br />
I have never seen Fay slowed.<br />
<br />
The one thing I have always wondered is if Lull would stick on Fay.  Since this is a MOB where ping pong kills, if you could reduce the range Fay would agro from low HP, you would reduce this encounter to near trivial.  The only wipes I have seen were caused by The dragon ping ponging between low HP healers, and straggled melees.<br />
<br />
Also No sitting, and if you are low HP and see Fay turn to face you...give it up and charge him.  You dying at his feet is much better than having him walk over to you to kill you..Ping pong kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did a faydar raid a while ago.  The main reaosn spells don't land for some ppl is if ur not in melee range.  I decided we lacked dmg so what i mostly did was nuke. I ended up doing like 6684 dmg or something like that.  That's 20% of his health.  Don't underestimate the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">we did faydedar for the druid epic long long ago.<br />
<br />
damn, hard to remember the levels and classes now but I think it was.<br />
<br />
60 monk tanked<br />
60 cleric<br />
57 bard<br />
56 druid <br />
55 wizard<br />
55 shaman (me)<br />
54 enchanter bot for buffs<br />
54 warrior<br />
54 bard<br />
52 ranger<br />
52 rogue<br />
<br />
Was slightly less than 2 groups.   I knew I wasn't going to slow him, so I focused on healing the AE dmg while the cleric kept the monk alive.  Piece of cake.<br />
<br />
I am thinking of doing the druid epic for my portbish soon and I guess I will revisit this guy.   I don't think I would take more than my regular 6 people though.<br />
<br />
Use agro management to keep him on one person.  Have clerics heal that person, have other priests heal the AE dmg on the other players.  Nukers and Melees do their thing.  Should be an easy kill for your buddy druids.  :)<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
-Henora</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just make sure all the tanks have 100+ magic resist for the fear, and good fire resist for the AE (if they are in front: Fay's fire only goes to the front). <br />
<br />
When druid does turn in, everybody except the MT should be standing so Faydedar will aggro and run straight to MT. Have the other tanks engage from the sides and rear while MT holds aggro and faces dragon away from the healers. <br />
<br />
As far as debuffs, dont worry about it. Just get tank heavy and healers and beat him down. We've killed him about 10 times, and I didnt bother debuffing him any of those times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ditto on the debuffing...don't bother.  Done this about 9 times now and only died once.<br />
<br />
Keep casters close to the back wall for the original pull. MT sits so Fay aggro's her.  Everyone holds back until MT has plenty of aggro, then melee's charge and healers move in and out of range.  <br />
<br />
My job?  I keep clerics and wizzy's alive so everything moves smoothly. I give buffs and resists as needed (potions work well for this if you have any around).  I have made a pet for several of these attempts..but they typically poof after the first fear (I assume doggie sticks in the wall and sucks up AOE damage).<br />
<br />
Typically I wait until things are inevitable..then run in and melee it.  Most importantly I keep an eye on my own health.  I actually purchased a pair of those +5 fire earrings they sell in lavastorm just for this fight.  Get an elemental blankie and keep your FR up and you will always be standing at the end of this fight.<br />
<br />
(/rant on: my guild has done NINE of these this year alone..and we only have 3 epic druids left in guild..not exactly a good investment for the time. Druids are very indepentant sorts.  G_d forbid I should get 2 mages and a few clerics to COM to finish MY epic..there's even a direct portal to it! /rant off)</div></div><hr />
