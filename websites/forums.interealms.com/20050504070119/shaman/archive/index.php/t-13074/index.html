<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys and gals.<br />
<br />
Dont read unless bored. heh. you have been warned.<br />
<br />
First off I've been reading here for a while, but this is my first post.<br />
I'll tell you my story, last night i started my fourth Shaman, a Barbarian Shaman on Maelin. My first Shaman was my first character ever, which i Started in December, i had bo clue about anything in the game, but i had a freind who i worked with that had played since beta (but had quit pre-luclin). My first shaman was a Barb also, but not knowing anything I messed his faction in Halas and Qeynos killing stuff i should have =) and got frustrated being killed by NPCs and not really knowing anything about shaman (I tried meleeing everything, hardly ever used spells so when i did i fizzled... a lot) I also dumped all my starting points into STR and a few into CHA (go figure). I was also in blackburrow until like level 17 (not realizing greens didnt give EXP) until i got SoL and PoP and someone showed me PC. <br />
<br />
So I decided to start a Ranger (Half Elf Karana same starting points mistakes lol) Who is now level 37 and my highest character. I made pretty good coin with my shaman selling trade skill stuff in the bazaar and also decided to start a Gnome Enchanter (sounded like the perfect tradeskiller to me with Jewelcraft and Tinkering among the rest) He's now level 25.<br />
<br />
Then LoY came out and a new server, I decided to move to the new server, but being out of work i could only afford to move 2 characters, so i chose the ranger and chanter since i considered the shaman &quot;screwed up&quot;. so I loaded my ranger and chanter with the gear from my shaman figuring I would start a new shaman on Maelin. Well I did and this time i chose Vah Shir. Infravision was nice, but I missed Slam, And the fur was Kinda Itchy and it just didnt seem as fun. So at level 9. delete. Went back to playing my ranger and chanter and bazaar whoring.<br />
<br />
Ended up with some really nice stuff watching people sell stuff cheeep on the new server (example: hardened clay bracer, 100p and Froglak scale BP for like 200p), a lot of it was rng/rog/shm so i had a lot left over after outfitting my ranger. So I started thinking about Shaman again (since rogue didnt appeal to me much) and I found the Crucible, after reading for days on end at work I decided a Troll Innoruuk was the way to go. Even picked a decent name which ismy login name now, Pane (was gonna shoot for surname of N'Sufferin lol).<br />
<br />
But. All my friends were playing in Qeynos and BB while I was in Nektulos where i was somewhat safe. So i decided to voyage to BB but no matter how careful i was there was alwyas some guard or other NPC waiting to kill me. Never been a fan of KOS, and I know with luclin I can still do good n non KOS zones, but staying in one zone/area to level up as much as possible is boring, i like to travel and see different zones without having to worry so much about being killed by guards and stuff (got enough mobs to worry about haha). It wasn't fun,which is why I play. And to top it off I couldnt even do the Necklace quests without faction work (faction which I didnt know how to fix).<br />
<br />
Level 7. Done. Well I still have him but he's nekkid, started a Barb and transfered all the gear. On passing through POK I see an OOC that MGB KEI and Aego where being cast, so about 2 hours later I was level 8. And having a blast as a Barb Shaman, I can easily group with all my friends (who are all good aligned races even if they are bad class (ie Human SK)). Also I dumped all my points but 5 into STA and the other 5 in WIS.<br />
<br />
So, Just though I'd share my story with some Fellow Shamans. I've gotten lots of good tips from you even if you dont know it, and added lots of gear to my wish list lol. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good first post Pane.  Welcome to the community.  I never bothered to introduce myself.  For some reason, the name Pane reminds me of the comic book character that came out before Spawn.  Some one syllable named character with fingers of steel.  Anyways, I recall way back in the day when I was a newb Ogre shaman wandering the good lands of the Karanas, and Faydwer.  I died several times, I remember most vividly the named tree in North Karana towards the east side of the zone.  I didn't even see it.  He started casting, I was like this probably isn't good.  He killed me with one cast!  I didn't even see the tree, he blended in so well with everything else.<br />
I was trembling on my way back to my corpse, thinking to myself what huge aggro radius this guy must have.  Where the heck is my corpse.  It was all rather amusing.  Since then, my favorite moment was in Greater Faydark quite some time ago when someone trained the banker on me.  He happened upon me near the lift to the wood elf city.  My friend was sitting across from me.  He was like, RUN!  I stood there, and killed the banker like the goody goody Ogre hating fool that he was!  Good stuff.<br />
Trolls are cool.  Dodging around the stupid guards in the Karanas is fun.  Trying to get on a boat, or invis'ing through a city that you are KOS to is also tons of fun.  You miss out on all that being a barbarian.<br />
Shaman of Tunare<br />
ps - I think my time has come to go back and find that good for nothing tree in East Karana, and teach it a lesson he'll not soon forget!  I'm 61 now, it could prove interesting.  Talking about holding a grudge for an exhorbitant amount of time lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stick with it this time, you wont regret it, Im a barbarian and Ive never looked back or wished I could be evil with faction problems.  There are plenty of other ways to make the game exciting other than dying just trying to accomplish a regular task like getting on a boat or trying to buy food.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mazuli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I started EQ April 2000.  My first char I kept longer than a week was made August 2000.  It's pretty common to delete and try again when you're new.  You're lucky though, you can level so fast now with KEI and Paludal and such that you can really get to where the class begins to shine within a week (paludal can take you to 25 fast).  I had to spend a week to get to level 15 or so hehe.  Finally I stuck with druid, took me almost 2 years to get to 51 then went to a new server.  Made a rogue (april 2002).  Got to 60 around end of February 2003.<br />
<br />
The more experience you have with the game, the faster you'll level.  That and the expansions now make leveling so much faster.  The funny thing is it took me to level 60 to realize I hate rogue.  A lot.  Stupid class &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />
