<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hadina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I tried to log in today after the patch and it tells me that I've been BANNED for &quot;inappropriate behavior.&quot; Lately all I've been doing is soloing with my bard or mage..... what the heck is going on?<br />
<br />
Anyone else been banned and managed to get their account back? I hope customer service helps me out and at least tells me what I did...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Banned and got it back? No.....<br />
<br />
So really fess up..what did you do?!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anyone else have your PW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">friend of mine was also banned recently for the same thing, it was because they had changed the billing creditcard apparently...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Check and see if your credit card info got hosed.  A guildie of mine got banned because his parents contested the charges (I guess he wasn't supposed to be charging their card :P).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you truly are not in the wrong then there's a screw lose somewhere.  Friend of mine got a similar out-of-the-blue automated e-mail from Mythic when he was playing DAoC saying they had placed a warning on his account, but gave no specifics.  Apparently others had gotten a similar message as well.<br />
<br />
Definitely investigate this and see what's up.  They ususally don't straight out ban unless you've done something REALLY bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its possible the wrong account got banned: if thats the case querying it should be enough for reinstatement.  Look on EQLive for the email address of your GM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Someone in my boyfriend's guild got banned because her ex stopped paying for her EQ bill for her. It said the same thing - banned for inapproriate behavior.  She went thru a lot of crap, but got her account back w/in a few weeks.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Banned for swearz0ring at teh GM! w00t.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Had the same thing happen to a guildy, was a billing error on their side that had caused it. Email the GM on your server through the EQ Live website.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As it's been mentioned before you just need to contact the EQ Account Status team.  Here is the official &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.station.sony.com/esupport/esupport/consumer/esupport.asp?id=GUID9c98320e%5F765e%5F11d7%5F9c08%5F080020fb302c&amp;resource=&amp;number=0&amp;isExternal=0&amp;nShowFacts=&amp;nShowCause=&amp;nShowChange=&amp;nShowAddInfo=&amp;activepage=statement.asp&amp;bForceMatch=&amp;strCurrentSymptom=&amp;searchtype=normal&amp;searchclass=&amp;bnewsession=false&amp;selecttype=normal&quot;&gt;support article&lt;/a&gt; on what to do.<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure there is only one message for all accounts that are inactive by anything other than you canceling it yourself.  So billing problems and legit bans all appear as the same thing, &quot;banned by behavior&quot;.<br />
<br />
(edit, man I need to proofread before I post.  Bad grammer is killing me.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hadina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the replies, it probably has something to do with the billing because I sure didn't do anything in game. I hope i can get it straightened out.<br />
<br />
I don't think I would just be banned outright for something in game, I've never even gotten a warning on my account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got a warning once for calling someone a jackass in ooc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You are right.  We all shared this guys account, so we were sweating that one of us had done something wrong.  They really should have a more descriptive message, &quot;Banned for innapropriate behaviour&quot; doesn't sound like it has a damned thing to do with billing problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zarlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I feel for ya bud, id hate to try and log into EQ and get denied my play time for no reason.  My friend used to play the game just to cause a ruckuss. LOL he thinks im one of the ubah twinkies because im level 44 and ive done no PLing lol. One time he made a cleric named &quot;Jesusthechrist&quot; and ran all around Norrath healing people, the whole time doing /who all GM. When one finally came on he camped and ran with his tail inbetween his legs lol.  That character exists to this day but can only be on for about 5 minutes before someone reports him lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I got a warning once for calling someone a jackass in ooc.<br />
<br />
heh, well I got a warning once waaaay back in the day when I called a guide a waste of band-width :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>MojoTroll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hadina,<br />
<br />
I had the same thing happen to me last week - only not after the patch, after jumping through hoops and FINALLY tracking down someone reasonable at SOE - I have gotten it pretty much all straightened out now and my account is being re-activated today - it ended up being an account payment problem - from about 3 months back when I changed credit cards that my account was being billed to.<br />
<br />
If you haven't gotten anywhere with getting your account problem fixed/resolved yet - send me an email at the link in my SIG - and I can send you the email address of the person I dealt with who has helped me out greatly in getting the problem resolved.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Interesting -- this just happened to my family's accounts.  Changed info on them a while back, it takes a few months for them to notice this stuff?<br />
<br />
Hm, on 2nd thought, we're on one of the longer billing programs, so that makes sense.<br />
<br />
Still, one would think they'd have some sort of msg saying there's a billing problem, if indeed it is one.<br />
<br />
My kids all swear they didn't do anything to get the accounts locked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A friend of my sister got banned when she gave her account away to him after his account got banned by this one guy who told GMs he was account sharing, both times, when in fact he was neither.  Things like that happen all the time, maybe someone falsely reported you.</div></div><hr />
