<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pingpang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im currently lvl'ing up a ranger to dual-box with my Shaman after having tried both a monk and a SK as a partner (and found them both lacking). Before I go much further, I'd like some input from those who have tried this combo. Simply, will the ranger be able to tank well enough from lvl 40 on to make this a viable pairing?<br />
<br />
I realize that slow will lessen the damage taken considerably, and that I'll have the ability to fear kite animals, but I don't want to spend a lot of time medding/canni'ing to get back mana used to heal the ranger i.e. pull a mob then spend 5-10 mins before I can pull another.<br />
<br />
Any input would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes.  I duoed with a Ranger friend in Chardok quite a bit.  Even with the hard hitting mobs there at 52 he was able to tank the slowed ones.  Get matching Fungis and you will be all set.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My usual duo partner is a ranger.  Works great.  I can generally keep up with healing her and still get in there and melee if I feel like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SurfinShammy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I have a 51 shammy and an almost 45 ranger. I solo with shammy and group my ranger with my 52 shamaness wife. <br />
<br />
We haven't really experiments though I have duoed on the shammy with SK's and Monkeys. Dps if buffs and mobs slowed are good but I love the Ranger/Shammy duo my wife and I have. Monks can put out some High dps but they lack one thing that kills shammies. Taunt.<br />
<br />
With my ranger I do some good dps damage. <br />
With my ranger and slowed mobs I can tank very well.<br />
With my ranger, slowed mobs and buffs I am dangerous.<br />
With my ranger, slowed mobs, shammy buffs and haste I am a flippin frenzied weedwhacking fool on the edge of insanity. <br />
<br />
It's awesome how a ranger with good toe to toe dps to begin with gets paired with the best post 50 solo class mix will with some buffs and debuffs and we solo a ton of stuff. <br />
<br />
I mean at 44 I am able to somewhat tank ME gorangas. DL is a joke honestly. SLow lands and buffed and hasted and I take any drachnid giant or drolvarg apart in under a min (never really timed it).<br />
<br />
So it's good exp plus rangers can track to named mobs for cash purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have levelled up a halfling (!) ranger with my 60 shaman. This is an excellent duo. Anything that can be slowed can be tanked by a ranger. I duo a lot in Kael. So far the toughest giant killed was Korakaz and that was trivial after slow.<br />
<br />
Also started killing Xin Thall Centiens in ME when ranger was 54. Could get close with the level 58 ones but now its very doable.<br />
<br />
Snare, tracking and some decent buffs hps/ac/ds is a very nice addition to what a shaman can do. Only problem is that we both use chain armor LOL. Got lots of plate armor in Kael that we cant use :(<br />
<br />
Shaman + ranger = fun<br />
<br />
PS. Ranger is 56 now and using a black acrylia halberd (until he can get the first epic probably). That seems like a very fine weapon but rangers have lots and lots of weapons to choose from. And you can do the Bow of the Huntsman quest in Kael if you need a pretty decent bow.</div></div><hr />
