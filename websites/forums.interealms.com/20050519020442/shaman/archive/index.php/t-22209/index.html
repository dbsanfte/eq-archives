<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that discussions can get heated, and tempers flare over sometimes the smallest things, but are there any folks out there who just play for the fun of playing..Those who dont calculate exact DPS or parse every little thing..Those who just buy the gear cause it looks cool and works decently and value the quality time spent with friends over trying to figure out the exact value of mana per damage a spells costs?  I almost got wrapped up on the later and was , luckily, able to bring myself back to the reasons I play in the first place..To have have fun and rub my buddies noses in the near gear I have...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am trying to do that again. When I finnally gave up the ghost back in Febuary I handed over guild leadership to my small guild and faded away. <br />
<br />
The game wasnt fun anymore. <br />
<br />
i am playing again and having some fun. But it is on my own terms once again. Maybe a little GoD. (And die alot) Or head up to Hate and wander with a grin on my face from ear to ear. But the stress of leadership is gone. And while I might lead a raid or two (Only like 18 people max) I am not feeling obligated to work twice as hard as others to help make the game fun for them anymore. <br />
<br />
I was turning into a support player for other peoples fun. And you know what. That isnt a whole lot of fun after a while. Every now and again you want to shine for yourself.. I bet shaman as a whole feel the same way. Helping others is cool and all. Being the grease that makes a group tick. But dammit we need to be able to get some of that rockstar glory back that Gloriana talked about when doing ToV. We need to have some fun for ourselves. As players and for the class. <br />
<br />
My opinion of course. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I'm not having fun, I'll log off. What's the point?  They don't pay me to play so I have no obligation to play and not enjoy myself.</div></div><hr />

Fun all the way, baby! Not elemental flagged - never likely to be, with my timezone and playtime - but don't give a halfling's arse about it. It looks to me (from listening to my Elders and betters on this wonderful board) like endgame play is where the joy of being a shaman starts to leach away, so I'm not exactly in a rush to get there.<br />
<br />
I get my kicks in a more modest fashion. I was pleased as Punch the other night when I got my Grummus flag on a pick-up raid. Same when I won a stone bracelet of battle mastery in an EC hard recently. Tra la la .. one happy shaman.<br />
<br />
I set my sights low, and try to keep an eye on the fun factor. I've been playing since Kunark and still get psyched about how much I still have in front of me to do - and in content where I'm at least damn useful, if not essential.<br />
<br />
I really feel for all the endgamers out there, but I'm kinda relieved I'm not in the same boat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One of my frineds was in the same situation, he felt obligated to the role of guild leader he was so depressed that he was about to quit EQ. Finally he left and joined another guild. Later he said it's the 1st time he has fun laying EQ in months. Like Snoww wrote basicly he was support player for others. He found his fun in the game again and is anjoying it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We had a guild breakup recently over POP progression - some folks wanted to move much faster than others and got frustrated when we passed on a mob needed for progression to do backflagging, or to just have a night off.  I was one of the ones not interested in racing to the finish as fast as humanly possible, and I was on the verge of quitting when the whole thing imploded and the front-runners left for greener pastures.<br />
<br />
We're smaller now and have a lot of new members recruited to fill old spots, but we're also a lot more laid back and I for one am enjoying the game much more.</div></div><hr />
