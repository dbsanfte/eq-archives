<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wulfgyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's what I'm using currently.  It's a modified UI that incorporates much from KaoUI, Cairrenn, and of course, T. King's artwork.  Changes I've made since takin' this screenshot include swapping around the slots on the 2nd hotbutton page so all my clicky items are on page one, with my 4 most used bags there as well.  Please note, it's in 1280x1024, which is my normal resolution.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wulfgyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ack, Tankorr, that could be a bit of a problem at the moment.<br />
<br />
I'm in the Army, and am currently deployed to Kandahar, Afghanistan.  Needless to say, Internet access is crappy here, and I can't test out changes on EQ.<br />
<br />
I'll see what I can work up, mebbe I can have the wife test my coding for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tankorr Turretlizard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ACK! lol no hurry man!  use your internet time for other things rather than worrying about the ui!  I'm in the army also albeit as a Nasty Guardsman, so we're not deployed yet...  Keep making your country proud man!  -Tank<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulfgyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Okies, I think I can manage to find a way to test it.... just hafta find some spare time now, and a comprehensive list of what UI changes VI made since I posted the original file.   I like what T. King is working up for a MP3 player, so I'll probably incorporate that as well.  Like I said, testing will be touchy from here, and it may be a bit buggy at first, so keep a good working backup safe until I can iron out all the gremlins.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on improvements people would like to see?  (and descriptions of errors they've gotten will help me scrub the code, as well).<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays, and I'll try to finish it up this weekend, depending on mission requirements here.<br />

edit:  Ouch!!!  Fortunately, Cairenn has a basic walk through posted on the changes I'll need to make.  All of the bugs appear to have come from the implementation of the MP3 player and the patch on December 4th.  A quick peek shows around 18 PAGES worth of code I'll have to redo; so, I may not finish it this weekend after all :mad: .  I do intend to have it back up within a week or so, though.  --W</div></div><hr />
