<br />
Alakazhams has a poster saying its off a mob that is a part of another quest.  Please post up locs, directions, names of mobs.  I would like to get one of these before the drop rate is nerfed.<br />
<br />
Alll know I is that it drops in PoN off a thullian something.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llyric</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it dropped from the last mob in the little scripted event where you have to protect Thelin Poxbourne in the hedge maze.</div></div><hr />

Try complaining about the new harmony, that will get you 100 responses in an hour or two.<br />
What a great disapointment.<br />
Edit: BTW i don't know the answer or I would post it for you. I'd kind of like to find out myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kinolen</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone had posted it dropped off Mujaki the Devourer a day or two ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roophus Gunthar</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They drop off the werewolf things in the maze, or so I hear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elessar Elfstone</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They drop randomly off the Werewolf-type mobs in the Hedge Quest Maze, not off the boss mob.<br />
<br />
We got 2 bows one completion, and none the next 2 completions.<br />
<br />
The Quest has a maximum of 18 people, 3 groups, and requires some decent crowd control for the latter part of it. Took us an average of 1.5 to 2 hrs each time we did it. That's all I'll let out in a public post :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenas</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How long does the event usually take?  Can't really find any info on it..<br />
<br />
Also, is Mujaki the 'boss' of the event?  What kind of Tier fight would he be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MenoldarWolfkin</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No Mujaki is not a part of the maze quest. He is boss mob found inside the castle area where all the gargs and banshees are. As for the final mob in Maze Quest he is slowable and hits for 1100ish. He has a ALOT of hit points though so takes a bit to get him down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalvarian</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally the boss mob of the hedge maze (called a nightmare construct) is one of those &quot;if you can get to him you can easily kill him&quot; type things.<br />
<br />
We saw 3 bows drop our first time through and 1 the second...actualy gave the last one to a warrior cause all the rangers had one :)</div></div><hr />
