<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone had some views on playing solo in EQ2 vs. WoW. I haven't played beta in either game but from what I've read here and there it sounds like WoW would be more apprpriate for the solo player. WoW seems to have many quests that someone can do alone that can actually be completed without help from others.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think that have played one of them or both? <br />
<br />
Thanks, Eis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In WoW, everyone can solo, and soloing is almost always significantly faster xp than grouping is.  In EQ, everyone can solo, but soloing is much slower xp than grouping is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So what's the point to grouping?  Why would I want to group if I'm going to be penalized for doing so?  If I'm going to be forced to solo to be most effective, why should I pay the monthly fee when I could just buy a single player game and play whenever I want for no additional charge?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess ill try to answer that...<br />
<br />
- Friends, you can play with your friends in game if you wanted to.<br />
- Trade skills, people love creating, buying and selling wares to real people.<br />
- Player interaction, people love the fact that on the other side of those pixels there are real people even if you’re not getting exp with them.<br />
<br />
There are more things to an online RPG than exp grinding with other people.<br />
<br />
I had friends in my guild that i never once exp'd with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I really have to agree with you there Uthgar. Since I quit playing EQ a little while ago I've tried different single player games but pretty fast they become boring. Oh but how I love that pause button!!!! <br />
<br />
Many times in EQ people get with friends and group. You probably don't get much exp and spend most of the time talking to each other.<br />
<br />
Like you said, there's much more to the online game than getting exp.</div></div><hr />

In addition to other comments offered, many of the quests (and WoW is truly about quests) require more than one person - often a full group - to complete.  I have 2 level 25 characters that are 100% quest-only experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not to mention the dungeons are all group oriented. If you want to see some of the high level stuff you're going to need not only a group, but a balanced and competent one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Some dungeons are group oriented.  Below level 40 (my highest is 42), any group (full) can get through.  We cleared RFK with a group of 4 warriors and a shaman while the &quot;elitie&quot; quest was still yellow to us.<br />
<br />
Can't talk to higher levels (than 42) yet.</div></div><hr />

Uthgar has hit the nail right on the head, I gave up EQ twice for various reasons one of those being starting a family.  I played a number of solo non-online games and could not get into them, I found them too sterile.<br />
<br />
By choice I prefer to solo in EQ and I just party with people who I call friends in both RL and the Game Life.  The wolrd of EQ is more than just levelling and xp grinding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think that for me, part of the reason why single player games get boring fast is that nearly everything is programmed or scripted.  You know in a single player game that even though the dwarf or gnome is &quot;talking&quot; to you, it's all a scripted conversation that will always be the same, every time you trigger it.  In EQ/MMorpgs, nearly every character you seriously interact with is a real person.  That is what makes EQ interesting to me.</div></div><hr />
