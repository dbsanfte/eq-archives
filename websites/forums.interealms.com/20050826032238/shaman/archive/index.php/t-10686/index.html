------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
** Interface **<br />
<br />
- All settings for the Songs window should now be saved properly when the player logs out.<br />
- Fixed a bug that could cause the Bit Depth and Refresh Rate setting to not save properly upon exit.<br />
- Users of Windows XP should no longer be seeing their Windows mouse cursor or other windows 'bleed through' into the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Gameplay **<br />
<br />
- Changing from an old model character to a Luclin model character at character select should no longer result in the character having no hair.<br />
- Fixed a bug that caused merchants to charge a little extra or less (1 copper).<br />
- Merchants will no longer claim that they will pay 1 copper for starting equipment (they have never actually purchased such items).<br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells **<br />
<br />
- Fixed a problem with the Giantsbane Spell quest NPCs not spawning in Skyshrine.<br />
- Failing to hide while invisible will now make the invisibility icon disappear.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Trade Skills **<br />
<br />
- Many Planar Recipes can now be used in collapsible containers. Some Planar Tailoring can only be done in the Tanaan Loom as opposed to the Planar Sewing Kit.  Nothing that was previously made in the Loom was added to the collapsible tailoring kit.  Skills changed were Baking, Sewing, Jewel Craft, and Fletching.<br />
- Added gnome cultural recipe book to Ak'Anon.<br />
- Changed the weights on Spiritstones to be more in line with Faithstones.<br />
- Changed Collapsible Jeweler's Kit to 6 slots from 4.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones **<br />
<br />
- Grummus is much more likely to stay in his home.<br />
- Fixed the door to the Ak'Anon zoo, by request of the Zookeeper's Union #23.<br />
- Newly created Wood Elf Druids will now make their first appearance in the world much closer to their guild master.<br />
- Fennin Ro is now more durable, more in line with the other elemental plane gods.<br />
-Rallos Zek now moves considerably faster then before, as do his cohorts. He will also become very, VERY angry should he be removed from his lair(s).  <br />
- Skyshrine will once again require a key for exit into the Cobalt Scar.  The fact that the key was not needed was a bug.  We do understand that few people actually walk through this area considering the other methods of transport available, but the dragons aren't leaving their doors open.<br />
<br />
<br />
** Items **<br />
<br />
- Corrected the inventory icon for the Acrylia Studded Legs and the Two-Handed Practice Sword.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IOW the farming days are over, sorry to those of you who have to now do the encounter the way it was intially intended. You don't actually expect us to TEST this shet do you? $12.95 please. Tks drive thru.<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
Absor, you are a coward. <br />
<br />
Apathy, indifference, continual weakening of a class in comparison to others. If these terms are unknown to you then you are playing a dr00d. If you live this every patch and expansion then you are playing a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No, playing a shaman means that you know absor is a coward.<br />
<br />
It think his totally post count in here is 7.<br />
<br />
And no I don't think he's to busy to come in here and post more often.  It's not like they're busy working on any new conent.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xelot Bloodseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">In the time I've played this game (~3 years) I'd say I have become a little jaded with the all over the scope actions of the Live Team and the Devs. <br />
<br />
I have to think that after looking at the stellar work the Live Team has put forth fixing the doors of Norath, it is a bit frustrating to see important and/or long standing issues, problems and concerns overlooked.<br />
<br />
If they're going add a &quot;do nothing&quot; fix, at least make it something that could actually benifit people. Heck, for that matter, do something that people notice. I've played the game for 3 years and never had an issue with a door. (Well, there was one time in Perma where the portculis grabbed a guy and drug him in to the ceiling, but he was screwing around with it, so he had it coming)<br />
<br />
It's kind of like the State announcing new multi-million dollar progam to replace their aging lawnmower fleet so the grass next to the highway stays mowed... All the while ignoring the fact that there are pot holes with their own zip code in the highway.<br />
<br />
There are problems with the game on many different levels, for nearly every class. Insead of addressing them, they're using their resources to fix doors and remind NPCs that they aren't allowed to buy no drop items for 1 copper.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm sure someone that reads this has background in Project Management... What if you came to your director and said, &quot;We realize that there is a laundry list of things that need attention, so we decided to start with fixing the doors.&quot; What? Are they warming up?<br />
<br />
I would think that a &quot;top-down&quot; methodology would be a normal stratagy in a case such as this. The &quot;doors first&quot; idea makes no sense to me. <br />
<br />
I guess that's what they thought &quot;Fix existing content&quot; ment on that poll they had a while back... Pretty sure everyone can agree fixing the doors was a swing and a miss...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If doors are important enough to be mentioned, then this had better damn well be. <br />
<br />
I'm not debating that it should have been in the damn it, and i said it's on the DEVELOPER'S CORNER, not the NEWBIE ZONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Project Management<br />
What has that to do with EQ?  You know they live and die by the random number generator.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm - we rolled a 472.  Looks like this month we work on doors.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Oh my god! What a lame patch message.<br />
<br />
No mention of anything really serious except the changes to end-game encounters to make it more difficult for those who come later. What a load of crap. I dont care if the encounters are now working as intended - if thats the case they should roll back EVERY SINGLE ITEM gotten in the period where it was not working. Nothing more nothing less.<br />
<br />
I also have to agree that SOE and Absor are cowards in the extreme to pinpoint very minute changes to prices merchants are using and doors not working and hair not appearing correctly instead of focusing on the million of other issues that are actually AFFECTING gameplay.<br />
<br />
I dont think anyone could alienate more customers if they tried.<br />
<br />
PS. And if anyone that works in customer relations (if they actually have that?) dont have time to browse the major class boards daily I dont really know why they get paid.</div></div><hr />

- I can finally sleep now. It's fixed! OMG THANK YOU VI! Glad to see this bug has same priority as Affliction Focus bugs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">** Interface **<br />
<br />
- We also decided to screw up all UI mods.  Even that &quot;default&quot; one that so many people use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You're all still mad about the nerf it's funny (kinda).  The new charm slot is actually pretty cool, look they're adding more fun stuff to the game!  Nothing wrong with that, now the last patch tho ...</div></div><hr />
