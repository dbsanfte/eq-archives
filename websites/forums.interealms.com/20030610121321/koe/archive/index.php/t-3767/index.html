I'll try to get in touch with him and find out if he still has it as soon as I can :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Awesome! Thanks for responding. I appreciate any help you can give us. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what kind of torch do you mean?  I have a smoldering brand which looks like a torch on a secondary... you're more than welcome to it if it helps you with epicy things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The torch he is speaking of is a drop off of a high end mob in the City of Mist.  Bem and Falino have been working to get these.<br />

That would be great if Dev still has this item and Ixtlan is willing to multi it with Bem.  Thanks guys!</div></div><hr />
