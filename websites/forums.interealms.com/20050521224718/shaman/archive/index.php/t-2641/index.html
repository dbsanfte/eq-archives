<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
I have seen a lot of people frustrated over getting these spells so I thought I would share how I got them. My guild provided them for me free of charge (WOOT) and have several copies still in the bank for future shamans. Where did my guild get these spells from? The answer is Gore in DLs!<br />
<br />
I have been on 3 Gore keels since I joined Aurora Noctum on The Tribunal server and all 3 keels of Gore have resulted in a copy of Torpor dropping and one copy of Malo (she dropped VoB also). We also got a copy of Torpor off Sontalak in WWs but Gore is a 2 group keel nowadays and doable by pretty much any guild with 20+ lvl 51+ characters unlike Sontalak.<br />
<br />
In short if Gore is up SMACK her down cuz she seems to have a common drop of Shaman 58+ spells. Well at least on The Tribunal she does.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps,<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, level 60 Kunark spells drop from Kunark dragons.  That's great if you're in a guild/raid group that regularly tackles Kunark dragons.  Some guilds are past that and rarely make the effort of finding them up and killing them.  Some guilds can kill them, but must take time to mobilize and often find themselves beaten to them. Some guilds can't kill outdoor Kunark dragons.<br />
<br />
Saying &quot;hey, just wack Gorenaire for your spells,&quot; is great for shaman who are in guilds/raiding groups capable of killing Gorenaire.  You might as well say, &quot;hey, just go to VP!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually the uber guilds on e'ci regularly kill gore before the lesser guilds can gather a force.  Recently a few people from my guild and a few from another where getting together to kill gore when a  few manaburn wizards popped up and downed her quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tend to agree with Glorianna here, ones who are in guilds cabable of doing dragons will get em spells just mather of patience. Once who get frustrated are in guilds that aren't so high level and number. Even if Gorenaire is easier now, it still does require some good number of hard nukage I imagine (haven't done since spell cast patches).<br />
<br />
I'd recommend to all (esp in small guilds/guildless) to get friends/guildies up and try to get a regular thing going to go to OS crypt. All get exp, drops and emperor drops the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Trakanon is best chance for these spells, as trak, tola and protector can drop it. 3 chances in 1 hour, that is good :)<br />
<br />
Last trak kill we got avatar+torpor, and the one before we had torpor+malo. But we are the luckiest guild for shaman spells drops, i still see some peeps in guilds that kill kunark dragons buying torpor :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">With Gore being reduced to a farm fest for 4 MB wizards the amount of high level RoK spells on the open market is much higher.<br />
<br />
If you do not have the money to spend just do the old route and camp juggs (yes they do drop them every now and then)/ Guardiand wurms</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">juggs/reets dont drop malo/torpor if i remember well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">According to the Spell drop location post over in the spell fourm they do. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I thought only lvl 60 and more mobs did drop it that is why... and never saw any drop off juggs/reets, and god know how many i have killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I checked, and they aren't listed off juggs/reets in spell drop location, as i thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you'll look again, torpor is listed as being dropped by juggs.  Torpor has been reported to drop off of a regular juggernaut a couple of times, but I've never seen it happen first hand.  If torpor drops, one would assume that malo could since they're on the same drop table.  It has been said that occasionally a jugg will spawn that is 58 which has a *chance* to drop a 59 or 60 rare spell.  Again, just something I've seen reported here, not anything I've actually witnessed...<br />
<br />
The real opportunity that exists for 59 / 60 spells while camping juggs / reets comes from 2 other mobs that spawn in the same area - Tolapumj and the Sebilite Protector.  If you're doing juggs / reets you'll be killing these two also.  This is why the juggs / reets camp is generally considered to be a source for rare 59 / 60 spells.<br />
<br />
At the risk of whacking a dead horse that's already been flogged to the brink of oblivion, there are a number of mobs out there that can drop the rare spells.  Jumpy / prot, juggs, guardian wurms and emporer chottal can all drop the spells - rarely.  Your *best* chance to acquire these spells, however, remains killing kunark dragons (plus certain velious dragons), chardok royals and the like.  That very simply requires a strong guild or raiding group that most people can't rely on having available.  Often because their guild lacks the raw strength for the encounter or because they're unable to assemble a sufficent force quickly enough for the mobs or a myriad of other reasons.  <br />
<br />
Telling those people to go out and kill dragons and they'll get their spells easily is like telling me to run out and scrape up $300k &amp; buy that Ferarri I've been dreaming of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's all random luck. We have killed the Kunark dragons many times and the only Shaman spells they have dropped have been Avatar (x2), Poxx, and Talisman of Raptor. I have actually never seen malo drop and only seen torpor drop once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can confirm, firsthand, torpor dropping off of a regular Juggernaut.  We were pulling to Trak's lair so I can't say exactly wich one it was but it was definitely not the Seb Protector.  <br />
<br />
I would love to get my hands on some Kunark dragons... but lately, it seems like manaburn groups are dominating them.  =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I recently started playing again and came across Torpor for sale in the market channel.  Guy was asking 15k and would not budge.  That was all the money I had in the bank and I always told myself that at 56 I should just wait and see if I come across it in the next few levels, but it seemed to be lower than I have heard other poeple paying.<br />
<br />
On my server, I have heard it typically ranges from 20k-50k.  I don't know though...you think I paid too much?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">And it was a bargain. <br />
<br />
That damn spell is scary. It takes an effective class, one that can solo, can group in small or full groups and raid well, then turns them into damn near unstoppable juggernauts. <br />
<br />
Sure I don't do damage fast, but I am the hand at the end of the lever with one end under a giant boulder. It may not seem like I do much at the onset but damn if it doesnt leave wreckage behind.<br />
<br />
Shaman are the personifacation of power. The hurracane as it is building. A tornado before it has touched down. Provoke a shamans wrath and you will feel thier fury, but stand there beside them and behold thier majesty and you may be left unscathed, but you will be changed when you view them in thier glory.<br />
<br />
Woah, a little bit of a speil there sorry. I guess I feel strongly about my chosen class. (grins)<br />
<br />
Get torpor as soon as you can. Don't pass it up at level 53  and then spend the next year trying to get it like I did. The last count of Guardian wyrms killed was 87 of the bastards. <br />
<br />
Heh Have fun. I am off to play NWN if I can find a damn copy in my town.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">where i got em -<br />
<br />
torpor:  guild had a copy waiting for the first shaman to get level 60.  i busted my ass to make sure i got it first since it was so rare at the time (early 2001).  the copy came from the sebilite protector on one of our first trakanon attempts.  <br />
<br />
malo:  purchased from another shaman in tribunal's 'ueber' guild for 2000p.  they were raiding veeshan's peak constantly and had about 6 copies.<br />
<br />
these days i rarely use malo but constantly use torpor.  most of the time i don't even mem chloroblast. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have killed trak several times, Jumpy and Prot maybe 20 times, and many many many many juggs. In all those Seb kills I have seen exactly zero level 59 or 60 shaman spells. <br />

My guild did get a torpor off jumpy when I was not there (now in my book).<br />
<br />
For every person I hear say &quot;We got two copies of Torpor off LockJaw! It must be easy to get!&quot;, I hear a hundred say they had no luck anywhere. <br />
<br />
You can get the uber shaman spells in traks lair, but dont hold your breath. They are just damn rare.<br />
<br />
The best bet really seems to be the big Kunark dragons and some of the WW dragons. <br />
<br />
Torpor is freaking amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Malaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What i meant conas, is that the best chance to get torpor in a raid time would be in a trakanon raid, because you would have 3 solid chances (prot, tola, and trak) + very little chance off a jugg, and on any other dragon raid(minus VP and velious ones) you would have only one solid chance.</div></div><hr />

I tend to think these people are doing it to sell the loot, not save it for their guilds, so any copies that drop will most likely enter the open marketplace. Not perfect, but better than it was when guilds would save them all for internal use.</div></div><hr />

Yeah! It's so unfair! I'm restricted to soloing Dragons in the Western Wastes! I wanna solo Gore too!!!!!!<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kerran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">First off, you guys must be kidding right - complaining about manaburn. <br />
Being a 60 wiz as my main and now switching over to a shaman (whos almost 60), I can tell you a LOT about wizards.<br />
Lets think about this, Wizards are restricted to their manapool, Manaburn cost 17AA's (I believe, cant remember anymore, been playing my shammy too much :p) to obtain, it can only be used every 2 hours 45 mins, if you dont have AA's spec'd in cripples, Manaburn is useless, 16-20k manaburn crits are uber rare, once you use manaburn you have 0 mana left over (And being a wizard without KEI - youre SoL for a good 15-20 mins while medding.) Manaburn is also based on your current mana, hence the name, but that means that unless you're in a uber guild - dont think about having a 16-20k manaburn... ever. <br />
Now, lets also think of the positives of having manaburn.  Manaburn can lower the economy (wizzys selling those CoF's from Talendor, Torpor, Pox, and other stuff cheaper than people normally would), Manaburn can also keep those damn dragons from killing/chasing you (If you're kos like me) while running through a zone, and Manaburn is great on raids because of the low-to-no aggro. <br />
<br />
Okay, now lets compare a shaman to a wizard.<br />
[1] Torpor (Uhm, this is a godsend in itself, we *all* know that). Wizards dont get that<br />
[2] Shamans can actually get their ENTIRE spellbook. Wizards cant, hell none of the FoH wizards even have their full spellbook... You would have to be in the top 98% of EverQuest to even think about getting a full spellbook...<br />
[3] Buffs - Do wizards get these? Dont think so. (With an exception of their flappy as I like to call them, but for you non wizzys - a familiar.<br />
[4] Pets - Once again... I dont think so (And if you think the flaming sword of Xzul is a pet, please, PLEASE go check out the specifics of that spell - It blows and has a high mana cost.)<br />
[5] Debuffs - Okay, slow most NPCs and watch it hit you so damn slowly that you can do numerous other things in between, then cripple the NPC so that its really messed up :p<br />
[6] Canni - Combined with Torpor... need I say more? C'mon.<br />
[7] A Monk and a Shammi Team can wax about 95% Of all of EverQuest.<br />
[8] Soloing - Okay, so maybe you can't quad kite. However, when was the last time you've seen a wizard solo anything big (without manaburn). Do I really need to name examples of the things shaman can solo that wizards w/o MB can't?<br />
[9] Groupage - From what I've seen thus far, I can find a group relatively quickly as a shaman. Its much harder as a wizard.<br />
<br />
Thats just to name a few. Now of course, you're probably thinking, well Torpor is so hard to get, it can cost up to 100k depending on what server you're on. News flash - Try getting Garrisons Superior Sundering, or Elernik's Electrical Rending. I guarntee you you'll have a much worse time finding those... With Garrisons being impossiable except to the elite few. Ancient spells will probably be installed, the PoP expansions will be enabled and probably about 10 wizards on all of EverQuest will have that spell. Sure, it makes sense, the spell does a massive amount of damage, but uhm - compared to the shammi with Pox and Bane and a slowed, crippled NPC.. Theres no comparison. The shaman is the best rounded class in the game of EverQuest, hands down. And plus, even with Garrisons Superior sundering, a wizard still ultimately will not be able to take down the same things us shaman do. <br />

&quot;If you have any comments on this, I'd like to hear your input.&quot;<br />
<br />
... ok, let's hear it.<br />
<br />
&quot;once you use manaburn you have 0 mana left over (And being a wizard without KEI - youre SoL for a good 15-20 mins while medding.&quot;<br />
<br />
... try medding from 0 as a bard. Bards can't benefit from KEI, their OWN mana regen songs, FT items, Focus Items, or ANY other form of mana regen/preservstion (EXCEPT AAs).<br />
I will concede that we only have one viable use for mana: charm.<br />
Though I will point out that this one use is the best way for us to get exp from levels 27-60... unless we are grouped with a bunch of wizards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Manaburn can lower the economy (wizzys selling those CoF's from Talendor, Torpor, Pox, and other stuff cheaper than people normally would), Manaburn can also keep those damn dragons from killing/chasing you (If you're kos like me) while running through a zone&quot;<br />
<br />
... hey, I can solo dragons as a bard, but people would freak and try to get me banned. You are right, they should be thanking me for lowering the economy and killing dangerous mobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, now lets compare a shaman to a wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
... ok, let's compare a wizard to a bard now.<br />
Bards CAN get most their spells/songs, Wizards can't.<br />
Bards get their own version of MB at level 43!... it does 311 damage.<br />
Bards can run fast.<br />
<br />
Last compliment I got as a bard was: &quot;Wow! You make a great riksha!&quot;<br />
(I was running a person from IC to GD)<br />
<br />
Last compliment I gave to a wizard: &quot;wow&quot;<br />

Sorry all. I didnt / wasnt trying to turn my last post on this thread into a class comparison - I played my wizzy to 60 and the point I was trying to make is that wizzys blow except in raid scenarios or quad kiting... I find little to no fun in running around farming dragons (Sure, I've done it before, but Its not like I wait till one pops just to call my friends and bring it down). Now, what I was trying to point out is that I enjoy the shaman class much more than playing a wizard... I'm sorry if my focus became obscured in that first post. <br />

<br />
I'm not sure which server you play on, but have you tried talking to some of the MB wizzys? I know on Drinal, it is typical for the same people to farm the dragons over - and over ... and over. Maybe you could contact them and work out a deal, a lot of people tend to be generous with their prices / negotiations, especially if they can kill an NPC with 4 people in 1 minute. <br />
<br />
In response to &quot;Graal the Dwarf&quot; -<br />
&gt;&gt; wonder how many paladin epic books rot from MB wizards killing Gore. I guess those 60 paladins could always de-level to 52 and kill Vox.<br />
<br />
I suppose it depends on the person... I know that on my server, we usually ask people / guildies (or people from other guilds) / twinks if they need the book.<br />

Ive been 60 for 4 months now and havent gotten a copy yet.<br />
<br />
 My plan is to save up cash and I hope I can find a copy for sale. Also my guild is on the borderline of being capable of taking Kunark dragons. Im crossing my fingers it will be soon and that Ill get lucky.<br />
<br />
Ive killed lots of guardian wurms and havent gotten it as have a lot of people. Doesnt mean you wont though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">The fastest way is probably to hang out in Shroom King groups until you get a fungi, then sell it and buy your spells from your server's manaburn team or a VP guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Fastest way to get any spell, IMO, is to have as many friends as possible. ;)  Smartass reply?  Not really, but I suppose it could be seen that way.  Talk to the shaman in as many raiding guilds as possible and politely let them know what spells you are looking for.  As rare as Malo/Torpor are, chances are that there are at least a couple guilds with spares in the bank, 'just in case'.<br />
<br />
Find out which guilds farm VP and/or kunark dragons with any regularity and target them especially.  On our server, I know the Australian time zone guild had a recent string of good luck on Kunark Dragons and ended up with some spares to sell, which I managed to buy at 5k a pop.  :D<br />
<br />
Camp Juggs/Prot/Jumpy.  Take the rare spells you get and instead of selling them on open auction, approach those guilds that are likely to have/get the spells you need and offer to trade the rarer spells you have for the ones you need.<br />
<br />
Basically, be proactive.  Don't expect to find Malo/Torpor for sale on your server auction channel often.  Even if you do, chances are the price will be stupidly high.  Direct inquiries almost always yield better results for me than just waiting around for someone to /auction whatever I'm looking for. ;)</div></div><hr />
