<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timia Chaos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been out of EQ for about 10 months, and only played a Druid for a couple months prior to that.  So, I'm not a complete newbie, but not to far from it.<br />
<br />
I'm off to buy Luclin, and intend to start a Vah Shir Shaman later today.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any last minute advice on creation.  The conventional wisdom seems to be to add 25 to Wisdom, but varies on the remaining 5.  I'd like any opinions as to whether this makes much difference or not.  I'm tempted to add it to STR, since being encumbered if a buff accidently wears off can be a hassle.  On the other hand, some seem to like adding 5 to DEX since 75 total seems to be an important threshold.  STA for HP and endurance seems reasonable, too.<br />
<br />
I'd also like any input on &quot;Must Do&quot; beginner quests after the initiate quest.  Any tips on whether to save or spend early skill points would also be helpful.  Finally, I'd also like to know if any particular newbie area drops are valuable to save for later, and if any are valuable to sell to NPCs or other PCs.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I went 25 wis, 5 str as an Iksar but thats with 70 starting str. I don't regret that choice it helped me alot levelling up, unbuffed I was perma encumbered. I havent had a problem with str since level 50 or so.<br />
<br />
Would I add 5 to dex? No, it's only useful for proccing weapons.<br />
<br />
I'd put the rest in stamina, end game items will mean stamina ends up near the cap but those of us with lower starting stamina need some very nice gear to hit 205 stamina unbuffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definately put it into stamina. I wish I had.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do not put any points into str...sure, you might be encumbered the first 10 levels or so, after that, we can buff our own strength to the heavens.  <br />
<br />
Sta!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Split points between Stamina and Wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Stam and wisdom. . . . and learn to use your sneak skill!  It's the best part of being a kitty shaman.  Man I wish I was a cat sometimes just for that reason!  <br />
<br />
I'd go 25 to wis, 5 to stam.  Max starting wis cause the more you have to start, the less wis gear you have to wear.  Most of the time wis gear lacks in other important stats like ac and hps.  So the more you have to start with, the more options are open gear wise if you still wanna maintain a decent wis level.  I'd say if you got over 150 wis with gear, work on ac/hps from there.  Velium Fire Rings (6AC 65hp) are good.  regen bp of some sort if you can snag it.  GL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i did 20 wis and 10 sta i dont regret it...hey its 15 more hps ya! i can take one hundreth of a hit from the AOW YIPPIE with that many extra hps LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Timia Chaos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks everyone for all the input.  I did go +25 Wisdom and +5 Stamina.  If any of you are on Firiona Vie, my new character is named Uncia.  Thanks again for the help!</div></div><hr />
