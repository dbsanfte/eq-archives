<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just looked at it today - was some 20 minutes behind.  Thoughts? (Cause, remedy (buy a new MB)).....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Always been a very very very rare thing, but the motherboard battery CAN run out of juice.  When your pc clock runs slow consistently over time, 9 times out of 10 it is (or at least used to be) this battery.  Much like a watch battery, you can just pop it out and snick in a new one.<br />
<br />
That is, of course, providing it's not some kind of virus, spamware, etc.  Or some other new thing that's come up in the 10 or so years I've been out of the tech support game.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh, I should mention, popping out this battery will reset your bios settings (including bios password), in case you've done a lot of tweaking in there.</div></div><hr />
