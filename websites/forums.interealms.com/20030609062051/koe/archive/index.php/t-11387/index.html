I need this to complete my woodelf illusion crown. I need one solid group of  55-65lvl peoples. Ideal group will be tank (me), cleric, ench, 3 of anything else  :p It's open to how many people that show up. Could be just 6 could be 30 hehe. I need feedback so I can get a time and date goin on this. As usual guild raids will take presidence. But if you wana have some good frog slayin fun like the good ol' days plz come lend me a hand on getting this crown for my quest. <br />
