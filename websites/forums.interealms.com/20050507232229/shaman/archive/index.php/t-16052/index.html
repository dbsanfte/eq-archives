Yes I know this has nothing to do with EQ...</div></div><hr />

No rush, the beta is still ramping up.  But... dragons as a playable race - VERY good idea!</div></div><hr />

Oh Ye Flipp'n GODS, I am so waiting for this game.<br />
<br />
Please, please, please...don't let it be the next AC2 or Shadowbane.<br />
<br />
For active forums and (considering it isn't gold) good information about it, head over to http://horizonsvault.ign.com/</div></div><hr />

HOLY CRAP! THIS GAME WILL EVEN SURPASS WoW!<br />
<br />
I already like the Saris and dragons...WOW...when is the ETA for this?<br />
<br />
They even managed to make female gnomes look attractive!</div></div><hr />

Current target seems to be November, but...<br />
<br />
Remember NeverWinter Nights? Same deal...no dates given until a real date is set.<br />
<br />
Currently in Beta III (not in yet, damnit), with a possible - but by no means sure - Open Beta before it goes live.<br />
<br />
Yep, planning to dual box a Dragon and a humanoid...prolly a Fiend.<br />
<br />
I just hope they really do make Dragons difficult to play and advance. I'll be pissed if anyone can camp a dragon toon and wait 6 months, then log it back in and make it an adult dragon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That is true Shazzog.....All the info about dragons give reference that greater age gives them greater power.<br />
<br />
I think it would be dumb to make the age time based. I think it should just be a general exp progression like it is in EQ but something more interesting. As there is reference in EQ as the character's age in regard to as many 'seasons' they have been out.<br />
<br />
I hope I make a dragon warrior/wizard/healer...with this different schools thing I think it would be possible!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Has anyone ever seen the detail that is in the Morrowind Sky, especially at night?  The stars, moons and nebulae.  It's really awesome just to look up.  I wish EQ had something similiar.  The scenery looks really nice in Horizons from the screenshots.</div></div><hr />

I like the way they indicate they are going to work it.<br />
<br />
Age will be partly time based...this keeps it from being a &quot;Oh look, I'm rich and powerful. I'll make a dragon twink and get him ancient in 1 day&quot; thing. It also allows for casual players to 'age' at roughly the same rate as a powergamer. No penalty for not having an UberGuild.<br />
<br />
It will also hopefully cut down on the number of people making dragons because they want to be 'Uber'. Juvenile dragons will supposedly be dufficult to play. Gotta work for that eventual power.<br />
<br />
The other part of it will be a Trial of Passage kind of thing...quests that must be accomplished, a certain horde size that must be gathered, etc. to go from one stage to the other.<br />
<br />
In theory, this should help prevent camping a dragon char and waiting until  the Real Time timer kicks over, then bringing it on and *Poof* you can fly.<br />
<br />
They stress that they want to make sure that casual players are not overly disadvantaged compared to the power gamers. Obviously, a powergamer is still going to have an edge in how much they can aquire, but at least the casual gamer doesn't gt left in the dust.<br />
<br />
I'm liking that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a word of warning, HZ has already done the rounds once.  It built up one of the best communities I have seen for an unreleased game, and then it got hit with the vaporware stick and it told it's community to sod off.<br />
<br />
It's since been rebuilt on even rockier grounds, don't get your hopes to high just yet.  Incidently the original version was much better, you could become members of the town council and even become mayor in the original.  There was all kinds of cool stuff which has been left out of version 2.</div></div><hr />
