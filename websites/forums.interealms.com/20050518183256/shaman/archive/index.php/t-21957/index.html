<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are some of the AAs that you would rather not have wasted on?<br />
<br />
For example, the 20 AAs for Pet Affinity?  Or Pack Rat? Or Call of the Ancients? Alchemy? Rabid Bear?<br />
<br />
There are alot of useful AAs out there, and I think the easiest way to approach AAs is to figure out what AAs NOT TO DO.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Call of the ancients - its not Ronseal (doesn't do what it says on the tin). More HP Regen where it was supposed to be endurance regen. Bad enough they make us pay AA for a half assed attempt at replacing taking a major benefit out of the Acumen line, then to go and change it into an AE HP regen (I don't want to be a bard!!!!).... grrrrr....<br />
<br />
Incidentally, weren't they supposed to refund the AA for that or did I misread?</div></div><hr />

GoD, however, was a total disaster in any number of ways, not the least of which included all of the AA choices (and costs).  30 AA for three levels of skills, 20AA single cost abilities . . . and all total crap.<br />
<br />
Note:  I have NOT finished my GoD AAs, but I have 29 saved for OoW already, assuming I don't cancel billing before then.  They've got some serious work to do before I even consider OoW.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i would have to say crit affliction and the ward aa.<br />
<br />
i had a GM roll back my account so i could spend my points better, (i lost half of my save aa's doing it)<br />
<br />
crit affliction like i said many times befor is broken, its so much aggro you could land a venom of the snake and get summoned on a crit.<br />
it in effect doubles the poison counters on a critical tick. but, the doubled counters still remain, wich is just gross because 3 crit ticks and your on the floor with red text in front of you saying &quot;loading please wait...&quot;<br />
the only dots that seem to not double in counters or just diminish are the curse dots, but ... why use dots at all ? hell why even try to do damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the ward, was a waste of time, 75 a tic regen ? it caps at 55 or so ?<br />
totally worthless.</div></div><hr />

what i regret spending my AAs on are Rabid Bear and Hastened Rapiditidy (sp?). i do melee a lot when i solo but the increase in dmg i could not see and the dot that you proc is garbage. plus, even with the hastened joint you still had to wait forever to use it again.<br />

packrat, pet affinity and suspended minion are last on my list of AAs to even consider getting.</div></div><hr />

Its kinda hard to &quot;complain&quot; about 3 lousy points though, especially when most of us spent em when we thought Regen was awesome and laughed about Metab.<br />
<br />
As for QB, I think the people that are saying they regret it mean ONLY QB3, not QB1 and 2. I got the skinny on that one, and only went to QB2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">rabid bear, hastened rabidity, but at the time it was either that or stats/resists. never got qc3.<br />
I agree crit affliction is good for soloing, and max spirit call does some decent damage, so no real complaints on those 2 except the cost is too high.</div></div><hr />

Pet affinity might be on my list soon, if I can find out if SC5 doggies can receive group buffs or not.  Might make talisman of alacrity useful for something, or not....</div></div><hr />

I was talking to a friend, and he says that Pet Affinity does work on SC5 pets.<br />
<br />
PA does sound attractive, if and only if our SC5 pets stayed alive much longer, and if they were controllable.<br />

Every one that I've gotten has been throught out before I got it, so no impulse spending.  I don't have rabid bear yet and really don't have any intention of getting it.  I did put the points into Call of the Ancients 1 and I do believe that it was well worth it to have the first rank of that (on that note.. I mentioned it several times before GoD went live that the effect's description was broken and that it was a hp regen.. so i'm sorry for all that didn't see it).  <br />

I waited forever (around 400+) to get Channeling Focus and I just kinda took it just cause I needed to spend points on something.</div></div><hr />

Using BA 4 with Crit Af 2 im doing a ton of dmg all the time - i melee a great deal of the time as well.  <br />
Berserker epic mob was done with about 3 grps all pretty much died when tank went down me n druid kitted mega dotted it and she had the adds i tanking the named and was fun with rabid bear n dots  when u have CA n BA running with bane alone i was doing 1008 dmg every 3 rounds with my dots n CA/BA combo was doing 1500 or so a tick an was able to keep up the pace until mob died canni about every 4 stuns max FT and Regen was huge help as well as QB 2 n Quies as for the druid our lil shammy 1300 hp heal never healed her less then 1700 during entire time even crit healed for 3400 a few times,   so when ppl say Crit affl , QB, rabid bear an some other AAs suck question isnt what AA suck should b how the AAs are used and in the users hands  <br />

They should at least change the text on the description for that one, when they are done balancing us of course ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
trust me it has comedic value WHILE dueling. I know I laughed last time I fought a shaman with rabid bear up, of course on the zeks servers you pretty much have to laugh at any shaman who thinks he can kill another shaman, hi dumbass I have the counter to everything you can do including your pissant nukes.<br />
<br />
<br />
I cant even say I regret regen3, sure its usless now but when I got it that extra hp regen was helpful, pre torpor you want all the standing hp regen you can get your hands on. <br />
<br />
like a few peeps here I did my research, no mgb for me, even when I was raiding there were almost always enough shaman with mgb to do the buffs and when there werent I just did it the hard way. left the guild before I had enough &quot;Core&quot; aa's to feel mgb was worth my time. had I been a bst/cleric/druid I would probably have it though, few things as impressive as a mgb massive heal spell/aa on an entire raid, whats a shaman gonna do? mgb focus for a 500point mass heal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">What is the reason most say don't get QB3 just stay with 2?  Is QB3 not really 50%?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Because the max a spell casting time can be reduced to is 50%. There's so much spell haste gear out there, it's pretty easy to max out with QB2 + item.</div></div><hr />

This especially applies to the most important thing that QB effects, the single spell most people bother to train this AA at all for, and thats Quies (or BoT now). If it didnt affect this spell line, I wouldnt spend a single point in Quick Buff. Who cares if I can cast Fo7 faster?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">In addition to spell haste items there's also the cleric spell haste range. Given the large cost of QB3 its generally not worth it.<br />
<br />
Anyways, thanks to you guys I'm glad to say I've got 155 well-spent AA points, no real regrets. Metabolism would have been better than regen I think but that's pretty minor. <br />
<br />
Still got a few to go that will be useful: working on CS at the moment, then ID5, RC3 (have RC1 atm).. then I'll start making some dodgy decisions I guess.<br />
<br />
Looking back, anyone with SCS that regrets getting it? Peops complaining of crit dot aggro, anyone dislike NOT being able to hold aggro so well when they want to due to SCS? Sometimes I duo with a rogue and its nice to have slow+dot hold aggro for 80% of a fight :) But its not that hard to root for aggro with clicky pants, or throw disempower on a few times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's still not hard at all to steal and hold aggro even with SCS3. A dot will still do the trick easily. I think it's a great AA though, because it does noticeably help how fast you can slow/debuff something. Especially with less then optimal tank/taunters.</div></div><hr />
