<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i know it probably doesnt help but i used to travel the world for work and went to some very unsavory places. we were on a trip to eastern europe and we had our own food but got ice from the people at the airports. no big deal right? one stop they brought out the ice in paper bags and someone on the crew told them to put it in the cooler without checking it. we leave and someone goes into the cooler and the ice has dirt and &quot;stuff&quot; in it. we dump it out and wash the cans and bottles off the best we can. no joy. 15 people out of 17 got food poisoning. imagine being stuck on an airplane 14-18 hours a day with 15 sick people and one bathroom. of course this happened on the last day before we hit a 4 day stretch where noone had equipment to service the bathroom on our plane. thank god we had a nurse with who had these little magic pills. they didnt help the naseau or fever but at least we could stay out of the bathroom finally. anyways ive had food poisoning like 3 times and i feel your pain. I'd go with the gatorade or flavored pedialyte.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We keep a can of powdered gatorade in the cupboard for JUST such issues.

On my honeymoon I went to Mexico, the resort had its own water process plant with staff members always on duty testing, they were very proud of it.  However, they failed to use that water for the ice in the drinks.  For 4 days on the tail end of my honeymoon, where I'm only suppossed to be getting tail (from my new wife ... well, she was new 4 years ago) ring of fire had an entirely different meaning.  Not food poisening, but the parasites were not into bickering over semantics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have a bottle of whiskey, take about 3-4 large gulps and do your best to keep it down for about 5-10 minutes (that's the hard part).  You're almost certain to throw it up, but I don't think many bacteria can handle stomach acid AND a large slug of alcohol.  I've managed to head off several bouts of food posioning that way, sick as it sounds.   It's extremely unpleasant, but it works for me, anyway.  :(<br />

When you get sick, how the hell do you know if you have &quot;food poisoning&quot; or you just got a flu-bug?  I have friends who blame everything on food poisoning, and therefore won't eat at a restaurant for ages afterwards for that very reason.  I'm like &quot;How the hell do you know you got food poisoning?  Ever heard of a little thing called influenza?  It makes ya throw up too. &quot;  Then they're like &quot;'Cause I got sick right after I ate there.&quot;  And I'm like &quot;Yeah, the chances of you getting sick after you eat are pretty high... since you eat probably no less than 3 times a day.&quot;<br />

Most people don't know it but food poisioning pretty much takes 2-3 days to actually start showing up.  It most certainly isn't something that was eaten within the last 12-24 hours...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Oh...I dunno...<br />
<br />
&quot;Eating food contaminated by bacteria is the most common way to get food poisoning. The infectious agent usually causes inflammation of the digestive tract within as few as 6 or as much as 48 hours of exposure, vomiting and diarrhea; these are among the methods that allow the body to deal with poisons naturally. Other symptoms may include stomach pain, dizziness, and weakness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pretty much have all those symptoms.</div></div><hr />

My daughter and I had food poisoning a few months ago.  Was horrific enough for a trip to the local Urgent Care Center.  Here I thought being vegan was going limit my contact with nasty bacteria.<br />
<br />
Sprite, apple juice and water was about the only liquids I could keep down.  After about 48 hours of that I tried overcooked rice. (Twice as much water or broth as the rice calls for and cooked 10~15 min longer.)  I dont think I started back on real solids for a week.  Not fun.<br />

It was like clockwork. Hurl, feel better (Albeit drained), lie down, 30 minutes later repeat.<br />

Water. No. Gatorade. No.<br />

We just joked about it tho.  Excusing myself to &quot;release the hounds&quot; just made it a tad more fun.  <br />
Fantastic place to visit tho.  I've never had more fun in three weeks!</div></div><hr />

Hmm, this post is nothing but a blatent attempt at fluffing - get well soon Gloriana :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Oh, Gloriana, by the way - I always wondered - Is your name taken from the novel of the same name, by Michael Moorcock?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Fluff fluff fluff<br />

Get well soon Glor :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">1) Pedialyte tastes like sweat.<br />
2) I seem to be over it, I feel pretty darn fragile and I *have* to go to work today, hopefully I can make it a short day.<br />
3) I liked the name Gloriana because it was a nickname of Queen Elizabeth I, thought it was a queenly name for my tall, beautiful barbie.<br />
4) You're all a bunch of fluffers!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">The title character in Moorcock's book is actually an &quot;alternate history&quot; version of Elizabeth I, so I guess the answer to my question is &quot;yes&quot;, in a way at least :)<br />

<br />
oops, sorry :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Yeah, I forget who said it (too lazy to scroll up) but when you have food poisoning, you know you have it.  I'm fortunate in that I'm vegitarian and so it's less common.  Cross contamination from chopping veggies on the same board as meat would do it but it's still rare.  Glad to hear you're recovering, Glori.<br />
<br />
Ginger-ale.  My grandmother would pour it in a pan &amp; heat it up, kinda like tea.  Took the bubbles out that way &amp; she said that helped.  To this day I still drink warm ginger-ale when I'm feeling yucky.   Course, I also make ginger tea when I have the time.<br />

Taladaen (no, i'm not fluffing, why do you ask?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Well, Ok.    But only because this is ding 200<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Oi - I'm watching you grippa ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Ugh, Glori, I hope you are feeling better today.  Nobody, and I mean nobody, deserves food poisoning (Ok, maybe Hitler, and my ex-wife, but it's a still pretty short list).<br />
<br />
I got food poisoning on the weekend I was moving into my new home.  Stopped at Jack in the Box in the morning to get some breakfast , and by noon I was throwing my guts up.<br />
<br />
So this is how my day went:  <br />
<br />
Run to the bathroom, throwup, go back out and direct the movers, maybe move something myself I didn't want them touching (TV, stereo, comp), run back to the bathroom, explosive Poison AE, go back out and watch the movers, move more stuff myself, run back to the bathroom to throwup, etc. ad nauseum.<br />
<br />
We finally got the old house packed up, and drove over to the new house, and started unloading.  As soon as the movers left, my sister drove me to the weekend clinic (you know, the one where the doctors get their degrees in the Bahamas), and I got a shot for the nausea and the cramping, and then she took me home (after a two hour wait).   I then spent the next two days in a rather pathetic attempt to control my poison AE (but at least the vomiting stopped).<br />
<br />
That was, without a doubt, the worst weekend of my life.  <br />
<br />
I hope my story made you feel better.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Yeah, we cleared up the meaning of &quot;fluffer&quot; a couple of months ago.  I'm generally careful to always use &quot;fluffing&quot; in relation to &quot;posting.&quot;<br />
<br />
What I want to know is, how did Kelador, a Ranger get in our shaman top 10 list!<br />
