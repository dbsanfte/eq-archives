Suggestions:<br />
<br />
1-5:  I suggest just staying at Halas and level from there...nobody is ever in zone.  Just be careful next to the PoK book, newts and evils sometimes zone in and will most likely send a train your way for fun.<br />
<br />
5-12:  Head out to Greater Faydark and start hunting the Orc Camps outside of Crushbone and the random mobs that spawn around there.  This zone is essentially Goodie HQ(as well as PK hell).  Most Centurions will con even-yellow around lvls 5-7.  Once they are green head inside crushbone till lvl 12.  I would not suggest staying much past that, Castle camping is not safe due to the heavy PK'ing inside Crushbone.  <br />
<br />
12-16:  Unrest, Unrest, Unrest!!!  The garbage outside the house(beetles, Tormented Undead, Jack O' Lanterns) are great xp at this lvl and you should be up to 16 in no time.  Again, after 16 the xp/PK factor makes it not incredibly worthwhile most of the time, so you should think about heading to newer territory, though you could stay here MUCH longer.<br />
<br />
16-25:  I suggest Mistmoore.  Good loot, can hunt right next to the zone line(will con dk blue-yellow) and if you can get a good group you should be able to pull the entrance Mob's with no downtime.  Pk'ing occurs here a bit as well(especially lately), think the evils are contending this zone for some reason.<br />
<br />
25-30:  Options start to open up a bit.  If you can find a monk/druid, I would suggest going into Lesser Faydark.  To the East of MM entrance along the wall there is a Tier'dal camp with 4 warrior spawns(large aggro radius) and two clerical spawns(do not aggro unless attack).  Why this is not camped more often is beyond me, these guys drop good loot and give good xp to a duo group once the camp is broken.  If you dont want to do this, you could head out to the Karana's and kite Gnolls outside of splitpaw or the Aviaks at KFC(Karana Fried Chicken:)  This zone is very safe as no PK's venture out here due to lack of action.<br />
<br />
30-40:  Up to you, there are so many uncontested and empty zones to hunt at this level:  Fironia Vie and the Rathe Mountains are where I hunt with my monk currently.<br />
<br />
Good to see another goodie join the ranks and hope to see you soon:)<br />
