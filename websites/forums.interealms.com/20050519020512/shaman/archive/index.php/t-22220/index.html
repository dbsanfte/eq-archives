This is what happens when the game gets dumbed down. This is also what happens when they put disgustingly powerful abilities in the game like Fade. I dunno, EQ may be cooked. My goal at this point is kill Quarm. After that, I hope there is another game to occupy my free time.</div></div><hr />

As someone who's played a bard in vxed and done the pulling fade really has little to do with this. It's easy enough to pull singles the whole time if your careful that you could definitely do it with out ever fading once. Soloing the 50 mobs to spawn the named is definitely possible but probably pretty time consuming. A number of mob types in there summon and there isn't alot of area so kiting probably isn't really practical. Meleeing them down is going to require some pretty good gear and some time I'd imagine. Probably having to mez the mob and regen some health.<br />
<br />
If you where going for only kitable mobs (don't summon) I could definitely see fade being used some to pull the right type of mob but lul and mez are going to be key parts of that too. Even then a bard could probably reproduce the same result just by zoning out and back in to clear aggro.<br />
<br />
Once the hail mob is spawned with bard speed, invis and da on the end I can definitely see people being able to train thier way to the hail mob too altho there's a definite risk of death which isn't a big deal but it can also make you miss the flag which would suck. I'm pretty sure they'd also have to add people before they actually spawn the named since I beleive it locks the expedition as soon as the mob spawns just like it locks tipt after you kill the named so you can't get anyone besides the 6 who where there flagged.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I ran my twink beastlord all the way from the entrance of the zone to the hailing npc after 100 mobs were killed before with only sow on him and hailed the npc before I died.  It's not that hard to do if you know the route up to the top.  Having done about 30 total Tipt adventures myself when it was still 100 mobs to kill.. I can tell you that it would take the bard hours longer than it takes a full group, and you can only get a maximum of 6 flags per trial.  Not even worth it ifyou ask me.</div></div><hr />

I do not see the problem anyways. Yesterday we tried Vxed with a couple guildies and we had enough trouble with a decent group including War and Clr. There are always people who can do things that are beyond the &quot;normal&quot; player. Be it due to equip, AA or skill, I do not care and they can continue doing whatever they do. <br />
<br />
For me, this trial was still ugly, unpleasant and felt like work. Failing because the group leader canceled the expedition after we had spawned the hail mob did not help (partial wipe, no, untrue,just cleric dead). Seems like there are not even enough hints so people know what to do on a trial without going to spoiler pages :(<br />
<br />
GoD is one depressive place anyways, I have no idea why I am even trying to progress there. The Muramites can keep it.</div></div><hr />

This is how i got my vxed flag after the guroup wiped in there, and a raid was called.  Had a rog get my body, rez loot gear, get a few buffs, rez again (so i didn't need another CR) and made the run, didn't get hit once if you know what you are doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey Barb!<br />
<br />
Yes, after the last patch it was dropped down to 50/~50 to spawn the hail npc.  The trial also seems to be a lot easier now as well- maybe because we didn't drag the chanter/zerg pet of death along with us, but it could have been something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ya vxed is now reasonable.  You can do it without a mez class no problem as long as you have a good puller.  DPS needs to be reasonable at least at the end if you wanna get there without repops wipin ya.</div></div><hr />

Dunno what to tell you, 2 different bards in my guild have done it, 1 of them has done it a couple times. You have to know EXACTLY what mobs to pull though. Basically, the quick re-spawn works in your favor. There is a ton of kiting room by the ZI. It does take a while, for sure, but according to my friends the XP is amazing (he is in there alone, everyone else from the expidition is outside waiting for him to finish). <br />
<br />
I am not saying nerf anyone or anything here, but sheesh, this just seems to defeat the whole purpose of the event. Actually, if anything, this is a perfect example of how difficult it is to adjust content across a broad range of players. You simply cannot do it without either pissing off a big chunk of players or trivializing it for another chunk. And honestly, its too late to ever turn it around, I think, unless they made near-Time gear readily available for everyone, a la Diablo 2. And of course, nothing would make me /canccel billing faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hurk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I did vexd right before the nerf with a beastlord tank, (im a cleric) and a druid backup healing.<br />
<br />
we did ok on the trash, only a couple deaths caused by lucky double rounds, the named were very hard, wiped twice on those. got our 100 kills in in under 6 hours though.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt want to repeat it. Im glad to hear ts only 50 needed now.</div></div><hr />

I agree 100% with this. Anyone can solo pull all the needed mobs, it doesn't require FD or bards fading; just a bit more patience for those without those particular tools. Additionally, it would be a pain in the proverbial to do.  I haven't tried soloing in Vxed, but myself and my regular group have farmed it like crazy.  I can't imagine the xp being any better than Kod Taz, and I would assume the time taken to solo a mob in Vxed would be similar, so you're talking around 6-7 minutes per mob for those without elemental+ drums (around 5 mins with, and it's all AA dependant)  and that's not counting any downtime that may be due to a lag spike, mob getting lucky, etc etc (there really isn't much room for a bard to kite at ZI)  For 50 mobs, you're talking around a minimum of 4 hours, give or take 10%, up to a potential 6+ hours for 50 mobs only...  double this for 100 mobs.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, you'd have to be one bored bard to do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think the key here is the combination of selos and DA to get to the flag mob. Anyone can solo there, including shamen, and at about the same rate as a bard too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I smell something fishy with this story.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if a bard can charm in vxed or not, but if they can, I suppose that it would be pretty fast if he charmed one and trained 3 or 4 mobs onto it, I am just not sure if pet deaths count against the kill count.  Also the fact that it was good exp tells me that the bard does get the kill.   I am really finding it hard to believe that placement of the summoning mobs and subsequent repops possibly being summoning mobs is such to allow for what is being described here.<br />
<br />
Its also possible I am missing an angle i guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  You don't need Selos or DA to get to the flag mob.  You can do it with just sow and lev.  I've done it for Tipt long ago when I got my flag in the early parts of GoD.   We wiped on the final mob.  I went splat on pull but the group managed to win, the problem was we got a few adds and wiped.   We didn't want to give up so the warrior (who had the flag already) trained the zone in front of us while we followed all the way to the flag mob.</div></div><hr />

Its not that the bard is trying to flag the whole guild. He is soloing in there for excellent XP, and also accomplishing another goal at the same time. This is most common during the days, when Clerics, Warriors and Chanters are not as abundant, at least in my guild. Lets face it, without the proper class balance, these trials are a PITA. <br />
<br />
Believe me or not, its happened a few times now. Yeah, it takes 3-4 hours, I guess they pull a few and AE them down, I dunno, I dont play a bard, but even 50 takes a solid group a couple hours. This honestly isnt THAT much slower, and the Bard is getting some mega XP in the process. <br />
<br />
Not sure about charming, but if you know anything about swarm kiting, you would understand that its NOT charmed when it dies, thats where the huge XP comes from. Charm, let others beat on it til near dead, break charm and kill the near-dead one, repeat. I dont know if this is the method being used, I somehow doubt it.</div></div><hr />

I think the point is that their are classes that are becoming stuipdly over powered. I am sorry but the fact that they can solo there  proves the point. Chanters are over powered also but at least there is some danger in charming. Bards kiteing 40 or 50 things at once is stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bardic charm is capped at level 57 mobs.  I doubt there's many of those in a Vxed trial, so I'm gonna have to agree with you here.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who said that the bards where killing 40 or 50 mobs at once here? As far as the type of ae kiting your refering to here I don't think it's done much anymore with the nurf to the extended range aa effecting only benificial spells it's extremely hard to do and easily results in death.<br />
<br />
Vxed would be a nightmare for trying that type of thing because there are summoning mobs, mobs that run at different speeds, mobs that cast and mobs that snare. I salute any bard crazy enough to try ae kiting that and will even log in a cleric to rez thier corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Solo in vxed like others said is no big deal and far from productive. No way can the bard kill as fast a shaman could in this zone anyways imo..your both bumming if you get a summoning yellow con cragbeast..hell even 75 percent slowed (mitigated of course) it eats up a 10500hp tank fast...your both gonna die.<br />
<br />
Clawmarks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">OK I think everyone is reading too much into this. <br />
<br />
First off, a Bard is going to be much more successful pulling the non-summoning mobs than anyone else. Why? because Fade allows them to skip mobs and pull from as deep as they wish. Other classes are limited to whats right there. You can't really skip the summoners and the yellows unless your a bard, I think. <br />
<br />
Secondly, I have noticed that the mobs here break root and VP regularly. Although I have not tried to Mal Decay + VP yet, though. This creates a problem for shaman. Personally, I hate having to re-root, and I will avoid ANY mobs that break VP early for soloing. <br />
<br />
Thirdly, I am really not trying to make a statement against bards, or whatever. I am using this exoample to highlight the difficulty of gauging content difficulty in todays EQ. As I said in an earlier post, if you make things &quot;easier&quot; for the less equipped people, you are merely trivializing it for the upper half. This applies to a lot of things. I did an LDoN Hard with one of these bards pulling. Collect 26, took us 38 minutes, and we never left the ZI room. Cleric, 12K tank, druid, ranger, me. Hardly uber DPS or anything. But we are all decently geared and he is an amazing puller. <br />
<br />
People like Iz, Snoww, BlargX, are right. Its impossible to create 1 set of content for all levels of EQ players anymore. The gap is too wide. A less equipped, less AAed Bard (note I didnt say less skilled, I do not see people who play less or dont raid as &quot;less&quot; skilled) probably wont be able to do the Vxed thing  with any efficiency. Didnt seem like a big deal to these guys though. I guess thats the point I am trying to make here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Just because they can doesn't mean it is efficient.  Like another person said &quot;having the group wait outside while he solo'd it&quot;  That's just plain retarded, he pulls mob, using fade or whatever floats his boat, dps use non taunt weapons, and let the bard do his thing them chopping all the way not using taunts.  MUCH MUCH faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">necros can do this as well, and it only takes them about 2.5 hours to kill 50, if that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well.. screw it.. .I'm going to go and solo this entire trial just to say that I can do it, and that I can do it in shorter time than the bard can :)<br />
<br />
Oh.. on that note we did a Hard Guk last night with 2x shaman, 1x pally, 1x wiz, 1x necro and 1x bard.. was pretty trivial.. took 40min for collect 28.  It's funny how equipment suddenly renders even hard ldon easily.  The 2nd shaman was the only one without qvic gear.  We did a normal just before that without the bard and at one time we had about 15 mobs in camp (someone forgot snare) and even then, it was almost trivial.  Just funny to me what a difference equipment/AAs make sometimes.</div></div><hr />
