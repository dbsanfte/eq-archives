<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am I really only looking at like 40hp for 10 aa here? Got an item that pushed me over 280 sta fully buffed last night, so I popped 2 aa into Planar Power, and I was pretty dissapointed at the gains that 5 sta got me ( surprise surprise ). I think I will be better off to put AA elsewhere until I complete more useful options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm a bit confused Krakster. ND3 (which you mention in the title) is 12AA to get 10% more hp (excluding hp gear, but including stamina).  That's a bit under 200hp for 12AA (ymmv, depends on your base stamina + stamina gear)<br />
<br />
If you are talking about the stamina AA and planar power stuff, then I would agree that the benefits are minimal. Once you've got all the other nice aa though, more hp is always more hp.<br />
<br />
I get 3hp per stamina point... with ND3, I guess that'd be 3.3hp per stamina point. So 2AA for 5Sta = ~8hp per AA if you have ND3. That's about half the returns from ND3.<br />
<br />
Please correct me if I got any of that wrong )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You dont get full benefit from high Stamina, that makes the benefits for Planar Power somewhat questionable.<br />
<br />
So that makes it an AA skill to take if you have everything else already, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My understanding of ND3 is that the bonus applies to your STA, buffed or unbuffed. Shaman get 3hp per sta up to about 255sta, after which it falls off to about 1hp per sta. ND3 effects that however bringing it to about 1.5 HP per sta. So the 25 more sta you can get from 280-305, with ND3AA as well should net you about 38 more hp.....for 10 AA points....ewww. Just wanting to make sure I was thinking correctly when it came to that. I love HP and all but I ain't that hard up for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm confused too.  He seemed to be talking about ISTA and AISTA, but the title points towards ND3.  His profile shows ND3 and he's only got 220 STA, so even with Tali Boar and PE, that's only 300 STA (unless the profile's old or he's using Stat food)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, I'm with ya now Krakster.... my stamina is well below 255 even buffed, didn't realise it drops to 1hp per sta above that. Yikes. <br />
<br />
There's better places to spend aa I think :) ND3 is nice, but getting it above 255 seems pretty worthless until you have more AA than you know what to do with.<br />
<br />
FinalJustice - I think he's just saying he's got ND3, coz that makes a difference to how many hp you get per stamina. The question relates to the additional stamina points you can get from the PoP AA increasing your stamina cap. I think :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah sta past 255 is pretty weak over all for all classes and its true for shaman<br />
 too. The reason to by planar power, the aa he's actually talking about, is because it increases your sta cap and your wis cap. Adding both hps and mana at the same time for only 2 aa points. Even then I would probably put it pretty low on my list of things to get.<br />
<br />
In your case i'd be looking for combat agility and lightning relexes.<br />
<br />
BTW ND works on anything other than pure hp buffs, ie aego, pog, focus, brells etc. Sta buffs, your base hps and even your hps from gear benifit from the +10% that ND3 gives you. So the better your gear is the more hps nd3 will give you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hehe, let me put it this way:<br />
<br />
Self buffed, I hit my 280 sta cap last night. I then dumped 2 aa into Planar Power, bringing my personal sta cap to 285. The HP increase I got from those 2 aa points was very little. <br />
<br />
The purpose of the thread is to ask if I am calculating my HP correctly, going from 280-305 sta. ND3 comes into play, because it changes the HP per STA you get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I never really thought about this much.  <br />
<br />
My unbuffed STA is 206, so with Boar/PE I would have an unbuffed STA of... 206 + 60 + 20 = 286.  I am, for all intents and purposes, capped right now.  If I were to get Planar Power 1, as I was thinking of doing next, I would gain 1hp.  Oooh!  Assuming I got some more STA (from somewhere) I could gain as much as 7hp.  Oooh!  I guess I will get planar power at some point...but it will be some point in the distant future.  I think combat agility, lightning reflexes, radiant cure 2, healing gift 3 (to finish that series) and advanced healing gift are calling out to me first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep, I will be swapping out my coldain skin gloves for something with more raw HP/AC/resists in the meantime. I need to dump about 15 sta and find more gear with raw HP on it....<br />
<br />
anyone think of some decent droppable gloves until I win some phatlewtz for my hand slot? ( was thinking of a circlet of smoke from the cursed when the time comes)<br />
<br />
In the meantime I was lookin at storm rider gaunts ( NEVER for sale in the bazaar ), shissar scale, my old PoH gaunts... Found these also:<br />
<br />
Supple Black Gloves: Wt 1.20. +13 AC, +8 Agi, +8 Wis, +4 Cha, +8 vsPos, +8 vsDis, +50 HP, +50 Mana, LORE MAGIC NODROP   Classes: C D Sm. All Races. Dropped by Overseer Wrank. <br />
<br />
Anyone know anything about this camp? Sounds like I can solo it pretty easy, but I don't know crap about LoY really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Supple black gloves drop off Wrank in torg mines.  He's the boss guy of the zone.  First you have to kill 20 guards and get keys (they don't all drop keys).  Then you have to find 20 resistance miners to give the keys to (there are on average 2-3 up at a time, 10-15 minute respawn'ish).  Figure about 6 hours to get the keys and turn them in.  Killing other slaves can help speed up the resistance miner spawn process a bit.  <br />
<br />
Once you've turned in 20 keys, the overseer spawns.  There are 6 guards in his room, but you can pacify it all to clear them easy.  Overseer himself hits for 350's I believe, has a 500 dmg fire AE.<br />
<br />
IIRC he drops 2/3 of his loots every time you kill him.  I got the gloves, our cleric got the ring (70hp/mana, 10 sta/wis) when we killed him.  The loot is pretty nice, but a ridiculous amount of time to spawn the guy.<br />
<br />
So uh, no, you can't solo it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have ND3 and could max my sta at 285, fully raid buffed i was below 5800hpts by at least 10 or more, cant remember the exact number. I put another 2 points into planer power and now i am at 5821hpts fully buffed. If its a 30hpt gain per 2 aa points then I will train planer power to 5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">According to Magelo, 305 sta gives 47 hp more than 280 sta, with Natural Durability 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">According to Magelo, 305 sta gives 47 hp more than 280 sta, with Natural Durability 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
yes, had you read the other thread on stamina, you would have seen where I posted, that at lvl 65 with nd3, stamina over 255 gives 1.85 hitpoints per stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Regardless....I just finally got ND3 and gained approx 151 hps from it...without being fully raid buffed.  Was sitting at exactly 5600hps raid buffed..so I'll see what I get now with ND3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, sta over 255 is pretty much worthless since it only returns half as much hp as pre-255.<br />
<br />
I have 338 sta unbuffed theoretically but my cap is still at 280 after 175ish aa's simply because there are so many other aa's that is better than PP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes, 10 AA for Planar Power 5 will only get you 47 HP as already mentioned.  Getting PP5 for Sta only isn't really that great, but it is a decent amount of mana for the extra 50 Wis though.  If you have all the other good AA's already getting PP5 can't hurt, but I wouldn't get it over some of the better AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually I've been thinking about this a lot lately.  Kudos to Krakster for bringing up the subject.  It does appear that hp gains due to post 280 stamina are minimal at best.  I have unbuffed 254 stamina these days, and frankly, the 26 stamina I get for buffing myself with Boar often isn't worth the effort.</div></div><hr />
