Does anyone know if this spell will shrink our pet? I'm getting tired of targeting my huge pet by accident so often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Our pet hasnt been shrinkable since right at the release of LDON. It has always been buggy, with various graphic engine patches breaking it, at one time, at the release of Luclin, shrink made it huge....dont hold your breath on a fix.</div></div><hr />

we've been raising our vioces over this for 6 months now. i /bug this issue at least 3 times a week. i was doing it every time i logged but decided to chill out and have my friends start /bugging, to have it come from different voices... since it's just as annoying for them as it is me.</div></div><hr />

With all of the problems hovering about, who really gives a damn about shrinking a dog.... my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I bug report this loads. Along with Spiritcall 4 and 5 being broken, Call of the ancients being broken etc etc... they will probably do nothing but i feel its my duty to keep hassling them to work for the money i pay them each month.  :mad:</div></div><hr />
