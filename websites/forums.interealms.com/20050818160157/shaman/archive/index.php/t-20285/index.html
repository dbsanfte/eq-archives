Quiescence = 300per tick x 4 ticks = 1200hp for 200 mana = 6hp per mana<br />
<br />
Breath of Trushar ( Prenerf ) = 360 per tick x 4 ticks = 1440hp for 220 mana = 6.54hp per mana <br />
<br />
Breath of Trushar ( nerfed ) = 360 per tick x 4 ticks = 1440hp for 285 mana = 5.05hp per mana<br />
<br />
OK so as u can see BoT prenerf was a slight upgrade to quiescence but nothing major. Still cool for an upgrade though.<br />
<br />
Nerfed, BoT is now 1/6th worse mana efficient that Quiecence. So in the patch today they went and made our heal less efficient than our previous spell in the line in an expansion where we can barely keep someone alive with a GoD mob on them slowed. This is just bull**** and has made me so angry that i'm considering playing my WoW beta invite and just giving up on EQ. Bad enough our class is close to useless in the expansion but they had to take one of the 2 good things we get and ruin it. i'm so dissapointed i can't even express it without getting banned from the forum. Jeez if they had even made our heal 400hp for the extra 65mana they added it would still not be ass efficient than Q but would be better than just getting it nerfed. this has been my favorite line of spells for shamans since i started and was always something i was proud to have.<br />

Look, we get it. They changed BoT. We have seen the numbers. Take a moment, breathe in. But stop with the dramatic over reactions. You are considering playing your WoW Beta invite huh? Well, is that what this post was really about? So, you got into WoW.... I assume that you were going to play the Beta anyway or you wouldn't have applied for it...... it's not like you didn't apply......<br />
<br />
Anyhow, it's getting pretty boring seeing every single shaman in the universe start an angry post. Can't someone start one in the grey and have everyone who is annoyed, slapped in the face, quitting, cancelling their account, starting a beserker, PL'ing a beastlord in disgust, feedbacking in game 1200 times an hour, etc, etc. just add &quot;Me too&quot; and be done?<br />
<br />
With everyone getting so excited here it's hard to recognize a worthwhile post.</div></div><hr />

Damn, must be nice to have friends that work for Blizzard, considering the emails for beta verification haven't even been sent yet. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KumarriTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">they were sent weds. and to be honest i was gonna play in off hours just to see what classes would be cool. it's just things like this that make me mad thats all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't let this stooge test WoW, he might brake the thing before it gets through Beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Phroke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">um, they haven't been sent out yet. Some people were floating around faked emails that got people all excited, but nothing more. The official boards even state they haven't gone out yet. According to Kat and GF.</div></div><hr />

don't worry, they are working on it, look like BoT will possible change to 500hp per tick with 285mana, they just forgot change the hp to 500 after increase mana :<br />
<br />
Breath of Trushar ( possible fixed ) = 500 per tick x 4 ticks = 2000hp for 285 mana = 7hp per mana, which will upgrade to Q</div></div><hr />

<br />
for SOE to even put that spell out shows that no one in SOE is paying attn to what we presently have for spells??????<br />
<br />
just makes SOE look inept to me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KumarriTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">omg my friends sent me a joke email. holy crap it was convincing. Man i got joshed. no WoW for me yet :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well atleast those of us who don't have it can say we skipped BoT cause Q is almost as good (and not cause we're too lazy to get it).</div></div><hr />
