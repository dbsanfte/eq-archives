<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I camped myself a soulstripper coupla days ago cause I wanted a greenie farming tool. When I farm greens I pull a bunch of them and slow em while dog dog chews away. Therefore I like to have a shield equiped for the extra ac/stats plus a nice lil greenie whacking weapon. Soulstripper works nice. :P<br />
<br />
Anyways skilled up from 1 to 10 or so in exp groups in PoP just messing around. I trained my 1hb up to 34 at the trainer. I really dont want to spend any more points on it (saving them for tradeskills).<br />
<br />
So last night I went to dulak, brought puppy up, bearformed myself, hasted and Raged myself (Dont have VotB yet :) and went to town. I killed greens for 2 hours.<br />
<br />
Problem. After 2 hours 1hb didnt move it all. Still at 34. Str was near maxed (252 out of 260). Dex, agi, ect were all over 200. *** is going on? Do combat skills not increase in bearform? Or do the mobs have to be lb or higher? Is Int a function of skillups at all? (Int was only 71 i think).<br />
<br />
Help. :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Real simple... cant get skill raises on Greenies.  You have to get xp for the kill to get a skill raise.  Back in the day it was confusing because you'd be hitting a green and get a skill raise / xp if it was just below the blue mark.  Now days it's real simple.  Kill Lt Blue guys all day long and you'll get skill raises.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ive noticed myself that you get more skill ups the harder the mob, i.e. a dark blue/white mob will give you more chance of a skill up then a light blue. this makes sense, because i am guessing the reason you dont get skill ups from greenies is because they are easy, so the harder the mob, the more skillups (or chance to get them maybe). while i havent officially tested it, i know i tried to use light blues for skill ups, slow as hell, got tired and moved to xp hunting, and they were going up rapidly, sometimes 2 points in one mob.<br />
<br />
basically, i wouldnt bother using light blues for skill ups, too slow skill and xp, unless the loot is too nice to pass up and you are in need of it. just tank dark blues and higher, theyll go up fine on their own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LoL,  I am maxing pierce (191) right now for the same reason and have both 1hb and 2hb at 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If your raid can support it..go VoB/Haste and start whacking on whatever your raid is after.  I've gotten some great skill-ups whacking on Vindi and the like. MUCH faster if you're hitting reds or yellows to you, which is why it's so much easier to skill-up at lower levels.<br />
<br />
It's a nice change from casting a few futile nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">most people dont have the luxury of my server.  but when we did sleepers (hes still sleeping) after killing 3 warders would go down and get inside the bubble and smack the sleeper overnight or something.  red con mob with unlimited HP, doesnt move and doest riposte.  was quite fun.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I maxed all my melee skills, including h2h, while camping the comm2 piece for my emp key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">actually, I have never gotten a skill up on a lt blue. only dblue and up.<br />
<br />
I was training my warrior on 1hb just for kicks and was taking ltblues out on the beach in gunthrak and at the low skill level of 15 I got no gains, as soon as I went to a dblue mob I got like 5 gains/fight till I got to about 50 then it tapered off.<br />
<br />
anyway, moral is, I didn't see a raise in skills on ltblues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have gotten lots of skillups on light blues.<br />
<br />
I managed to max my 2HB and increase my 1HB from 139 to 178 in just a few days doing VT key shard camps - a few light blues, a lot of low dark blues, a few high dark blues.<br />
<br />
Having very high stats helps a lot.  I'm lucky enough to have an Ancient Prismatic Spear, so I poked with that until it procced and then switched to my 1HB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">go to maidens eye and pull a lt blu / blue mob it works $   <br />
<br />
<br />
i trained 2hb (83 - 115) thier off 3 mobs  ( i used rabid bear on a hunter)   and rabid bear owns  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have been training my skills up recently and I have gotten a few skill raises on green mobs.  I used to think you couldn't, but thats not true.  I double checked my spam and the con message and I did get 1 or 2 raises from green gorangas in Maidens Eye.  The amount of skill raises goes up with the difficulty of the mob IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There is another way to skill up: duel a dark blue pet. Still worked yesterday night, although something new happened, which did not occur during the last event of this sort we held.<br />
<br />
At a guild event (yesterday) we tried to get our skills up with this method. Just one thing was changed: when you heal your opponent (who is battling the pet) during the battle, the pet poofs. Gone. We tested it a few times to confirm this.<br />
But getting melee and offense/defense up from duelling a pet still works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Theres 2 mobs that are fantastic for fixing melee skills if you've left it too late (I used this for my frog cleric when I hit 60 but my defense was still at 190ish) to get easy skill ups earlier on.<br />
<br />
The mist panther in WL is one and theres also a wierd naked Erudite quest npc in Erudin next to the library, blue to 60, max hit of 8, not many hps though but guards do NOT assist her.  The trick is to pull her between the inn and library so a nearby enchanter npc runes and hastes her.  Que one endless punch bag with no real risk (Not sure if the nearby gm's assist her though, so careful with that) but afaik it is allowed because of the risk and the fact that she is fighting back.  Only downside with the Erudite is that you get a lot of beggars =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I got 9 raises of 1HB in 3 minutes fighting the broken golem in PoF. I agree, the harder the mob the better the increases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I skill up on boring VT raids.  Equip a weapon, self avatar, use chanter haste, ranger attack, and just melee when everything is slowed and things are going well.  My skills are now maxed, cept for HtH which doesn't wanna raise for whatever reason, dammit.</div></div><hr />
