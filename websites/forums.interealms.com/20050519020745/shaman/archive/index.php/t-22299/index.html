I can't seem to find much information about LDoN raids here or on the web, so any input would be very useful here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Figure the easiest LDON raids are a step above LDON HARD.  If everyone you take with you can in groups of 6 complete LDON hards with some time left -- say 10-20 minutes to spare then you have a shot at an LDON raid -- if NOT then you probably do not.  If you can complete the LDON hards with 20-30 minutes to spare then you have a good chance at easy LDON raids.</div></div><hr />

It was provided to us by another player outside our guild, a friend of one of our officers. I hope this helps. By the way ... even if you do know what you're doing ... LDON raids just are awful. Period.<br />
<br />
**********<br />
First off, the difficulty is totally static. Nothing in the zones change based on number of people you have, their levels, or anything. It's exactly as hard for 18 level 60s that request it as it is for 36 level 65s with 500 AA each with casters of around 10k buffed hps. So if you are kind of in the mid range of raiders, I'd stick to the easier raids. *<br />
*<br />
It's 36 raiders. Minimum is something like 18, but again, for intents and purposes most wouldn't be winnable with that even under exceptional conditions. *<br />
*<br />
There's Vex-tuned ones, Elemental-tuned ones, and Time-tuned ones. Vex and Elemental are both 'normal' difficulty, Time ones are high. Spread is like this: *<br />
*<br />
Rujark: 1 Vex Thal, 2 Time. *<br />
Butcherblock: 1 Elemental, 1 Time. *<br />
Miragul: 1 Elemental, 1 Time.<br />
Takish: 1 Vex Thal, 1 Time. *<br />
Guk: 1 Time (and 2 unknown. Totally bugged when I tried months ago). *<br />
*<br />
You could do well trying the vex ones, and working your way up to the elemental butcherblock one, and some time maybe the miragul elemental one. Vex Thal ones are decent for a guild trying- no augments drop, it's all vex/ssra type loot. Not shabby, not great, but not shabby. A lot have decent right clicks, enough where I did these pretty routinely for my Time+ guild during the long lull before GoD came out (one of the vex one has a nice 100/100 cloak with right click SoW, for example). *<br />
<br />
Ruj one has some interesting chain aggro that can catch you out if you dont work out how it works but it otherwise pretty simple. Kill 3 named mobs in seperate rooms - this spawns the bigger boss. Kill him - get loot. <br />
*<br />
Takish one you clear as much as you can then raid splits into 3 groups and each goes to a set area (hint - clear all the mobs first as a raid ... just pull em all to the middle room and wipe them out). Mobs spawn in the three areas that are similar im difficulty to hard ldon xp runs (hit for 900ish) .. nothing too hard but there are 3 or 4 waves of 5 mobs in each room then one named in each area. If you don't keep up then the next wave spawns and things can get very messy. <br />
*<br />
Mistmoore is probably the easiest one - clear entire zone (basically) till you have 3 named left up .. then split raid into 3 and kill them all at the same time. One spawns some mezzable mini adds I seem to recall... nothing special otherwise. We used to farm this one regularily for the 50hp augments *<br />
*<br />
Of the three I'd say Mistmoore &lt; Ruj &lt; Takish in terms of difficulty. <br />
*<br />
Here's what you need to know about the 3 raids you could really try, if you don't like spoilers, just don't read below: *<br />
*<br />
Rujark Warlord Raid: Basically, there's 2 mechanics added to this raid you need to deal with. *<br />
-The first is goblin run code, something truly annoying. Basically, when goblins detect that they have less than 2 other goblins supporting them, they run until they find another goblin to bring back. This never turns 'off'. It loops infinitely unless you find ways to kill the running goblins. This can be a serious pain. Fortunately, unlike the Time level rujark, these goblins are basically snareable and you can nuke them out. But it's still a huge pain. You can tank them down and get them low and kill them all simultaneously, or try desperately to root/snare/nuke them out, or best yet, pacify/invis past them (virtually nothing in rujark normal sees invis). *<br />
*<br />
-The second mechanic is arguably more dangerous. There's 3 captains, and a warlord. The captains need to be killed first. Every one of the captains and warlords guards are named after him. Like Instead of A Rujarkian Vindicator, they'll be An Omal Vindicator or whatever. There's going to be around 12 or so in each room. Now here's what happens- after about a minute of being aggro, each one of those will do a cry for help. This summons every other thing by that name for help. In the warlords case, it summons the captains too. So pretty much, any guard type mob for a room HAS to be killed quickly. This is going to be a true bitch for a lower guild with avengers (who are kind of like Eom difficulty from vex) since they have a lot of health. On the plus side, virtually everything can be pacified. Pull avengers last, clear out as much trash as you can, then if you get captain+tons of stuff from a call just tank captain and avengers, mez everything else, and clear it out. Warlord works virtually identically to the captain, just moreso, with a weirdly hard to resist AE fear. *<br />
*<br />
Takish - this is more straight forward, but probably harder. You clear out all sorts of traps and trash and have 3 different empty rooms. When you enter these ring-rooms, they start to spawn trash. They spawn based on time, not how much you kill. After X number of waves, a boss spawns. When all bosses are dead, you win. Split up the raid. If you take the time to run between the rings, you will get overwhelmed. On the downside, these rings are going to be very, very hard for 12 people (36/3) in pre-vex gear. It'll be a lot like 12 people taking on a particularly tough pull in vex. Workable for sure, but uh, you might wanna do Rujark one first unless you are highly confidant in your people. *<br />
*<br />
Butcherblock- This is another split up the raid one. First, you clear through tons of trash (ignore the red con scions, they do nothing, and are not required to win the raid), kill all the summoners, and are eventually left with 3 named bosses alone in their rooms. They are leashed, it's easy to pull around them. Basically, they have a few different detects- one is if the others aren't engaged, and then they'll start to full heal around 70%. The other is if the fight just goes on too long, and then they'll heal. The shadow boss reflects and summons adds. THe werewolf boss flurries (but is slowable), the mummy boss sometimes (rarely, don't know why he does or doesn't) casts Valdoon's ae which is brutal for a lower guild (curse counters). I'd probably not split up evenly, but do something like 3 groups with shadow, 2 groups with werewolf, 1 with mummy. But really whatever works for you. Technically, this raid has a death limit, but I've never hit it. *<br />
*<br />
Miragul- this is a puzzle one. Every event almost is a puzzle. It'd take forever to explain, but I'll just say some of the lose conditions are unfortunately far too easy to blow, so I'd avoid it. This is the raid that has given me the most actual losses without wiping. <br />

This is completely inaccurate or they changed it since you tried it with this method. My guild tried this one twice and it actually ended there. We decided they sucked ballz and are a waste of time. We cleared the entire zone with 40 minutes left of time. All 3 named bosses were up and we kept all boss mobs with in a percent of two of one another. they still completely CH each time....all different percentages too..was at 90 some times at 80 some times right away. 40 minutes of engaging the boss mobs and keeping there percentages right with one another we still failed this 2 times.<br />

Clawmarks,<br />
You must have missed this portion of my original post: &quot;This is cross-posted from my guild's officer forum. It was provided to us by another player outside our guild, a friend of one of our officers.&quot; We have not personally tried every single one of these themes. We raided a Rujarkian one, just to test it out, and the running goblins wiped us once. We tried again, got to one of the bosses, and the ENTIRE roomful of orcs was pulled onto the raid, wiping us. We tried again, and wiped. As it was then midnight PST, we gave up and haven't been back. I know of no plans to try it again, it just wasn't worth the effort. Fun, but not worth it.<br />

The extra fail conditions were removed awhile back.  The only way to lose the MIRB &quot;Frozen Nightmare&quot; raid now is to let the timer expire.  Tordail is right - it was too easy to blow before.  On the frenzied animals event you could lose the raid in literally 30 seconds if you didn't know what was happening, which was more than likely on a first try.  Sorry about that. :(<br />
If anyone wants to try it again I'd love to hear how the raid went.  You can contact me at jcaraker@soe.sony.com<br />

This part can be done without messing round with run away goblins. We just invised past and moved to the 3 warlord part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The problem with LDoN raids were:<br />
<br />
1) Raid Size Limit - Could only take 36 people, this after an expansion where raid limits were pushed to 72.  You had to tell half your guild to sit out.  It wasn't possible to run two raids at the same times unless you had the miracle guild with 16+ clerics and 8+ warriors.<br />
<br />
2) Lock out timers on failures suck.<br />
<br />
3) Loosing cause of death counts suck.<br />
<br />
4) The gear sucked for the difficulty.  Anyone that could beat the raid wouldn't want the crap that it dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm in a small family guild over on AB. Err... now I think about it we're not that small, but anyway. We posted a question on the AB boards re LDON raids since we wanted to try. We did eventually have a go. Didn't wipe but didn't succeed either - just not enough of a clue about *** we were supposed to be doing. The thread is still added to as we discover more bits of info<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The thing is the mystery behind actually winning a LDON raid shouldn't be during the event. It should be clear cut..do this and you win like the group LDONS..collect me this or kill this many and win. Why on earth would any guild want to do a raid in LDON that is a pain to set up and once you actually get one going..no one seems to have a clue on what needs to be done in the end..resulting in a 3 hour loss that sucks ass with absolutely no rewards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kaam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So the bottom line is: if some other target is up, go for it, and ignore LDoN Raids (unless we're bored to death).<br />
<br />
I guess they should make these instanced raids and adventures scalable...<br />
