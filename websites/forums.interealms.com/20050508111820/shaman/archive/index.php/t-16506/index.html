<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With LDoN, I decided to explore it a bit with my new 2nd box 30 SK I'm levelling up.  So I logged my SK in on my primary box and my shaman onto my 2nd box for buffs before grabbing an LDoN group with the SK.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the character I usually play on that 2nd box is a druid on the same account as the SK.  I had that box wired up to hit hot key #10 (Forage) any time I hit the left arrow.<br />
<br />
By this time, I'm sure everyone sees where this is going....<br />
<br />
Sadly, my shaman has HK10 wired to canni5.  Logging him into a box which has that key wired to left arrow isn't the best thing I could have done....<br />
<br />
I used to think the people who said they'd canni'd themselves to death might be kidding.....</div></div><hr />
