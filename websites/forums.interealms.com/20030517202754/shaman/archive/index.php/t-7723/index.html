<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snowielder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1.  Would it be possible for a 58 shaman and a 55 ranger to duo Lodizal?  Was thinking about trying it for fun, but wasn't sure if it was even feasible.  If it's possible, what would be the best strategy?  I was thinking slow, snare, have ranger use archery disc, then melee the rest of the way.  I do have epic, and bane, no pox though.<br />
<br />
2.  Secondly, we are currently looking to upgrade gear.  What would make the biggest difference for us:  better stats gear for ranger or a better haste item (currently using SCHW)?  Was thinking about saving up up for CoCW or CoF, then doing general upgrades later, but perhaps others who have more experience duoing to 60 can tell me that AC/HPs/stats will be just as good as better haste.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sojourne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How far along is the Ranger to getting Swiftwind? That would be a very nice upgrade in a good bit of areas. I would think the ranger should mostly focus on that unless he is guildless. Can't beat the 40% haste on it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think a 58 shaman and 55 ranger would struggle, youre missing two of the spells that make is possible for shaman to survive big mobs - malo and torpor. It's the shamans ability to slow and then survive a mob that makes them able to solo/duo over everything else.<br />
<br />
No harm in trying it tho, you never know!<br />
<br />
I wouldnt worry about haste for the ranger if they can get or have Swiftwind. Go for gear, they seem to have a thing for dex for the archery but I'd talk them into looking for a good AC/HP balance from the point of view of a duo.</div></div><hr />
