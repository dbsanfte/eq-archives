<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was in BW yesterday trying to see if I can kite the2 named wurms for the Wurmslayer quest, they didn't pop so I took a stroll into Chardok for a look. I notice that not many people actually go into that place. Anyway I single pulled near the first bridge (?) area and was doing fine until one of those slavering dog-looking things decided to join in the fun, I made it out of there with like 45hp. <br />
<br />
Anyway, the question is, why is Chardok so empty ? I was doing a bit of reading and it seems that the place has quite a few nice drops. And....for anyone that has solo'ed in there, any advice ? And is the xp in there any good ? Just need a change of scenery from Jaggedpine, totally sick and tired of JPF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">mainly because its off the beaten path<br />
<br />
and the xp there is GREAT until 61, after that i dont know cause i havent been there since 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmmm, cool. I think I might try hanging out there for a while. Had no problems with the single mob that I pulled near the Zone out.  By the time I had to re-root, I already had him down to 3 bubs of hp and I still had about 60m left. It was only the add that caused me to break and run. <br />
<br />
Cool, thanks. Will give it another shot this weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kysran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grab a healer type and the two of you can clean up on the exp.<br />
<br />
Rounlin is right, no one heads there because the place is in BFE. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">BTW, the dogs are animals, so you can fear kite them. Bring a healing partner and you'll be fine doing zone-in and zone-out, need a bit more to do the fortress though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The dogs are Animals ?!?! Heh heh I think my weekends just got a bit more interesting. Thanks for all the help people.<br />
<br />
Weird thing though, Eqatlas has the mobs listed as 45+ but when I hit track, just about all the mobs conned dark blue, even those by the zone in / zone out line. Maybe they increased the mob levels during a patch or something. Whatever, at last, something interesting to do in EQ again. I simply cannot stand to look at another griffon or anaconda again, yuck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get a Shaman partner. Haste + slows make it go a lot faster in there since less downtime is needed for healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i wouldnt suggest solo fear kiting the dogs unless the zone in or zone out is cleared</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Panteroo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">pre-PoP Chardok was IMHO, the PREMIER experience zone in the game. Ranging in ability areas from a low 50's group to a full 60's group to a full raid force. I have spent hundreds of hours in chardok and everything a single group could kill (including a single group kill of the Chardok King recently). I went there for AA points prior to pop and with a solid group of 60's we could get 1 aa point in just a hair over 2 hours.<br />
<br />
The dogs are animals and will sometimes see thru invis. Best bet would be to grab a healer type for duo action. With a like similiar leveled healer you could likely duo zone in, zone out, entrance fort (possible exception of the named in the top left *turret* ), and the lev tunnel all the way down to the Captain spawn door. Any one of those areas will keep you and a duo partner in constant supply of mobs. <br />
<br />
If you have a full group of mid 50's you should look into the Bridge Keeper/Captain Area and the Observer/Bridge area.<br />
<br />
A full group of highish 50's should head directly to the mines to either the bank or the Foreman/Collaborator area. Be forewarned, mobs are higher level and respawn faster here. Crowd control and slow will be necessary. Can also do the Graveyard and initial Royal Arch areas.<br />
<br />
If you ahve a group of 60's the deep mines are the place to be. The bank/waterfall area is fun, Overseer/Underboss is fast paced with some good loots, the Herbalist house is a pathing nightmare and should only be considered if you have serious quality people. My favorite tho is the Kennels. 2 named mobs there with fast respawns, tons of mobs and the likelyhood that you can and will die at any second. Very nice loots too.<br />
<br />
It was not uncommon for my group to leave after a 4-5 hour night there (at the kennels) with about 1.5k in coin for everybody AND 5-10 loots that could occassionally top 80-100k in value. This is a constant barrage of mobs with a high dps group tho... things like not paying attention (1 runner = wipe) and afk will kill you np.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />
