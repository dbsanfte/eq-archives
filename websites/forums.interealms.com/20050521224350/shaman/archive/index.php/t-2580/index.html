<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thoughts, opinions? I hear they drop the earring of station.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only caster sarnaks drop the earring of stations and very rare at that. <br />
Why a shaman would want those beats me. Sure 5 ac on an earring is nice, but I'd rather have some hp/mana along with that instead of 5 str.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sonic wolves in GF that are similar level to the sarnak knights/partisans drop (a lot more often thatn the partisans drop the earring of station) an ear piece with plus 3 to ac/wis/int/str/cha<br />
<br />
no drop<br />
<br />
got my first from a Mangler, light blue to me at level 48<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  my bad - should not even mention the knights, I guess</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even 1 in a Million is more often than the Sarnak Knights. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eahlfereth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One note, I actually watched my Druid Brother Solo at the Entrance to Chardok, and a Sarnak Ear of Station did indeed drop off a warrior recruit there.<br />
<br />
However, anywhere else, I have never heard of it dropping off anything but a caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aw jesus rubes, this post is a JOKE.<br />
<br />
you're all busted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was surprised to see two sarnak earrings of station drop back to back at the first fort in Chardok about a month ago.  (both dropped off caster Sarnaks).<br />
<br />
I had only seen two of them drop before this! (both in Dalnir)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Snowgoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have seen one drop, at the Sarnak Forstess  in LOIO.<br />
Cant remember if it was a caster mob or not though.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've seen two drop off Sarnak extremists (casters) in Burning Woods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hey now, I used to drool over earrings of station, 5ac? On an earring? Not lore? Uber! <br />
<br />
Your shaman appears to be evil, if you want better ac on the ear slot then dont forget Ivandyrs Hoop, easier to get hold of in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I seen this earring drop only once, its was in the fort in the Lake of Ill Omen.  <br />
<br />
It was ninja looted and the group got the line &quot;I didnt know it was no-drop&quot; mean while we talking about it before hand and how it was no drop /sigh /disband.<br />
<br />
Earring really not great for a Shaman, more melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Given it's rarety and it's *cough*crappy*cough* stats, it's one of the worst earings for any class.<br />
<br />
I know monks that look at this and think &quot;UBAh! 5ac!&quot;, when in reality the Black Sapphire Earings are better for them.<br />
<br />
Shoot, I think BSEEs are better for most classes. I know my NEC, MNK and SHM are wearing them ( well, SHM might be, still working on Earing of Solstice and Ivandyr's ;) ).<br />
<br />
5AC, NO DROP and drops in 1 in 100? or even 200? Flank that. BSEE 500 plat, tops and are player made.</div></div><hr />
