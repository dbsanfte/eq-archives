This is just bizarre.  A preinstalled operating has to stay with the system for it's entire life?  What constitutes said system?  What happens if replace the hard drive?  Sorry Redmond, but if I want to give my school a computer with linux, *this* isn't gonna stop me.<br />

Aside from the other scary concerns, considering the myriad  security flaws in the Passport system, is this really a good idea.<br />
<br />
Heres the third bizarre microsoft story<br />

The (admittedly paranoid) scenario they're trying to avoid is some company buying a mass of new PC's, wiping the system (or installing something else), donating the Hardware for a nice tax-writeoff and selling the software (say Windows XP at a 50% discount) for a tidy profit.<br />
<br />
The onion link is classic :)<br />

&quot;Where to, O Gateslord&quot; - rofl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a tenuous legal construct.  Whatabout first sale?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coryn</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Link 1 - OEM copies of OSes are sold with a computer at a discount, and are valid only for use on that computer.  You can certainly donate a computer with linux installed --  you cant, however, keep the OEM OS disc and use it on another computer.  That's piracy.  Of course, if the computer didnt come from an OEM with an operating system (dell servers, gamepc, alienware, build-it-yourself systems can all come with no OS) then it doesnt apply.<br />
<br />
Link 2 - passport seems bigger than it really is, simply because every single hotmail user, msn messenger user, etc. counts.<br />
<br />
Link 3 - no wonder new yorkers say water quality sucks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A. It is a legal requirement that pre-installed operating systems remain with a machine for the life of the machine. If a company or individual donates a machine to your school, it must be donated with the operating system that was installed on the PC.  <br />
From the website<br />
I realize that technichly there not saying that the operating system  has to be *installed*, but do you think schools are gonna realize that.  It's deliberatly worded to be misleading.  FUD at it's best!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coryn</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also from the website:<br />
<br />
If your school has a Campus Agreement Subscription or a School Agreement Subscription, and you receive a donated computer with a properly licensed operating system, it's automatically covered by your agreement. That means you can install the Campus or School Agreement software on the donated computer at no extra cost.<br />
<br />
That makes it pretty clear that you don't have to have it installed, i would think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does seem to be contradictory, though. It is obviously to keep people from un-installing the cheeper OEM version of the OS to re-install it on another machine, but it seems open to interpretation.<br />
<br />
I wonder if upgrading the OS while never un-installing the first one counts?</div></div><hr />
