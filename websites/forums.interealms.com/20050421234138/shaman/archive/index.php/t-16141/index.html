<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hello<br />
<br />
I would go to Dulak for a few levels if I were you.<br />
<br />
I was there from lvl 48 to lvl 55 and made enough money to buy a JBB, a horse, Tae Ew tunic+shield+leggings, Soulstripper + upgrades for 6 other slots.<br />
<br />
Greetings Gukak Kluelezz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Myst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been in Dulak alot lately and the zone is very nice for us to solo.  They have really cut back on the gem drops since LDoN started getting close but you can still leave with several nice gems and bags full of weapons that sell for 3-5pp.  At 52 you should be able to hold the Stormwave and keep it pretty much cleared, give Dog the shivs since they are not worth carrying about and have fun.   :) <br />
<br />
Note: One of the better charms drops off the Capt. of the Storm but it is pretty rare  :( , but something else to look out for...</div></div><hr />
