<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Matten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have. Noticed the other day that I was getting quite a bit more xp than I was previously when duoing with a friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I only played a little while yesterday exploring Veksar with an enchanter guildmate but got pretty decent exp. All the bloodgills in the front of the zone were light blue, but we crawled way back into the zone where everything was dark blue. Got about 15% AA during the whole thing..and it wasnt what I'd call heavy killing. We just killed mobs here and there that were in our way, and there were 2 or 3 other groups exploring at the same time so they were killing a lot of stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Matten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Overall I applaud SOEs decision to impliment this.  I feel that it enhances the game and makes it more fun to play. Now if only they would do something about the insane spawn times... 3.5 hrs for a newbie quest in Innothule? I mean, come on...</div></div><hr />

Seemed like it in Dulak.<br />
<br />
I remember looking at it after being grouped with two or three others last night and thinking that my XP was about where I would have expected it to be had I been soloing those mobs. (And usually, if I grouped, it was with guildies\friends and I mentally wrote off any expectation of XP gain)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Camping shards last night I actually got pretty good AA exp off of Sun Revs in the grey, and grimlings in Acrylia.  I'm guessing ssra is actually good for exp now =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In true EQ fashion, imo they went a tad overboard.  I love the new grouping exp.  In a full group, I was getting better exp than I would solo.  I was grouped for all of one hour this morning before I left.. leaving them shamanless (darn casual gamers!).  Solo - I think they went too far.  From what I gather the exp modifiers are something like: -40% solo, then 10% duo, 20% three, ...  I was hoping that -40 would be closer to the -10%-0% ratio.  This was all PoP stuff.<br />
I'm looking forward to finally leveling out of 61, and still being able to gain experience in those zones I used to like to frequent.  Good thing for that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I noticed more exp per mob in PoV yesterday. Where it normally took 3 mobs to fill a blue bubble of exp (at 65, 100% exp to aa), it was only taking 2 mobs to fill that same amount. hehe.. If only my groupmates wouldn't have been constantly going afk, maybe I'd have REALLY gotten some exp. ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: forgot to mention, I was in a full group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been routinely duoing (2-boxing) my shaman/warrior combo in Plane of Valor at the Gamite Frogs on the east side of the zone.  I've been doing this for the last couple months as my exp grind location, since it is rarely camped, it totally safe during downtime, and is decent but not risky exp.<br />
<br />
Before the patch, on my 65th level shaman, with 90% exp to AA, I was getting either 0 or 1 percent per kill when duo'd with my 61st level warrior (who is at 100% AA).  Last night, with no change in the mobs being killed, the group configuration, the AA/regular split, the method of kill, or any other variation, I was getting 1 to 2 percent per kill.  My sample size is about 20 mobs.<br />
<br />
Thus, for a simple duo in a tier 2 PoP plane, on mobs that are 58-60 level, the exp has increased.  Not sure my sample size is significant enough to put it in a formula, but it looks to be a 50% increase in this particular setting.<br />
<br />
I like it.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I thought exp would be a little slower overall and did not really watch my bar closely, but after my second AA ding I sat and watched...<br />

****!!!<br />

There is no negative solo exp modifier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Er didnt do a full test, did a quick guild group in HoH tonight<br />

65 cleric<br />
65 ranger<br />
65+64 rogue<br />
65 paladin<br />
65 shaman<br />
<br />
probably a 500aa group. Was killing in hero hall, I would say xp seemed 25% faster, we were chainpulling and taking 40secs or so to kill each mob(usual) with 5-10secs between mobs max. <br />
<br />
Most mobs were now giving 2pc here, so i'm guessing an aa an hour would be feasible. camp was previously 70-75% aa/hour with similar group makeup/quick pulller.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I though that was the whole idea of the group xp changes, to make group more favourable that soloing, and by the sounds of it, it worked like a treat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Technically no not a negative solo exp modifier but the fact that pop exp over all was lowered will give you less exp per solo kill. Lowered the Zem so they could boost the group exp so really side effect gives a negative solo exp modifier from where it was prepatch.<br />
<br />
I havent had the chance to fully mess with this yet but grouping 3-5 seems to be a decent boost with the same mobs we kill. Solo i didnt think it was terrible of a drop in exp but at the same time was a limited about of solo time. Ive yet to be able to really get a good amount of time in to test it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hey, soloing in PoP may be worse, but now you can make decent AA soloing in old world zones (more dark blue mobs to 65), which generally have a lot more character than most of the planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">solo is much less...<br />
<br />
full group is faster than before imo.<br />
<br />
they kind of fixed it right i really can't complain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hey, soloing in PoP may be worse, but now you can make decent AA soloing in old world zones (more dark blue mobs to 65), which generally have a lot more character than most of the planes.<br />
<br />
Plus you can play like a shaman in old world zones, rather than as a chanter who can't charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">here is a simple calculation:  <br />
group of:<br />
1 = 100% xp of the fight (100/1 each member)<br />
2 = 120% xp of the fight (120/2 each)<br />
...<br />
5 = 180% xp of the fight (180/5 each)<br />
6 = 216% xp of the fight (180/5 each means 216/6 each)<br />
<br />
So a Full group gets a 116% bonus xp!!! <br />
Each mob gives more than double the xp it gives soloing!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">lv 65 Barbarian Shaman, 100% aa xp, Solo<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Loopi Loo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Right after the server went up I got a group together in plane of earth to try the new exp. It was about 4-5% AA a kill. It was too good to be true lol.<br />
<br />
Later in the day they took down all elemental zones, and we went back after into the same spot, and got 3% AA a kill, with the rare 4% every 10 or so mobs.<br />
<br />
Its still slightly better now than before the initial patch, but I wouldn't be suprised if they snuck in more &quot;adjustments&quot; to other zones.<br />
<br />
Soloing now is definitely much slower than a solid group unfortunately. One friend told me that they now get 11% AA a kill instead of 18% AA in doomfire. /shrug, I told them to be happy that they can at least still quad mobs that give 11% each, I sure as hell never will be able to lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">/sigh  forced to group with N00bs that powerleveled their toons on KEI/Aego just to get decent exp.  at least they changed the kei thing.  yes i anser their polls, &quot;I WOULD RATHER SOLO&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kalaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;A blood raven at PON 0.8% AA xp<br />
(before patch 0.20 AA xp, 400% boosted!!)&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this an effect of xp mod, or is it because the raven is now dark blue to you where it was light blue before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Fighting luggalds in Nadox with full group of 50-53-- exp was so much better. I might actually get to level 54.:)<br />
<br />
Bad thing -- Razorfin guy spawned after one of our wizards left, we killed, got drops, then server crashed. Lost loot and exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ok solo exp more noticable than i first thought. I had been doing some pling lately of another char and when i pulled the 8 mobs from the two camps would fill up two yellow of aaxp. Did the same today and it filled up one yellow of aa exp. <br />
   Not an exact science since the mobs are 55-57 and they give a little different exp to the lvl 61 char. But was pretty consistant two yellows before and was only one and maybe little ticks over after the change . Not a complaint or gripe atm just giving some info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Slaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">No complaints here, 70% of lvl 62 and 2 aa's in 6 hours gaming Wednesday. Roughly three hours in PoI Factory and 3 hours in HoH.</div></div><hr />
