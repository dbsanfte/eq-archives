<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi fellas.  Well, I'm back after a year's haitus.  I got involved in DAoC back in October 2001 and have been playing as Cicero on Midgard Galahad since then.  I haven't touched EQ at all since October 1.<br />
<br />
So, what's changed?  Are any of the old guys still here?  How's the shaman business these days?  Anyone here on Innoruuk?<br />
<br />
My old guild on Xegony moved to DAoC, and I killed that account last year, so I'm restarting from scratch on Inny where I have a couple RL friends, but they're casual players.<br />
<br />
Basically, DAoC got old and boring, and while I'm still GM of Jormungander, Midgard Galahad, DAoC.  Then last week, SOE sent me a new account for free, and since DAoC was getting stale, I took 'em up on it.  <br />
<br />
I'm trying to get my feet under me again for Innoruuk.  I was once a lvl 60 shaman with 200+ days played, and 178 alchemy, and I'm working my way (slowly) back towards that now, but I don't know very many folks on Innoruuk, and most of the ones I did know in general seem to have migrated away.<br />
<br />
So basically, take this email as a hi there, I'm back on EQ.<br />
<br />
Different name, different server, (different level), same person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hey..you played Midgard Galahad?  Me too.<br />
<br />
Probably ran into you at least once.<br />
<br />
Had a lvl 37 shadowblade named Bhakur.<br />
<br />
Anyway, glad to have ya back.  DAoC just wasn't all it was cracked up to be so I can understand why you made the move back to EQ :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, in DAoC, I'm Cicero --<br />
<br />
GM of Jormungander<br />
1079 Ranked Legendary Grandmaster Weaponsmith.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vandulus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am still on the Inny server despite my best efforts to quit this god forsaken game<br />
<br />
Drop me a line and I will do what I can for you.  Vandulus is my Shaman name as well in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks Van.  I appreciate it.  I have a couple friends who've played on Inny since release, so they've managed to help me find some fair gear.  I'm not hurting for anything really except meeting folks and heck, I wouldn't mind finding a good guild to get back into the swing of things with.  I'm focusing on leveling up right now though, which unfortunately has been mostly via soloing.<br />
<br />
My new shaman on Innoruuk is &quot;Karsan&quot;.<br />
<br />
After 200+ days played on Xegony, and lvl 60 as an ogre shaman, then taking a haitus for a year... when I came back to EQ, I still chose to play a shaman.   My only difference was this time I'm playing a troll.</div></div><hr />
