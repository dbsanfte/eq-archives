<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sakiris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i made an account here a week ago and can finally post today.<br />
<br />
I want to know a place where i can solo (not DSP crappy XP) or group that has excellent XP.<br />
<br />
I would do HHK but groups in there take about 3 hours to get into because of long lines.  This is for WR not GR.<br />
<br />
Any ideas would help.</div></div><hr />

try LDON, at 36 i'm getting about half a level per adventure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think he's going to be soloing in LDON any time soon.<br />
<br />
Try Crystal Caverns.  Loot and XP are both pretty good.  Unrest is good XP also, as is Solusek's Eye (though I do not condone the killing of gnomes).</div></div><hr />
