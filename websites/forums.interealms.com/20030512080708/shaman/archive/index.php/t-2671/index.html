<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Phorm Phactor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i am level 29 almost 30....for the test of patience, when i need t sit at the bottom of eruds crossing, can i do it w/out being lvl 45? if i keep invis vs. animals up will i be ok? just asking cause i want to get as far as i can on this quest since ill be lvl 30 for a while...and i need a good shiled :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did that stage around 39, and had no problems.  I kept Invis to animals up (and when it started to drop I made sure no sharks were around before re-casting) and was never noticed.<br />
<br />
You should be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phorm Phactor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks alot, actually, i started it today in bb and everything is going great so far- thanks again for the advice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Heeoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have done everything up to handing in the dire wolf pelt for the boots and I am 35.  Solo the two idiots, invis to animals for sharks (had a druid friend there watching over me but I wanted to see if the invis to animals really worked) and had a little help in with the dire wolf.  Took the wolf down with a 54 warrior, 52 druid and a lvl 60 cleric.  melee went ld and when she came back, druid and cleric were low on hp, six mobs on them and the wolf still up.  Fortunately, all were dropped, shaman got the pelt and now I need to get to the spirit safely.  Had to gate twice due to aggroing too many mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phorm Phactor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">killing the dire wolf should be great fun :) lol but yeah,  my guild is willing to help me do it in a couple levels, im gonna get the shield, and the hold off on the quest for a couple levels, and then pick it up w/ the emerald jungle part, and they'll help me with the wolf. it'll  be a group or two of 45-50's, so they might actually get xp for him, so they arent to reluctant at all. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you choose to do the test of patience at your level, realize that there is a 100 percent chance you will have to deal with the killer shark.<br />
<br />
Some people have overcome this by levitating OVER the water and listening for the spirit to spawn (skipping Abe &amp; company).  I actually used the ITA method. <br />
<br />
When the killer shark pathed by he immediately aggro'd (he doesn't seem to be immune to ITA..it's like he has an AoE dispell or something).  The first time he did I had to gate out.  After having to do the 'drunk' part a second time I wised up and memmed good old Flash of Light.  When the shark aggro'd me this time I flashed him..and re-invised while he ran away.  He never came back.<br />
<br />
If you do choose to do this the 'old fashioned' way..bring help.  A big tank or a chanter could make this very simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Konnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got lucky at level 35 and killer shark never came close. If you  use sense animals to check when a killer shark is nearby you might be able to stay out of his way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I used ITA and got smoked by the killer shark.  I was watching the icon so I could recast if needed so I'm 99% sure it didnt fade. This gets me to thinking that the killer shark just might spawn with see invis sometimes....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did the Test of Patience at level 30 with the help of a Goblin Gazughi Ring; that ring has an insta-casting targetable Invisibility vs. Animals, and none of the sharks that swam right above my head aggroed while I had that spell on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did this part of the Quest at lvl 36. Kept ITA up the whole time, remained standing and must have had a whole lot of luck. I think I saw one shark the entire time I was down there. Glad you got past it, and good hunting to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Invis to Animals WORKS.  A few patches ago (around the April May time) they included a little blurb in the patch message about how the Killer Sharks are now considered 'animals'.<br />
<br />
So yes, if you did the quest a while back, you probably had a hell of a time with the killer sharks...but now it's a piece of cake.</div></div><hr />
