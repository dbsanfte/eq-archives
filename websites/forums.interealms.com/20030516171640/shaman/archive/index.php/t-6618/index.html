<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A friend of mine is interested in doing this quest and I said I'd help - I'm now wondering if its worth doing for myself too :)<br />
<br />
Current Shield, SBS:<br />
25AC +5Str +5Sta +10vsMg +10vsFire +10vsCold +40HP<br />
<br />
SoBW:<br />
25AC +20Wis +8Cha +12vsMg<br />
<br />
Basically, its a tossup between the 40hp and 5 stamina on SBS (plus nice saves) and the 20 wis on the bane warder (plus the time needed to do this quest). Given my wis is fairly low (about 150 at level 55) I'm really tempted to do the quest (I can always sell it later) but I know how important Hp are too.<br />
<br />
I'm intrested to hear all your thoughts on whether its worth the time or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SoBW can take forever...<br />
i did it and like the SoBW better than the SBS.  my wisdom is about 210 though so the shield lets me keep a sizable mana pull without killing my AC.  still keep the SBS for resist situations though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If nothing else, it is a nice way to make some cash. The shield still sells for 20-25k on my server. I did the quest when Luclin first came out and it was cool to run around and have everyone ask what that shield is. As soon as I had the chance, I sold the SoBW and grabbed and OoIV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SBS is better, all things considered.  I like the saves, and the HP...not to mention is 1k compared to 20k on saryrn.  Save for OoIV if you can, or something more usefull<br />
<br />
However SoBW looks cool as hell, and is very nice, plus it has teh ubah cha, which helps the resists land pst!(/sarcasm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kargen Krimsonwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Depending on the situation, I'll either use my SBS or my SoBW. I use SBS on raid situations where i need those extra hp and resists like Ntov. For normal gear I use my SoBW. Plus the wisdom helps for tradeskills so its nice to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ursus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Which is an OoIV?<br />
<br />
NM...i understand now..lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I personally had a SoBW and it was nice, but for most circumstances I preferred my good old SBS; I now pack around a Bone Braced Buckler (LOL when I get time to play, which these days ain't often) look into it : Ac 25 +10 Str +10 Wis +50 Hit/Mana<br />
Over all, your getting more mana than the SoBW gives you (depending on your wis of course) and we all know that were a hit point obsessive class :-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hijacking this thread.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to MQ this? I have all the items except the ashes. A friend of mine has the ashes though. Can we do this quest together and get a shield? If so how is this accomplished?<br />
<br />
/Merry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can the npc be charmed /boggle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/agree Helfdane<br />
<br />
I'd forget the SoBW and get a Bone Braced Buckler.  Not as pretty, but function &gt; form.  BBB is easier to get, they are down to 8kish on my server, I can farm 4x that amount of plat in the time it takes to do SoBW quest. :p<br />
<br />
Merry: any quest that doesn't require no-drop items to be combined in a no-drop container should be MQ'able.  Just make sure everyone turning in has the required faction.</div></div><hr />
