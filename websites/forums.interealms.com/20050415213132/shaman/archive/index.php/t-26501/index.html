that works, but don't mess with the resist check.<br />
<br />
make it a 250 proc or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Change too many things and it will get really messy.<br />
<br />
I would like them to make the pet changes first and evaluate that.<br />
<br />
If the devs feel that further adjustments need to be made then do it through recast times but not 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Start with 10 seconds then after a time evaluate that effect and adjust the recast time down or up from there.<br />
<br />
Also eliminate the timer link between the spells. There is no need for that at all.</div></div><hr />

Glori I want to debate whether it is insanely powerful.<br />
<br />
The spell is powerful.  I've done some calculations in some of the other threads that propose a max burst dps on a raid of about 1100 dps over a three minute period with this spell.  That's cooperative dps, for a shaman casting this buff on 18 other characters.<br />
<br />
That compares to a wizard's max burst dps of about the same 1100 dps, chain nuking their best Ancient spell, using all available aa and focii and buffs.  That's direct dps: the one wizard causes it by nuking the mob.<br />
<br />
It's not entirely a fair comparison:  what damage one character can cause by nuking, up against the damage another character can cause by buffing 18 others.<br />
<br />
The fair comparison may be to look at an enchanter casting one mgb buff, and increasing the actual burst dps (not the theoretical max, but the actual dps) of 30 characters in a typical raid.<br />
<br />
150 unhasted dps x 30 characters = 4500 dps<br />
<br />
4500 dps x .7 haste = 3150 dps<br />
<br />
Assuming 75% efficiency during a boss mob fight:  2362 cooperative burst dps created by one buff, cast 40 minutes ago.  (We won't even bother to count all the additional damage the enchanter caused during the plow on all the trash mobs along the way.)<br />
<br />
So my 1100 max theoretical cooperative burst dps compares to the enchanter's 2362 actual cooperative burst dps.<br />
<br />
If I keyboard like a madman and drain my mana bar over these three minutes I may get close to that theoretical maximum:  which would mean that a very capable shaman casting and retargetting constantly could provide 47% of the cooperative burst dps of a run-of-the-mill enchanter who cast one buff 40 minutes ago.<br />
<br />
Being able to chain buff people as fast as I can go, to create that much damage: that is powerful.  But it's not insanely powerful.  It's still less than half of what an enchanter routinely does, with one spell, once an hour.</div></div><hr />

<br />
any change to the spell at this point will likely damage its usability permanantly. even with some of the suggestions I've heard so far, some people are saying worse things to begin with...one of the worst being &quot;shorter duration&quot;<br />
<br />
just give it time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sorry - I should point out that I don't think it's insanely powerful at all :)<br />
<br />
Obviously, someone out there does, and I would like to reach a compromise that doesn't cripple the spell and send it right to page 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kapakx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can't say I agree with this. The spell line, even with the pet proc rate, was fine the way it was in all situations, EXCEPT raiding. And destroying the spell line anymore will just make people madder.<br />
<br />
I hate Sony's tactics and Rytan is not a person I ever hope to meet, since I'd like to remain out of prison, but I can totally understand how this spell is messing with game balance at the raid level. NO spell should be able to add 30x the DPS your are ever capable of to a raid. Period. <br />
<br />
With that said, the spell is a little overpowered in group situations and perfectly balanced in soloing situations. I can understand the spell recast time, to a degree, for limiting its DPS. But if the spell is no longer going to do that DPS, then how can we say what cast timer, resist check and proc damage it should do? We have no point of reference for balance on the spell. So we need to balance it, as much as possible, from the spell that we have, know, and love.<br />
<br />
I'd say, leave the spell and the pet proc rates, exactly as they are. And just change the number of people and pets you can put this on. And an easy way is to change the spell timer. But we ALL hate that, especially with the duration. So, if you want to change that and balance it for a raid AND make people happy with the spell, the duration would have to be drastically increased to counter the recast time, but increasing the duration would mean adjusting the proc damage. The spell is fantastic for burst dps, everything a shaman CAN do for DPS, he was finally able TO do.<br />
<br />
So, all in all, the only option is a complete rebuild of the spell, or leaving it alone and accepting a limitation to the number of people it can be cast on. And I for one haven't a clue about how to do this in an unfair, unbalanced and uniritating way, except by adding either recast delay or MASSIVE mana costs. Changing the mana wouldn't effect soloing TOO much for the average player. With grouping it would lower over all DPS, but still be effective, balancing that out. But with a raid, a shaman with spiritual serenity(one I don't have yet), and spiritual channeling(which I have) a shaman could STILL keep the spell up on a significant number of people and make it unbalancing, but far more balanced then it is now.<br />
<br />
So, increase the mana cost AND the recast time. Make it 5-10secs(at most) and give it 1/2 again, to 3/4 again more mana cost. That would balance it against bazaar equiped shamans-time/qvic-anquish equiped shamans. Making ppl still progress through the areas for greater potential, without being buff bots and slow whores, which is what we have been reduced to.<br />
<br />
I've been having more fun in the game with my shaman, then I've had in 5 years. I've played more and considered playing longer then ever have before. I'm even thinking about upping my times and joining a raiding guild, and I've DESPISED them since shamans were marginalized to buff bots and slow whores so others could have the fun. But with the panther line, all the has changed. I've been invited on more raids and into more groups because of this spell line, in the last month, then in the last YEAR. Its made shaman and actual PLAYING class, instead of making us stand on the sidelines.<br />
<br />
So don't destroy the one thing that can extend the play lines for my class. Just leave the spell alone and make an actual balance for the dps in higher end groups and mostly keep the change to the raiding aspect of the spell. I know this isn't going to make the raiders happy with me, but the fact is, raiding is the only totally unbalanced area at the current moment. Every other aspect can easily be fixed with a simple tweak to mana and recast time. And that's what I'd like to see, a balance that would be the easiest, least painful and hassle free fix possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree 100% and honestly think it will only harm us to try to offer them other ways to nerf this for us. They knew (or damn well should have known) what the damage potential of this spell was before they ever sent it to live servers. I don't think this spell will be over powered in any way once pets are adjusted.<br />
<br />
Frankly, if I wanted to tone down something a bit and knew there would be a big fuss about it, I might do something to make it look like it was going to be heavily changed and then whoever was being manipulated might welcome the smaller change. If that's actually what's happening, they're asking to change it. I wouldn't let them think that was ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">NO spell should be able to add 30x the DPS your are ever capable of to a raid. Period. Hah hah, 30x?  How do you calculate that it adds 30x the dps?<br />
<br />
As I said above:my 1100 max theoretical cooperative burst dps compares to the enchanter's 2362 actual cooperative burst dps.An enchanter can routinely add more actual dps than anyone else in the game:  still more than twice the theoretical maximum burst cooperative dps I calculated for a supershaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tehya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I vote NO.<br />
<br />
No recast delay or cast time increase<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
No mana cost increase<br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
No damage decrease<br />
<br />
I will not accept any of those changes.  I know I sound hard-headed and unwilling to negotiate, but this spell is already costly in mana (even the level 61), effort, and the &quot;max&quot; damage done is dependent upon other players being on top of the mob as soon as it arrives with a non-stop attack until it's dead.    <br />
<br />
They cannot be basing their dps numbers on the highest AA's, highest level, best geared and focused shaman casting this spell on the best geared, highest AA'd, most attentive players while fighting and proc'ing every hit on every single mob continuously for 20+ minutes.  That's not realistic data.<br />
<br />
This is a situational burst dps spell buff and lowering it's dps is not acceptable to me.<br />
<br />
If any of the above happen I'd rather go back to struggling with my DoTs and nukes, tyvm, as those would become more reliable and managable for the mana cost and damage done....  I will most likely /rude sony and, after 6 years, never purchase another one of their products.  I am that tired of these tactics.  Obviously, so are many other folks.</div></div><hr />

I dont want a recast time ... none ... at all ....<br />

If they truely feel this spell is &quot;insanely powerfull&quot; and must be nerfed , i am open to any and all possible ideas <br />
<br />
Reducing proc damage ... that sounds fine if they are dead set on mega nerfing this Spellline ... The onlything that i personaly see as unacceptable is Recast time .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes - the addition of a punitive recast time would make me deeply unhappy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kapakx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">To Macnair :<br />
30 was just a number I plucked from the air. Since I didn't want to do the math. But I plucked some more numbers that are a little more down to earth. I'm giving best case scenario's here, so bear with me, I know there are major flaws and impossibilities, but this is just for theory and a closer number then 30 :)<br />
<br />
9 Spell Gems, we'll say 6 of the highest level dots and malos, slow and a heal. And assuming infinate mana and no cast time on slow, malos, dots, no fizzles or resists and the mob is always up.<br />
<br />
So, six dots:<br />
BoYoppa 450/6=75 DPS  <br />
Sysslak 577/6=96.2   <br />
Wunshi 180/6=30<br />
Saryn 320/6=53.3   <br />
Bane 420/6=70     <br />
Ultor 131/6=21.8 <br />
 without focus/crits = 346.3 DPS base<br />
 with always critting = 692.6 DPS<br />
 with 35% damage focus and always critting = 935.01 DPS with no limitations, but I'm going for max.<br />
<br />
Now, I only have a small sampling of personaly data on PC procs and my own pets DPS with procing. But the general consensus seems to be about 100dps for players and 250ish for pets, although my pet is closer to 230ish with it, so I'll use that. And adding in cast time limitations and spell duration limitations for the raid scenario. Figuring an average or 30 PC DPS and 20 pets in a raid of 72. And Panther last 90 sec. with a cast time of 1.5. <br />
<br />
90sec/1.5cast time = 60casts<br />
<br />
100dps * 30players = 3000dps<br />
230dps * 20pets     = 4600dps<br />
<br />
so max dps = 7600 with 10 more casts availabe<br />
<br />
7600/935 = 8.14342 blah blah blah<br />
<br />
So instead of a shaman adding 30x his max possible dps, he's only adding 8 times, I appologize. But considering that there wsa no limitations on the shaman dps besides the 6 spells gems instead of all 9, and the casting limitations and player number limitations on panther in a raid. I believe a shaman going from doing a max possible, ever, dps of 935 to doing 8x that number, is why Sony is swinging the nerf  bat. In another forum, someone posted that there raid went from killing the king in rss at something like 7:30 to 4:30. And that's a &quot;real&quot; world scenario. Thats a helluva nice cut, for one spell to do by itself. And a little too nice in the eyes of balance and SOE. In a group and soloing the numbers are FAR less overpowering. Even underpowered in soloing situations compared to the max shaman dps I layed out up there.<br />
<br />
But in the &quot;real&quot; world of the game, are just about balanced in a group/soloing with FAR less agravation and the ability to be versatile and relaxed and still feel necessary and useful to the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've been thinking about that myself.  Looking at what wizards can do in maximum burn mode, and what a shaman can do, we are the same (1100DPS).  I think that is unfair to wizards - they should be kings of damage.  <br />
<br />
Taking us to 80% of that is about right IMO.  Panther at 440 per strike, leopard at 330 <br />
(porting backwards....a 50's spell at 250, a 40's spell at 200 a 30's spell at 150 and a 20's spell at 100)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You forgot the inherent 2.25 recast. This cuts into your 60 cast number.<br />
<br />
each panther cast takes 6 seconds (unfocused). you'll be able to get about 15 casts maximum. Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kapakx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Okay, so make the cast time 3sec with focus and up the number from 15 to 30, halving my numbers. That's still 4x damage and 3min taken off that raids fight. And the damage isn't considering the melee having crits for the procs. The thing I was trying to avoid were exactly numbers, since only Sony has those and all we're doing is speculation unless they give them to us(which I never see happening). The point is that it was overpowering in raids and easily fixable for groups and balanced for soloing. And that's why Sony is trying to raise the cast times. I want the spell, as do others, to remain the way it is right now. Untouched, but that's not gonna happen, so I'm trying to find a middle ground that won't put it at the back of the book or make it so unejoyable and galling that people would rather quit/reroll rather then use the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Additionally the pet proc raid is already being adjusted to be much closer to that of players.<br />
<br />
Max spell haste 1.5 + 2.5 recast time and assuming all retargeting is done during recast time means 4 seconds a cast. Assuming aa and max spell extension focus should give you minute 45 or 105 second duration. Resulting in an absolute max of 26 people before it starts wearing off o the first person. Only problem is with out accounting for mana pres that would take almost 17k mana. Substantially more than anyone has even after you start accounting for some mana pres and mana regeneration. Even with spiritual channeling it would require substantial outside healing.<br />
<br />
The other thing to remember is the dps builds and trails off like a dot. You don't instantly have x dps. You start off at 100, then 200 etc and it builds up. You might only have 30 seconds or even just a few seconds at that theoretical max. The actual dps over the entire period is going to end up being much closer to half that.<br />
<br />
Taking the theoretical max 26 people and ignoring mana cost issues you should hit about 2600 dps give or take at the peak but it would start dropping off imidiately after that and would have dropped of entirely after 3:30 minutes. Average dps of around 1300 dps for a little over 3 minutes. I'll admit thats pretty good for a theoretical absolute max but the numbers people have crunched on other threads show a wizzard's theoretical max should be around 1100 dps for about 2:30 minutes.<br />
<br />
Given the nature of panther I don't think thats too far over the top. Requiring 26 people or pets to cast it on a substantial build up time and then a fade off after that not to mention that it's still an impossible level to attain due to the mana requirements. Any out of range, can't see target, dispelled dead melees etc kill our dps. While a wizzy and just keep nuking away as long as they have mana and don't get aggro.<br />
<br />
The realistic number for average dps isn't even double that of what you claim. BTW why leave out the dot focus's up to 50% on your dot dps numbers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">30 was just a number I plucked from the air. Since I didn't want to do the math. But I plucked some more numbers Isn't that a problem, though?  Anybody can make up numbers, because they don't want to do the math, or because they want to prove a point.  Don't we need real numbers, if we are going to do real comparisons?<br />
<br />
six dots ... with 35% damage focus and always critting = 935.01 DPS Despite providing a number with 5 significant figures, you're not really concerned with accuracy here, are you?<br />
<br />
90sec/1.5cast time = 60casts<br />
100dps * 30players = 3000dps<br />
230dps * 20pets     = 4600dps<br />
<br />
so max dps = 7600 Figure 5 seconds per cast, please:  18 casts for your 90 seconds.  Figure the dps on the assumption that pet proc rate and pc proc rate is supposed to be the same:  10 per minute, or once per tick.  Figure the actual damage of Panther, 550 damage per proc.<br />
<br />
550/proc x 10 procs a minute x 18 proccers = 99,000 dpm = 1650 dps<br />
<br />
Figure in that this full damage only takes effect after you have the buff on 18 characters:   after 90 seconds total time.  During those 90 seconds you are just building up to this, averaging 825 dps during this build up.  <br />
<br />
825 dps for 90 seconds = 74250<br />
1650 dps for 90 seconds = 148500<br />
total damage for 180 seconds = 222750<br />
average dps for 180 seconds = 1237<br />
<br />
Figure in inefficiency:  you must target, cast, target, cast, you will lose many small fractions of time along the way.  If you can achieve 90% efficiency over this three minute time frame:  you get 1114 dps as an actual theoretical maximum for burst dps.  <br />
<br />
Not 7600 dps.<br />
<br />
Your 935 figure for dot damage is also too high.  Reducing it to 60% because you won't crit on every tick (hah hah nice idea; /summon,  /splat):  561 dps<br />
<br />
1114 / 561 is just about twice as strong.<br />
<br />
Not 30x.  Not 8x.  It's like 2x.  And instead of direct damage, it is cooperative damage that requires buffing 18 other characters.<br />
<br />
I believe a shaman going from doing a max possible, ever, dps of 935 to doing 8x that number, is why Sony is swinging the nerf  bat. Well, it could be that they think that shamans could potentially do 8x the damage, but if that's why, it's because they are doing the math really badly.<br />
<br />
If that's what they think, the solution isn't to shrug and say, &quot;Yah, 8x is way way too much.&quot;  The solution is to point out that they are making a decision based on flawed math, and a flawed comparison of cooperative burst damage with direct burst damage.</div></div><hr />

Seriously . . .bad, bad shaman!  We don't need to be offering compromise positions on this.  They don't need to be changing the spells.  It doesn't need to be group only, it doesn't need a recast.  Brakes are already built in with the mana cost and the duration of the spell.<br />

Yes, but you know it is going to get a nerf... the developers have it in their heads and they will not forget about it.<br />
<br />
I myself think the only way they will be able to come up with a compromise is to add a longer recast to the spell, but 30 seconds is certainly way too much.<br />
<br />
If the developers refuse to just go with the pet changes, then a smaller recast time (in the 5-10 second range) would be the only acceptable change to myself personally. No linked timers, no increased mana costs, no modification of the proc damage, and no to group only</div></div><hr />

That would reduce the ability for it to be chained on raids without otherwise impacting its use.  And a big NO to the group only and any recast timer suggestions.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I've been thinking about that myself.  Looking at what wizards can do in maximum burn mode, and what a shaman can do, we are the same (1100DPS).  I think that is unfair to wizards - they should be kings of damage. <br />
<br />
This is the kind of ignorant (I'm sorry, but it is) statement that probably helped this all come about anyway. A wizard can do that DPS all by themselves. Meanwhile, a shaman needs umpteen pets and melee paying attention and it takes time to get this spell up on that many people on the raid. You don't just flip a switch and you're blowing stuff up all by yourself.<br />

Why would you suppose that we can work out a reasonable compromise with people who cannot reason?  If you think it is just in their heads and they will do it no matter what, why imagine you can make any suggestions, no matter how thoughtful?<br />
<br />
If, instead, you suppose that people at SOE can reason, so a reasonable compromise will be possible:  why not suppose that since they can reason, they can provide a reason why this needs to be nerfed at all?  And a reason for why it needs to be nerfed this amount rather than that amount?  And a reason for why this style of modification is better than that style of modification?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I honestly have a hard time responding in a civil manner to anything regarding the upcoming Panther changes. Mainly because I feel offended.<br />
<br />
A month or so ago SoE asked the respective comunity correspondents to gather a general feedback on a newly introduced spell line. Two days later SoE happily announced that they were so glad about the positive player feedback, that they were going to extend the new spell line. <br />
<br />
Three weeks later SoE announces the pet nerf and another week after that they finish destroying the spell line, which they had happily introduced and gathered feedback on a few weeks earlier.<br />
<br />
Would you call this professional working?<br />
<br />
Adding 100 DPS per melee seems harldy overpowering. This line is static in its power curve and it won't increase its DPS over the months as you progress(Think I have said this 10 times already). Furthermore it is severly limited by the number of recipients in a group. <br />
If you have 3 recipients in your group, a second Shaman will add exactly ZERO DPS through &quot;his&quot; Panther to that group, while the first Shaman adds 300 at best.<br />
To counter this, every Shaman should contribute the majority of his Panther DPS in a group through his own pet, which can be achieved by leaving the wolf's proc rate as high as it originally was and only adjust the proc rate of others' pets for PC buffs.<br />
<br />
So my proposal looks as follows: <br />
<br />
- Leave Panther the way it originally was<br />
<br />
- Change other classes' pets to proc on par with PCs(this is already going in), EXCEPT for Shaman pets to allow Shamans to stack better when in a damage role</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kapakx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I have to agree with Chutoi and Mcnair. I personally think the spell is fine. But I have NEVER seen SOE be reasoned with effectively. And I doubt they are going to start now. The time and resoures required to be reasonable and the patience and level of imput and exchange of information is not in SOE's capabilities. And while a reasonable nerf would be to pets or spell cast time and delay without the pet nerf, I don't see a reason why WE as the shaman community should be the one to put forward all the ways they can nerf us. They do that just fine on their own. So maybe its time to just wait and see where this is getting us. Since we all know, 12 hours before the patch comes out is when they'll hit us with the info, if even then.</div></div><hr />

Not that I've seen.  Were pretty much trying to figure out just what their objections are for sure.  We've all seen the calls for nerfing by cleric, wizard and a couple shamans, but no one at Soe is really talking about the why behind the change.<br />
But, if it does turn out that is raids that are at issue, then group only is a better option than a 30 sec delay.<br />
Both options suck. <br />
A plea to fellow shamans, please dont ask for more nerfs, the devs dont really need the encouragement.<br />
<br />
-Edit-<br />
I read the post on eqlive boards, it seems his objection is the spell doing more than 300 max dps.  Its going to take either some serious nerfing or the dreaded recast delays to bring it in line with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">All these changes seem just like the artificial progression hurdles in Plane of Power expansion.  Back in oldworld, Kunark, Velious, what you could do was limited by what you could do.  If you could hack it, AoW, Tunare, Vulak were all right there on opening day.  Same with Panther, if you had the mana pool for it, g'head deal your damage.  No kludgy game mechanics standing in your way, you drain your mana pool and see how far it'll take you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I'm opposed to reducing proc rates and the size of the DD.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
It's very simple. The problem with the spell is the enormous burst dps it is capable of over and above what allready exists in the game. That power comes from the ability to distribute that damage capability between a number of hosts, and to do that quickly. Any nerf to proc rates and/or magnitude would have to be very large to regulate that. We are not talking about 10%, it will be larger than 50%. Ok, so that solves the problem with the way the spell could be used against large targets, but what does that do to regular joe blow shaman? The ones who dont raid and can only sustain the spell on one target in groups anyway? Suddenly they end up with a very weak spell, and made weak because Glori wants to chain cast in raids for big dps, do you think they are going to be happy with that? Not that you will want to chain cast it anymore, since if it does just so-so damage, you likely find other more usefull things to occupy your time. End result: you get a useless spell that no one will want.<br />
<br />
These folks using enchanter haste as a reference point are throwing smoke, I can MGB haste as well and, with the people I play with, get a dps &quot;increase&quot; allmost as large. Spells like haste have been in the game for a long time, and content is designed around the assumption that they will be there. Panther introduces a large amount of additional damage that content was NOT designed for, consequently it has to be reigned in to maintain balance. Likewise the comparison between a shaman throwing around panther and a wizard using acient spells and all the high end foci available is equally invalid. There is no reason why a bazaar equiped shaman should be capable of dps comparable to end game wizards, and in any case, a wizard chain casting nukes quickly ends up being summoned and squished, something that wont happen to the shaman.<br />
<br />
Rytan has explained that the devs think the pie is too big. And its going to be made into a slice. That 18 wheeler is barreling down the road and looking the other way, sticking fingers in ears and singing protest songs isnt going to stop it. You need to think carefully about what you ask for and what the consequences of that will be for all play styles. Asking for what to you might be a big slice of pie may very well be leaving someone else with a crumb. The spell in its final iteration has to be of service to ALL shaman. Having a recast timer will regulate the power of the spell on large targets (which is where the problem is), but will ensure that ALL shaman end up with a spell of equal power, the only differences coming from any AA abilities or foci they might have.</div></div><hr />

Where did *I* say it needs a nerf?<br />
<br />
I said the developers have it in their minds and they will not forget about it.<br />
<br />
I don't want it nerfed. But if it is going to be nerfed, the only thing I see being acceptable is a 5-10 second recast time, and I base that on how *I* currently use the spell on raids. During the main portion of the fight I am able to maintain it on 5-6 people while doing other things also.<br />
<br />
The only other way I can see to absolutely prevent the large amount of DPS is to reduce the damage itself, either by reducing the damage done, or reducing the proc rate of the spell. I don't want to see either of those happen. Period.</div></div><hr />

No, technically there is another way, and that is to tag it group only, in same way that shrink and invis are.</div></div><hr />
