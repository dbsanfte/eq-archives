<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This 20% Troll xp penalty is killing me.  I've got plenty of regen from gear already, so as far as I can tell I'm just being punished for being green, having crappy fire resist, and not being able to fit through 87% of the doors in Neriak.  These freaking xp penalties are out-dated. Between gear and the changes in the early xp-gain model, the vast majority of benefits that penaltied races recieve can be considered negligeble by the end of the first 20 to 30 levels.  All the while, a_dirty_halfling_rogue2607 is whollowing in his 10% xp bonus all the way to sixty freakin five. Graah its almost enough to make a troll want to restart as a barbarian or a cat....or god forbid.... a frog....  :eek:</div></div><hr />

You knew there was a tradeoff for the ill regen for Trolls and Iksar, don't get grumpy about it now.</div></div><hr />

i'm sure that doesn't make it any less frustratin' from time to time though :)<br />
<br />
my buddy plays an iksar as one of his alts eheh he loves the reasons for playin' the race, accepts the down side of the race. . but that certainly doesn't mean he doesn't enjoy a good vent here or there on the down sides eheh<br />
<br />
vent away i say eheh its all good to me. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cant say I ever really noticed the xp penalty that badly (mainly coz my mate played a troll too), and the regen was great - I really miss it when trying to play a non regen'd twink these days.<br />
<br />
Admitedly I would trade it all in now for frontal stun immunity and to not have my FR so far behind the others (they could have made it crap cold resist - I so rarely seem to need that in comparison)</div></div><hr />

as an iksar shaman i  know what u mean, but believe me, our regen rate saved us more often than the exp malus costs us experience  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Using the old xp tables...<br />
<br />
It took a Barb Shaman 539,119,875 xp to get to 60.  Now the xp tables have changed but the ammount of xp to full 60 remains the same so this number might be higher or lower.  Same with Trolls.<br />
<br />
Troll took 616,137,00... so with the ammount of xp it takes for a barb (5% penalty) to get to 60 a troll would be starting 59, again using the old tables, (59 hell level was taken away so these numbers are probably alot higher than actual now) with approx 78,000,000 xp left till 60.  Again this number is most likely way less now.  Now figuring that an AA was the ammount of xp it takes to get through 51 for a no xp penalty char (approx 10,000,000)  that makes this comparison.  <br />
<br />
A 60 barb with approx 8AAs is the same ammount of exp it takes for a troll/iksar to get to 60.  These numbers are most likely high because of the demise of hell levels between 51 and 60.  So trolls/iksars give up being 1-8AAs behind other races for having the advantage of increased efficiency 1-59... those numbers dont look that bad to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Trusk1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, I want to point out something that older, wiser shaman have pointed out in the past, but seems to be overlooked in the &quot;New EQ&quot;.   <br />
<br />
Is there a racial penalty for Trolls?   Yep, sure is.   I should know, I have a 65 Troll that's been around for about 4 years now.   When I levelled from 64 to 65, I was duoing with a 64 ranger who was also trying to ding.   He had 2.5 blues to go, I had 2 blues to go.   So, we duo'd, and you guessed it, he dinged before I did.   The ONLY difference between us was the racial penalty.<br />
<br />
But here's what  you're forgetting.   Dinging is nice...it's fun...it's exciting...and it is NOT what the game is about.   It's about playing and having fun.   If you're trying to rush to a level, you're missing the journey.  I have grouped with powerlevelled toons before that suck nuts because they didn't take their time to get where they are.   Bottom of the pile may be ebayers, but pl'd toons aren't far above them.  <br />
 <br />
   This goes for any race out there with a penalty.   Suck it up, enjoy the game.  Play to have fun.   Explore new places all the time.   Try different techniques.    Meet new people.   Rejoice every ding.   But stop staring at your damn exp bar.   <br />
<br />

If being a troll is such a pain, Change. No one will fault you for making the change to a different race or class. Those that do...there are terms for people like that *evilgrin*<br />
<br />
Play what you enjoy, and how you enjoy it, and ta heck with the rest :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">exp penalties by race are a rather harsh penalty, imo.  when I made my iksar I didn't know a thing about it, most of us didn't have half a clue back then.  I didn't know until much later on when I felt there was no turning back.    levelling with a 20% penalty was a heavy price to pay.  I thought I'd die trying to reach 60.  I hated the grind, hated it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Trusk1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Then stop playing to grind, and start playing to have fun.   : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm grinding for a purpose though.   :)   I've been playing for a couple years now with my ranger with a regular group of friends.  We recently lost one of our slowers in a lil a tift and the other one to a heavy raiding guild.  I volunteered to make a shaman to fill the gap since we have plenty of damage already and can afford to lose the ranger.  <br />
I picked a troll, cause well, I love trolls.   <br />
<br />
I've had the experience of taking it slow and stopping to smell the roses with my ranger, so I know all about that.  In fact, I'm grinding so I can get back to that once I get the first 50 levels out of the way! But man, that xp penalty hurts sometimes and I just wanted to vent a little about it.</div></div><hr />

Thats by the same group that did &quot;Bite My Tan Mulatto Butt, Numb Nuts!&quot; Right?<br />
<br />
<br />
I call bull**** on your visibly being able to see that you have to kill 1 extra mob out of every 10 to stay up in level as, say, a barbarian shaman. <br />
<br />
Your free to call it as you see it, but the fact is, Trolls and Iksar effectively have a 6th orange bubble to fill.  Having played an Iksar monk extensively in addition to my Troll shaman, I can tell you, its noticable.  It's not bad enough to make me to quit trolling, but it certainly enough to make me want to expess my irritation to others in the same boat.</div></div><hr />
