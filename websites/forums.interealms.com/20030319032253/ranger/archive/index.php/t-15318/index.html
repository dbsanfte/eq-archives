<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drunia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Check Lucy. Paladins now have a 150DD magic based imbue weapon proc at 63, only difference worth mentioning is the resist adjust, Cry of Thunder (level 65 spell that few will ever see, and I'm guessing those who do would prefer to use the effect from fetid gloves as its fire-based) will land more often. So lets work on this. Pallies have LoH, 900HP group heals, level 57 cleric buffs, 90% rezz, some truly sick ratioed weapons one handers and two handers with which in straight melee they will out damage us, they have the second highest AC and HP in the game...did I miss anything? I just recently started grouping with Pallies of higher level and that group heal they have is awesome. Heal the dying casters and grab agro all at once, hard to beat. I'll never stop playing my ranger, I love her to much, but I'm finally beginning to see what all of you mean by &quot;itemization&quot; and all that. It doesn't make sense to me that two comparably equipped people in terms of difficulty to attain the equipment one being a DPS mahcine and one being a healer/tank the healer/tank will out damage the DPS machine. Granted pallies won't go for AoB and Vengence items quite as heavily as rangers interested in maxing their DPS, but you have to wonder.</div></div><hr />
