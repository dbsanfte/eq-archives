<br />
So you're interested in getting started with Dragons of Norrath but can't figure out how to get a mission, lets start with the basics.<br />
<br />
Most servers are done with the gnome quest which opens up broodlands and gives the backgrounds of how the dragons are pissed were invading, Lanys is trying to take over, and the good Princess Firiona is in hiding and trying to gather troops to fight off Lanys. If this isn't the case, I won't spoil that quest for you. But once that is done move on to part 2. Get yourself a good map of lavastorm, pay a friendly druid and head to 2200, 0, 70 (near the old Naggy Lair entrance) and you meet our friends the Mercenaries and their camp of crystal speculators. As loyalists to Neriak you will want to first talk to Wayfarer Mercenary Varein (or perhaps Elanye if you are sympathetic to the palebloods). Come right up and hail her and she will offer you a simple task or three. Typically Blood Money or Spiders Web. These first tasks will give you very minor coin rewards and a special bit of faction so that you may declare sides. This camp is also important because you can trade Norrath Keepers Tokens for Dark Reign Tokens. This becomes noticeable when your friends drag you along helping those lighties and you get stuck with tokens of the wrong faction. You can bring them back to the Mercenary camp, and the twins Youra and Limann who will glady exchange them and turn them in for faction if you do wish to change sides.<br />
<br />
Now that you've completed a little bit of faction for the side you wish, lets travel to your new home the Dark Reign Camp (or the Keepers). This is located in the northernmost cave set (the one a bit to the west is the Norrath Keepers camp so beware, you will be kos as a evil to start with and the same goes for the forces of good in the evil camp).Behind these two camps further in the tunnel is the entrance to the Broodlands, which leads to all the further zones in the expansion except Lavaspinner may also be reached from Lava Storm.<br />
<br />
You will want to start talking to the NPC's here, who really don't want to talk to you yet till you have proven yourself.If you're evil, Start on the outside of the room with Captain Aleeth, then Officer Vacax, then Commander Zaerr who will finally give you a flag and a set of tasks and tell you when you return to speak to Sirrikus who has more tasks. Followers of the good side should speak to the private, then the keeper, then the chieftan and lietenant.<br />
<br />
These Tasks allow you to build up faction and small rewards quickly with your faction. Once you've gained a small amount of faction you may also gather in groups and do shared tasks (one person obtains a task and is shared among the group as is the reward) or Missions. Missions are special in that they create a Dynamic zone for you much like LDON and you are rewarded not only with coin, but the crystal currency that will become important to buy augments, foci, and gear from the merchants who will return shortly. These NPC's are also the ones who will help you buy your and quest for your spells from this expansion.<br />
<br />
You can group with anyone light or dark, just be wary of turning in the tokens above to the wrong camp because it will slow your progress through the ranks towards your final reward for your Dark Brotherhood or the Keepers.<br />
<br />
If you have any other questions or need help getting started with a task, please feel free to /join serverwide.crgaming:crgaming Remember that the crystals will be tradeable between players again in the near future, so hang on to them even if they are from the wrong faction.<br />

<br />
Dragons of Norrath – Good Faction Quests / Missions (work in progress)<br />
<br />
In order to start these Quests you need to have at least indifferent faction standing with the Keepers of Norrath, you can raise this faction in different ways, 1) You can do group missions with your friends or 2) do single person alliance quest’s from the wayfarer’s camp in lavastorm.<br />
<br />
Wayfarer’s Camp (loc positive 220 negative 44 - East of Nagafens Lair zone)<br />
<br />
Wayfarers Mercenary Elanye will offer you single person quests<br />
Wayfarers Mercenary Bitral will offer you single person quests<br />
<br />
In order to get the quests hail the npc, and click accept to the quest you wish to under take.<br />
<br />
Also at the wayfarers camp is Wayfarers Mercenary Youra. When you complete any (good aligned) group missions you will receive a Norrath’s Keepers Token, this will automatically appear on your cursor, and you hand this into the aforementioned Mercenary, and this will raise your faction with the keepers of Norrath.<br />
<br />
Norrath Keepers Camp (loc positive 3648 negative 530 – NW corner of lavastorm)<br />
<br />
Kanetheus Forestwalker will offer you group missions for 3-6 people<br />
Bianca Galgraith will offer you group missions for 3-6 people<br />
Boldger Bristlebeard will offer you group missions for 3-6 people<br />
Gordish Frozenheart I am unclear what he offers at this time<br />
<br />
All of the above names apart from the last one (for the time being until unlocked) will reward you with a various amount of Radiant Crystals and a Norrath’s Keepers Token upon every successful completion of the mission you accepted.<br />
<br />
The Radiant Crystals can be traded with other players or can be used to purchase items from the merchant at the camp; this is basically a more advanced LDoN points system. (At this time the Merchant is not in the game)<br />
<br />
After completing a various number of the above quest’s and missions you will eventually become Indifferent faction with Norrath’s Keepers, and this will unlock further development with the Keepers of Norrath.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gift of the Keepers<br />
<br />
In order to progress from here you must first speak to Chieftain Relae Aderi, you do this by hailing him and following through the dialogue, he will send you to speak to Private Nylaen Kel’Ther, and he will assign you 3 quests.<br />
<br />
Quest 1 – Greed of the goblins<br />
Kill 11 Stillmoon Laborer’s inside the temple of Stillmoon<br />
<br />
Quest 2 – Creating an antidote<br />
Loot 5 Boiling Lavaspinner Bloods from Lavaspinner’s Lair<br />
<br />
Quest 3 – Burning Arrows<br />
Loot 5 Delvian Goblin teeth from Tirranun’s Delve<br />
<br />
Upon completing each quest you shall receive approximately 40% aa exp and 220platinum and faction to the Keeper’s of Norrath, once you have completed all 3 you may go and hail Chieftain Relae Aderi once more, and he gives you more work to do, you then go and speak to Keeper Dilar Nelune, and he gives you a mission, for this you will need a minimum of 3 people and a maximum of 6.<br />
<br />
Mission 1 – Children of Gimblax<br />
Relae must have already told you that Gimblax plans to exact vengeance upon you for killing the goblins in the temple. We have learned roughly where this foul goblin is and highly recommend you find your way to him before he finds you.<br />
<br />
Upon completing this mission you must go back to Chieftain Relae Aderi and hail him once more…. Congratulations you have now received 2 AA and the new ability Gift of the Keepers – Your devotion to Norrath’s Keepers grants you increased Statistics (+10 to all stats cap).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Valor of the Keepers<br />
<br />
After completing the above, I am sure your hungry for more action!!!!<br />
<br />
To start of this part you must once again go and Hail Chieftain Relae Aderi, and he will send you to speak to Private Nylaen Kel’ Ther, when you speak to the private he assigns you 3 more solo quests.<br />
<br />
Quest 1 – Turn the Tides of the Sand<br />
Loot 7 Sandy Goblin Blood from the Stillmoon Temple<br />
<br />
Quest 2 – Recover the Lost Map<br />
Loot 8 Shredded Map Pieces from The Ascent<br />
<br />
Quest 3 – Defend the Kirin Contact<br />
Kill 9 Kirin’s in The Ascent<br />
<br />
Again for each quest listed above that you complete you shall receive approximately 40% aa exp and 220platinum and faction. Once you have completed all 3 of the above you must go and speak to Chieftain Relae Aderi, and he will send you to speak to Keeper Dilar Nelune, this will open a new group mission Sickness of the Spirit (this is not needed to be completed for progression) he will also ask you to speak to Lieutenant Ekiltu Verlor you will be offered an Event.<br />
<br />
Event 1 – Calling of Emoush<br />
You must hurry. The Dark Reign are slowly making their way deeper into Tirranun’s Delve. We have heard they seek a magic that the delve goblins possess that allows them to create a great, sentient, and dangerous dervish of stone. This dervish is a danger to everyone in the delve, but if the Dark Reign are able to capture and harness the dervish, they will most certainly use it in the army they build. You must find a way to put an end to this magic posthaste!<br />
<br />
Maximum Players : 24<br />
<br />
Upon completing this event you will loot a stone from Emoush and go back to Chieftain Relae Aderi and hand it to him, upon the hand you shall receive another 2 AA and the new ability Valor of the Keepers (+250 hp / mana / endurance) You will also receive your new class lvl 69 spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next Ability (unsolved at this time)<br />
<br />
To continue with the progression you once again hail Chieftain Relae Aderi and he sends you back to Private Nylaen Kel’Ther, who once more assigns you 3 more quests.<br />
<br />
Quest 1 – Snowfoot Revenge<br />
Kill 10 Snowfoot Goblins in The Ascent<br />
<br />
Quest 2 – Protect the Waters<br />
Loot 5 Purified Nest Water in Stillmoon Temple<br />
<br />
Quest 3 – The Sacred Scrolls<br />
Loot 7 Ancient Scroll of Wisdom from Thundercrest Isles<br />
<br />
Once again upon completing each Quest you shall receive approximately 40% AA and 220p and faction.<br />
<br />
Again you must now go and hail Chieftain Relae Aderi, and he will send you to Keeper Dilar Nelune this will have opened another 3-6 person mission History of the Isle, and he will also ask you to speak to Lieutenant Ekiltu Verlor, and this will have opened up 2 more Events which appear to both needed for the next part of the progression.<br />
<br />
Event 1 – Trial of Perseverance (Not completed at this time)<br />
There are still more parchments and tomes we wish to lean about in Stillmoon Temple. Some of these documents may provide the Dark Reign with the ability to bring ruin to the world. You must use your strength, stamina, and wherewithal to uncover these scrolls and secure them before the Dark Reign can get their hands on them.<br />
<br />
Maximum Players: 24<br />
<br />
<br />
Event 2 – Volkara’s Bite (Not completed at this time)<br />
Deep in the caverns of the Lavaspinner’s Lair is the queen of the spiders. Her name is Volkara and hour by hour she builds her army of lavaspinners that weave and kill by spinning webs as hot and deadly as the lava that surrounds them. She has taken to the flavor of the blood and flesh of mortals and she must be stopped. You must go there in the name of Norrath’s Keepers and Firiona Vie to stop the flow of blood in her caves.<br />
<br />
Maximum Players: 42<br />
<br />
<br />
Well at this time this all the information I have available, I shall update as I find out more / complete more of these trials, hope this helps you all out.<br />
<br />

So far it's...<br />
Guide for Evil DoN Progression<br />
<br />
So, you want to follow the Dark Reign? Just follow these simple steps to get there and soon you'll be enjoying the life of killing and slaughtering all of those who follow Friona Vie.<br />
<br />
First thing is first, the Dark Reign just won't START to like you because you want to follow them, you have to prove your dedication to them.<br />
<br />
Go to the Wayfarer Camp in Lava Storm Mountains just east of the Soldung B entrance at /loc 2200, -50. When you get there, you might want to talk to either Wayfarers Mercenary Varein, Jeryx, or Elanye. They'll give you some soloable mission to increase your faction for the Dark Reign. Once you've done enough of these missions, or the groupable ones (from someone who has indifferent faction or better), then head off and talk with Zaerr Ty'Dal in the Dark Reign Outpost in Lava Storm Mountains at /loc 3000, -350. Follow the text and soon he'll ask you to help out in the most meager form possible. Find Officer Sirrikis Ryktor and chat with him. You'll get 3 tasks that will be automatically put into your Task Window (Alt + Q).<br />
<br />
First Tasks<br />
<br />
Task: Blood of the Basilisk<br />
Zone: Tirranun's Delve<br />
Objective: Loot 5 Simmering Basilisk Bloods<br />
Walkthru: Invis to the center of the zone where there are 4 basilisks. Kill them. Loot the bloods. Win.<br />
<br />
Task: Clearing the Path<br />
Zone: Stillmoon Temple<br />
Objective: Kill 8 Stillmoon Drakes<br />
Walkthru: Only Stillmoon Drake mobs will complete this task. You can be grouped to complete it as well. Kill them. Win.<br />
<br />
Task: The Burning Poison<br />
Zone: Lavaspinner's Lair<br />
Objective: Loot 5 Caustic Lavaspinner Venoms<br />
Walkthru: Kill the Lavaspinner spiders and loot the venom. Win.<br />
<br />
Once you've completed those quests, go back and talk with Commander Zaerr Ty'Dal again. He'll give you a character flag and tell you to speak with Officer Vacax Rol`Tas and accept the mission.<br />
<br />
First Mission<br />
<br />
Task: Have Note Will Travel<br />
Zone: Tirranun's Delve<br />
Objective: Kill a number of goblins in the zone to spawn the named at the end of the zone. Kill the named and loot the piece. Then you need to kill 9 goblin guards on the way back to the zone in.<br />
Walkthru: I'd suggest a full group for this. Many of these goblins Complete Heal and Gate. They come in packs and at one point, we had 7 in camp. The named hits for 1k, but we had a monk tank it and 2 shamen keeping him up was over kill.<br />
<br />
Once you've completed that quest, talk with Commander Zaerr Ty'Dal and receive your new AA and character flag.<br />
<br />
Gift of the Dark Reign: Level 1<br />
Effect: Increase all stats by 10, Increase all stats max by 10.<br />
<br />
If Commander Zaerr Ty'Dal won't talk to you anymore after that, its because you need amiable faction to progress. So do a few missions with friends, I'd suggest the Animated Statue plans. Once you get to amiable faction, talk to the Commander again. He'll direct you to Officer Sirrikus Ryktor and he'll give you another 3 tasks to complete.<br />
<br />
Second Tasks<br />
<br />
Task: Army of Stone<br />
Zone: Stillmoon Temple<br />
Objective: Loot 5 Animated Guardian Essence<br />
Walkthru: The objective says it all. Kill the golem mobs and loot the items. Win.<br />
<br />
Task: Blood from Sand<br />
Zone: Stillmoon Temple<br />
Objective: Loot 7 Impure Goblin Blood<br />
Walkthru: Goblins are pretty plentiful in Stillmoon Temple. Kill them, look the bloods, and win.<br />
<br />
Task: Reap the Kirin Mind<br />
Zone: The Ascent<br />
Objective: Loot 3 Pristine Kirin Brains<br />
Walkthru: This task was a pain in the ass to do solo. I'd suggest invising and conning everything in the zone as you make your way up. You'll see a Kirin or two on the way. If you can kill them and find a brain, more power to you. I managed to solo my way to the top and I just killed the 2 static spawns there. Loot and win.<br />
<br />
Go back to the Commander and talk to him again. He'll send you over to Officer Vacax Rol`Tas who will send you on a mission.<br />
<br />
Second Mission<br />
<br />
Task: Drake Egg<br />
Zone: The Ascent<br />
Objective: Loot a Drake Egg and kill one 'a goblin guard'<br />
Walkthru: Get a splitter for this one. You can invis to the top to where you will see 2 'a drake', either one of those will drop the egg. Loot it. Invis back down *Do not succor*. You will see 2 golem guards, and 2 goblin guards, get those split, and kill one of the goblin guards. Port out since there isn't a zone out of that instance.<br />
<br />
That's as far as I've gotten. The next step I believe is the 24 person mini raid on Emoush the Destroyer. You can flag 6 people past this point if they've done everything up to this. Your Gift of the Dark Reign AA will increase to be...<br />
<br />
Gift of the Dark Reign: Level 2<br />
Effect: Increase all stats by 10, Increase all stats max by 10, Increase HP/Mana/End by 250</div></div><hr />
