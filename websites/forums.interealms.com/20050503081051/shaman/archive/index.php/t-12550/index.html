The Grey, according to the readers, is a place where a bunch of whining and fighting takes place; I state this, seeing as how nobody ever reads that forum, and based on what I've heard people say.  According to the mods, though, its a forum for off-topic discussions, nothing controversial.. however if this is the case, why is it waaaay down at the bottom where its not likely to be noticed?<br />
<br />
So in short, as you already probably knew, I feel the moderation is too strict here.<br />
<br />
edit: Another thing that insinuates that the grey is for posts that aren't wanted here (on top of it being the very bottom forum on the list) is that you can't link images in posts in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest, I like things getting moved to the correct forum.  Maybe some of the n00bs that come looking for an answer to a question posted in general might stumble over one of the FAQ stickies (with, curiously enough, the answer they want) in another forum while looking for their topic.<br />
<br />
The only time I've had some concerns are with some topics that go to the Grey.  I have more concerns, however, with all the bitching and whining that goes on whenever something does.<br />
<br />
I'd like 24 hrs on things that are EQ related, and not remotely shamanic.  Yes, this is stretching the boundary of the General forum, but arguably something that affects another class is something we should know, and thus appropriate for General.<br />
<br />
If it is not strictly EQ but pertaining to this board's members and culture in general, it should stay.  Sunmoon (or another shaman) getting engaged would certainly be appropriate for the General forum, as would be an &quot;I'm leaving&quot; topic. <br />
<br />
RL topics (crappy day at work), politics, etc, are appropriate for The Grey.  Give 'em half a day and move 'em.  There's nothing so bad or so frightening that we can't talk about it.  After it's had its initial exposure, folks can easily go back to the Grey to check up on it.<br />
<br />
Yes, folks can see that a topic exists and has been moved from the General forum, but they cannot see whether it's an active or dead topic.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, one of the most fun times I had on the board was when Henora and I were keeping a sick Glori amused (or was it Glori and I keeping a sick Henora motivated?) ... all in the General forum.<br />
<br />
Above all?  As Mojokyn has constantly requested:  Keep it civil.  I'd be willing to bet a lot less would get moved if folks had thicker skins and larger hearts.</div></div><hr />

Conspiring to annoy someone?  ***, when did I do that?!  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ash, he's talking about my puppy post and rellix's baby post :p  (check the Grey if you dunno what I'm talking about).  Remember how I told you I could make a post about how cute puppies are, and it would be found offensive and moved to the grey, and you called me a noob for thinking that?  Well Henora moved it to the Grey exactly two minutes after I posted it, and chastised me for not posting to the correct forums.  Rellix then made a post about how cute babies are (Mojo we didn't conspire, I didn't know he'd do that, although it was pretty funny :D), and that's where the talk of conspiring to annoy Officer Henora came into it ;)</div></div><hr />

This thread is appropriate for the general section since it is about the boards management but a thread on puppies or children isn't and should not have been made here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yes Schpleef - that is because you said in your post that you knew it didn't belong in general and that you had a bet with a friend on how long it would take to move a mod to move it to the grey.  You are posting simply to provoke a response from a moderator.  I am tired of playing these games.  If you don't like the way things are done here, go somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Our rules are simple and pretty lax.  In fact, our tolerance is far beyond what other boards display.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">enough already</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">On the forums and communities I use to run the rule for moderators was:<br />
<br />
&quot;Moderation in moderation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meaning don't be too heavy handed in editing/deleting posts that you (the moderator) may find offensive. It may not be, but it is just your perception. An over zealous or overly sensitive moderator can do more damage to a community than the posts they censor.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, those shouting &quot;freedom of speech damnit!&quot;...since when is a private forum a democracy? Go start you own (as someone already suggested).<br />
<br />
As far as mods moving posts to more apprpriate forums, I have no issue with that at all and kinda like it. Keeps the signal to noise ratio in the main forum at an acceptable level IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I also feel that they do a great job. I recently had a post sent to the &quot;Grey&quot;.

Good job Mods, and keep it up!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is the best policy.  I come to General to read the new posts virtually every day.  I go to the specific forums when I'm searching for something specific, normally once or twice a week.  I don't have the wont or time to read each specific forum every day, but it is nice to be able to read most all new posts on a daily basis in one spot...<br />

<br />

<br />
A lot of marginally appropriate topics get moved fairly quickly by Henora; that's where it can look inconsistant.  Her interpretation of what belongs is at times somewhat stricter than yours seems to.  I haven't seen her use bad judgement, she's just stricter and quicker.<br />
<br />
The puppy/baby posts had no business being in General. Those 2 were pretty asinine for doing that.  Myself, I would likely have edited them to something like &quot;Hello!  This post doesn't belong in General, and I'm tired of moving posts that people place just to troll.  Feel free to repost in the correct forum, somewhere in the Spirit Realm.  OKloveyabye,&quot; and locked the thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Oh -- and as to polls; every time somebody votes they get bumped back up the board.  I am NOT a fan of polls; if you need to see why, go to the Steel Warrior.  You'll find a bajillion polls there and half a bajillion posts saying &quot;please disable polls.&quot;<br />

Thanks, mods. keep it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Back in the day, we didn't have many thread moves.  Back in the day, we didn't have nearly as many 20-post-a-day-spamming-morons-turning-the-forum-to-crap-and-chasing-away-most-of-the-non-morons, either.  <br />
<br />
I would pay a _lot_ of money to watch Tudamorf or even Eduin go to work on the idiots that have taken over here with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.  <br />
<br />
If they banned, or at least let the community police via public ignore messages or whatever, the couple complete idiot spammers that have changed this place from the best eq class board into a damn ****house, you'd see the signal-to-noise ratio shoot back up, and you wouldn't need to move as many threads.<br />
<br />
Anyway, what I am saying is that thread-moving is a symptom, not the disease.  Henny, Sunmoon and Mojo rule.  If anything they need to be more strict.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Honestly, how many people actually care about posts being moved, and how many just like to use this topic when the week's complaint quota isn't met?<br />
<br />
The mods apparently feel it is important to keep general discussion on topic and it is their right to decide whatever they want to do. Personally, I think it is a lost cause.<br />
<br />
EQ is old. In fact, it's ancient by the standards of the gaming industry. Everything game-related has been mentioned many times over the years, and to the dismay of many, some are being regurgitated every month. The only new things left to talk about consist soley of the utter amazement of how SoE is able to consistantly top their own incompetence over the course of four years. Even that can be considered boardline off-topic.<br />
<br />
At least with the Grey, there is only one extra forum you have to check. If the Grey was split into many forums according to the degree of off-topic-ness, I do not even want to anticipate how many thread bearing the topic of &quot;omg! xxx post should have been moved to xxx forum, not the other one!&quot; will clogged the boards over the months to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">my only complaint with moderation is OT topics being moved to the grey.

Some people go there but most dont.  Personally I do but compare the people browsing the grey to people in general at any given time its usually something like 3 : 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I don't think it's too strict. And, yes...tired of the topic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I like the way the (don't flame me) eqdruids boards do polls - they have a polls forum, so that recently voted-upon polls getting bumped to the top is fine.<br />
<br />
Uggok are you talking to me?  If so please point me to my posts that have turned this board into a ****house - is it my replies to people with questions on equipment, or my help with quests?  It sounds like you're just one of the more vocal sheep around here.<br />
<br />
You're got roughly 1/3 of the people here saying that yes, moderation is too tight, and about 2/3 saying its fine.  Of those 2/3, many are just followers who would agree with however this board was moderated.  That should tell you something.<br />

The forums at www.vgnation.net are shaping up to be a great source of information backed by a good community of people who have greater concerns than policing others.  I would recommend everyone have a look over there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Overall the moderators do a wonderful job.  Yes they are human, and yes that means that sometimes mistakes are made.  It seems to me (just a perception) that a few more mistakes than normal were made in the last month or two in terms of overzealous moving of things to the Gray, but this has already been resolved to my satisfaction.  So add me to &quot;those 2/3 ... who would agree with however this board was moderated&quot; as long as it works, is fair to everyone, and doesn't REQUIRE me (though they can hold donation drives until they are blue in the face) to pay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I counted no where near 1/3 of the people saying that moderation was too tight.  I disagree with you not because I am a &quot;follower&quot;, but because I think you are wrong.  One of the things that I have seen here that will cause a mod to take action is when flame fests start, and they start when people throw out insulting comments like that &quot;just follower&quot; comment.</div></div><hr />

You're joking, right? There's a total of 20 threads in the Shaman section there, and most of the discussion is from the same handful of people. I don't think you could really call that board a viable alternative to The Crucible.<br />
<br />
The Shaman forums at EverQuest Realm are the closest thing to an active Shaman community I've found outside of here. A lot of Shaman migrated there after Mung went MIA, but most of them have came back since then.<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm a fairly new lurker to these forums, but, just based on scanning this post, maybe a suggestion to the owner/mods is have a rant/flame section. I'm from the Tunare server, and our server board has a specific flame section, where folks can go to bitch about stuff and get it off their chest. Maybe that could clean up &quot;The Grey&quot; to more appropriate type posts that are unrelated to Shaman stuff, but are not really flames/rants.<br />
<br />
A question about that forum tho. Why would posting images in &quot;The Grey&quot; be something the mods dont want?<br />
<br />
I see nothing wrong with how the mods run the board, I'm far too new to the boards to see anything other than a standard board. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">At least it keeps the Flamevault crowd quiet here. Alot of new people show up here, looking for answers and fins them instead of a buncha &quot;**** n00b I pwn j00 plz thx&quot; garbage. <br />
<br />
The moderation on what topics get moved around with is a bit too &quot;by the book&quot; but atr least I have peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">No one thought the puppies were &quot;offensive.&quot; Those posts didn't belong in the general forum of an EQ shaman board.<br />
<br />
Darn straight!  Now KITTENS... kittens are offensive. (http://www.dansdata.com/kitten.htm)</div></div><hr />

Let's show those felines who's boss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">It's moderated quite well.  If you believe it isn't, ask yourself why you weren't chosen as a moderator and they were.  Criticism is a two way street.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Not only do I think the moderation is strict, I think the mods have nothing to do bt 24/7 scan boards for the most insignificant infraction and move the post.... but I also think there should be a poll option<br />

There are plenty of zealous and hardworking mods at the Druid's Grove too, but they're pretty harsh with anything remotely off topic from whatever is listed in the fine print as being &quot;on topic.&quot;  <br />
Lemme give you another quote that sums up my feelings on this:<br />
<br />
&quot;The price of freedom is eternal vigilance&quot;<br />
<br />
You wanted the job.  You wanted to watch us post.  The watching goes both ways.  <br />
<br />
Proposed solution I have is when a post is moved, the moderator who moved it must include their sig/reason for moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Uggok are you talking to me?<br />
<br />
Considering that I have no idea who you are, I would have to say 'probably not.'  That was a solid flame though.  Bahhhh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Not only do I think the moderation is strict, I think the mods have nothing to do bt 24/7 scan boards for the most insignificant infraction and move the post.... but I also think there should be a poll option<br />

You can do polls, as you can see on the front page.  You just don't know how.<br />
<br />
And the threads that are OT get moved to OT, the attempted OT derailment, see above, are not unless that becomes the new focus of the topic.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you don't act like an @$$, the mods don't have to touch your posts.<br />
<br />
(The YOU wasn't specifically you Coraz)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">I visit the crucible about every day with my morning coffee.<br />
<br />
I don't see very many off-topic posts.  I don't visit the grey or any of the other off-topic forums because I don't care about anything from this board but the shaman information.<br />
<br />
Anything I post here has to do with shaman information only - my posts have never been greyed (that I've noticed).<br />
<br />
I think the moderation is 100% perfect (as far as I can tell), since my reasons for coming here are very specific, and the mods seem to be in perfect alignment with my goals when coming here.<br />
<br />
I've moderated boards myself.  It's thankless, you're damned by half the community when you actively moderated, damned by the other half when you stay more in the background.  I appreciate the work you folks do so that I don't have to wade through 25 posts of non-EQ-related crap every day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">This is just my opinion, but it seems that, for as long as this has been a hot topic......that &quot;The Grey&quot; would by now be a high traffic forum.../shrug. I know I look there often, where as before I did not...-just- because of this very thing. The mods dont delete posts or edit them usually.....and the Grey is only a click away :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Basically, if you don't act like an @$$, the mods don't have to touch your posts.<br />
Please read through the grey to find posts I've made and participated in, and quote where you felt I acted like an ass.  I'm reallly curious as to what I said that was &quot;acting like an ass&quot; that got my posts moved there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">That's another point I think people aren't seeing...we don't EDIT the posts in case of profanity.  we just move 'em.  even then its maybe 5% or LESS.  is that really enough to make us &quot;nazis?&quot;  I just don't see it.  oh well...this is the last i'm gonna say about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I am fairly new to these boards, But i like the way the moderators run it , I have been to someboards were it looks like 13year olds run the whole thing, and this board is a refreshment to visit/post at,<br />
<br />
Just my opinion on the subject and i think people in general should just get off of the mods butts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Honestly, what's so important about some unrelated topic that you absolutely must have it on the general board? It can't be because you care about that specific topic, because all of those topics were frivolous.<br />
<br />
Do not even attempt to insult everyone's intelligence by pretending you were demonstrating the &quot;censorship&quot; of the board by posting crap that mods have to move. Yes, you forced the mods to act, with the cunning and methods of an average three year old. Good for you. However, you must realize that it doesn't support your cause one bit.<br />
<br />
It really comes down to &quot;I want it my way, if I don't get it, I'm going to whine until I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
On this board, and every other board out there, the opinions of mods are more important than your opinion. The sooner you learn to deal with it, the sooner you can stop wasting everyone's time with your drivel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Boinshar, nice flame :)  You're trying to get this post moved to the Grey I see.  You could have done that by simply clicking the &quot;report post&quot; link instead of trying to turn it into a flame war.  I'm not taking the bait though :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Gurck, the posting about kitties and puppies and all that.  That's what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
It was purposely done in a way a mod would have to move it, then you can say, see the mods here are Nazi's blah blah blah.</div></div><hr />
