<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just completed getting a full set of Elysian armour for my druid and I thought that I would share my experiences, in the hopes that it may help someone else.  I am not claiming to be an expert at this, I am just relaying how I did it.  I probably go into a bit too much detail, but I was bored at work and it was fresh in my mind.<br />
<br />
Background information:<br />
I did this with my level 56 Shaman and level 53 Druid.  I waited for these levels so that I would have the 55 pet on the Shaman and the 53 DoT (Winged Death) from the Druid.  Since the pup and the druid do all the damage, I felt that this was important.  The druid had Elder Spiritist Vambraces (clicky Drones of Doom DoT) and the Shaman had JBB (clicky DD), but did not use it much since it broke root too much.  Either epic would have been a huge help, but I have neither.  Neither has outstanding equipment as I 2-box them mostly solo.  Shaman does have a horse and Iksar Chestplate, but these were not necessary.  The Shaman always had way more mana than the Druid.<br />
<br />
The camp spot:<br />
I camped in the same spot as all of the Druids do, the South East corner of the zone.  It is easy to find as there is almost always someone there.  Basically run through Maiden's Eye to Umbral Plains invis.  Turn right in Umbral, staying high on the zone wall and go past the zone to Vex Thall.  If you are invis all of the elementals at the VT zone, won't see you.  Just watchout for sometimes there are see-invis mobs in ME at the zone tunnel and sometimes there are wandering Dark Assasins in Umbral that are close enough to the wall to aggro.<br />
<br />
Preparation:<br />
Summoned and buffed pup with HoS, Shroud of Spirits.  I would also put on Celerity and Regrowth right before I went out to pull so that they were fresh.  Druid would put on Skin Like Nature and damage shield.  I also Alpha'd pet when I had the necessary materials.  I noticed a huge difference between an Alpha'd pup and one without.  Buffs don't really matter that much on the Shaman or Druid, as you shouldn't get hit very often, but since the Shaman always had tons of mana compared to the Druid, I would go all out with HoS, Shroud of Spirits, Riotous Health, Regen on both Shaman and Druid.  <br />
Depending on mana, some of these may slip, but I always seemed to have lots.  I would also have the Druid put Skin Like Nature on the Shaman for the extra regen to canni, if mana permitted.<br />
<br />
Pulling:<br />
There are 2 choices here:  pull with Druid or pull with Shaman.<br />
1.  Druid - She would invis and then run out along the zone wall to find an Elysian.  Since they are generally the only mob in the area that can see invis (Except some Dark Assasins and Fallen Soldiers; just stay away from them completely), you can pull with vicinity aggro.  Basically, inch closer until it aggros.<br />
<br />
2.  Shaman - He would not go invis, because of the pup.  Basically just go out and pull carefully.  You just have to watch out for all of the other types of mobs.  Sometimes that means an Elysian may have to walk away without you getting to pull it, but better safe than sorry as most things out there can hand you your butt pretty easily.<br />
<br />
No matter who pulls, it is easier with lev, but not necessary.  If you run along the zone wall heading away from the VT temple the vally opens up to a few flat areas.  There were lots of mobs wandering around this area.  I never had any aggro onto me if I was up on the zone wall.  There are some Elysians in the ruins that you can see, but I never bothered with them as I did not have any trouble finding a wandering one.  I have heard that it can be difficult getting singles out of the ruins and I just didn't want to bother with Harmony or anything like that.  Plus, the Shaman pulled for me.<br />
Make sure you only pull Disturbed Elysian Remains.  DO NO PULL THE CORRUPTED ELYSIANS.  They are level 58-59 druids that will kick your butt rather quickly without a decent group.<br />
<br />
I pulled with my Shaman simply because I run him on my main computer and run the Druid on my laptop.  The laptop is not the best and I get a lot of video lag and such.  Yes, I could have switched computers, but the Shaman is my main and I much prefer playing him and having a Druid bot rather than the other way around.<br />
<br />
I would pull with Malosi.  It helped for root durations and any possible resist problem.  I would then run the Elysian back to camp.  if I had the separation, I would slow and sometimes cripple him on the way back.  When I got back to camp I would root.  I used Paralyzing Earth.  It has a nice long duration and I never had a problem with mana anyway.  I would then slow and cripple, if I had not done so already.  Then send in the pup.  <br />
<br />
The fight:<br />
The druid is setup with hotkeys pretty good, so I would target the Shaman with F2 and hit my assist hotkey (2), then my snare earring hotkey (1), then my 3 DoT hotkeys (3 for Winged Death), (4 for clicky Drones of Doom) and (5 for Drifting Death), then sit down.  I did the spells in that order since it meant no waiting for spell refreshes.  The druid would simply stand and refresh DoTs, snare and damage shield as necessary.  <br />
<br />
The Shaman would keep the thing rooted and keep pup alive with Chloroblast.  Also REMEMBER TO RE-SLOW THE MOB.  I chose to do it at about 50%.  I forgot once and it wore off.  He went through the pup pretty quick when root broke at exactly the same time.  He went through the druid pretty quick too.<br />
<br />
The druid would usually have aggro if root broke.  Sometimes an alpha'd pup that was taunting a lot would be able to hold aggro, but more often than not the mob would head for the Druid if root broke.  Just re-root.  The druid might take a couple of hits in the 190 range, just run her away once the mob is rooted again.  If she has regen on, don't worry about it.<br />
<br />
I didn't time the fights, but I was usually done long before the druids that were there soloing.  The only problem was that it took my druid down to about 20% mana and it takes a long time to get that back.  At first I had KEI and it sped things up, but was too much of a pain to go back to the Nexus to get everytime it wore off.  It is easily doable without it.  You can also pickup another druid or two and stack DoTs.  It will go much quicker.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that is my take on helping your Druid twink or friends get some Elysian armour.  It really is good stuff and I should make a couple k selling off the crap that my Druid was wearing before.</div></div><hr />

I spent the whole night just casting Malosi/Root/Slow and that was it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heard some druids talk bout a safe valley in UP near the elysians that it was ok to bind in..........most of the time.<br />
<br />
Thinking bout getting more info on that, and binding my GF's druid there to get her some of that very nice gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Biggest tip i can give here from outfitting my druid alt in a full suit of Elysian armor, if its busy in the corner (druids are like flies) try and find a necro/shadowknight to pull from the camp for you. I was there all the time on my necro and never had to look for or wait for elysians. The camp is easily split by either class, monks as well but never tried. (and corrupted elysians aren't that bad)</div></div><hr />
