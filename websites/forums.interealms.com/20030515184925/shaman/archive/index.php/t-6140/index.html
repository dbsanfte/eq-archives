<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy,<br />
<br />
I was in BW a few days ago soloing.<br />
<br />
In the area I was in giants occassionly roam.  Giants can drop decent loot.  Being tired, I just went after a giant and ignored the possible threat of an add.<br />
<br />
Slowed the giant and let dogie go to town.   Things were looking great.<br />
<br />
Then I get an add.  A scornie hornet.  Still dark blue to me.  I got stunned from behind and before I was unstunned, I had lost about 400 hps.  A good kick in the sides, but not life threatening.  Turned to slow the silly insect.  Got stunned again and had my casting interupted twice.  (Loss another 300 hps in the process.)<br />
<br />
(Oh, AC for those curious was 950 and 1900hps)<br />
<br />
I got frutrated and just moved away from the dog/giant fight.  Hornet followed, but I got some distance becuase of SoW.  Nice thing about casting root is that you do not have to face the mob to cast it on it.  I spamed myself until the hornet was in range and rooted it.  Then I slowed it for good measure.  Ok cool.<br />
<br />
Head back to dog and giant.  Slowed giant + hasted dog = good fight.  Dog was winning no problems, but I started to JBB becuase I didnt know when root was going to break on the hornet.<br />
<br />
2 blasts of JBB then I get another visitor.  This time a dark blue moldering gorilla.  Hit me a few times for 116 (I think).  That adds up.  Again, I am stunned and have my casting interupted.   I pull the gorilla away like the hornet, but root wears off just as it lands (bad bad gorilla).<br />
<br />
I was able to slow the gorilla, and root it again.  I head back to dog/giant fight.<br />
<br />
Giant is almost dead.  Root breaks on the gorilla.  I turn to face the gorila but kept the giant targeted.  I let the gorilla get a swing on me and click on JBB to help finish the giant.  I did  this twice, then our favorite hornet comes over to play.<br />
<br />
(By now some of you may think that I should just run, which is wise, but I have to much pride as a shaman and feel that I must try to win.)<br />
<br />
The giant dies.  Pet goes to the gorilla and starts hitting.  Pet gets agro and I again pull the hornet away.  Root the hornet again.<br />
<br />
Have 1 bub of health by this point.  Cast chloroblast on myself 3 times.  Get back to a little over 4 bubs of health.  Have about 2 bubs of mana left so I let lose a BoN of the gorilla (they have some hps, and pet was not full health to being with, plus I wanted this said and done).<br />
<br />
Guess which spell breaks?  Hello Mr. Hornet.   :)<br />
<br />
As I prepare to spin and move away, I noticed two mobs standing close by.  Two sarnak extremists.  Extremists are shaman.   Getting one of these to add, may be my death, for they cast root and I do not have Annul magic memmed.<br />
<br />
Sow starts to wear off...<br />
<br />
I do not keep sow memmed, I have boots, and pet is non-agro.  (But who knows what would have happned had I not had the boots.)<br />
<br />
Re-freash sow instantly.  No worries here about interuptions from mobs.  ;)<br />
<br />
Hornet gets root parked again.  Head back to dog.<br />
<br />
Faithful animal has one bub of health left.  Two blasts of CB helps out some.  BoN wears off and gorilla is down to 2 bubs of health.  JBB it to death, err destruction.<br />
<br />
A sarnak extremists runs by... and keeps going.  <br />
<br />
By now I have less than a bub of mana, though I still have 3 bubs of health.  <br />
<br />
Pet goes after hornet now.  Let pet get some agro and then start to JBB away.   <br />
<br />
But these types of hornets can hit hard - and do.   I start to cann for a CB (using Cann 3).  Pet goes to about a third of a buble of life.  CB again.  Cann five times.  CB again.  Now pet has enough health that I can get an 8 second click off from JBB without an interuption. (I seem to get interupted a lot, might be becuase I do not buff dex or agility when soloing.  Will have to experiment.)<br />
<br />
If pet had died then, I had no mana for a root.  Yes, I could have saved all that mana from CB's for a root, but I am not sure if had had enough for a BoN.  And that is if no fizzles or spells bouncing off.  Also, I could have tried root and JBB alone,but JBB breaks root a lot for me.  I like having the pet up as added insurance.<br />
<br />
Hornet finally dies.  I have no further problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I was an idiot for doing what I did.  I should have pulled the giant back to the zone line in the first place to avoid adds.  The fact that I was able to do what I did was because of the use of those wonderful boots and that magnificent bracer.<br />
<br />
(Total loot from those guys was maybe 15pp.  *chuckles*)<br />
<br />
To those younger shaman who do not have their JBB or Sow boots yet.  Just remember that mana free items always have their place in a shamans inventory.  You never know when you may need them.  <br />
<br />
Toh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fun story :)<br />
<br />
Sow boots have saved my life multiple times, its pretty frustrating when you die cause sow faded, and a couple of adds come and join the fight.<br />
<br />
JBB/Epic are on their way, so the mana free damage part will be here sooner or later :)  I enjoyed reading that story, coming up with a way to win against hopeless odds for any other class is what being a shammy is all about!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actualy what i did in that zone was dance really well. i played through there in 3rd person . i would just sweep around and see whats coming and move the beast i was on accodringly.<br />
<br />
plus , if you fight around the giant fort its almost impossible to have a add , i think i have had 1 add the whole time i was there. it was a wurm and he literaly walked on me before he aggroed. out in other spots its another story. man that place has to be the best and most fun and lucrative zone for a leveling shaman with a JBB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For Toh, this is a pretty significant achievement.<br />
<br />
After all , this is the same shaman who I've seen chased to the zone by snow bunny adds many times in EW .  Must be the whole Tribunal /  Barbarian  thing  ;)  .<br />
<br />
How's it goin Toh   ?   hehehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tohlagos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, nice to see a friendly face Tweadle.  ;)<br />
<br />
Where is Azz?  We still have not gone to ToFS!  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">SoW boots are the single greatest item I own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah. I remember when I was hunting in a frontier mountains giant group. We got too many adds and we were all planning to run away. Well the warrior tells me at the last second that he didn't have sow. He's got two giants on him at that point. So I cast sow on him and we both start running. Before the fort gets out of site I see my sow icon blinking. DAMN. I stop and start recasting sow. Fizzled the first time, start casting again but got stunned from the giant. Ended up getting killed :( <br />
<br />
THAT was the day I planned on starting after my sow boots, and nothing like that ever happened again! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah cause if you had had your sow boots only the warrior would have died =D<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah cause if you had had your sow boots only the warrior would have died =D  <br />
<br />
