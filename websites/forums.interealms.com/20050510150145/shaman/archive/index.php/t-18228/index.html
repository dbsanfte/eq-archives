[QUOTE='Stareff2']<br />

<br />
Admittently no.<br />
<br />
You mentioned that you had &quot;boar&quot;- not sure if you mean talisman of the boar or endurance of the boar. I have the single target version (endurance of the boar) and not the group version (talisman of the boar).<br />
<br />
Tordail is a patron in my guild, if you are willing then please pass them to him. I have an apointment that I have to leave for just before 10PM est (i'm on pacific time) So i'll probably miss you, and won't be back on tonight until 10:30pm PST (1:30am est) or thereabouts. I can meet ya any time tomorrow though if its more convenient.<br />
<br />
I'll sync my magelo around 9PM EST tonight though so that its authentic.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help comrade-</div></div><hr />

Any time someone has &quot;Sullon&quot; or &quot;SZ&quot; in their username, there is a 90% chance that what they are about to say is a complete waste of bandwidth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">90%? Thats a little unreasonable. Id say 89%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">lol settle down<br />
you guys are too easy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Junkilo, Im I missed your tells last night, I was also a little hesitant of your being 62 and not having thpose spells already lol. I judged you by your magelo and Im sorry. I just want to make sure that who I give these spells to, can really use them. I dont want to give them to someone who  is just going to sell them in the bazaar. I could do that and pocket the  3-4k.<br />
<br />
This being said, I apologize that I missed your tell, and if you DO NOT in fact have these spells, they are yours. After hearing form your guildy, it assures me you have integrity and Im sorry I judged you. Just  alot of people that only think selfishly on our server, and sorry I misjudged you. I will be on tonight. Yes it is Talisman of Boar BTW.<br />
<br />
Later,</div></div><hr />
