<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I keep getting notifications through email that there are new posts under threads I have posted on, but when I come to look there is nothing new.<br />
<br />
This is happening multiple times on the same threads.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else having this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Perhaps the MOD will be able to help you out. Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It happens due to the &quot;thread rot&quot; problem we're having. Folks are *trying* to post to the threads you get notifications for (that's why you get the notification) but the server has some problem actually storing the new posts, which is why you don't see anything new.</div></div><hr />
