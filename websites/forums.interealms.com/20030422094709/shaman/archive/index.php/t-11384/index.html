<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SamTheMan67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ATM I have a JBB and no money.. I'm almost 56 , but the jbb isn't all it cracked up to be so I'm thinking of selling for 20k buying barbed draggy boots and upgrading another slot..............<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Should I?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
<br />
It is a tough choice.  At 56, I recall I still used the JBB alot.  At 61 I don't, but it is nice knowing I can still use it.<br />
<br />
Before eyeing up BUYING upgrades, look around the bazaar and some of your fellow shaman Magelo profiles.<br />
<br />
There are some decent pieces out there that are EASY to acquire with a single group and they won't cost you a thing.<br />
<br />
If you post your Magelo (or even a text gear listing), I'd be happy to give you some advice on cheap upgrades.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmm, my advice is to get Velious quested armor.<br />
<br />
Seriously, even the easiest / worst Velious quest armor is very good. Runecrafter's (the Thurgadin faction quests) would look real nice in Chest, Arms, hands, legs &amp; boots. And frankly, it is not that hard to get. All you need is a level 59+ tank, a competent cleric, a slower (that would be you) and an evac (drood or wizzy). You can camp the Arena pretty much untroubled these days - not many people go there any more. And the thing about doing the Arena with a small tight group is that there is almost no competition for the drops. I actually have cleared the arena with 60 warrior, 58 cleric and me (56 shaman at the time) - the warrior and cleric split the plate, I got all the chain (see my Magelo), and we split the leather and silk for multi-questing.  <br />
<br />
By getting your Runecrafter's armor, you will (a) improve your gear a lot, and (b) be able to sell the existing armor in those slots to buy upgrades for other slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DON'T sell your JBB. True post 60 you wont use it much cause you group alot, BUT till lvl 60 if you solo you will use it alot. Also you WILL get bored of grouping post 60 and will solo from time to time. If you ever want to camp any item its indispensible imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SamTheMan67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've been in the arena for 20 hours in kael. I got a thurg bracer in the bank to show for it =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sarlen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you dont mind the faction hits you can solo or get one or 2 others up in PoG and make some mad cash and get armor drops that are equivelent to the thurg armor. On a full pop 2 boxing with a 61 shaman and 63 monk I can clear every wandering mob west of the river, making around 12 to 15k and get 4 or 5 armor drops in 7 to 8 hours. Do this 4 or 5 times you will have several armor pieces and a ton of cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sam, only certain mobs drop armor - from memory, Veterans are the best bet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>SamTheMan67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I know... we cleared the whole arena for at least 7 hours straight one night and a chain bracer droped =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SamTheMan67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How many people do i need to take to successfully hunt in POG?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sarlen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Depends on what you call sucessful. I call 10 to 15k and a hand full of armor sucessfull and I do it with just my 61 shaman and 63 monk. If you want faster results (2 to 3 hrs) take a full group with a plate class and a cleric and you can own most mobs here even ones that drop BP's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sam,<br />
<br />
I think you were unlucky - sure the drop rates are not great but i have a full set. Yes, i spent a while there, but the exp is good, so stick at it - i think it is worth it</div></div><hr />
