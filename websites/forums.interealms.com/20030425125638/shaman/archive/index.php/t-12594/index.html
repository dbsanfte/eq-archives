Can anyone tell me if they know or have had any luck in obtaining the quest item &quot;Slate Chant Rock&quot; from goblin rockchanters.<br />
<br />
The walkthrough states you obtain it from the rockchanters in Mines of Nurga, however I have spent many hours in there and never seen one.<br />
Although I did find the rockchanters in Temple of Droga and Frontier Mountains but after killing so many I have lost count, not one has dropped the &quot;Slate Chant Rock&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyone else had any luck, ( pref on Bristlebane ) or is this quest item currently broken?<br />
<br />
Regards, Ridgey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's the deal with the chant rocks.  I spent so much time on those quests (and finally got my 8th /cheer) that I know them like the back of my hand... errr claw.  A while back they revamped Nurga a bit.  That's where the piece actually drops, Nurga (not Droga or FM).  They took out the rockchanter spawns so no chant rocks were dropping for a while (they had to do this right when I needed the drop).  Eventually they replaced them with stonechanters who now drop the chant rocks.  On a side note, the drop will be called A Chant Rock and will be slate in color.  They can also drop items with the same name but a different color (I.E. blue, etc.)  The correct rock is tan and will look like a sharpening stone if you have ever done a little smithing.  Happy hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ridgey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kiisekai, thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
I've killed a fair number of these but not as many as the rockchanters in Temple of Droga.<br />
Hopefully as you say the Stonechanters will now drop the &quot;Slate Chant Rock&quot; in Nurga.<br />
<br />
This is one of those camps you like to do when you actually get experience... I shouldn't have put it off  :) <br />
<br />
Kind Regards, Ridgey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ridgey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After spending hours in Nurga killing Stonechanters I can confirm the drop for the &quot;slate chant rock&quot; is bugged and not dropping  :( <br />
<br />
Regards, Ridgey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shantan Maverick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got my rock 2 nights ago off the first stonechanter I saw.<br />
<br />
Since then I killed probably 10 more stonechanters while looking for Overseer Dlubish and only got blue and green rocks.  <br />
<br />
BTW it's not actually called 'slate chant rock', can't remember the exact name now but it's the only one dropped by rockchanters that looks like a sharpening stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">By the way, when they revamped Nurga they took out the overseer spawn as well.  He is now a random spawn in Droga I believe... not sure but he may spawn in Nurga too, /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Elenrak-FS-Rathe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did this camp back in January of this year.  Killed 3 chanters in Nurga over near the sleeping ogre (aka the monk epic guy) and got 3 rocks.  1 blue and 2 tan.  They aren't specifically called Slate Chant Rocks, but the item icon is a tan, egg shaped rock.  And Overseer Dlubish IS a random spawn ANYWHERE in Droga.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im on bristlebane server, got mine two months ago tops. Is indeed a tan sharpening stone looking thing called A Chant Rock. Gluck ridgey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ridgey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thankyou all,<br />
<br />
Yes, the item is indeed dropping.  :p <br />
<br />
An egg shaped &quot;chant rock&quot; that to me looked more white'ish green than tan but being colour blind in real life prolly doesn't help  :) <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The one thing I noticed, there are certain spots where the correct (tan) rock seems to be incredibly rare.  I spent a lot of time at the (old) Overseer spawn, and never got on there in hours of killing everything around.  Eventually I figured to try a different spot, so I jumped down the waterfall at the entrance, and cleared the first room there and up the tracks.  Got one in under an hour.  They've changed a lot of things since then, so it's hard to tell for sure, but that's not a bad spot to start looking for them.</div></div><hr />
