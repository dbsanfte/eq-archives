<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is the number of hit points per stamina a constant rate, or is it like wis/mana and has a point of diminishing returns? I ask because I'm at 240 stamina unbuffed, and my stats cap at 280, so I'm wondering if it would be worth using some aa's in Planar Power so I can get the extra 20 stamina and hit points. My magelo is up to date as far as what aa's i have now. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">diminishing returns, when I got my vindi bp it was just under 150hp, now its more like 120ish <br />
<br />
got it at about 55, at 65 I can max sta at 280 pretty easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For a shaman anything over 255 stamina is about 1 hitpoint per stamina point.  As far as is it worth it to spend AA to get the cap to 305?  Eventually yes but I didn't buy my planar power until I had about 170 AA and probably would have waited until after 200 had GoD AA's been out.</div></div><hr />
