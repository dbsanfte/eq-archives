<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i dinegd 41 before the fight so it was 41vs46 monk. Okay, we fought in the arena in bazaar(laggy but closest one). Didn't start well as some high level ranger was trying to beat down my pet just b4 we started, almost killed my pet but not quite. Anyway he promsied to leave us alone and we started fight. My pet was fully buffed (t`narg, haste, chloro etc). I started with root which held then slapped on blind and slow followed my maslisment (resisted DoT's) Then i hit him with VoS and scourge reapplying VoS as need aswell as root and blind while my pet nipped on his heels. Anyway, i killed him with full HP in the end on me and pet and 40m. Shamans rule!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Does he have any resist gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lol... obviously not if 5 levels higher and he got owned as hard as tel says, but either way... nice job :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stelmach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Melee are totally gimp in EQ. Unless he was uber equipped with resist gear, and Malo and Annul Magic on him should take care of any self buffing he did, you should never lose or even get close to losing to a pure melee. I mean, wizards quad mobs that would kill a well equipped melee in 20 seconds. Druids solo mobs that make melees cry. Monks class defining skill FD is useless PvP and they can be torn apart like wet paper bags now. Hell, a high level pet buffed could solo a monk, all you have to do is watch the show. So grats on the win, but be much much more embarassed if you ever lose to a pure melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't stand a chance agianst one of my pure melee guildmates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My melee guildmates scare me. <br />
My hybrid guildmates frighten me more.<br />
<br />
Amazing what some gear and a lot of resists will do for PvP competition.  I couldn't land **** on them if my life depended on it.  And it probably would.  How you beat a warrior with fast weapons, self haste to 65%, 200+ in each resist, 6.5k hps unbuffed, lots of AA skills, and weapons that proc everything from slow to snare to blind?<br />
Oh, and if that's not enuf, let's say they had enuf foresight to buy a few chunks of pumice. <br />
<br />
what the f*** ever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No joke, end game melee/hybrid are by far the hardest classes to beat 1 on 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just kite them with pet nipping on them and if they turn on your pet heal it and pray they turn back to you.  <br />
<br />
When I was level 60 I kited a level 65 warrior for over 30 minutes to bring him down to 1 bub of health. He could have won at any time by turning to pet and killing it, but I guess he took pitty on me. I couldn't land jack **** on him (and probably still can't even with malos). Pallies with crusader's touch are always great fun to fight :rolleyes: as are SK's with AA and disc that HT for 3k+ on me. <br />
<br />
Of course non-uber, non-hybrids are great fun to fight. If dots stick 1 in 5 or velium strike hits for more than 23 it's not that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EQ is not a balanced PvP game.  Don't fool yourself into believing that it is.  At end game, there are definite power classes.  SK is probably the most powerful of these, followed by necro.  Or possibly swap the two.  Of course, that doesn't mean an end game necro can beat an end game shaman.  End game shamans are the most difficult casters to kill with another caster.  <br />
So basically we rock the casters.<br />
And we get pwned to the melees.  <br />
<br />
Funny thing is, that used to be switched around.  Resists make SO much difference it's not funny.  People in end game gear have over 250 in each resist.</div></div><hr />
