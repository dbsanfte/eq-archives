<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, I was just wondering what is the earliest anyone has gotten their epic.  I've had some people tell me it can't be even started until level 51 (mainly druids and warriors), all though I have started mine.  Just curious.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can start the shaman epic any time you like.<br />
<br />
If you do the quest properly (no faction cheats, no multiquesting) then the earliest you can get the Spear of Fate is level 46, as you need to loot an item from Plane of Fear.<br />
<br />
I'm sure someone somewhere has made a shaman twink-bot with a multiquested epic at about level 5 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, I'm pretty sure it's not possible to get the epic before 50. At least not now. I helped a level 48 friend with his epic and after looting Rak, we ran off the spirit. The spirit refused to give him the epic. It responded to hails, but when you did the hand-in the spirit simply gave it back. He tried again at 51 and received the Spear of Fate. We thought it was a bug, but many other folks told us that 50+ was required.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can anyone please confirm this.  I'm lvl 50 and have everything in the bank up to and including the 3 books of Ghiosk.  Should I wait a few more levels before turning these items in?  Will some of you tell me what level you were when you completed epic please.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">48 shaman posted that he has it.  I got mine at 51.  I've seen a 20something with it... which made me absolutely SICK for about 5 seconds.  Funny thing is, I don't think I've seen that shaman since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I read this post the night of the raid, and was a little concerned.  But unless someone says &quot;I tried it and I couldn't&quot;, I tend to weigh the information with a &quot;Jaundiced&quot; eye.</div></div><hr />
