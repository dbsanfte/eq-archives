<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, no clue who this poster is, but the kid came up with 2 very nice ideas that I haven't seen anyone here toss out yet.   Post count is low enough he could be new to using web boards, or he might be a quiet troll type, who knows.<br />
<br />
Spell Ideas from EQ Live post (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=608) <br />
<br />
  The basic summary of what all he brought up so far (fair chance he thinks of some more later, or others follow suit), is a reverse Malos and a /disc haste.<br />
<br />
  The reverse malos idea is that we get a buff which adds a resist modifier to all spell cast by that player.   If the modifier was set at the same level as malos that would mean that you can have an approach to malo which matches the idea of dogdog = DoT.  It lasts from mob to mob!  This would mean that we can save a LOT of time on casting Malos and get straight to casting slows.   It would also mean that our spells WOULD have resist modifiers on them (and our Nihil/endgame roots would have LARGER mods)... as long as we remember to buff ourselves.<br />
<br />
  The other notable idea was a spell that lowers the re-use timer on melee disciplines.  My take on this is that since we suck at healing HEALTH, why not let us heal END and also toss in a haste spell that makes END running out an actual concern.   This would not only give us a new role, but would also return us to the fabled ULTIMATE MELEE BUFFER status.  It'd be the VoQ/KEI of the melee world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The idea to buff casters so they had a resist mod for their spells isn't new. The idea to combine Shaman spells(debuff + DoT or Slow + debuff), since time is the biggest enemy of our class, is excellent, though.<br />
<br />
Too bad no one will listen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So combining re-malos and malos you'd put spells at a -110 resist mod? <br />
<br />
While I would love such an ability, I somehow sense SOE being very reluctant to introduce it. Just imagine how shaman would be able to solo alot more 3 expansion old content with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My only concern is if the reverse malos buff was made self only.  This would remove the chance of other classes to land spells in raid situations.  As long as the shaman could cast it on another character then it should be a kick ass idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd rather not have more buffs... unless they changed the ones we already have and use.  I already feel like a live buff bot as is, at times, and there are better things to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We have too many buffs as it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While its a nice idea I suspect that they wouldn't implement something like that for balance reasons. Resists are put on mobs to increase their difficulty, providing a uniform means to short circuit that would defeat the purpose of them having resists in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">While its a nice idea I suspect that they wouldn't implement something like that for balance reasons.

<br />
As it is, the only caster getting resisted is the Shaman, unless a mob is intentionally made immune to a certain realm. Ask a necro how many resists he gets on raids when he uses his DoTs.<br />
<br />
Shaman need a self only resist mod, be it through an AA, a self buff or a resist adjust for their DoTs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Resists are put on mobs to increase their difficulty, providing a uniform means to short circuit that would defeat the purpose of them having resists in the first place. <br />
<br />
Only to increase the difficulty for shaman?  Other classes have resist mods built right into their spells.  <br />
Malos = -55<br />
Malosinia= -70<br />
<br />
Couple examples:<br />
Swarming Death (dru) resist adjust=-100<br />
Sylvan Embers (dru) resist adjust =-50<br />
Blood of Thule (nec) resist adjust =-50<br />
Night Fire (nec) resist adjust =-100<br />
<br />
What spell for shaman has this?  If a shaman can land a spell on a mob with malosinia on, it means that these other classes could land it without malosinia.  And on the higher resistant mobs during raids these other spells enjoy a resist mod of -170 in some cases.<br />
<br />
All I am saying is that the precedence is there for resists to be lower in some situations, so dismissing the idea out of hand and citing that it would completely defeat the purpose of having resists is short sighted and somewhat unreasonable.</div></div><hr />
