<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Shammies-<br />
<br />
42 Shaman here.<br />
<br />
I'm fortunate enough to have both of these fairly nice weapons.  When using the REIF I also equip a crystal chitin shield.  I also use the sc hand wraps for haste with either and have the 39 quick spell up at all times.<br />
<br />
Magelo=  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=494623<br />
<br />
I've gotten both skills roughly the same- 168ish.  I solo 95% of the time due to RL time constraints.<br />
<br />
I can't decide which I like better, the BSH has a great proc, but forces me to load up deftness.  I hate waiting for a 43 delay to see &quot;you crush a MOB for 2 dmg&quot;. Or the MOB ripostes, dodges, etc. The real power seems to only be in the procs. If it procs X3 you rule, if it procs X0 its a long, long fight.<br />
<br />
The REIF with haste X2 is scary, my arm never stops moving but I hit for squat and the procs are only soso. I'm a living DoT.  Fights seems longer than average with BSH.<br />
<br />
Wis is about the same with both, but I pick up 70 mana with REIF and shield.<br />
<br />
As I level up, which will be more useful?  Or is this a pointless post? :p <br />
<br />
Thanks all.<br />
<br />
Edit:  AC really dosen't seem to be a factor for me, at least at this level.  Since I'm approaching JBB time, should I sell one or the other to fund that bad boy?<br />

Some times I think I'm indecisive; other times I'm not so sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Whenever I try to figure out which weapon is better damage wise than the other one I first look at the damage/delay over the proc. You can't depend on the proc, its always a maybe when it comes into contributing to the damage. Even when it does proc it may get resisted, or only land for partial. Unless of course the proc is some ungodly damage or effect in which case I would choose proc over damage/delay.<br />
<br />
So looking at the damage/delay of your two weapons:<br />
<br />
Rune Etched Icewurm Fang: 12/19 1.583 ratio<br />
Barbarian Spiritist Hammer 22/43 1.954 ratio<br />
<br />
So looking at the damage/delay the Rune Etched Icewurm Fang would be better. I would probably use that instead if I was in your shoes. Besides the damage delay, it is also a one hander, so you don't have to give up your shield. If you look at the proc for damage the REIF is less damage, but weapon is a lot faster so you will be hitting more often and have more chances for it to proc.<br />
<br />
This is just my opinion though.<br />
<br />
PS. Once you get your epic and a jbb you will likely put both weapons away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I also have both the REIF and Barbarian Spiritish hammer.  If I want a quicker fight, I use the hammer.  I really only use the Fang when I lvl and want to keep piercing maxed.  As your buffs and gear get better your dex goes up and the number of times proc goes off increases dramatically.  Switching out gear I can get my dex almost maxed with buffs(251).  I still load up alacrity, and have an RBB to speed up the nasty delay on the hammer.  Which all this gives me more swings, but more chances to proc too. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought that the delay of the weapon and the proc rate of the weapon were entirely independent of one another.  IE, swinging faster has no bearing on proc rate.  Saw a long post about it on the Safehouse I'll try to link it here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They are independent.  Let me rephrase my comment.  The more swings I get in, the more chances I have for the weapon to proc during the fight.  If I swing 10 times I might proc once.  If I swing 150 times maybe I'll proc 15.  The more swings the more procs, and the more damage.  Yes with the same haste on REIF you'll swing twice as many times, but the procs on the hammer make up for it.  263dd for hammer vs 81dd for fang.  Like I've said I use both, and hammer + procs way out damages fang + procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, from what I've read procs are a function of time, not number of swings.  You'll get the same chance to proc over say a 60 second period no matter how many times you swing.<br />
<br />
I've got both a REIF and a BSH and it does seem like overall they'll proc at the same rate (proc chance per second) whether I'm slowed, hasted, or swinging normal.  I have no doubt that DEX does impact the proc rate, but the delay on the weapon or a haste buff doesn't seem to have any impact on how many times you'll actually get the weapon to proc.<br />
<br />
I love my BSH and pull it out every once in awhile just to keep my 2HB skill up, but the REIF is my weapon of choice due to the superior dmg/delay ratio (better than our epic, btw).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just so I will be clear on the subject, when do each of these proc?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I *think* BSH is at lvl30 and REIF at lvl36.  May have to check allakhazam for confirmation though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I also have both, had the hammer since about 36, and picked up the REIF at 46 to work piercing skill up after 2hb was maxed. <br />
<br />
You said that you were working your way toward a JBB in your earlier post. With that in mind, if you need to sell one to fund the JBB, sell the REIF. When you're using the JBB, once you ckick it you stop swinging/stabbing for the duration of the cast. Then once the bracer goes off, you immediately swing again. So if you will be chain casting the JBB, the low delay of the REIF and all the haste you have on will be wasted, so you could actually sell your SCHW as well and get some Coldain Skin or other gloves to wear and have a little plat left over if you're lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with Abividad. If you are going to sell one for a JBB then your playing style with change and the BSS would be a better weapon to be swinging in between the JBB casts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks all.  I should get 9-11k for cc shield, sc hand wraps and REIF on Torvan, which will really help the JBB fund.<br />
<br />
Guess Ill keep the hammer out more.<br />
<br />
Lars</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Since you have a jbb, my answer would be keep the 2hb as well, especially if the proc rate is independent of the delay on the weapon.  I will say that the lifetap effect on Boon of the Garou combined with REIF helps give you some hp to cannibalize after fights... Not sure if proc rates on Boon would also be independent of weapon delay?  Either way, you won't be doing much tanking once you hit 45 with jbb... and the Boon spell is a lvl 44 enchanter spell so you wont' be using that anyways.</div></div><hr />
