Gather all the dwarfs, and mutts that you can handle, and either AoE them, or beat them down all at once. Depending on levels this is a fast way to get faction from killing, and heads for turning in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you know anyone who kills the BIG Coldain or Dragon mobs, ask them to allow you to come on a raid, promising you wont loot or aggro or do anything but get a faction hit.<br />
<br />
Then plink an arrow into said Uber mob to get on the list, most of those faction hits are Two or three con levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidan</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just tag along for Dain hits, or hunt the royal guards in icewell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lythe Featherblade</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do decide to hunt in GD, just check if anyone else is hunting dwarves/wolves as well. Even if they don't group, shoot a single arrow at any of the mobs they're killing and you'll still get the full faction hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yzen Danek</div><div class="date">05-11-2002, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Zek hit from actually killing Coldain is very small compared to the Rif hit. The best ways to raise Zek faction are: ToV raids, Western Wastes raids, soloing Sentries in Skyshrine, and turning in Coldain heads to Captain Bvellos. While killing Coldain is certainly a good way to acquire the heads, it's not the only way, the heads can be acquiring from bodyguards with no Coldain hit, and can also be bought.<br />
<br />
I went from KoS to Zek back to ally, despite our Statue/Vindi raid in the middle (I /q out for the statue hit) in two days by fighting in west ToV for an evening, then soloing Skyshrine for a few hours, then turning in about 40 coldain heads, most of which I bought from people for 50-100pp each, acquiring the rest killing bodyguards for exp in EW. Overall, I spent about 2k, but did it very quickly so I could make my last armor turn-in and go back to killing giants again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danko of the Tundra</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go to Upper skyshrine, up the stairs, past Sentry Rotiart.  Hunt with 6 ppl and roam towards Yelinaks lair.  By the time you get too the Skysrhine quest mobs, all the while safari style hunting, you will gain at least one con level, if not two.  Upper skyshrine is huge +Zek.  <br />
<br />
In 6 hours of Upper Safari-shrine, I went from max KOS too Amiable Zek.</div></div><hr />
