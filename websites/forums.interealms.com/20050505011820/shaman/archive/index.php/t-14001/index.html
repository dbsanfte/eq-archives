This looks like its improved damage per tick for dots. Notice how it says: <br />
Limit: Min Duration(6.00 sec)?<br />
<br />
Have to admit it got a rather funny name though :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Noticed that last night myself.  Guess with the changes they made to DoTs such that you see the damage per tick, they did something that let them boost that damage per tick as well.<br />
<br />
VERY much needed focus item for DoTs, of course ti will only be on items found dropping in PoTime. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have been hoping they would do this for quite a while now.  It will be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hope they put this focus or others like it on items found in lower tier planes.  I won't be in plane of time for a while, but I want this NOW!!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If this effect indeed becomes accesssible to players, then I hope it will include a whole range of similar effects. Preferably with different level reqs, different % boosts and specializations, ie general midrange % boost, poison specific highrange % boost etc. <br />
<br />
I don't see any reason why these items couldn't go as high as, say 100% additional damage on the very high end specialized items. Unlike dd's, dots are still limited by the fact that they do not stack with themselves. Even if dot dmg boosting effects such as this one would crank dot dmg up to 150% bonus the very nature of dots would still be severely limiting and keep the whole system in balance.</div></div><hr />

There's still some faith left in me, and it tells me that Sony will not choose this way to balance DoTs, but is rather working on an AA that works pretty much like this Focus Effect currently on test. <br />
Well, if i am wrong, hopefully they will realize how bad of a call it is to introduce items with the intention to fix broken game mechanics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, that would be insane.  Ridiculous.  Asinine.<br />
<br />
And exactly like the Warrior - Enraging Blow situation.  With the exception that DoTs aren't in nearly as sorry a position as Warriors.<br />
<br />
Probably lots of other examples of how this most likely is exactly what they consider to be a solution to the problem.</div></div><hr />

What do you mean by dots not stacking with themselves?<br />
<br />
The same DoT cast by different Shaman will stack with each other. This change was put in long ago.</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping there is sarcasm in there, somewhere. I really do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aruman, I meant there is a difference between wizard01 repeatedly spamming sunstrike on a mob and shaman01 repeatedly spamming bane of nife on the same mob.<br />
<br />
If you have more than one shaman casting the dots its a whole new ballpark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">LaughingWoman, when i wrote my post, i actually had the same thought coming up about the Enraging Blow situation. However, i only agree to an extent with it being the same issue. <br />
1) Warriors are by design the best tanks and the best class in REGAINING aggro, nowhere does that imply they are supposed to be the best at HOLDING aggro<br />
2) Enraging Blow is nice, but it isn't NEEDED in raid situations. However, having a EB weapon makes things easier.(No one of us used to have EB weapons for the AoW. Yet the first guilds downing him were doing tank transitions before AE taunt was implemented even<br />
3) DoTs weren't &quot;broken&quot; since day one. The ability to HOLD aggro(for Warriors) has been broken for as long as EQ exists, thus actually making it hard to call it &quot;broken&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/comfort warriors<br />
<br />
AA that let us do more with DoTs would be good.  Wholly more appropriate for us (and equally so for necros) than spell casting fury.  I would hope they're not Planar AA, this would be even more useful for the shaman taking his time from 51-60 than the shaman just flat-out xping hardcore.</div></div><hr />

So if I read and understand your posts correctly. You want to cast BoN on a mob 5 times back to back and have all 5 stick? Your compairing DoT's to DD's that like compairing apples to oranges. There is only two usefullness I could see for this off hand. One would be to quickly drop one mob. The second to hold aggro. But eather way I cant think of a situation where I would want to do this..</div></div><hr />

Strike of Solusek: Decrease Hitpoints by 2740 <br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn: Decrease Hitpoints by 320 per tick (*7 ticks = 2240 Total Damage)<br />
<br />
I dont why the idea of stacking these dots is so silly myself.  It still take 7 ticks to do the damage, and the total damage is still less than that of an 8 second nuke (by a long shot), not even taking into consideration critical hits and aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
30% more dmg on Blood of Saryrn does a wooping 416 dmg / tick for a max dmg of 2912 in 42 sec + 5.7 sec cast =&gt; 61 DPS<br />
Velium strike 925 dmg in 7.8 sec cast =&gt; 118 DPS Without any focus<br />
<br />
In Xp group this DoT will never do more than half of the max dmg because the mob will die too fast and because I have better things to do like slow and stuff before getting insane aggro.<br />
In Raid, DoT aggro is fuxoring positioning so much that I don't know many high end shaman that have the balls to DoT anything in Elemental planes in raid. <br />
So, lemme think... hmmm.. nope, DoTs will still be on page 35.<br />
<br />
Either in XP group or in Raid situation, DoTs are worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Giac, I think the Wurmslayer was introduced for that reason.  People forget how dramatic that weapon was for a period of time.  <br />

<br />

<br />
The wurmslayer itself was broken when it was introduced. This was fixed later, though.<br />
<br />
Focus items were never introduced to &quot;balance&quot; spells. <br />
The whole dicussion rose, because no matter what mobs a caster killed, he would never outperform another caster, who played EQ more casually, while a melee killing harder mobs would gain a noticeable DPS increase from doing so. <br />
The spells itself were NOT considered broken. Focus effects were merely added to reward casters in the same way melees were getting rewarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As everyone has mentioned, take a gander at any weapon with an aggro proc.  Also, when they released focus items, they listed several reasons, one of which was the &quot;meaningful loot&quot; issue you mentioned, but they also said that melees had become too powerful relative to casters since Kunark.  Finally, when they nerfed/fixed affliction focii to only work for damage over time spells, they explicitly said that the reason that affliction focii were more powerful than other focii was because they thought DoT spells were underpowered.  <br />
<br />
So, it is certainly not beneath them to balance via items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Focus items were never introduced to &quot;balance&quot; spells. <br />

<br />
Actually both... they were also introduced throughout the lower levels to provide a way for casters to have an improvement similiar to what melees have been getting throughout the expansions.  Now it is debatable whether they balanced enough or not but it does provide a sliding scale for uber to non uber as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either in XP group or in Raid situation, DoTs are worthless.<br />
<br />
I use DoT's all the time in Elemental Planes, for XP and in raids. You just have to be a bit careful but it's not hard to do. It's common sense: let the MT get solid aggro before using DoT's.<br />
<br />
For me this means waiting until the mob is between 90-95% health before starting to apply DoTs and reapplying as they wear off if needed.<br />
<br />
The problem with DoT's comes if the MT gets unlucky and dies, or they have other problems such as an AE effect not being cured.<br />
<br />
Do I care if the mob dies before the DoT wears off? No, because DPS is DPS no matter how you look at it. DoT's are far from worthless, but I think they could be improved upon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">not a very smart shaman now are ya...? <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm not... But at least I have enugh commen sines to not dump all of my mana into 1 mob. Which is exsacly what chain casting one dot on a mob would do. Mana wise it is the same has chain nukeing. And even if you can go from oom to fom in under 3 minits, down time is still down time. And personaly I dont see where being able to stick the same dot on a mob mutipal times from the same shammy would help you. Other then getting one mob dead just a little faster. But with the down time after did you really gain anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It's no different than casting 3 or 4 different dots on the same mob (which is what you're gonna be doing when you solo).  In fact stacking the same dot over and over might improve your mana usage, depending on the dot you choose to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>uklugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Maybe I'm not... But at least I have enugh commen sines to not dump all of my mana into 1 mob.

<br />
The difference would be that i could use only my most powerful dot when soloing instead of having to swap in 4 like i do now. It would be more mana efficient and faster soloing. Same applies for any situation where you are using multiple dots on mobbs. I would have thought this to be obvious to anyone who uses dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">now when will they add in the AA ability to gain more spell slots?<br />
<br />
btw, yes, they would do something really dumb like makeing this some rare drop somewhere to balance an issue.<br />
<br />
spells are basically no drop items.<br />
<br />
Any class defining spell balances the class, torpor and malo are the shamans class defining spells.  They be rare as heck.</div></div><hr />

Well good for ya if your xp group takes more than 42 sec to kill a mob. Yep you have time to reaply the dots.<br />
<br />
Now for raid situation, only mob you can maybe dot are boss.<br />
Sorry but I m not fan of doting during raid.<br />
<br />
I don't even need cani4 in raid now because of mana regen and cani5. <br />
Mana cost of chain nuking is not a problem and nuking is faster, better and safer DPS (with velium strike). <br />
<br />
What is the point of getting a lot of aggro using Blood of Saryrn for doing less than 3k dmg (with that focus) in 42 sec when you can nuke in the same time for 4500+ (without any focus or crit) with almost no aggro ??<br />
<br />
Yeah you can do both and die because of aggro and maybe move that freaking 3k AoE mob onto clerics and listen them screaming and dieing.<br />
<br />
Now if you think that your l33t dot dps worth the risk of wiping, then it's good for ya. I myself (and a lot of other shaman I know) think that this dps is not needed and too risky but once again, it depends of what mob you hunting and how good is your raid dps.<br />
<br />
DoTs are good for solo or slow dps group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm guessing (well, hoping would probably be more accurate) that this effect will come from a potion. If I remember correctly, I'm too lazy to look it up right now, the duration is listed as a little over 3 hours - the same as our other mana-savings potions, no? Would make some sense and would also dispense with the problem of this 'focus' only being attainable on PoTime loot or whatever. Will probably be introduced with the next expansion, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">As you know a certain specific dot, lets say BoS, does not stack with itself if casted by one shaman on one mob. The shaman would gain the % damage increase from the Poxans effect, but would then have to switch to another (less potent) dot if he wished to stack on more damage. A wizard could just have his handicapped parrot peck away on the best_dd button and score successive bursts of damage, each and EVERY one of which is boosted by whatever damage increasing effect he has.<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing for shaman to become dps machines, cause clearly that is not our role. However, as most of us will agree and as stated by SOE/Verant, dots in the high end game have not kept up in relative power.<br />
<br />
Which leads me into saying that dot damage increasing effects could go alot higher than 30% without becoming unbalancing.<br />
<br />
That was my point, which obviously was misunderstood by some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The duration on it shows as 3.0 mins @L1 to 3 hour(s) 15.0 mins @L65 which is the same as the Awareness III potions so it might be the case. However this is also the same duration listed on Focus Effects so it could be either. My guess would be a new focus effect.</div></div><hr />

Heh... I'm not going to fall for your trolling, but this is the last thing I am going to say to you in this topic:<br />
<br />
Lets see... From what you are saying these are the choices:<br />
<br />
1. A Shaman who does 5646 damage every 164 seconds for 1085 mana, while also healing or curing people who do more damage or are able to heal better, plus add in Project Alpha damage when able to be used.<br />
<br />
2. A Shaman who chain nukes and gets roughly 15k damage nuking non-stop in 164 seconds for 4896 mana assuming no partials or resists. He cannot heal or cure anyone in this time. Add in Project Alpha damage when able.<br />
<br />
3.  A Shaman who does 5646 damage every 164 seconds for 1085 mana, while also healing or curing people who do more damage or are able to heal better. Nuking through Enrage when able, plus add in Project Alpha damage when able to be used.<br />
<br />
If you were a group leader or raid leader... which Shaman would you want?<br />
<br />
Yeah, this is over-simplified, but trying to make a point here.</div></div><hr />

The problem with DoT's comes if the MT gets unlucky and dies, or they have other problems such as an AE effect not being cured.<br />
<br />
Do I care if the mob dies before the DoT wears off? No, because DPS is DPS no matter how you look at it. DoT's are far from worthless, but I think they could be improved upon.<br />

Even if not in the high end game dots ARE still useful.. Try killing a freakin rock in AR! 110k hps or so on those guys... try killing an aten in vt, like 3 million hps on that.. &quot;/ooc ok turn on attack and go afk, she should be dead in about 20 minutes..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Maybe I'm not... But at least I have enugh commen sines to not dump all of my mana into 1 mob. Which is exsacly what chain casting one dot on a mob would do. Mana wise it is the same has chain nukeing. And even if you can go from oom to fom in under 3 minits, down time is still down time. And personaly I dont see where being able to stick the same dot on a mob mutipal times from the same shammy would help you. Other then getting one mob dead just a little faster. But with the down time after did you really gain anything?<br />
<br />
I'm not calling you stupid or anything.. I'm just giving you a time when I'd like BoS to stack =] In HOH if it stacked I would drop enough BoS on a mob to kill it, go to a little out of max range, have root ready if needed, no recasting, less down time, better mana management (I would know if I should take out jbb for bracelet of sense, I carry both on me).. or even ice giants, drop 2 bos and go afk come back in 36s? and it's dead loot wait 6 min... or clicky disease buffs on someone then double dot and chain our poision nuke (to interrupt) in pvp.. or cazel, wow I'd like to stack my dots I would have killed him at 5x ish =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Heh... I'm not going to fall for your trolling, but this is the last thing I am going to say to you in this topic:<br />
<br />
Lets see... From what you are saying these are the choices:<br />
<br />
1. A Shaman who does 5646 damage every 164 seconds for 1085 mana, while also healing or curing people who do more damage or are able to heal better, plus add in Project Alpha damage when able to be used.<br />
<br />
2. A Shaman who chain nukes and gets roughly 15k damage nuking non-stop in 164 seconds for 4896 mana assuming no partials or resists. He cannot heal or cure anyone in this time. Add in Project Alpha damage when able.<br />
<br />
3.  A Shaman who does 5646 damage every 164 seconds for 1085 mana, while also healing or curing people who do more damage or are able to heal better. Nuking through Enrage when able, plus add in Project Alpha damage when able to be used.<br />
<br />
If you were a group leader or raid leader... which Shaman would you want?<br />
<br />
Yeah, this is over-simplified, but trying to make a point here.<br />
<br />
I'm shammy #3 and if I have mana I nuke even when not enraged and I jbb when I want to keep a little mana up.. I also buff the dead and talk smack in group.. heck I even SLOW and DEBUFF which I think is the most important =\ is that 1st shaman just lazy?</div></div><hr />

I said I over-simplified this, ;)  I was just bringing some attention to how narrow minded a certain someone was being. Shaman are so versatile in raids and groups it disgusts some other classes.<br />
<br />
I also do more than throw DoTs and heal/cure, but it's dependent on how many Shaman we have on a raid.</div></div><hr />
