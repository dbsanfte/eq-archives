<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How are your servers holding up since GoD was released? Fennin ro is about unplayable since it came out  :(  5 minute zoning and when you drop to desktop you get a 1017 error for a half hr before you can get back in if at all. Our guild hasnt been able to raid this weekend hardly at all, and today(sunday) is the worst.  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, Povar been messing up a ton too, cost us two days in Time, thankfully we got an extra day in the rotation cause of the screwed up servers, and on the third day they actually held up ok, until Time crashed for 30 frigging seconds well were owning CT.<br />
<br />
Today has been pretty bad too, on my 4th or 5th 1017 of the night, and haven't be on THAT long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">During primetime Mith Marr is the same way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">seems to come more often than go on tribunal.  There's moments when everything seems fine, but lot more often /tells, /whos, zoning, etc. all laggy.  Haven't noticed any major problems in gameplay/fights though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tribunal here also, bout 3 minute zones, SLOW tells, and two full zone crashes that I have been in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Drinal is horrible also.  Very slow tells and lots of LDs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Quellious is pretty bad around peak times. I've been dumped to server screen during zoning every day at least 5 times, always after 5PM PST, and all day Sunday. What I'm thinking the problem is is the new instancing of GoD zones. I believe it's eating up bandwidth which is causing all the lag/zone problems. I don't think SoE allocated enough resources to handle the addition strain on the servers when multiple groups are all doing instanced dungeons/events. What strikes me as odd, however, is that the problems wasn't nearly as severe with LDoN, which has even more instancing.</div></div><hr />

i thinkits gates of discord instancing too, why ldon is not so laggy ... respawns !<br />
GoD has fast repops, meaning your almost clearing as fast as they respawn, and hey, when they pop that fast, me and my group have no time to loot corpses.<br />
so we get humongous piles of bodies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Xev as a whole has been remarkably stable (compared to our daily crashes).  Tells have odd lag, some people have long zone times, and others get horrible video lag in some zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Zoning seems to take a bit longer on Tunare and<br />
when I do LD it takes a LOT longer to get back. I<br />
keep getting &quot;can't connect to the login server&quot;<br />
errors.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Innoruuk having problems too.  1017's on drops or zone and laggy tells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Last night bout 4 of the general chat rooms were full of people bitching bout the 1017's.  So we can figure its all servers.  <br />
<br />
I don't think it has anything to do with the GoD zones since getting dropped and teh lag is happeneing across all of the zones.  It has more to do with some of the other code put in with it somehow.</div></div><hr />
