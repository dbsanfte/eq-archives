This pretty much states that on the Test Server VI has implemented that pets now get resistances equal to those of its master, as if he was the masters level, and what the master is wearing. Few exceptions would be the fact that fire pets are extremely FR, so it would use its own FR, due to it being soooo much higher.<br />
<br />
SO, is this bad for duels because:<br />
<br />
A) Full resist gear, not only for the wearer, but his pet also...kinda :).<br />
<br />
B) Pets use whichever is higher, their innate or the masters, so they really get the best of both worlds...<br />
<br />
C) Not sure if this works for us, so if it's only for mages I'll be pissed :).<br />
<br />
Are these new &quot;developments&quot; good or bad for the PvP world? I assume bad, because the mage epic pet is already a bitch to cast on? BUT, if this also effects our pet then I'm sure we'll be much more effective, since they ARE a significant DMG source in duels, especially against casters with low-nil AC.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance Oracles :).</div></div><hr />
