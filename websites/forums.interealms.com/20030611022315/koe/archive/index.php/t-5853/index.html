You got wiped out using one of your spells?, here you go, you'll get wiped out even faster now, save you the trouble of touching your keyboard!!<br />
<br />
From the horse's mouth --<br />

Question, what happens to the wizard portal that's in Cazic thule?<br />
<br />
I'm guessing you didn't clear the area around the portal site out.<br />

The portal isn't really any more dangerous than it was before. The same precautions work as they did before. Sure, if you were going to get wiped out in the old CT, you'll get wiped out a little faster now. But the portal is pretty much just as usable as it was before.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You know, even when I ported into Cazic to go to Fear, the little level 30 lizards never bothered me much.  A quick root, draught and dead lizard.<br />
<br />
Course, they didn't see through invis, quad in the late 100s and stun.<br />
<br />
Safe as it was?  My High-elven butt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tallulah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds about as safe as running across a freeway to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had Quinn TL my naked lvl 8 ranger into CT this morning, invis of course.  There was nothing near the telport pad for quite a long distance, almost to the courtyard doors, and even then the lizards were probably too far down the tunnels to aggro.  There were 41 people in the zone at the moment, but the courtyard was full and all 41 people were huddled together at the zone in fron Feerrott so I don't think anyone did any clearing.  I heard there are some mobs that see through invis there, however if you have it up and know the way to the door it looks like it is as safe as it always was to get to Fear from there, or to go kill Ogre guards, etc.<br />
<br />
Got some cute little baby tiger raptor looking things in there now.  All white with orange stripes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yea...<br />
<br />
I thought about this too Jlove... started swearing to myself and shit... but...  believe it or not its quite safe to zone into here.  As Windigo said, there doesn't appear to be any any mobs near the portal or even in the maze at all for that matter.<br />
<br />
Pretty easy to just zone in to the platform and then succor to the zoneline.  And if your a melee or a person with invis you could probably run to the zoneline anyhow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Could have been alot worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yups, Nindalf.<br />
<br />
I suicide gated to there, just to see.  Believe it or not I didn't get killed, although is was pretty close.  Fully dressed, with epic effect active, i might even be able to waltz.  Who knows?<br />
<br />
Basis premise tho -- I got a chance to whine publicly:)<br />
<br />
Spectrez often asks for a tl there, or used to -- I would love to be standing over his shoulder watching the next time - hehe.</div></div><hr />
