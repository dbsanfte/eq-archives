** Information Gathering ** <br />
<br />
You will soon notice a new dialogue box appear when you log in (it appears after logging in three times to prevent spam for new players). We are asking you to let us gather a bit of information about your computer that will help us build the future of EverQuest. <br />
<br />
The important thing here is that you can say no and we won't gather any information. <br />
<br />
If you do accept, we'll gather CPU, RAM and video card information to help us evaluate and improve EverQuest. If you agree and then change your mind later, you can disable the feature under the Options tab (Alt-O) and then the General tab in game. <br />
<br />
So when you see the new dialogue box appear, please read it over carefully and click whichever answer you feel most comfortable with. <br />
<br />
Thanks. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Zones ** <br />
<br />
- Droga and Nurga moving to Live servers - These zones were revamped and sent to Legends, and now they are moving to the Live servers. This is a great chance to revisit these zones. <br />
<br />
- Chardok - Treachery and lies are not uncommon in the court of the Overking. But there are some unusual rumors being told by some unusual adventurers. Some say that there is strife within the council of the Overking, and that heroes may find adventure there while that strife lasts. OOC: We're introducing a new zone and a new zone type. The Halls of Betrayal is a &quot;pocket zone&quot;, and new type of zone for EverQuest. It will exist for a short time to be part of the storyline, and then will be gone. So if you're going to see it, now is the time. <br />
<br />
- Grieg's End revamp going to Legends - The redesign includes new encounters, items, traps, and events that make the zone a challenge for the experience group, with plenty of events for a raid group. <br />
<br />
- Plane of Earth B - we have removed the Call of the Hero restrictions in this zone. <br />
<br />
- Rallos Zek - the Warlord will now kick anyone out of the zone that is on his hate list and is not in a valid raid greater then 20 people in size. This should prevent single players being able to attack him and grief other players who are making a valid attempt at him. This is in addition to the previous limitations of having only one raid allowed to attack him at any given time. <br />
<br />
- Increased Experience - We have increased the experience modifier in the Tower of Solusek Ro, Halls of Honor, The Temple of Marr, and the Lair of Terris Thule. <br />
<br />
- Bastion of Thunder - The mini-bosses in Bastion of Thunder no longer spawn immediately after the zone comes up. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Tradeskills ** <br />
<br />
- Tradeskill chance of failures changed - The higher your skill is over the trivial of the combine, the less likely you are to fail with a combine. This is a reduction on the chance to always fail. <br />
<br />
- Stackable - Ice Burrower Silk, Pie Tins and Muffin Tins are now stackable. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />
- New Imbue, Enchant, and Thicken spells - New Imbue, Enchant, and Thicken spells have been added that create five magical items rather than just one. These spells require five components and take longer to cast and use more mana. <br />
<br />
- Damage Over Time Spell Foci - Extended Affliction has been changed to Burning Affliction, which causes DoT spells to do more damage instead of having a longer duration. <br />
<br />
- Enthrall spells - Enthrall spells will not un-stun the target when they wear off if there are other enthrall spells on that target. Also, when an enthrall spell breaks due to damage it will now remove all Enthrall spells, not just the first one it finds. <br />
<br />
- Ferocity - We have removed the component requirement for Ferocity. <br />
<br />
- Kindle - We have added a new Magician spell to the game called Kindle. <br />
<br />
- Force of Akera - We have added a new Paladin spell to the game called Force of Akera. <br />
<br />
- Burnout V - this spell should now stack with the Shielding line of spells. <br />
<br />
- New Spell levels for Clarity line - Boon of the Clear Mind is now a level 44 spell, Clarity II is now a level 52 spell and Gift of Pure Thought is now level 56. <br />
<br />
- Area of Effect spells - AoE spells that do not affect your group in PvP no longer affect your Raid in PvP either. <br />
<br />
- Direct Damage spell messages - Striking the killing blow with a direct damage spell will no longer show a double cast on the spell message. <br />
<br />
- Target Group Buff - TGB will no longer work with any illusions. <br />
<br />
- Illusion - With Permanent Illusion, Levitation effects will no longer be stripped when zoning and gnome enchanters with a large-size illusion will no longer return to gnome size after zoning. In general, characters that are under the effect of a size-changing illusion should be seen properly by everyone. <br />
<br />
- Song Spam - Bards should see less spam when they hit low level PCs with their high level songs. <br />
<br />
- Treeform - This spell should now work in Luclin outdoor zones. <br />
<br />
- Draught of Lightning - We have added a new Wizard spell to the game called Draught of Lightning. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Items ** <br />
<br />
- Bards Using Components - Bards using right-click items with a casting time greater than 0 will now expend any required components. <br />
<br />
- Ornate Armor Molds - These molds are more readily available. <br />
<br />
- Spellshield - Spellshield items now reduces spell damage by a percentage rather than a fixed amount. <br />
<br />
- Strikethrough and Stun Resist - You will now receive a message when Strikethrough and Stun Resist work. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Quests ** <br />
<br />
- Newbie Quests - Erudites, Trolls, Ogres and Barbarians now have quests in their newbie areas similar to those implemented for all other races. This completes the updated newbie quests for all races. <br />
<br />
- Seana and Stefan Marsinger - These two will be clearer when giving their quest requests, and will return them if you hand them to the wrong Marsinger. <br />
<br />
- Bors Wharhammer - He will be checking level instead of flags as a requirement for his quests to bring him in-line with the flag removals for the lower tier planes. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Alternate Advancement ** <br />
<br />
- Frenzied Burnout - this ability has been changed to better stack with the Burnout spells. The attack speed portion of the spell has been reduced in percentage (it hastes the pet much less), but changed to a &quot;bard&quot; haste which will stack with Burnout V. The strength bonus has also been decreased but made to stack with that of Burnout V. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Skills ** <br />
<br />
- Sneak - Sneak will now work under water. <br />
<br />
- Instill Doubt - Instill Doubt will now work if the Monk is using his other skills. Previously, use of other skills such as a kick would cause Instill Doubt to fail. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Interface ** <br />
<br />
- Camera - We have added the ability to bind cameras to keys. This will allow players to hit one key to switch to a desired camera rather than having to cycle through the F9 camera chain. This can be changed in the Options window (Alt-O) under the Keyboard tab (select &quot;camera&quot; from the list). <br />
<br />
- Auto-inventory - Items right-clicked off your corpse will now be place into your inventory in the correct order. <br />
<br />
- Spell Favorites - Creating a spell favorite name that matches a name that already exists will cause the new favorite to be saved over the old (whereas before it would create a second list with the same name). <br />
<br />
- Random name generator - Asking for a name should no longer result in a name that will be rejected due to duplication. Note: names can still be rejected by GM's. <br />
<br />
- Bow Graphics - Bows that have been autoequipped will now display a graphic. <br />
<br />
- Raids - The creation of a group will now work from inside a raid. <br />
<br />
- New Filters - We've added a Melee Warnings filter. It will filter out &quot;cannot see your target&quot; and &quot;cannot hit them from here&quot; messages, along with other such melee warnings. <br />
<br />
- Spell category lists - We moved a few of the Necromancer spells around on the category lists (from right-clicking spell gems) to make more sense. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous ** <br />
<br />
- Updated character creation descriptions - Right-clicking the class, race or statistic buttons while in the character creation screen will display a detailed explanation of the item clicked. <br />
<br />
- Clicking on corpses - Right-clicking on a PC corpse other than your own will no longer make a character visible. <br />
<br />
- Mounts - Fixed a bug with mounts showing up with incorrect Luclin model settings. Mounts should now only show up when the Luclin models for the character race of the rider AND mounts/elementals are both on. <br />
<br />
<br />
Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we have changed: <br />
<br />
EQUI_Optionswnd.xml <br />
EQUI.xml <br />
EQUI_charactercreate.xml</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice of them to have this magical new zone, and not tell us where it is. I assume chardok, which means that pretty much only chardok allied people will be able to go there.<br />
<br />
Why would they bother changing the XP modifiers for HOHB and PoNB is beyond me, it's not like anyone hunted those places beyond god killing raids.<br />
<br />
--Edit: Hmm, I hope these limited time zones aren't going to be a regular thing. Would really suck to waste all of this time downloading a zone that will only be open for like a month, and which I may not even bother going to....never been to Kerra ridge, but at least if I ever decide to, IT WILL BE THERE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;If you do accept, we'll gather CPU, RAM and video card information&quot;<br />
<br />
Not while I still draw breath, you won't...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really dont see this as a privacy concern. I would imagine that this is  important to them for future expansions or updating their graphics.<br />
<br />
...However, can they be trusted not to sell the information to a third party marketer? I guess if I start getting e-mails for hardware upgrades, I'll know where it came from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">- Auto-inventory - Items right-clicked off your corpse will now be place into your inventory in the correct order. <br />
<br />
As the old saying goes: i believe it, when i see it.<br />
<br />
Would be neat if they fixed that bug already - with two PRIMARY/SECONDARY-usable  piercing weapons (guess which 2, hehe) they always put up the secondary above the primary. Polite /clap - only took them 2 years to fix this simple bug in ordering items on corpse  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, it's just the &quot;we'll gather&quot; bit... They can ASK me what PC I run, but don't be going a-gathering in my box, thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not because I have anything bad on my computer but just in general if they want to know what i'm running... ask me. <br />
<br />
They come up with a 10 minute long survey of all that information and ask for feedback on game issues I'd be more than happy to take the time and answer everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">- Bors Wharhammer - He will be checking level instead of flags as a requirement for his quests to bring him in-line with the flag removals for the lower tier planes. <br />
<br />
So now it's level-only?  i.e. if you do the flag quest early, you still have to be 62 to get the armor?<br />
<br />
Kinda nice the armor being more available, but I just finished getting all the pieces that I want &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Man, what paranoia. <br />
<br />
They already have your email address, so if they wanted to sell you to the spammers, they could have already done so. If they wanted to put spyware on your computer to retrieve things like credit card information or even information about your computer, they could have already done so and you would never know. <br />
<br />
They are trying to upgrade their game and want to know what kind of computers we have so they can target the platform. Would you rather they not ask and just make the game require a 4ghz or perhaps a 66mhz?<br />
<br />
As for the PoP exp upgrades, perhaps the reason they are changing the exp is BECAUSE no one goes to those zones.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a pretty good patch and I hope to see it stable and ready to go soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">PoNB???  Are they kidding?  I would rather play Space Invaders on my Atari than exp there.  Torment would even be more fun....well ok, maybe not. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>zmakus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thought they were going to revamp other zone also.  Anyone know if this was scrapped or just delayed??<br />

This means that they're on vendors for 500pp, perhaps?<br />

All I wanna know is if they've fixed the spellbook bug.  After I dinged 61, it took me 6 tries to mem just one spell because the darned book kept closing.</div></div><hr />

Looks like it's still there... Keeps snapping shut on me at the most inopportune moments!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm taking this literally, to mean that the plate molds are dropping more, but not any of the patterns used for other armor...  Hopefully I'll be pleasantly surprised. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As for the PoP exp upgrades, perhaps the reason they are changing the exp is BECAUSE no one goes to those zones.<br />
<br />
Clearly you've never been in either zone. They could triple the xp-per-kill on the mobs there, and still nobody would go there except to kill gods.<br />
<br />
I'm happy that they increased the XP in zones that people actually go to, I just wonder why they bother with these two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Vorpatril said: &quot;Man, what paranoia.  They already have your email address, so if they wanted to sell you to the spammers, they could have already done so.&quot;<br />
<br />
From a very general standpoint, I can assure you that, in fact, this information gathering could open up countless windows for potential direct marketing purposes, if SOE felt so inclined to do so (as the original poster alluded to).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">- Newbie Quests - Erudites, Trolls, Ogres and Barbarians now have quests in their newbie areas similar to those implemented for all other races.

<br />
maybe this will be our completed necklace quest?  hell i'd just like them to remove the no-drop part of the summoned hamers so i can give them to dogdog and not have to carry /farm weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually people do exp in HoH.  Why not?  I do.  I solo there, I group there -- I really like the zone.  If you get a good chain-pulling group going, you can do an AA faster than in any other zo....  er, nm.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.  HoH sucks.  This post never happened.</div></div><hr />

Yay!  hopefully a lot less failing on blood of the wolf.  maybe i will be able to finance the rest of my alchamy skill now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Deria, there is a substantial difference between HoH, and HoHB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Increased Experience - We have increased the experience modifier in the Tower of Solusek Ro, Halls of Honor, The Temple of Marr, and the Lair of Terris Thule.  <br />
<br />
Actually surprised me that they would increase it in HoH since the exp there was already pretty darn good and at least on my server has a good amount of people grouping and soloing there already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just as brief update.<br />
<br />
Auto-Inventory after death is still in the wrong order.<br />
LFG-tag still vanishes after zoning.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
On a more positive note, the xp-increase (at least in HoH) is nice and noticable.</div></div><hr />
