<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was posted on Illia's Everquest Bestiary under Kirn's comments.  I was wondering if this would work:<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, after some trial and error, I can outline a relatively easy way to get a force into close proximity to the epic mobs that spawn deep within the Hole without having to clear through the city (which is a complete pain in the arse). This method does work while Yael is up. <br />
<br />
First, you need to powerlevel a brell cleric to level 14. The cleric needs the three spells divine aura, invis to undead, and reanimation, if you want to go totally barebones. <br />
<br />
Get the cleric to paineel, bind him right at the pit that drops you into the hole. Have the cleric divine aura and dive in, he'll land in the middle of a bunch of elementals, golems, flighty fiends, and master yael (if he's up). All these mobs should ignore you since you're a brell worshiper. Run up the passage that leads to the castle full of undead and epic mobs. ITU so none of the undead will aggro, run past the entrance to the castle, around the corner, and you'll be on a ledge overlooking master yael's spawn. Park the cleric here, we'll come to him later. <br />
<br />
Next, you'll need to have a 55+ mage in your raid party. have everyone in the raid party zone into the hole, no need to fight the entrance mobs, just sit around. Have someone duel the mage to kill him without exp loss. Now, take a level 1 brell worshiping halfling rogue, use sneak/hide and drag the mage's corpse all the way down through the city and to the spot where the level 14 cleric is parked. Have the cleric reanimate the mage, get the mage grouped with the halfling rogue, have the rogue sneak back to the entrance, or even easier make sure he's bound right outside the Hole entrance in Paineel and just have him run up to a mob and ask it for a free port to bind, any way you do it, have him in the entrance to the zone so he can invite people for Call of the Hero. CotH your entire raid party into position, assemble your groups, and presto! You're right near all the epic mobs, you're really close to master yael, and you didn't have to kill a thing. In the event that you don't have a mage that can cast Call of the Hero, it is possible to simply corpse your entire raid party and drag all their corpses through the zone. In this situation, I strongly reccomend that each person at the raid bring their own level 1 halfling rogue, because I had to drag five corpses through the Hole last night and it was not only extremely difficult (ended up making a ton of macro keys to target and summon corpses) but it also took about an hour and twenty minutes. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps, and good luck. <br />
(note: copies of this post will be placed in the discussion of the important epic mobs in the bestiary section, as well as under the main Hole strategy discussion. I'm not trying to spam, just trying to make it so anyone looking for info on their epic mob can find this strategy quickly and easily)&quot;<br />
<br />
Now the guild I am currently in has about 25 people between level 50-55.  I might be able to get enough support for killing Kirn if I propose that we do this, but firstly I need to know if it would even work.  My guild and allies attempted a half-assed attempt at Yael and we didn't even get halfway there before it wiped (the guy who organized it was a moron, only like 10 people showed).  Is this a good idea?  Would it work?  Is there an easier way to reach Kirn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Looks like it would work I have used a halfling brell rog to freely walk adound down there. It might take a few tries to get the Clr in pace tho. But I would not worrie about grouping the rog with the mag. Just have the mag goruped with the first people you want CoHed down. And remeber to have one person stay up top grouped with the mag that will be the last to coh down. I would coh down War,clr, shm/ enc, enc if shm was first, 2nd war. have them disband and form a group at once when cohed. They should be able to deal with any mobs while every one is cohing down. I would also make a rog and go exsplor the area yourself first to scout out good coh spots and such. Unless they changed it you can also take the rog into the undead tower and walk right up to Kern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well yes it works but it's not without risk still, your rogue has to be very fast else the mage wont be revivable, duelled corpses have a short res timer. Level 1 hidden and sneaking rogues move like a snail.<br />
<br />
The Holes changed since this strategy was common, more mobs are mezzable now when they never used to be. If you can get a tank and a competant mezzer and a few people who are used to dungeons then you're al set. Theres plently of threads about with Kirn strategies, see the epic sticky thread or try a few searches. Best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A couple of years ago, after our firwst couple of attempts at getting through the city all ended in wipe outs, we started using this method. I had long before made a Brell worshipping halfling rogue for CR and scouting in the Hole. Having SoW on the rogue is a must, and be sure the Mage knows to consent the rogue as soon as he zones from the duel death.<br />
<br />
The area to the side of the undead tower is perfectly safe, have had 30 people sitting there for an hour with no aggro problems. Once everyone is there you buff up, have everyone get Invis to undead, and make a mad dash for the top of the tower. We usually go in to the room to the left of where kirn is, where the chanter epic ghost is and clear that, then pull Kirn there.<br />
<br />
But as said, mobs in The Hole, notably the golems, can now be mezzed when they used to be immune, and one good group of 60 plus, or a few more can easily fight there way down now. <br />
<br />
Of course I have had my Tear in the bank for past 8 months and still havent got around to finishing my epic :)  I did drag the guild down to Kirn one night, only to remember I had never turned in Ghiosks books and didnt have good enough faction, and since the Shaman is my Alt to my Warrior, who has his epic, I hate asking for help to get another epic. Of course the Shaman is now Lvl 62, and my warrior is stopped at 61 as they both farm AA's for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you spend a while getting to know the Hole, it is actually not a bad dungeon crawl to do it the long way. You need a good puller, preferably level60+, a CH cleric, preferably a chanter for mez, and a shaman for slows.<br />
<br />
I did the Kirn raid this way, as a single group 0f 55-61, but we didn't have a chanter. I anjoy the whole Hole experience to be honest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Like they said:  it works, but it's a pain.  The Hole is so much easier now than when I did it (walking barefoot uphill in the snow, doncha know) that it is just not difficult.<br />
<br />
I did this step for a friend with one group of 58-60.</div></div><hr />
