<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Could someone please advise me on what kind of force is needed to take down the Guardian Wurms.<br />
<br />
I regulary play with a level 55 Pally and a level 57 druid (will definitely be 58 soon, so we're have the complete heal)<br />
<br />
I am currently 54, thinking about getting 55 very soon though.<br />
<br />
Is is possible to take one of these beauties down with this kinda force? <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Have the druid snare agro them while you try to debuff, once slowed the pally should root the GW at fight spot and engage. Reapply root until the pally has agro.<br />
<br />
Send in your dog, and just help with healing while epic dotting / jbb'ing if the time and mana allow it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Buy an aego too, a 55 pally is going to have some issues tanking otherwise. Pull with dispell to get single elders and break the spawn up. Its a really really boring camp.</div></div><hr />

Whats the chances for them to drop 60 spells? Are they incredibly rare?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well , they do seem to drop the 60 at a rare drop-rate. the worst is killing a level 60 mob, and having it drop nothing.<br />
<br />
if you kill enough of them you'll see some spells.</div></div><hr />
