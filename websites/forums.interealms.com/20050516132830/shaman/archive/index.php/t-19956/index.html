<br />
If anyone can provide me with any information on the question I would appreciatte it.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know a guild, belong to a guild or has heard of a guild, that starts raiding around 10pm PST(12am CST // 1am EST) ?<br />
<br />
Any server will be fine, I have been looking for more than a year now with no luck.<br />
Any guild that raids, is fine by me, I am not elemental flagged yet, but I have no reason to be, unless I can find a guild that raids my times, until then.....<br />
<br />
I appreciatte any help in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He said any server so i bet he's willing to trasnfer.  If i were you i'd look for a server where theres an active australian guild.  I know on my server(emarr) theres a guild that raids around 12 -7am est called cruentus.  They host some pu raids and mainly hit VT and tier 2 and some 3 gods.  im sure you'll find a few servers with guilds like em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quiggle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wreckers on Tholuxe Paells raids during that time, they're just getting into VT also<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd suggest starting with the server you are on, and going to that servers webpage (if you don't know where it is, just post the server here, and I, or someone else, will find it for you).  Post there that you are looking for an aussi guild (or just post the time frames) and you'll most likely find a few there.  If not, just try the same thing on a few other server boards...  Really, if the boards are active, they are the best place.</div></div><hr />

Australian based guild on Quellious server.They just entered time and their raid times seem to match what your looking for</div></div><hr />
