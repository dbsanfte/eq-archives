100% agree here.  He is like the lvl 20 warriors running around &quot;Give me Agility!!!!!&quot;  It's all in his head when you prove him wrong he still doesn't believe it.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what we have to do to prove the destruction of the class with things like buffs and making shorter and shorter burst DPS fights.... It really does seem useless until they get someone new in.<br />

<br />
I would dissagree.  If someone said &quot;Hey Gorg, you know when I told you to fix that TPS report you typed up.... you didn't.  You screwed up.&quot;  Now instead of saying &quot;There is nothing wrong with the TPS report&quot; (like he does).  I would say &quot;It was right when I handed it to my big boobied secretary and she had a hard time reading the paper since her boobies were in the way&quot;  Now in no way would my company fire said secretary because... well... let's face it, the boobie thing.  BUT at least people would know that it wasnt me that was hosing everything up.<br />
<br />
I have to dissagree.... he it isnt him then he shouldnt defend HIS stance.  If he doesnt believe buffs are the end all be all and that an extra 10 agi is going to really make a difference, he should say &quot;WOW guys you have proven me wrong time and time again and make sense... right now my hands are tied but I'm going to go up to the person holding me back from changing these issues and show him what you've shown me.&quot;</div></div><hr />

EQ would work best with a design team that loved the game and understood the classes.  People that really appreciated our desired to feel needed and useful in the classes we select.<br />

<br />
I would tend to agree. As much as I don't like the direction most of our spell lines are headed again, I can't help but think there's more to the picture than what we can see.<br />
<br />
That having been said, we have offered numerous posts/logs/parses showing the ineffectiveness of many of our spells, as well as facing changing content that our spell lines are not geared to deal with.  In my eyes, that has largely been ignored.  Now, whether that is because of larger issues... I'd like to hope so.  The alternative is that SOE/Rytan just can't find a new role for shaman's to fill....<br />
<br />
If they can't figure out a way to tune encounters, while allowing us to retain our debuffing role... then they need to come up with a new role for us.<br />
<br />
If they feel that increasing our healing to Druid levels would essentially nerf Druids too badly.. then they need to come up with a new role for us.<br />
<br />
If they feel that buffing players significantly, in a noticeable way when already stat capped is overpowering... then they need to come up with a new role for us.<br />
<br />
If they feel that the sum total of our abilities is too overpowering to warrant good burst dps useful in fast encounters... then they need to rethink that.  What else can we do well right now?  I'm not talking about functional.. I'm talking about well...  Really, what do we do &quot;better&quot; than any other class that is deemed &quot;good&quot; to have in the new GoD content?  Yep, nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, Agility does have a use now in that it adds endurance.  Not sure how big of a drain warrior disciplines are, but when I play my rogue I'm constantly using sneak attack and pretty low on that stat.<br />

Anyway, yeah, I have no confidence in Rytan either.</div></div><hr />

I think we have more than enough of a sample of the way Rytan works to formulate our own conclusions, but there will always be someone to defend the opposite point of view. Nobody here is really happy with the spells they've given us. When they do give us something nice it's usually because they took something even nicer away, changed it so it's more useful but not as nice as it was, or fist us vigorously with mana cost and durations.<br />

Amen. If, like Haruuk wrote, there is more going on than we see ... then this alone is the reason we want Rytan gone. I'd rather have someone who will fight for the playerbase rather than sit silently back and shovel the **** toward us.<br />

<br />
It isn't Rytlan. It isn't Brenlo. It isn't the big boobied secretary (who, by the way had those implanted in Sweden ... other parts to change at a later date.) It isn't any single individual you can point to and say, &quot;Oh, my gosh, &quot;HE&quot; is hosing up a great game!&quot;<br />
<br />
The direction is based on the 'team' vision. If there is a problem, that problem is that lack of depth, breadth and vision of the team. There is no progression to a point of the reaching a holy grail with EQ. There is, instead, progression to a point of mind-numbing idoicy in continuing to lure players into grind for every little crumb of advancement. That is the base template of EQ, and regardless of the lack of quality in this template EQ has proved for 5 years that works. Players still play the game. Or at least those that play the game do so with passion. As the 'stat's show, EQ has maintained their 400,000 subscriber level for a long time now ... forget that fact that a large percentage of that base is 2, 3 and 4 account individuals.<br />
<br />
The song and dance of the summit, Smedley's apology for GoD's release, token changes to classes and all the rest of the tidbits tossed to the masses as more PR than substantive changes in game balance are each and all the result of the collective team mindset as well as the managerial limitations placed on where the available resources are directed to work. Are the choices made and changes we see influenced by key people on the team(s) at SOE? Certainly. Strong willed individuals tend to get more of what they want done or implemented (or not done and implemented) in the team decision dynamic. But, even with that, the team collectively stamps the approval of whatever is decided.<br />
<br />
You can blame &lt;insert whoever&gt; ... but the blame should be spread out. Afterall, there is more than enough to go around.</div></div><hr />

I met Rytan, we didn't agree on everything, but I thought he was a nice guy. I debated locking this thread/sending it to The Grey. Please tone down the personal attacks - to me, the very suggestion of trying to get someone removed from their job is a big deal!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hi all.  Well, much as it pains me, I do think that Rytan may be constrained by the powers at SOE on what he can do.  Being an analytical type myself I know exactly where he is coming from when he judges whether Shaman are balanced or not.  Unfortunately, he must be ignoring actual gameplay and &quot;enjoyable&quot; gameplay when making some of these spell design decisions.  Additionally he was hampered with the existing Shaman spell line created 6 years ago in a different EQ world.<br />
<br />
But, be that as it may, I continue to be more interested in gameplay improvements rather than a bigger heal, a bigger DD, etc.  There is no way that Shaman should have such slow casting nukes or malos refresh issues or puppy weapon irritation or a worse group haste, no out of group shrink yada yada yada.  It is this ignoring of simple gameplay issues that irritates me the most and does not infringe too much on content balancing.  At least the new group FA is a step in the right direction to make the Shaman class more FUN to play.<br />

<br />
I think Gloriana has given us some very sound advice, and I think turning your aggressions on a moderator who has done a lot for us is unnecessary and completely uncalled for. This is a very delicate subject. We want things to change, enough so that we're targetting individuals to blame. Grafsha offered us another perspective, that it's not *just* Rytan, but a team thing. If everyone is holding everyone else back then it's time for a new team. I always believed the problem was in the employees handling the game and not the game itself, and it shows. It isn't just one person, but one person *can* make a difference. Ryan doesn't have to accept giving us sub-par, inferior and insulting spell upgrades. He could be the first one to stand up and start the change ... if he had the heart for it. If he doesn't, someone else needs to and those that can't, won't or don't should be replaced by intelligent people who care enough about the game and the classes involved to take steps to change it and work more directly with their public playerbase. <br />
<br />
Now that I'm done typing this up, I'm going to go and start my emails to Sony.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;get him fired&quot; thing is a bit extreme though, but I understand that fustration leads to this kind of hyperbole.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;Like that will get you anywhere&quot; statement was about emailing SOE, they ignore emails just as much as they ignore anything else.  Yeah, you get that nice little, we got your email return, but that's the last you'll ever hear from them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, maybe there is another way. Perhaps SoE keeps an eye on the number of people actually playing each class at any given time. I know if I were in charge, I would find that kind of information extremely valuable, and I have no doubt that it is easily obtainable from their data and/or logs.<br />
<br />
If this is, in fact, the case, then the desired message could still be sent by merely playing a different class for a while. I sincerely doubt they will allow the population of a given class to dwindle to any significant degree before they give serious consideration to improving it and making it desirable once again. Heck, if you wanna get really zealous about it, play a class you think desperately needs a good nerfin'.  ;)</div></div><hr />

Glorianna is not out to moderate what you have to say about the way Sony or it's employees handle the game.  However, when a thread speaks about campaigning to get an employee fired that sure as heck constitutes a personal attack, which *is* moderated and should be locked, deleted, or edited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I cannot believe I did this, but after five years of playing EQ, I put my brain in gear this morning, and went another route.<br />
<br />
I am not a programmer, developer, nor any other kind of 'er that understands the makeup of this game.  Where my expertise lies is in 30 years of marketing in the entertainment industry.  So I went back to basics.<br />
<br />
I searched my addy banks, and sent an email to the marketing department of SoE in San Diego.  All I really wanted to know was their concept of &quot;diminished returns&quot;.  With limited demographics, poor customer service history, and imminent launch of an expansion that is mediocre at best ... how they are going to sell me any SoE product, and I am a long time customer.<br />
<br />
I spoke as only a voice of one, mine, as a 65 shaman on Mith Marr.  I spoke of my disappointment in the complete lack of originality, upgrades, and continued enjoyment of EQ.  I was curious as to why a marketing department that has the responsibility of making sure the product is what the customer wants, needs and desires, could not be aware that my life as a shaman has had &quot;diminished returns&quot;.<br />
<br />
I explained that I was wearing blinders on this one occasion, and while there were other classes, other content, I really was not interested in that aspect.  I was only focusing (and yes pun intended) on my chosen class.<br />
<br />
I politely requested a reply in some format other than the &quot;public needs this response&quot;, but rather one out of consideration to a peer in their industry. <br />
<br />
I did not add any parses, or equations, or codes, because I doubt they would have understood.  I know sometimes I do not.  But I did explain it this way ...<br />
<br />
While the money it costs me per month to hunt in Norrath does not hurt my wallet, I still know the value of what I am paying.  It certainly pays for them to take the time to stroll down the hall and ask a simple question ... &quot;What is a shaman?  And do they have a role in OoW?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, nothing ventured, nothing gained.  I don't know if this will even garner a response ... but then again, I don't know if I will fork out the money for OoW.  Only time will tell.<br />

I am always suspicious of the prospect of this type of correspondence. I suspect that those reading it on the other end don't necessarily have any frame of reference for the situation, and would basically see me as some pathetic geek who is getting bent out of shape about a computer game or is allowing my EQ life to encroach upon my RL.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">While this may be extreme, it does further the message that something needs to be done and it needs to be done now. Not soon. Not put up on a list for discussion. Not in three weeks. Not on two weeks. Not in a year. Now. Right now. This really has gone on long enough.<br />
<br />
Why are we targeting Ryan? He's the frontline whipping boy. He is the LEAD spell guy. Therefore, he has more control than anyone else. We've proven to him hat his views are incorrect but rather than give us a full explanation of the process and why he can't do or change anything, he has ignored it and clung to his (incorrect) views and ideologies.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that we've been unhappy, frustrated and talked down for far too long. Many of us have long ago reached the extent of our patience. &quot;Wait and see&quot; has become &quot;Wait and see what new ways they think of to ignore/belittle.intult/screw us over yet again&quot; and we're so absolutely divided on some issues that they don't know what to do. The whole shebang is so beyond fuct it's funny like watching someone nailed in the hoohas on America's Funniest Home Videos. It's funny, but guess what? Bob Saget's voice overs are our current voice in this. That's not funny. (Not that he ever was, but that's a separate matter entirely! ;)<br />
<br />
The majority of our frustration comes from the fact that we just don't know. We don't know HOW SonyOE works. We don't know who's doing the real holding back. We don't know WHAT they are doing (and I know we all wonder if they themselves know just what the Aitch E Double Ell they're doing themselves). We don't know their processes and policies. And, here's the real kicker, we don't know what they're thinking! They held a summit which, as it stands, was nothing but PR fluff, and stopped there. Once again, SonyOE stymies a great idea shortly after it starts. <br />
<br />
Taking all this into account ... who is going to explain it to us? Ryan certainly hasn't. Brenlo hasn't. The Mods at EQLive haven't, but I applaud them on their ability to take abuse when it pops up. Customer Service is a thankless job. (I know, I worked it.)<br />
<br />
We need to know what is going on. A Top Ten List isn't going to cut it, especially when the list isn't even taken seriously enough to be updated by the people handling it.<br />
<br />
And, for those of us saying that sending emails to Sony won't help? Aside from complaining, what exactly have you done to change things other than posting here? <br />
<br />
Yeah. I didn't think so. That's why Gloriana's suggestion made sense to me. She was saying more than just 'email Sony'. She was saying 'do something' instead of just complain. At least, that's what I got out of it. But I was an English Major so I was always taught to read too much into things. ;)<br />
<br />
We're paying customers and we're being treated like beggars outside a posh restaurant. It's our right to know what is going on and to have the delays explained to us.<br />
<br />
I want 'Community Relations' to actually mean something. I want to know something is being done, what is being done, who is working on it, project progress, and every bit of information down to how many nosehairs everyone involved has. I want to see progress, not just have to give blind faith to a company that has repeatedly shown us they don't give a half a tug about us so much as their profits.<br />
<br />
It's time to stop posting and start acting. Email Sony. /feedback every day about everything that makes you unhappy. Post on their boards. Demand customer satisfcation. Report them to the Better Business Bureau (someone had mentioned this, but I don't know if it's possible... if it is, it'll be one hell of a wake up call to them!) for ignoring comsumer needs, shipping unfinished products (Smedley's apology over GoD, for example), lying to the customer (&quot;Working as intended&quot; my royal Greek as.s), etc... <br />
<br />
So before you post to complain, stop and ask yourself what you're doing about it first.</div></div><hr />

he should either get a &quot;promotion&quot; away from any important areas or start working on what he is payed to do ( making sure players are interrested in the game ).<br />
<br />
after 4 years of &quot;working as intended&quot; and things like ( this is just put in a simple way ) 4+5=8 and then having count less people comming up with data on why that statement is wrong, should indeed show that he might not be suited for that job he currently holds.<br />
<br />
indeed we ( well atleast most of us here ) have no idea about how SoE works and who is above him in the chain but saying nothing and doing nothing about problems well documented by players tend to show that he is not doing his job.<br />
<br />
the reason that he might be unable to say anything about anything is that people like brenlo is hired to do that ... but since he does not have ( sorry if this is too offensiv ) a clue about any major problems we have. and so far is unable to get any info out of the dervs / ryan the end result is that we dont get any responses on anything or info about anything</div></div><hr />

I don't think its a good idea to target people in this way its just dumb. If the guy is to be altered in job position, its Soe's responsibility not anyone elses. SoE should have their own criteria what is expected of a person in their job and making sure they measure up. Therefore, its noone but SoEs fault. They've not made good consumer relations which has caused excessive frustration on the behalf of the players, they were the ones that laid off a lot of the crew behind EQ which has led to a arguably worse game. So targetting a specific person is not the solution to the problem.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Otani,<br />
<br />
First of all, you're being short sighted with this issue. This thread may be funny to you, but it's also a reflection of the way Shaman currently feel. People are willing to support this idea because we have been repeatedly slighted. Sure, you can say it's just a game, and at the basest and minimalist observation it is but when you've invested a lot of your time into it there is going to be an attachment on some level. (For example, type /played and see how long you've been playing this game, and then ask yourself how many cool people, fun times and memories you've made in that time.)<br />
<br />
Second, what makes you think that going to Mister Noboyuki Idei is going to be something Shaman-specific? If it is escalated to that level it would be nothing short of selfish and pointless to address class issues. Anyone can tell you that. But, you're assuming things rather than waiting to see what comes of this. Mister Idei isn't going to care about what Shaman feel needs to be changed. What he will care about is poor cutomer relation, consumer dissatisfaction, inferior product (GoD, anyone?) and proof of ineptitude in his company's ranks. Even a modicum of research on Mister Idei will show you that he is concerned with running things efficiently and in everyone's best interest.<br />
<br />
Third, people are passionate enough to care. Just because you don't doesn't mean you don't have to respect their opinion. Judging someone by their broken English, also, is in poor taste. Not everyone who plays this game is at a college level demographic, let alone in an English-speaking nation.<br />
<br />
Last, SonyOE has shown they don't care ... does that mean we should stop caring too? Just because they have no idea what's good for the game, we shouldn't take any opportunities to make them take us seriously? If that's the way you feel, then I hope I never see you complain about a single thing related to the class. I mean, fi it's just a game and you obviouosly don't care, you shouldn't be bothered or affected by it, right? When, and if, we make a difference and get things changed you're going to reap the benefits whether you approved of our efforts or not, so sitting off on the side and casting aspersions upon people's characters for wanting to see change isn't going to do you one lick of good at all. <br />
<br />
Keep on contributing to the problem and doing nothing or staying in the &quot;Wait and see&quot; mentality. It has served us all so well in the past, after all.</div></div><hr />

he needs to be removed, maybe even fired, incompetent people usually end up being fired or demoted.<br />
make him playtest shaman from lvl 1 -70 and get 300 aa's and some flags.<br />
see how we stack up. because seriously we lack alot. our hybrid seriously throws beatings compared to shaman at the same lvl.<br />
make him try and get into a guild too, i bet he wouldn't even get into a casual raiding guild. why? because all the shaman who didn't quit piled into what ever guild they could.<br />
and have the bar raised so high that even casual guilds want shaman with 250+ aa's now and some decent gear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Beth, you missed my point.<br />
<br />
I've been playing my shaman since April, 1999.  I have seen us go from near gods in Kunark to junk in GoD.  I care about my character, I have fun with my character, I have fun playing the game.  I don't take it so seriously that I'm going to write the CEO of Sony because I don't like the current state of affairs in EQ.  That's taking things to a level that a game just doesn't warrent, IMHO.  I'm a serious gamer/raider. (Time/Uqua guild).  I know about the high end of this game and the low end of this game, but you guys need to take a chill.  It is a game, it's not life.  If you truely are unhappy with the current state of the game, walk away from it.  That's my point.  Sony isn't going to listen to you.  They never have, and they never will.  Monks were broken for years before they got around to fixing them.  Paladins were broken for years as well before they started to balance them.  Now it's our turn.  We are broken, yes.  But no amount of yelling or petitioning or letter writing is going to make the developers change their perspective.  We mean nothing to them.  That's my point.  We are nothing except players, and the ONLY way they will get the point is if you and everyone else who is unhappy walks away.  As long as you are willing to pay them every month, why should they fix anything?<br />
<br />
So, either leave the game, or find some way to enjoy it.  But all this whining has proven over and over and over that it isn't going to work.  SOE doesn't care about your perspective or mine.  They just don't.  That's why I find this thread so funny, because you and others still live with the illusion that you and I matter to SOE.....and the sad truth is we don't.<br />

<br />
When pretty much every casting class has no use for the 66-70 spells until they get new focus items that can affect them fully because their current gear and spells are actually better, then it makes you truly wonder what the fudge he is thinking.<br />
<br />
Is he incompetent? No, I doubt he'd get to his position doing what he does being incompetent. However, I do believe he is too much set into his own view of things, to the detriment of the game and in this case against all logic, to do things correctly.<br />
<br />
From my perspective, it's been a downward spiral with him at the helm. Things, spell related, have not improved no matter what Brenlo says. The few changes that had been made were to bring us up to par to what they were saying, because we were even further behind.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what to say at this point. When the fact is that players wont be using new spells because their current gear/spell set is actually better and he can't understand that that is wrong, nothing anyone here says will matter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">I used to care, but now I don't ... EQ fun and real life goes much easier this way...   I highly recommend this attitude to everyone.<br />
<br />
When you think about it.  This whole game is about getting higher numbers:  higher hps, higher mana, higher resists, higher heals, higher slow percents, etc.  Well, eventually, I came to the realization that the numbers do not matter one iota (that basically means &quot;bit&quot; in Greek by the way).  The numbers are just that... NUMBERS.  This game is more about socialization and human contact when you think about it.<br />
<br />
I used to be upset that some shaman on my server had a time's anthesis and 7k unbuffed hps and were far more uber than myself.  But then I realized that it doesn't matter in the long run what your equipment, spells, or focus effects do.  It is all about having fun and socializing.<br />
<br />
I do acknowledge that shaman are not as &quot;valuable&quot; in GoD as other expansions.  However, that is not the &quot;end-all/be-all&quot;.  If you have fun and are pleasant to be with, people will invite you to their GoD expeditions and 54-person restricted raids no matter how much or how little you add to the NUMBERS (ex: healing, slowing, etc).<br />
<br />
So, my main point is 1) I agree that the shaman class have fallen behind the times but 2) this really does not matter in the long run.  Eventually, Sony will have no choice but to respond to its consumer's demands, lest it lose further revenue.<br />
<br />
I wish all these similar posts had any effect on the developers, but they do not.  The only real affect we have will be noticed when the demand of Sony's product dwindles.<br />
<br />
So, in conclusion, enjoy the game like you used to enjoy it.  Find new ways of having fun that do not involve &quot;increasing your numbers.&quot;  Eventually, everything will work its way out.  Since we live in a free marketplace with almost immediate exchange of information, something will have to give -- Sony will either respond to their decrease in market value or Sony Online Entertainment will become extinct.  It is unfortunate, but there is no way that we can change this fact.</div></div><hr />

Several people here complaining that some are sick or deranged because they feel that way.  I cant really think of any appropriate response except 'too bad'.  This is a game, correct.  However its a game that, by design, requires time and dedication.  Thats going to provoke some pretty strong feelings, like it or not.

You can always just stop playing the game if you're upset, but again, you have a tremendous amount of time/energy/emotional attachment put into it.  Hard to walk away from a 5 year relationship, even if it has gone bad.<br />
<br />
Heck, I couldn't have even told you who the spell guy was until recently.  I could have told you however, that a great many spells in all spellbooks are a total waste.  I'd still like to see more different ideas in the spell lineups, instead of more of the same old stuff.</div></div><hr />

Even in the even that you didn't actually cause him to be fired, if you don't think having him merely removed from his post would be detrimental to his standing with the company, then you really haven't spent enough time in the real world.<br />
<br />
Grow up, people, and let's get our priorities straight.<br />
<br />
When I get letters complaining about some of my staff (I am a manager CS) I will investigate that.<br />
When it is an isolated incident there will be no sanctions. However when I get more letters all complaining about the same issue I can asure you that the employee will be fired.<br />
<br />
When you complain about something/someone you always have an impact on his job (no raise, no promotion or being fired) so you want us to be silent?<br />
<br />
Rytan has shown in many cases he is unfit for his job. He seems to have a grudge vs this class (ever since showEQ proved him wrong a few years back) and I think it is not more then fair you give him the credits for his actions. In this case that boils down to asking his boss to kick him out.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully that's unless you're dealing with highly opinionated and subjective issues such as this. Otherwise, that would be like impeaching a US president because 25% of the people are dissatisfied with him, in which case I would pity your subordinates.<br />

Of course not. I would just expect people not to make mountains out of mole hills and remember what exactly it is they're trying to taint a person's employment record over - certain aspects of a computer game.<br />
<br />

Both claims HIGHLY suggestive and not supported nearly strongly enough across the board.<br />
<br />
I think it is not more then fair you give him the credits for his actions. In this case that boils down to asking his boss to kick him out.<br />
Again, this &quot;credit for his actions&quot; to which you refer is HIGHLY subjective and tainted by the fact that the &quot;actions&quot; in question are based on the over-zealous attitudes of the minority.<br />
<br />
When you talk about the idea that the time commitment involved with EQ and the idea of five-year relationships coming into play, I have to just shake my head and think that someone needs to get a life.</div></div><hr />

Shaman are great in 96% of the game. There are some issues in the other 4%, sure. Demanding someone's head because you can't bring yourself to cancel your account and step away from EQ for a month or two - the absolute most effective means of sending a message, I might add - is pathetic.<br />

I'll ask again. How strongly can you possibly feel about your perception of this horrible state of the game, if you continue to pay for it?!?! I played SWG for the first six months. I became a Master Droid Engineer, despite the flaws I saw in the profession and the complete absence of any communication from the dev team on the matters. These weren't subjective issues, droids just didn't work. When I finally reached MDE, I waited for about a month to see if they would at least open any lines of communication with the DE public. Seeing no activity at all on their part, I cancelled my account, and that was that. I wasn't happy, so I left. Seems like a pretty simple concept to me.</div></div><hr />

Did you're leaving swg help the class you were playing? I dont think its as simple as you make it out to be. To continue to play and want them to fix it at the same time. Is that really that whackked out a concept? There are varying degrees of being unhappy. Some warrant Canceling some warrant making some noise. <br />
<br />
Now for my part i dont see calling for someones job in this case as necassarily being needed. For all i know sony is content with the job they are doing. I dont know i see the world in alot of different shades. I dont think just leaving or not is the right answer all the time. If i was unhappy with my pay at work i could get a raise without having to threaten to leave. Also not convinced calling for someones job is going to fix a certain class that is just part of the game. Eq has had more problems than just the shaman class. Other classes were out of balance for a long long time before they got fixed. Beasts sucked at first. Zerkers suck now. I'd be willing to be their are people who quit the game thinking was the way to get zerkers fixed and they are still waiting. Classes have been fixed without having to cancel billing. <br />

Besides really sure firing one person will make them do anything different? Who were the last few pr guys and how much changed when they left/changed postions or whatever they do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Conaan_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">I stated, a few months ago, that I would not be back to these boards to post.  Just too many people here who get a kick out of throwing flames.  Oh well, I know the view point that I am about to pen here will be deleted from SoEs forums faster than a Shaman being one rounded by Barxt.  Be that as it may, I think this is valid and important enough that I want people to see it.<br />
<br />
It is obvious to me that Rytan is the kind of guy who enjoys needling people to stir up emotions, just to see people react.  He pursues this course as it makes him feel important and superior to others.  The fact is, Rytan is a trouble maker who has found his way into a job that can impact (upset) a lot of people.  Unfortunately for us, he has chosen the Shaman class as his pet target for these abuses.  I base my assessment on his history of how and what spell dated that he has released, knowing it will be reported on the Lucys web site.  He does this in such a way as to maximize the negative reactions of the paying customers.  Sure, its all pre-release stuff and nothing that appears on Lucys is finalized etc... etc... but the fact remains, there is no reason for him to alter this data, in the way that he does it, other than his own, rather pitiful, ego inflation.<br />
<br />
I suggest a write in campaign to have him fired.  Those of you who will claim that this is only a game and to take away someones lively hood over a game is wrong.  Well, you are wrong.  This game is his job.  If he wants to keep his job he needs to work towards making the game a success by giving people reasons to enjoy playing it.  Instead, he spends way too much time stirring up emotional responses via his self serving manipulations.  This behavior is destructive to the company he works for, to the game and to each and every person who pays to participate.<br />
<br />
Rytan should be fired and I urge anyone who agrees with that view point to write to Mr. Howard Stringer, Chairman and CEO of Sony Corporation of America.  Stringer directly oversees Sony Pictures Entertainment Group of which SOE is a part.  His office is in New York.</div></div><hr />

Locking threads will often just cause more problems. I never waste my time reading anything on Sony's boards because I know they are heavily moderated.<br />
<br />
One of my RL work buddies was fired because of too many customer complaints so it does happen. But thats one of the &quot;curses&quot; of having a customer related job. The other side of the coin is that when you are able to help a customers with something that has troubled them its a great feeling. With that in mind I just dont understand why Rytan and his buddies seem so uninterested in helping us (= their customers).<br />

You are overlooking the fact that Rytan has got nothing to do with customer relations. He's a tech guy involved in product design, who, on rare occasions, will make a comment in public forums. Most companies don't allow people like him to interact with the public at all. The other thing that you are overlooking is that issues of game balance are decided by the team, not by Rytan himself. He just manages the spell system. The spells that go into the game (or do not, as the case may be), and what form they take, is decided by the team. The are not decided in isolation. The people who design the actual encounters in the game probably have a lot more say about stuff like that than Rytan does, he just codes it.<br />
<br />
I mean, we have people on this board who apparently actually believe that Rytan has some sort of personal vendetta against shaman. Do they realize how delusional and paranoid that sounds??? ***!!!<br />
<br />
If people are going to look for a whipping boy to vent their frustrations, reasonable or not, they should at least go after the right people, not some guy who is not allowed to defend himself.<br />
<br />
You talk about civility here, but a fair number of people here are behaving like a mob that, when some crime happens, run after some random black guy waving clubs and throwing stones just because hes a black guy. Reason and rational thought appear not to exist. I know that this is an extreme example but the sheer ugliness of some the comments in this thread and the thread itself is beyond belief!

<br />
I don't know what Rytan thinks, or does, or how decisions are made at SoE. What I do know however is that whatever way they are coming to their decisions on spells, in particular to shamans, is ****ed up. Be it Rytan alone, be it Rytan and his happy helper elfs, be it the god damn Teletubbies, bottom line their decisions are crap. I've been invloved with EQ longer than Rytan has, that, to me, gives me the full justification to question, and to call out, his crap he has been giving us.<br />

Switching to another MMORPG is not as easy as changing your squash club or whatever simply because it involves leaving behind your character: something you've built over (possibly) many years. I found it difficult - if the Devteam hadn't made it as easy as possible for me, by destroying everything I valued in the game I'd still be playing EQ today.<br />
<br />
I would question whether Rytan should be the focus for all the blame.  The EQ magic system is actually a very good one: the real problem here is the Devteam deciding that they could could change the dps/hps balance of mobs so massively without realising that this would require a complete rebalancing of everything else in the game.

<br />
It wasn't a case of them listening to players directly that let to the change, rather it was an indirect effect. As the game evolved into the Luclin era, mudflation meant that in order to balance the game so that it was still challenging, they had give mobs high relative AC, which in turn led to long fights. The players didnt like this and any future balancing along these lines would have led to even longer fights. When they first announced PoP, and said that they were moving to shorter fights, most players were happy about that. People didn't realize that short fights mean high ATK and all that goes with that way of balancing things, consequently they were shocked when they first went into PoP and realized what that actually meant.<br />
<br />
Its a difficult situation for them. On one hand having short fights has an impact on the way certain classes are played, while on the other hand balancing by way of long fights will produce endurance fests, which will be equally unpopular (because they will be ultra boring). Particularly among classes that are not that dependant on the length of a fight. There is absolutely no way that you are going to get the thrill of a PA fight where everything has to be just perfect with a long fight for example, so any attempt to return to long fights is likely to be met with fierce melee resistance I would think. I think that they are faced with a very complex situation and I'm sure that they are aware of that. I think that changes in the encounter paradigm will more likely take the form of new content (ie expansions) rather than &quot;rebalancing&quot;, just as it allways has in the past. So we will see what happens in Omens.<br />
<br />
To be honest though I think the only way to resolve the problems that certain classes have in the modern game is through a fundamental redesign of the DoT and buff/debuff systems. That would be a huge undertaking though, and at this point in the product life cycle I doubt it makes economic sense to do so, so it most likely wont happen.</div></div><hr />

I'm personally glad that Tugela is here on the Shaman's crucible:<br />
<br />
a) Your're  very insightful about Warrior issues and how the Warrior part of the game works.  I've learned quite a few things from your posts.<br />
<br />
b) You've got some sort of inside line on how SOE operates judging from your posts on this thread.  You've told me more about how SOE works than Brenlo and Rytan and Khysa (that cookies girl on the EQ forums) combined.<br />

c) Your shaman is just a buffbot (or a 'strategic debuffer'), so you invariably pick the opposite side of the debate than everyone else.  Makes for good threads.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Actually, I'm sympathetic to knight issues, allthough I disagree with the requests for defensive type discs. Those are largely made to address issues with particular content rather than class deficiency, so I dont regard them as proper and I think in the long run they will cause serious balance issues for warriors. When you are looking for a solution for a particular problem it is foolish to focus only on that problem and ignore what exists in the past and what might exist in the future. You need to look at the impact on the whole game, not just on that small part of it, and that is mostly what the vigorous debate is about (allthough many probably dont see it in those terms).<br />
<br />
SKs in particular need help, pallies are largely ok with one or two minor issues. I do think they should both get a parry disc like rangers do though, at the cost of their DA/HS abilities, or at least get the option of that. Maybe make DA/HS discs and put them in the same timer group as the parry disc, that would work too.</div></div><hr />

Rytan says stat buffs are really effective <br />
nothing gets changed.<br />
<br />
Actually, he said they have an effect, which they do. Players were the ones who read other meanings into that, because they want there to be some other meaning. I dont recall any post by him where he states that they have a huge effect, and neither do you. All you have are reports of what people thought he said in unrecorded conversations, based on their recollections, and what third parties assumed he said based on their preconcieved notions. Hardly the stuff to warrant forming a lynching party now is it.<br />

Well, a couple points here.  One, Diabalin was paraphrasing, not to say he did it well, but it is a minor point.  Two, Rytan did say:<br />
<br />
Stat Buffs<br />
The initial implementation with the Accuracy etc is still on the table, as the Omens spells are still very much in transition. I know you're all very well aware of the effects stat buffs have on players, so I won't bore you with a recap. This is something to look at during beta and adjust the spells as needed. I will, however, say that 75 str does have a noticeable difference on DPS. The cap increases that are there now will likely filter down to the other stat buffs regardless of whether the Omens spells are changed. Then again, that might change to the same system as well.<br />
On a related note, we also discussed increasing the buff limit most likely through an AA, which should alleviate many of the concerns over buff slot limitations. Most likely this will be 5 new slots for a total of 20.<br />
<br />
Rytan feels he's been misrepresented (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?postid=258192#post258192)<br />
<br />
I guess the effect of 75 STR on DPS being significant is relative and a matter of perception.  If I were a poorly geared pre 65 rogue then I'd likely find it more helpfull than a well geared 65 warrior.  I'm sure you can provide more input on that than I can, but I personally found Rytan's definition of noticable difference to be lacking.  Even a 1% is noticable through parses on anyone, but is it worth a buff slot ... well, you tell me.<br />
<br />
I don't personally think Rytan has done a good job.  I don't know if he's done bad enough for his employer to take action as there are other classes and all ;), but he certainly has not earned the respect of the shaman class player base.  I think some of the players here are getting carried away and letting their anger and frustration get the better of their logic, but there are some interesting arguments here to justify a request for something other than silence from Rytan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">thanks Tarthug, I sure as hell wasnt going to go looking for it.<br />
<br />
my point is that Rytans idea of noticable and any lvl 65 in decent bazzar gear or betters idea of noticable are miles apart. <br />
<br />
if my 52 rogue gets a load of shaman buffage then I dont need to parse to see my dps go up, he gets almost full effect from focus/diaku/pe/sta across the board, I BS for more and I hit for more damage. stuff dies considerably faster fully buffed because my under 200 str is now 255, my dex and sta are also pushed in to the 200+ range. <br />
<br />
my friends 65 warrior, the one with 0 raid gear doesnt notice shyte, you HAVE to parse to see any effect other than a few extra hp. <br />
<br />
and the other sad truth is that shaman buffs are and always have been to weak for there relative lvl. at lvl 10 your best buffs arent even worth casting, go ahead and parse it and tell me I am wrong. the same goes for every lvl in the game til you hit post 50 and even then its questionable. kinda sad when my 52 rogue needs 65th lvl buffs to get a NOTICEABLE efect from stat buffs.<br />
<br />
rytan is full of **** and hes clueless to boot.<br />
<br />
note the part where he thinks we will be loading multiple Cani's so we can chain cani for even more mana...that we cant spend thanks to eternal cast times and having nothing to cast worthwhile.<br />
<br />
(EDIT) note that when I say best buffs I am talking about STAT buffs</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, I haven't gotten an org chart from SoE or anything, but that's the impression I've gotten from my conversations with the developers.  I'd be curious to know where Tugela is pulling his info.  I wouldn't mind seeing a little back-up to some of his claims.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">I am sure there is a primary flaw in their testing procedures. They are taking a Level 1 guy with a hundread str and parsing him With a focus and Then adding avatar onto it. Yeah that will have a dramatic impact on dps. soley through the spells cast. I mean that is how much strength added. +75 str + 140 Str. (Focus and avatar) will increase Newbies str from his base 75 to a capped 255.  Heck if you Betabuffed to 65 then would have a cap of 280.  Then add the +140 Attk. That will swing attack by like 400 points. (With Class bonuses.) That is probably how they are testing it. And seeing a Huge increase in the numbers means shaman are fine. Much better off than Beastlords or Rangers.  <br />
<br />
Only one problem. The testing methodology is crap. People dont play the game like that. 99% of the meeles in the game that are geared even somewhat normally will have their Str maxxed by a simple focus.  And of that 99% Probably 75% of them are stat capped maxxed in str. So Focus is simply a Hp buff. Avatar is simply a Attk Buff. That cots a huge amount of mana and frustration in mem times and recycle times. <br />
<br />
You cannot keep giving Shaman buffs that are on paper well designed that are neutered by the increases in actual game play elements.  Slow mitigation. Buffs that are purely against the cap And also With Omens new buffs that can go past the cap but the values are up against diminishing returns. (In other words +140 str over cap is really having a post Diminishing returns value of like +20 attack added.) <br />
<br />
That is the problem Sir Rytan. In a nutshell. We get the calculation of power based upon an increase of + 140 attk + 140 str (Which is a figured characteristic of attack) and +140 dex. When in actuality due to the cap and especially the diminishing returns past 200 In a stat we are getting very little of that paper tiger number in real game world power increase. <br />
<br />
Think about it please. Because we run into game play constrictions in all aspects of shaman game play.  Slow mitigation. Lesser heals due to slow. Stat buffs when stats are Very lowly capped. Compared to the increases we can give. Hp buffs that are directly countered by items on meele clicky items that have more game world effect. And cannot overwrite the caster self buffs. Increased Mana costs due to cannibalization abilities. Increased casting times in a fast paced game world.  No other class in the game runs into so many artificial out of game counters to their abilities. That is why we are complaining so badly. It is like we have a + 5 vorpral sword that whenever we use it the monsters are immune to the critical hits from it. Why play in a game like that where frustration is hand in hand with your main duties. <br />
<br />
Look at the game data on characters level 65. Just take Warriors. And look at their Str dex and agility unbuffed. Then start from there. You Will have your eyes opened I think. We dont buff like you think in game. Simply amazing on paper.. But the game is different<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Bigcatt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Interesting post. <br />
The Eq Shaman player perspective seems to be that Rytan actively minimizes the usefuleness of the class, and directly and indirectly mocks us at the same time while resisting allowing us improvements. (e.g. stat buffs are so good, but all the stat buffs are put on gear that makes us redundant as there are caps to how much stats can be buffed. How come we can't get shaman gear that tanks for us, so we can replace warriors with our gear?) <br />
Tugela and the other fanboys perception is (loosely paraphrased) MY GOD! THIS IS HIS JOB! IT IS A GAME! GET A LIFE!<br />
<br />
Hmmm. If playing a game, and getting passionate about it means we should get a life, where exactly on the food chain would that put someone who has based their livelihood on said game? We should not comment on what we perceive as poor service, and bad relations because this might impact their income, and that makes us bad for caring?<br />
So, then Rytan should not be held accountable for his poor relations because the basis of this situation is around a game? I need a job like that! <br />
<br />
Hello, I work in research, but it doesn't actually feed anyone, so therefore do not hold me accountable for any of my work. And I shall randomly abuse groups of people that I work with, but don't hold that against me, because we really cannot take this work seriously. <br />
<br />
<br />
There is a belief in service work that, one complaint in isolation may indicate the person complaining has a problem, but if many many complaints are received, then the problem JUST might be with you.<br />
<br />
Perhaps if we target one of the random folks that seem to care little about our concerns, yet continue to base their livelihood on our continuation of support for their company, the others will take heed and start working the problem, so they may continue to enjoy said livelihood from 'a game'. <br />
<br />
Peace and love. <br />

Thank you for linking that, I hadn't read it before, but it serves to make my point very well. For example, Diabalin says: &quot;3232433434 different shaman with parsed logs prove beyond the slightest doubt that stat buffs are a ****ing joke&quot;. This is a common theme in many threads, the innuendo being that Rytan doesn't know this. What does Rytan actually have to say about this? &quot;I know you're all very well aware of the effects stat buffs have on players, so I won't bore you with a recap.&quot;. Obviously he knows exactly what these buffs do, but that doesnt stop supposedly intelligent people from insisting that he doesnt, in spite of the fact that there is no evidence at all to indicate that is the case.<br />
<br />
What about other assertions Diabalin (and others) make?: &quot;Rytan says stat buffs are really effective&quot;. What does Rytan actually say? &quot;I will, however, say that 75 str does have a noticeable difference on DPS&quot;. He is not defining what &quot;noticeable&quot; is supposed to mean, Daibalin is. Is Rytan correct? Of course he is. Does he say that the buffs are really effective? No he doesnt. He doesnt make any comment at all about the actual magnitude of the difference, or how valuable it might be, all he says is that it can be seen. But that doesnt stop Diabalin from drawing conclusions, not from what Rytan meant, but from what Diabalin wanted Rytan to mean.<br />
<br />
A close analogy to the sort of argument that most posters on this board are making would be the situation regarding heals. We have a great many shaman posting here that a few hundred extra hp on our heals is going to have what amounts to earth shattering effects on our group desirability. My position has been that no, such changes aren't going to affect our group desirability significantly at all, that they are just &quot;noticeable&quot;, which is exactly what such a change would be. Why is it that something that is just &quot;noticeable&quot; is hugely significant when you (shaman, not you personally) say it, but hugely insignificant when Rytan says it? <br />
<br />
If you want to see what I mean, read Rytan's comments on that thread. It all seems perfectly rational. Then read all the horse manure in rest of that thread. You people wonder why the guy doesnt bother talking to you, it should be perfectly obvious to any level headed person who reads that thread why he doesnt.

Thanks for stating this more eloquentlythen I could Tugela.  All I could come up with is a rant about how shocked and disappointed I was that people on this board were casually calling for Rytans head. :p   <br />

I hate locked threads, but I really think this one should be locked or moved off the General branch.  A lot of these posts are personal attacks on Rytan and I don't think that should be allowed any more than if I personally attacked another poster.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying anyone should be happy or mad  at SoE - just that it should not become a personal attack against an individual.<br />
<br />
By the way, do you really think a fairly low level employee is making the decisions for this game in isolation???  <br />
<br />
Also, if you ran SoE, what would you do if you had an employee that spouted off publically against how SoE ran the game?  (hint - I'd fire them in a heartbeat because they weren't working with the team to solve the problem - it wouldn't matter if I agreed or disagreed with what they said...I wouldn't tolerate public dissention)  So, regardless of what you've read, do you really think you know what Rytan says to the team when the doors are closed?</div></div><hr />

You do realise if people would not have complained and complained and bitched you would have never gotten many kunark spells? That alchemy would have never been trainable at all?<br />
<br />
You do realise that if people wouldnt have made such a huge stink over mage pets they never would have gotten duel weild.<br />
<br />
That Avatar would still have a regent cost on all its iterations. <br />
<br />
That Warriors would be second class tanks to rangers. <br />
<br />
That rangers in kunark would have been dead on arrival just about.<br />
<br />
That There are so many instances where Just one person cannot encompass all that the game has to show. The game systems for spells alone are too ig for one guy to make every relevant descision. To balance everything in a timly manner.<br />
<br />
I am sure rytan sees teh effect of avatar. He sees that the Str is added by 140. (Which calculates out to Like +140 Attk If your str is at 75ish) Then added on that it adds 140 raw attack. So by looking at the paper you get +280 attack off that single buff. <br />
<br />
On paper. That is a damn good buff. Plus it adds Agility and Dex of 140 as well. Which when the stat is at 75 base is a Godawful huge increase. <br />
<br />
I mean That would be a game changer for a meele. And it was for years. Before all stats were capped at 305 due to Item and Aa increases. Before Worn attack that could get to 150. <br />
<br />
Well the combat tables show that after a certain number. (Exceeding the Monsters AC) Attk helps some. But 300 attk over the monsters Ac compared to 150 over the monsters AC is not linier. it is diminishing differances. So At the high end. The meeles stats are capped. They have a considerable amount of Worn attack. And they have items that give more in game effects than a shamans primary role. Buffing. Not to mention they can have in game effects that Directly effect the bottom line like strikethrough and cleave stuff and all.<br />
<br />
What is the point of talking to Rytan. He has shown that he listens less to usthan we listen to him. He asks for proof and we give it to him and he clams up. And &quot;is not convinced&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you have a problem with the service provider for something and you hit a brick wall you try and go over the brick walls head if at all possible. If that fails you will tend to stop useing that service. <br />
<br />
Rytan is a brick wall. And the only reason we don't all quit is because we can still be viable in some aspects of the game. (Primarily trivial content)<br />
<br />
I certain can't convine you Yella that you are in the wrong. No more than I can convince Rytan that he is as well. All I can hope to do is convince others that are not so strident as yourself and Rytan that there is a god damned problem here and it has to be addressed so that the game can go back to being enjoyable most of the time. <br />
<br />
Somehow Rytan must be convinced that somewhere he is missing something. Since he doesnt communicate with us about his methods of testing and he certainly doesnt take the time to convince us that he knows what the **** he is talking about. It is up to us to keep shouting and hope that somehow somewhere some god damned person with a clue might be able to listen. Or at the very least convince enough people to make a stink about it that the company that is concerned for profit realises that they are ****ing up and hurting thier potential.<br />
<br />
Or we can leave. <br />
<br />
I hav not yet begun to fight. Rytan has to listen and come to the table and convince us. Or there will continue to be uproars in our community. Till the last shaman quits for good. <br />
<br />
Or in your case. Becomes just another shaman bot. <br />

<br />
Just because I feel like playing with my favorite troll today, and this thread is a Grey-bound flamefest anyway...<br />
<br />
This will come as a shock, but words have meaning.  &quot;Noticeable&quot; in the context he used it cannot be fairly understood to be &quot;a miniscule but real difference that can be detected through parsing.&quot;  If you think it can, you are flat-out illiterate.  Even if you don't know what a word means Tugela, you can frequently deduce its meaning from the context.  This mysterious word &quot;noticeable&quot; came up in a discussion of shaman balancing.  One of Rytan's responses to the claim that the class is underpowered is that a 75 point strength buff has a &quot;noticeable&quot; impact on DPS and that once the stat caps are raised, it will buff the shaman class.  Now, does your definition of &quot;noticeable&quot; make sense in that answer?  Not really.  &quot;Noticeable&quot; in the sense that every other speaker of English uses it, however, does make sense.  So, you have the Tugela view, where Rytan is a moron who is spouting off near non-sequiturs (but true ones!), and the &quot;everyone else&quot; view, where Rytan is a misinformed person, though perhaps a well-meaning one.  Which one of those is more offensive to Rytan again? <br />
<br />
Since understanding words by examining their context is beyond your ken, I would like to direct you to some tools that other speakers of English use to understand unfamiliar words.  These tools would are called thesauruses and dictionaries.  Let's start with your new friend, Mr. Thesaurus, who lives at http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/thesaurus.  What does the thesaurus say about &quot;noticeable&quot;?<br />
<br />
Entry Word: noticeable<br />
Function: adjective<br />
Text: attracting or compelling notice or attention &lt;they both showed a noticeable aversion to his company&gt; <br />
Synonyms arresting, arrestive, conspicuous, eye-catching, marked, outstanding, pointed, prominent, remarkable, salient, sensational, signal, striking<br />
Related Word notable, noteworthy; evident, manifest, obvious, palpable, patent; spectacular <br />
Contrasted Words obscure, vague; concealed, hidden, shrouded; insignificant, undistinguished<br />
Antonyms unnoticeable<br />
<br />
You do know what &quot;synonym&quot; means, right?  OK, so we have learned from our friend the thesaurus that Rytan's sentence means that a 75 point increase in strength results in a &quot;prominent&quot;, &quot;striking&quot;, or &quot;conspicuous&quot; DPS increase.  Is this in accord with the facts?  No.<br />
<br />
OK, now that we have mastered the thesaurus, let's turn to Mr. Thesaurus' close cousin, Ms. Dictionary, who lives here http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&amp;va=noticeable&amp;x=14&amp;y=20.  This is what she says about &quot;noticeable&quot;:<br />
Main Entry: noticeable <br />
Pronunciation: 'nO-t&amp;-s&amp;-b&amp;l<br />
Function: adjective<br />
1 : worthy of notice<br />
2 : capable of being noticed<br />
- noticeably  /-blE/ adverb<br />
<br />
The Tugela meaning of the word clearly flunks #1, but at least #2 gives you some hope, if you could shoehorn the definition into &quot;capable of being noticed by close parsing&quot; in the context of the statement.  However, as we've seen above, that makes no sense in the context Rytan used the word.  Moreover, I am sad to report that Ms. Dictionary has some more news for you, and it isn't very good for your cause, because she lists some synonyms too :( <br />
<br />
synonyms NOTICEABLE, REMARKABLE, PROMINENT, OUTSTANDING, CONSPICUOUS, SALIENT, STRIKING<br />
<br />
So, anyone with an adequate command of the English language would know what Rytan meant.  Good try though.  I also liked the part where you made up someone else using the word &quot;noticeable&quot; when referring to a &quot;few hundred hit points on our heals&quot; and used this to prove that the made-up poster is using &quot;noticeable&quot; in the same way Rytan is.  OMG double standard !!!111!!  Once again, however, you miss the mark.  I would hope that even an avatar-bot like you would know that a &quot;few hundred hit points on our heals&quot; would equate to an increase in our base healing by 20% or more.  So, your alleged inconsistency would only be present if a 75 point increase in strength made a comparable increase in DPS.  PROTIP: it doesn't.  Nice try though.<br />
<br />
This is almost as good as your &quot;shamans do huge dps because I get aggro sometimes when I use poison dots&quot; argument, followed by a steadfast refusal to recognize that poison counters have aggro.  Keep trying, and I am sure you could make another series of posts that funny again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">I am sure there is a primary flaw in their testing procedures. They are taking a Level 1 guy with a hundread str and parsing him With a focus and Then adding avatar onto it. Yeah that will have a dramatic impact on dps. soley through the spells cast. I mean that is how much strength added. +75 str + 140 Str. (Focus and avatar) will increase Newbies str from his base 75 to a capped 255.  Heck if you Betabuffed to 65 then would have a cap of 280.  Then add the +140 Attk. That will swing attack by like 400 points. (With Class bonuses.) That is probably how they are testing it. And seeing a Huge increase in the numbers means shaman are fine. Much better off than Beastlords or Rangers.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anybody that has seen the aa selections on the beta buffs (and just plan stupid things like lack of haste items on melee) should relieze there are some serious flaws in their testing systems. Someone put these characters together and some like the shaman have probably 50 aa's spent on crap that someone that actually knows the class probably wouldn't buy until they were quite high in the aa's. <br />
<br />
The gear on the characters was probably too generous as a baseline of the average player with all the damn augs especially, but mostly understandable. The AA placement shows a lot about what the testing people think of how to play the class and in a lot of cases its scary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, you are incorrect.  <br />
<br />
Premise:  Rytan says &quot;you all know what stat buffs do, so I won't bore you with a recap&quot;<br />
<br />
Your Conclusion:  Rytan knows exactly what stats do.  <br />
<br />
Equally valid Conclusion:  Rytan doesn't have a freaking clue about stat buffs...he just think he does.<br />
<br />
...but that doesnt stop supposedly intelligent people from insisting that he doesnt, in spite of the fact that there is no evidence at all to indicate that is the case.<br />
<br />
Nice condescending attack there btw- &quot;if you think Rytan doesn't understand stats you can't be intellegent.&quot;   Your arrogance speaks volumes.<br />
<br />
There is plenty of evidence...here's just some I remember from this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21804&amp;mode=linear&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=1).  I consider him clueless about shaman spells in general, not just stat buffs:<br />
<br />
3. I did my best to convince Ryan that stat buffs were marginally effective at best, but he wasn't convinced. On a positive, we are going to gain the ability to buff OVER the cap limit. Say a warrior is capped at the new limit of 330. Our 70+ (or whatever) sta buff will raise him to 400+. I did point out the stat returns are increasingly minimal after a certain level, but Ryan insisted that it would help.<br />
<br />
5. Crit affliction causing aggro - All the devs agreed that poison did a freaky, unintended amount of aggro. Ryan said he had heard that crit affliction was doing untoward aggro and had run some testing on his own that didn't show that it was. So, all of you number crunchers out there, we need some documented evidence that we are getting weird aggro on critical affliction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shrinkable bear form - Ryan was surprised that bear form doesn't get super tiny.<br />
<br />
8. Doing things faster in order to better adapt to a fast paced world. Ryan seems to think that the faster slow solved this issue, no amount of pleading on my part could budge him. When I said that we spent more than half the fight malosing and slowing, he said that slow was a huge effect, even if it only lasted the last 10 seconds of a 30 second fight. I really really tried on this one.<br />
<br />
Feel free to quibble about some of these being opinions, if you want to claim that Critical Affliction is NOT causing untoward aggro, and that slow IS a huge effect on the last 1/3rd of the fight, or that stat buffs DO help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taking the waiter example another step...if the complaint is the restaurant doesn't sell steak but you really think they should - that may be the situation here.  It's not the waiters decision what they sell - they may discuss what happens with management, and if it's a senior waiter, their suggestions may be seriously considered.  But the waiter doesn't make the decisions.  And the waiter is not going to tell the customer &quot;I agree completely, I don't know what the *#$% management is thinking.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Management is responsible - if you are angry, that's where you need to go to get things changed.<br />
<br />
Note:  if relations had been great in the past and Rytan took over the job and things went downhill, that would be one thing...but I've seen this board (and others) complaining about EQ for a couple years now...it didn't just start when Rytan took the job.</div></div><hr />

This is a 3rd party discussion, it was Glori's recollection of a conversation after the event, so its not proper to use it as evidence. We dont have Rytans real words here. We have no idea if they were talking about the exact same thing, or when they were talking about different aspects, or in what context.<br />
<br />
5. Crit affliction causing aggro - All the devs agreed that poison did a freaky, unintended amount of aggro.

. <br />
<br />
There are a few points here. First &quot;all the devs&quot; (since Rytan is a dev, he does as well) agreed that poison causes a lot of agro. However, poison agro is not the same thing as crit affliction agro. He said he did testing that showed crits didnt do something unexpected. Remember that this is a separate issue from poison agro, allthough both have been compiled in the same paragraph, confusing people. The problem here is the question: Is what you think as &quot;unexpected&quot; different from what they think is &quot;unexpected&quot;, given that you dont know how the system works and they do? I think this reflects a lack of knowledge on the players part about how a certain part of the game works more than anything else. Whether it should work that way or not is another question but Rytan's response is technically correct. As to testing to characterize crit agro, it was in fact done on the crucible: here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=22200&amp;highlight=crit+affliction) . In that thread it was shown in a crude sort of way that DoT ticks cause a corresponding amount of agro based on the damage done, crit included. While this might be unexpected to players, it is probably a consequence of how DoTs are coded, so not necessarily unexpected to the folk at Sony. <br />
<br />
Shrinkable bear form - Ryan was surprised that bear form doesn't get super tiny. <br />
<br />
So? It's a bug. Report it and they'll get around to it depending on priorities.<br />
<br />
8. Doing things faster in order to better adapt to a fast paced world. Ryan seems to think that the faster slow solved this issue, no amount of pleading on my part could budge him.

I really really tried on this one.<br />
<br />
Well, Nihil does largely solve the issue associated with malos/turgurs in fast fights. It has a resist adjust and is fast casting. Likewise, slow does have a huge effect on a fight, both from a mana point of view and survivability (if the fight isnt so trivial that its not an issue). I tank mobs all the time, and trust me, the folks who think stuff doesnt need to be slowed need to get a clue sometime. And if you are main healing as a shaman you are sure as hell going to want that sucker slowed as fast as it can be and with the best slow available. People have just been screaming about the possibility of losing 20-25% mana efficiency on old focusses, but preserving 20-25% mana by virtue of slow is insignificant??? In any case what exactly is being asked of him here? Its basically complaining about the length of the fights, something he has no control over, and, as it happens, Nihil was a good solution to that, plus it can be used in other contexts as well.<br />
<br />
Feel free to quibble about some of these being opinions, if you want to claim that Critical Affliction is NOT causing untoward aggro, and that slow IS a huge effect on the last 1/3rd of the fight, or that stat buffs DO help.<br />

Again, I haven't gotten an org chart from SoE or anything, but that's the impression I've gotten from my conversations with the developers.  I'd be curious to know where Tugela is pulling his info.  I wouldn't mind seeing a little back-up to some of his claims.<br />

We dont have Rytans real words here. We have no idea if they were talking about the exact same thing, or when they were talking about different aspects, or in what context.<br />
<br />
<br />
My recollection of what was said was nearly word for word, that's the way the conversation happened, in the order it was said. I have a GREAT memory, especially about things which are interesting to me. When I got back to the hotel after the ball game, I took notes while it was fresh in my mind. I posted the summit thread while reading my notes. Thanks for the lack of confidence you jackass. ****, I'm pissed.<br />
<br />
Here it is again for clarity. <br />
<br />
1. We will be getting an improved Cripple with OoW which should really do something, especially on raid targets <br />
<br />
Repeated exactly - this is happening, just like he said.<br />
<br />
2. Ryan is very interested in something he calls a &quot;chain lightning&quot; effect. Spells would bounce from target to target. If you healed a person in your raid, the heal spell would travel to any people close by. Shaman might also have this ability to debuff. Ryan called it an infection which would spread from mob to mob. I did bring up concerns about stackability, so hopefully he will take that into consideration. <br />
<br />
Repeated exactly - still thought this was a great idea and disappointed that it didn't happen.<br />
<br />
3. I did my best to convince Ryan that stat buffs were marginally effective at best, but he wasn't convinced. On a positive, we are going to gain the ability to buff OVER the cap limit. Say a warrior is capped at the new limit of 330. Our 70+ (or whatever) sta buff will raise him to 400+. I did point out the stat returns are increasingly minimal after a certain level, but Ryan insisted that it would help. <br />
<br />
Repeated exactly - I brought up stat buffs being stupid, he said they weren't. This is happening, which part of this didn't I get right? The EXACT context was - I said stat buffs are pretty meaningless - citing the fact that few people in my guild want agi/sta or stackable str/dex on focus. Then Rytan said something about if the people are capped that our buffs would allow stats to go OVER the cap. And I said, if statistics have diminishing returns post 300, what good would they do if they went up to 400? I cited stamina as an example of 3 hitpoints per sta becoming 1 hitpoint per sta, how much hitpoints would we get for sta over 400? He said it would make a difference.<br />
<br />
4. I talked about cannabalize and passive mana regen, but I don't think we're going to be getting any sort of passive mana regen. Ryan was agreeable to the idea of a cannabilize that would match the percentage that can 5 USED to do, back when players had mana pools of 3K instead of 6K. Ryan had concern that we would mem the new spell with can 4 and alternate them. I tried to give him the innocent look, but he wasn't buying it. He is looking into the spell timers so the two spells could not be used concurrently. <br />
<br />
Repeated exactly.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Crit affliction causing aggro - All the devs agreed that poison did a freaky, unintended amount of aggro. Ryan said he had heard that crit affliction was doing untoward aggro and had run some testing on his own that didn't show that it was. So, all of you number crunchers out there, we need some documented evidence that we are getting weird aggro on critical affliction. <br />
<br />
Repeated exactly.<br />
<br />
6. Shrinkable bear form - Ryan was surprised that bear form doesn't get super tiny. When we were talking about spells to get excited about, I mentioned that bear form was the big spell for me in Velious. I told him that we were definitely looking for something with a big cool factor for OoW. <br />
<br />
This conversation started because I was telling him I wanted a spell to get excited about. I mentioned bear form since I was so excited to get this spell in Velious, paying huge plat at the time. He said he would consider an upgraded bear form, then I pointed out that some raids wouldn't let you use the form due to size.<br />
<br />
7. We are not getting a pet bixie  We are also not getting winged courier   <br />
<br />
Just joking around with him.<br />
<br />
8. Doing things faster in order to better adapt to a fast paced world. Ryan seems to think that the faster slow solved this issue, no amount of pleading on my part could budge him. When I said that we spent more than half the fight malosing and slowing, he said that slow was a huge effect, even if it only lasted the last 10 seconds of a 30 second fight. I really really tried on this one. <br />
<br />

No one is questioning Glori's integrity Faern. The point was that it was Glori's recollection and not a verbatim statement of fact from Rytan. The statement I made was:<br />
<br />
This is a 3rd party discussion, it was Glori's recollection of a conversation after the event, so its not proper to use it as evidence. We dont have Rytans real words here. We have no idea if they were talking about the exact same thing, or when they were talking about different aspects, or in what context.<br />
<br />
And that is exactly accurate. How is this questioning Glori's integrity? That she chooses to be offended because this was pointed out does not mean that her integrity was questioned. She has no reason to be offended and I was not attempting to offend her. The subject under discussion was how her comments were being used by other people and whether it was proper to do so in the context of the discussion. That is an element of debate.<br />
<br />
And speaking of integrity Faern, people here routinely question my integrity, and worse, when they have no reason whatsoever to do so, yet you are strangely silent, as is virtually everyone else here. Now why is that? You dont need to agree with my opinions, and I dont expect you to, yet when I am openly insulted, vilified and personally attacked you say nothing, and just look the other way.<br />

That is what my contribution to this thread is all about. Respect. Respect to other people in a debate, even if they dont share your opinions. Even if they are wrong. Respect to Rytan even if you dont agree with his opinion, or vision. I don't see an aweful lot of it here Faern, and I dont see you saying anything about it either.

This was Rytan's post concerning Gloriana's report of their conversation from the summit.  <br />
<br />
Glori you must be a saint.  You bust your ass for this community (Shaman) and the larger game community rendering valuable service to SOE for nothing and this asshat has the nerve to say that you misrepresented him.  It was bad enough that you took a bunch of cheap shots over the free trip but you then had to endure the insult of having this twerp say you misrepresented him.  And you still have the grace to say that you think that a thread calling for his removal as the &quot;Spell Guy&quot; is STUPID.<br />
<br />

How many mana has the cleric saved in these two scenarios?  What sort of impact do you see?   After all, the difference between 4k and 6k is the latter tank was healed 50% more!  Wow, that seems like a big number!<br />
<br />
And yet, in this all-too-common scenario, the difference is meaningless.  And everyone here knows it.  <br />
<br />
For what it's worth, I don't like the concept of this thread.  Shaman are not that busted that heads need to roll.  Better fill-in healing ability, faster dps, and better utility spells (these have really been neglected) would do a lot.  <br />
<br />
The current definition of shaman is the real problem, I don't like the narrowness of their vision as articulated in their modified class description.  I have no confidence in the current design team, but we're no worse off than a number of other classes.</div></div><hr />

I am offended because I went to the summit to report back what I heard, I went with the intention to bring back as much as possible. I took careful notes, I paid attention to conversations. I reported with as much detail as possible.<br />
<br />
I'm offended because you are implying that I don't remember the conversation and didn't report it exactly. I was talking to THE spell guy, about SHAMAN issues. You can be damn sure that I hung on his every word. I went straight back to the hotel and wrote everything down, because I knew it was IMPORTANT.<br />
<br />
I am sorry he feels he was mispresented. I think it's because in my original write-up, I didn't make it clear that I wasn't angry with him. I liked him, I liked some of his ideas (especially the chain lightning heals). I really didn't expect him to agree with me on everything. There was a lot of angst over that part of the write-up, which I might have mitigated by focusing on areas that we agreed on.<br />
<br />
The facts still remain - I stated stat buffs are meaningless and shaman have less of a role in quick fights - both statements Rytan disagreed with. I didn't misrepresent that at all.<br />
<br />
Calling for his resignation is just dumb. I'm having a hard time coming up with fresh, exciting shaman spells which give us value without unbalancing us, or our relation to other classes. It's obvious they are listening, they've made changes. They ditched our lousy str/dex single buffs in POP, they ditched our lousy disease dot in GoD, we got a fast casting slow, we're getting crit HOTs, we're getting a group heal, a group avatar, an exp-free rez, it doesn't look like OoW AA are going to be ungodly expensive, they are scaling back their plans to have some focus effects stop at 65 - I'm pretty happy.</div></div><hr />

The fact that you are applying a concept used to determine admissibility in court here is just the first level of idiocy.  The second is that you have not even applied it correctly.  In the legal analogue to this discussion, a civil suit captioned &quot;Crucible vs Rytan&quot;, Glori would be allowed to testify as to Rytan's comments, because Rytan is a party to the case, and &quot;admissions of a party opponent&quot; are NOT considered hearsay (and if her memory was unsure, you could admit the notes she took).  You can probably find federal rule of evidence 801 on the internet somewhere, which will explain all this to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u136"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p136">It's obvious they are listening, they've made changes. They ditched our lousy str/dex single buffs in POP, they ditched our lousy disease dot in GoD, we got a fast casting slow, we're getting crit HOTs, we're getting a group heal, a group avatar, an exp-free rez, it doesn't look like OoW AA are going to be ungodly expensive, they are scaling back their plans to have some focus effects stop at 65 - I'm pretty happy.<br />
<br />
They are listening, but to the wrong things. Things that don't have enough impact on the most critical Shaman issues(we get a new disease DoT with Omens btw, so tell me they learned). <br />
If I was really hungry and went to the restaurant, and I'd ask for a steak and a salad, and the waiter only brought me the salad, would I be happy?<br />
I know the analogy sucks, but it's what's been happening. We only get the things we ask for, when their impact is minor(hi, fixed invis).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">2. Ryan is very interested in something he calls a &quot;chain lightning&quot; effect. Spells would bounce from target to target. If you healed a person in your raid, the heal spell would travel to any people close by. Shaman might also have this ability to debuff. Ryan called it an infection which would spread from mob to mob. I did bring up concerns about stackability, so hopefully he will take that into consideration. <br />
<br />
<br />
I've had a LOT of coffee this morning, so:<br />
<br />
/derail<br />
<br />
Anyone play Wizardry 8? There was a great spell called fireball that, when cast, would create a fireball (d'uh) that travelled from the caster to the target and explode, damaging everyone close to it....<br />
<br />
and in Morrowind, when you were beating on a mob and its health was going down wounds started to appear on it until, when it died, it looked pretty nasty.....<br />
<br />
so, wouldn't it be great if we got a new nuke in our fire line (ahem) that hit a mob with a fireball and blew body parts all over and anyone around it would be stunned by the carnage and just stand around thinking &quot;dayum, look what happened to Ernie&quot; and all their resists would be lowered because they were all sick to their stomachs....<br />
<br />
now THAT, my friends, is a spell worth leaving spell effects on for....<br />
<br />
....and wouldn't it be great if we could make potions like stink bombs with delay fuses that you could drop while you were running from a train and they would detonate when the mobs got close and cause them to scatter in all directions, kind of like a AoE blind spell, and make them forget all about you....<br />
<br />
what?......oh, gotta go, time for my medicine.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u138"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p138">I forget why I even read Tugelas posts at all, then I remember hes not an actual shaman and that his only reason for posting on this board is to claim shaman are the uberest class ever concieved in any game in the entire history of gaming and could solo their way into potime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">Tugela - not cool. Questioning somebody's integrity is way not cool.  Especially Glori who has proven herself an addition to the class.<br />
<br />
(And that is an understatement of praise)<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think Tugela was questioning anyone's integrity.  <br />
<br />
The fact is, if 2 people have a discussion and they don't write down what was said and agree what was written was indeed what was said, there is a good chance for an accidental misstatement.  The problem could come from something as simple as misunderstanding a key word, forgetting a phrase, having a different meaning for the same word (ex:  gay = happy or gay = sexual preference), etc.  <br />
<br />
I know...I've been in development for over 10 years and I've attended hundreds of design meetings.  I can't count the number of times we've all agreed to a design in a meeting, after the meeting someone wrote down what they thought we agreed to on paper, then someone read the write-up and we realized there were key differences in what the attendees thought was decided.  This happens all the time, everywhere.<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with anyone's integrity or competence...this is just a fact of a problem with verbal communication.<br />
<br />
Lighten up people!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">I'm having a hard time coming up with fresh, exciting shaman spells which give us value without unbalancing us, or our relation to other classes. <br />
<br />
Maybe time to take 10 minutes to look at the WoW spell lists for Warlocks and then look at the curses they have.<br />
Plenty of perfect idea's there (and amazingly enough............plenty of ideas I remember from discussions here on this same board)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">I agree with Glori that Rytan might have missunderstood her emotional status when doing her write up because he just assumed she was going to be as upset as the rest of the shaman community has been acting.  The biggest problem with posting on Message Boards is that text doesnt convey emotion unless you use tons of emotes.<br />
<br />
Take the same phrase said in two difference scenarios:<br />
<br />
&quot;That F'ing Mother F'er I can't believe he pulled this S!&quot;<br />
<br />
*Spitting froth and face red with anger that someone stole your idea* <br />
or<br />
*Laughing at a friend that threw out all your condoms and instead put a bag of rubberbands*<br />
<br />
The only way you can know the difference is if you were there.... Glori was there I think she has a pretty darn good idea of Rytan's emotional status when he was telling us that buffs are useless.<br />
<br />
Ask a necro if they are overpowered solers and get:<br />
&quot;Nope&quot;<br />
<br />
*Stone faced answer from someone that really doesnt have a clue*<br />
or<br />
*Says it like he got his hand caught in the cookie jar*<br />
<br />
You'll only know if you are there and Glori was.</div></div><hr />
