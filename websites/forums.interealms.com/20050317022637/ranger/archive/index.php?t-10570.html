<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">faB</div><div class="date">09-29-2002, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is somewhat outdated, if only the RunnyEye section.. I used to solo my halfling warrior there and get some Blackened Alloy for newbies in Rivervale ( I used my Squad Ring for full healing on trips back to Rivervale), she is a 38 Warrior.<br />
<br />
Well since RunnyEye was revamped it's a hell of a lot tougher.. even the damn green goblins keep attacking me and they take time to fall..<br />
<br />
Better keep your Endure Fire at all times :p  And maybe use a 2H if you have because nearly all goblins receive a Fire Damage Shield from their casters at one point or another.<br />
<br />
PS: while I was off EQ I noticed they added a Focus Effect to the Blackened Alloy Medallion, saves about 10 percent mana on each cast I think, which makes it probably a valuable item to camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Finduilas</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This guide is extremely out of date.<br />
<br />
1. Which zone is paw? If it refers to Lair of the Split Paw, which is in SK then the guide is wrong. Paw is an indoor zone, SoW will not work, nor will regular camo. wouldn't start fighting here until mid 30's. Need to give the full zone name, it is a noob guide afterall.<br />
<br />
2.  Cazic Thule. Hehe. Just try going here at level 30. Everything on track will be red, and will stay that way right up to level 50. Since it was revamped it is the equivilent of a Plane.<br />
<br />
3.  You should add Paludal caverns. Bandits or Plargs. The plargs are tricky cos of adds and you need to mem cure disease. For the bandits mem harmony and single pull. I went from 17-25 here quickly. Except towards the end 1 kill would equal 1 blue bub exp.<br />
<br />
4. At 25 go to Everfrost. Using track and snare and panic animal you can fear kite wooly mammoths. Exp right through to mid 30's if you want. Also good for loot since you can sell the tusks for 8-10 pp each.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Finduilas</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cannot harmony<br />
<br />
hehe, ofcourse, forgot about that, been a long time since I fought there.<br />
<br />
But there are a few bandits on the fringes that are easy pulls.  And the plargs are ok if you have cure desease.</div></div><hr />

<br />
25-35 Stonebrunt (all animals)<br />
30-40 Great Divide (drakkel dire wolves)<br />
30-45 Eastern Wastes (all animals)<br />
35-45 Dawnshroud Peaks (zelniaks and wolves)<br />
45-55 Jaggedpine (all animals)</div></div><hr />

That was the first time i went there, after revamp and NOTHING was blue on track.  Lowest mob was even to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astroshak</div><div class="date">10-04-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would anyone want to fight the Phlargs in PC?<br />
<br />
The Shiknar are much easier to get singles from (they're spaced far enough that you have to work at it to pull more than one), they give the same xp, and they don't have that annoying disease dot!</div></div><hr />
