<br />
How about something like what we have now for the logo but have the 1.5/2.0  crossing it? kinda show teh epic in  &quot;X&quot; format and  go from there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah - I just hate the way the epic 1.5 looks! <br />
<br />
I thought about commissioning a new logo from Saraquael the amazing EQ artist who has designed 2 signatures for me.<br />
<br />
How about a shaman weilding the epic 1.5 and it's snarling and almost alive looking?<br />
<br />
I was thinking about this picture he did of an enchanter 1.0 epic -<br />
<br />

<br />
You know - kind of like our epic is alive or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the Kunark epic looks like crap.  That spear is not a one handed melee weapon.<br />
<br />
I think the 1.5 epic looks like crap.  Actually all of them look like crap except for the cleric epic.<br />
<br />
TA looks ok as a weapon in appearance in comparison to whatever else is out there.  It's still not in any way usable in it's actual size as a one handed weapon, but whatever.<br />
<br />
If any weapon is going to be used as a symbol of our class, I think the Kunark weapon should be the one used.  Why?  Because we are still being balanced around a Kunark era spell.  Only seems fitting that a Kunark weapon should be our symbol.</div></div><hr />

WTH?<br />
<br />
I say we have the might of the Vah Shir depiected somehow.... after all, we are the only ones who have no gods in which we bow to.  We need no god to guide us, for we have the history of our ancestors to learn from, and we use knowledge to guide us and choose our path, as opposed to the rest of y'all that rely on a crutch of a god to save you. Ha! <br />
<br />
(if anyone actually thinks I'm serious about depicting the might of the vah Shir for a crucible logo, you should be shot, the above is in jest.. if it wasnt obvious..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I still miss the old tiki mask.  <br />
<br />
The TA says &quot;shaman&quot; more than the cathead-on-a-stick, and it is on fire, which makes it just that much better.<br />
<br />
I don't mind keeping &quot;got slow&quot;, but it kinda has a dated 90's marketing feel.  What about &quot;We got more voodoo than you do&quot;? :p</div></div><hr />

I would picture a Long bear skin rug in front of a fire. The epics arrayed in a weapon rack near the flame, Mutt curled up on the other side. <br />

<br />
The Shaman's Crucible.<br />
<br />
Welcome home, Heyokah<br />

Oh also I would have the tiki mask hanging on the wall behind the epics.<br />

Heck, for the weapons - not just epic 1.0, 1.5 and TA, but it would be funny to have the good ole splintered club, screaming mace - ha!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Works for me.</div></div><hr />

Maybe we could let people vote on what weapons would be included on the weapon rack? Have a choice of 10 and the top 5 go in the picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">5 is pretty cluttered.  I think plain spear (jade prod obv, shm only version), epic, TA is good, with 1.5 maybe hanging beside them.</div></div><hr />

but i had an idea as well might be intresting ... maybe have like a Gun rack type of graphic with all the epics resting above each other parallel....<br />
<br />
heh i just got done watching Kill bill vol 1 and when she goes up stairs to see the swords .... they are all on that parallel type racks.... that might be cool for the epics.  .... plus then it wouldnt be odd for the 1.5 to be viewed from the side cause they would all be on the side...<br />

The thing that should be brought to attention is the room not the individual peices. When you are coming home you love the &quot;feel&quot; of the place. Not the weapon rack on the side or any of the other parts. But the entirety of it. The feeling of home.<br />

Heh it is funny, Last night I got a comment in WoW about how for a gnome I seem so much taller and commanding. Well one of my group members pipes up that I used to be a barbarian shaman in EQ.
