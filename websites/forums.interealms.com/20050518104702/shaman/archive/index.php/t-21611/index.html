<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The new expansion is just the other stuff that they didn't include in GOD.  So if he has any point, it is that they shipped out a very broken expansion and charged those that purchased it money.  Now they are releasing a bug fix expansion (with level 70!) to con us into buying more products for bug fixes.  It's basically a sneaky, con-artist type move to release only one expansion, but make twice the money.<br />

PS.  I have a funny borrowed picture that I edited, but it won't let me attach it...If anyone has any ideas?  This is what I get when I try: <br />

Warning: filesize(): Stat failed for C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\phpDA.tmp (errno=2 - No such file or directory) in D:\forums\shaman\includes\functions_newpost.php on line 791<br />

If anyone knows, a PM would be helpful :)</div></div><hr />

I is sounding like the filesize was too large to attach or whatever you tries to do.  Post it somewhere else and then just link it I'd say.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Smedley got the picture after 15 pages on Woody's board and some well thought out responses. In addition to a whole bunch of pissed off folks over some censorship and banning of people addressing concerns.<br />

Hello Norrath! <br />
<br />
I wanted to announce that we've decided to push Omens of War back to Late August in order to give the EQ team time to respond to important issues that the EverQuest community is raising (specifically including the issues with Gates of Discord). We've heard some concerns from within the community that we feel are important enough to push back our next expansion and spend time fixing the problems you have brought to our attention. At the end of the day, we work for you and it's important for us to demonstrate that we both understand and appreciate that. We're also inviting many members of the community to join us here at SOE for a day to have a direct dialog with the development team about issues that are important to the EverQuest community as a whole. We've already sent out the invitations and are making all the arrangements. In addition, our EQ community managers will be coming up with a list of issues raised on the message boards so that we can come back to you with a specific list of things we're going to address. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry if you feel we haven't been listening and reacting appropriately. We do our best to balance all of the needs and concerns you raise along with expanding Norrath and giving you new and wonderful things to do in EverQuest, but we do make mistakes. We've heard you loud and clear. <br />
<br />
We have many things planned for EverQuest over the upcoming years, and our goal is to keep you happily playing EverQuest for a long time to come. The best way for us to do that is by first and foremost is by listening to you. <br />
