<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm wondering if there are any encounters in game that make getting Radiant Cure 2 or 3 worth getting. So far I've only seen a couple of encounters that make Radiant Cure 1 worthwhile (Grummus being the main one). But it seems the higher levels of Radiant Cure don't cure enough to counters to cure anything beyond what Radiant Cure 1 cures.<br />
<br />
Also, why does Paladins Crusader's Touch (a spell, not an AA skill mind you) cure 20 disease and poison counters, while Radiant Cure 3 only cures 16? Seems a bit silly when they don't have to spend any AA on their cure all skill. Granted ours cures more curse counters, but I normally use greater remove curse for curses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wolfdale01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Grummus is a Tier 1 mob.  Maybe as you progress into the Elemental planes, perhaps you'll find more uses for RC 2 and 3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes but my point is that the higher levels of radiant cure don't seem to cure enough to be any good. Do you know of any mob that they are useful on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm highly considering RC2 so it'll have a better chance at dispelling negative buffs, sometimes RC1 works on some things, and then it doesn't hte next time they hit you (spells without counters, that the dispel part of RC takes off)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>atarak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">RC2 is nice, tends to be more reliable in most cases and nails a few things RC1 wouldn't. I've yet to find a reason to blow 6 more points on RC3 for less of a return on the investment though. Maybe once we get to time (fennin down, 3 to go!) it'll matter, time will tell I suppose (no pun intended).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I definately get a lot of use out of RC1.  I plan on investing in RC2 + 3 in the near future.<br />
<br />
I use RC whenever someone in an exp group is slowed, dotted, rooted, blinded.  Its fast, takes no mana, and requires no spell or inventory slot.<br />
<br />
In a raid situation, I used it on Grummus, on THO, on nearly ever NTOV encounter, on the dragon in PoI ... I use it a lot.  The greater chance of removing a negative effect that comes from levels 2+3 will make it worth the additional points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Athenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/BUMP I was wondering the same thing.  Also  I noticed that my radiant cure 1 wasn't getting rid of the grummus dot....was I just unlucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like radiant cure.  Call me silly, but having that at my fingertips has really been a big help.  Especially in places where we fight casting mobs like BoT.  It cures Malo off me or others, it cures snare.  It cures necro or druid DoTs.  That alone is worth getting it for.  But it also can cure or help to cure curses, poisons, and diseases.  It can remove most poisons and diseases including Pox of Bertoxxulous and VT poison proc.  <br />
<br />
This is just my own experience with the skill.  I find it handy and quite useful in a group.  In a group vs. caster mobs, I find it extremely useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I really really like RC1, for 2 points its a bargain.  having a hard time ratiolanize getting RC2 and 3 for the high points needed.  shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mediman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">rc2 is well worth it imo.  I play on a pvp server and anything that cures dots in pvp is uber.  Got your buffs screwed up and funeral pyre goes to last slot? no problem hit rc and good chance its gone.  Ive had it remove multiple dots, snares, and debuffs in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It also cures most blind spells which is always nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Definitely worth it the further you go into PoP. Some bosses have slows/dots with 30+ counters, so every bit helps.<br />
I would take a different view from Jing in relation to the pally spell crusaders touch. Personally I think its better NOT to have to use a spellslot like they do for a similar effect, plus we can augment RC if necessary with disinfecting aura (-10 poison/disease counter) or with abolich disease (-36 disease counter).<br />
Having said that, a Crusaders touch spell would be a good replacement for our special group str/dex buffs 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't question the usefulness of RC 1. I like RC 1. I was only curious as to the point of advancing beyond RC 1. I actually didn't consider the part of RC that cures detrimental spells like Malo and non disease/poison dots. I don't think Crusader's Touch does that (and Crusader's Touch is single target, while RC is group). <br />
<br />
The reason your Radiant Cure did not cure Grummus dot, is that it cures 1 of his dots, but not both. It cures his Plasma Decay, which has something like 4 minute recast. It does not cure his Stench of Decay, which has something like 30 or 40 second recast. Save your Radiant Cure for when he does Plasma Decay. Use Disinfecting Aura or Abolish Disease to cure Stench of Decay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Athenae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So Radiant Cure 1 will cure the 3 min recast dot with one cast?  Is the other dot he uses an AoE dot or a single target proc?  Also gryme uses that same dot right?  God I hate Gryme that fat bastard, has killed me more times than I would like to admit.....</div></div><hr />
