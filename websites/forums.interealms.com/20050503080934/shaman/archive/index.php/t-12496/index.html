We found her walking SW down the hill towards the sunken ship with zombies in it.  She will walk to the water and swim into the boat, get stuck then warp to the top of the hill to repeat the process.<br />

I love that all the zone geometry exploits are out of the game (thx lvled playing field) but I reeeeeeeeeeeeeally want my black fur boots =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Which server? I just completed this on the FV server...<br />
According to my logs, it took 1 hour and 56 minutes to complete the test. Seemed to take forever for Ooglyn to swim to the right spot. I was alone, so I didn't think to see if she was stuck somewhere. Maybe if you wait long enough, she'll get there?</div></div><hr />

Sat around underwater bored to tears for a few hours before noticing a post mentioning pathing problems with the ogre getting stuck in the sunken ship (seems she eventually despawned--or was killed by the 50'somethings that were hunting there for some reason).<br />
<br />
2nd go round I brought my monk down to give an assist. I did the turn in again, then had my monk tag Ooglyn and pull her past the sunken ship and FD'd (monk stayed down until Ooglyn despawned just to be safe). Ran the shammy out to the underwater spot and Ooglyn showed up in no time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I bet memblur would do the same thing.  It works on most quest mobs, like the guy in EW for the 8th shawl and the gnome in POI that spawns Xanamech.<br />
<br />
Just have anyone tag Ooglyn, run off, and memblur her to clear aggro.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, tag Ooglyn, run off and root her, then gate, port, or camp.  If you camped out and came back in quickly, I'll bet you could do this solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fleury Moistfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can we possibly sticky this thread and/or move it to the Quests section and sticky it there? I had no clue Ooglyn was broken until after another 1.5 hour wait under the sea I started browsing the boards and found this thread.<br />
<br />
I'd hate other people to waste their time if they did not know she was broken atm. Let's hope for a fix soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't matter which way you do the quest (each step, from beginning to end or doing envy, woe, marr's promise over and over to max faction) you will need the gem from the spirit in Erud's Crossing to get the Wandering Spirit to talk to you.<br />
Now that I think about it, I did the Test of Patience quest the night before patch, not after. If you need more info or whatever, send tell in game (usually get on around 12am central) or PM me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hehe, I plan to do my epic the regular way, no faction farming involved (but the faction you get normally). I'll try to contact you in game but I log on french hour around 8 pm generally, so I think our log in hours are completely opposed. Anyway, I'll try to be in touch with you id I can't manage to do this part of my epic. Once this will be done, the only hard thing will be to go in The Hole, but I have a lot of friends who want to go there for their epic, so it'll be easy to gather the force needed :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bumping this because Ive linked to it from the epic FAQ to help out those currently having problems.<br />
<br />
Who else is stuck at this point now and whats happening in your experience? Anyone else completed this while broken and how did you do it? Mem blur or FD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ok there is a new glitch on this quest, at least on Torvo server.<br />
<br />
I tried to do this quest on Friday afternoon my time (bout EST2am thursday) and this is what I found.<br />
<br />
When I reached the island in Erud's I found not one, but 2 to 3 Ooglyns cycling through from the spawn ppoint and walking to the sunken ship and respawning and just going through the cycle.<br />
<br />
I hailed one and passed her the gem as requested and got experience and true spirit faction. however, ooglyn just poofed immediately and no Ooglyn or spirits popped at the designated spot.<br />
<br />
Also the many Ooglyns continued thise cycle. I sent a bug report, petition as well as an email just now to SOE asking when they gonna fix this.<br />
<br />
So if you see more than 1 Ooglyn, DO NOT pass her the gem cause you won't be able to deviate her path from the sunken ship cause she poofs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aztkius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">After watching Ooglyn march down the beach for a couple hours a fellow shaman got the brilliant idea to have his 65th Level Bard friend charm Ooglyn and drag her out to neg 1600 pos 4200, break the charm, and then log out to remove the aggro.   Worked!!  Ooglyn stood there on the ocean floor after the Bard logged out for a couple minutes.  Then suddenly she tells you to wait right there (under the water at neg 1600 pos 4200) and she swims off.  A few minutes later the first of the 5 underwater spirits shows up.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd share a work around that really did the trick.  Good luck to all of you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aztkius, did the shammy give the gem to one of the many Ooglyns then charm and position her at the said spot or just dragged her without handing in the gem?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aztkius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We charmed and brought Ooglyn out to sea only after she had been given the gem.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I don't advocate either direction on doing the epic.  Whether you do it faction or the way it was designed is entirely up to you.  However, I think that the original design is the best, most entertaining quest I've been in on, during my three years in this game.  I enjoyed it all from doing Black Dire as a lowbie to the shivers that getting the temple item in CoM gave me (invised) to the triumphant killing of Neh and Rak on my 40th birthday (yeah, REAL old bear here).  And since I haven't used the epic in almost a year, my memories of that fun quest are all I cherish about it  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ooglyn is working properly on test as of Saturday the 19th, so hopefully she'll be fixed live soon. As this is a bug, I'd say pound those bug reports...sure work-arounds are great (a PITA, but sometimes necessary), but if we bug them enough perhaps it will be fixed shortly. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Yohimba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Still broke on Saryrn. :(  Hadn't heard about this but suspected something was up when I saw Ooglyn walking into the water (and poofing) as soon as I got there and there was no crazed shammy running after her.. That and ranger hubby had 2 Ooglyns on track!?  :confused:<br />
<br />
BUT was excited to try, so found the other Ooglyn, who was already stomping down to beach, but was able to hail and stop her, had the expected response, gave her gem, and she dissapeared.<br />
<br />
So no following or tricking her possible, even if I had known. But had heard no Ooglyn necessary, just go to loc. We did, and as it was test of patience, and all posts I'd read elsewhere said LONG TIME, I wated abt. 1.5... you know the rest. I noticed last patch said they fixed pathing problems... guess not this one.  :(<br />
<br />
Still, nice to know I hadn't done anything wrong.  :)<br />
<br />
Oh, another interesting thing, tracker hubby had 4 &quot;blanks&quot; on his tracking window, which he tried to find, but found they were outside zone... Maybe stuck spirits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>runawayq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Last Night (4-27-03) i hit level 39 and decided to start my Epic Quest. I did everything up to the part in Erud's Crossing. When i got there i noticed more than one Ooglyn walking around . I believe there was like 10 of them they were all stacked on eachother so it was hard to tell . I gave one the gem and like everyone else she disapeared when she got to the boat . I petitioned and after 2 hours of waiting i got no response .I camped and went to bed. Today at about 10 pm i got a resonse from a GM. I told her my problem and showed her what was going on and she said she would (repop) the zone. It did not help. She said she would foward the info to the bug department and that i would have to wait for next patch . I camped for a while and i noticed I got an email from a GM . He told me my missing item that i had given to Ooglyn had been replaced and sure enough when i logged on there it was .I logged back on and I had a buddy of mine come and try to knock her off the path. He cast on one of the Ooglyns and they all followed him . ... He gated . I ran to the loc in the guide and after about 5 mins all the Ogglyns showed up . I went thru the quest and finally got my arrow and Gem . The wierd thing was that more than one of each spirit spawned each time but the quest still worked . I believe if you cannot find some one to cast on Ooglyn you still have enough time to gate to qeynos docks .. translocate back to island to make it to Ooglyns location in the water .  I hope this helps anyone not wanting to wait for patch to get the Epic show on the road . Good Luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ok, need clarification here.<br />
<br />
Did you  give the gem to one of the many ooglyns? If so, did she disappear and you guys just pulled any of the roaming Ooglyns then camp/gate fd wutever?<br />
<br />
Or did you just not bother giving her the gem and just pull one of them off their bugged route and later go to spot?<br />
<br />
Clear descriptions helps tons.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>runawayq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I gave it to her the day before . I didnt bother giving her the gem again becuase i new she was stuck . He just hit and gated while i went and waited at location . Dont think it matters much cuz this patch should probably fix it . GL though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Nazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yeah i saw her standing where she was supposed to be, gave her the gem, got the faction and the XP for it and she started to swim out into the ocean and got stuck on the ship.  I waited for her and the loc where she was supposed to be and she never showed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ok I did it  yesterday.<br />
<br />
Through observation and feedback here from others, this is what I have deduced.<br />
<br />
When you hit the island and see that Ooglyn is in a warping rotation from her Spawn point then walking to the shipwreck and repopping to repeat her course, just tag her and swim her past the ship wreck. if you are worrried about not getting full True Spirit faction because you didn't pass her the gem, just pass it to her after you complete the test to get your faction hit.<br />
<br />
I just rooted her and logged out, relogged in and followed her to the designated location and the first of the spirits popped 10 mins after she left. Whole exercise took me  a total of 2 EB casts.<br />
<br />
If ooglyn isn't walking her route but is standing at her spawnn point, then give her your gem and tag her past the shipwreck.<br />
<br />
When you see an ooglyn or many ooglyns walking the route, that means someone else had passed her the gem but didn't know about tagging her past the bugged point of the shipwreck and there is no need to hand in the gem to her to get the spirits to spawn.<br />
<br />
Why do this? because just incase the spirits do not spawn, you can then pass her your gem and tag her past.<br />
<br />
If you have been waiting more than 30 mins (20 should be more like it) then the spirits will not pop. I noticed the time between each spirit is about 12 to 15 mins and the first is about 10 mins after ooglyn leaves.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Lill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yep, I did this the other day too.  Simple version:<br />
1.  Hand in your item.<br />
2.  If the walking Ooglyn starts looping, Malosini her and run out past the sunken boat a bit.  <br />
3.  Root her. <br />
4.  Camp out and come right back.  <br />
She'll then go to the meeting place.<br />
<br />
She's not MR, can tag her with anything and probably root her without Maloing first.  Green to me at 56.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Root + camp = ghetto mem-blur ;)<br />
<br />
Allakhazam's says Ooglyn (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=10409) is level 45, so younger shamans would need help doing this work-around for the pathing bug. Older shamans should have no trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Please /feedback this issue.  The shaman board is ignored too much for it to be seen here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Hamman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yep, the root/log works just fine, I did it last weekend and took less than 50 min I believe.  After went and killed the Black Dire with an enchanter and druid.  Everything went fine and I have my boots :)<br />
Now working on my report pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">OK, finished the test of patience today, still broken. Here's what I did, with a time line:<br />
<br />
When I arrived at Ooglyn, she was standing there and two more were walking down to the water. Each one swam to the boat, bumped her head on the side, slid down, and disappeared; either poofed or inside the hull. Shortly another one would start walking. I buffed myself, including sow, levitate, and enduring breath. Then, since I'm only level 50, and she hits pretty hard, I cast malosi on her first, then togor's insects. I ran around the end of the boat and made sure she followed me around, then I dived into the water and waited for her to catch up. I'm sure the rest of you already knew this, but spells don't seem to take when the caster is out of the water and the castee is in the water. She whacked me once, then I rooted her and backed up. I camped and logged back in, and she was still there. When root wore off, she started swimming towards the waiting area, and I followed. I kept invis to animals up all the time, but only saw two sharks during the 45 minute wait, which conned green to me, so I can't say this will hide you from the killer sharks.<br />
<br />
 9:42 - Pulled Ooglyn around boat, camped, logged back in<br />
 9:46 - Ooglyn and I arrive at waiting area<br />
 9:48 - Ooglyn tells me to wait here, she leaves<br />
 9:51 - Strafen the soaked appears, we chat<br />
 9:55 - Dillon the drowned appears, we chat<br />
10:03 - Strafen and Dillon leave<br />
10:06 - Froham the forgotten appears, not very chatty<br />
10:11 - Froham leaves, invites me to follow him<br />
10:14 - Abe the abandoned appears, we chat<br />
10:20 - Abe tells me about arrow, then gives it to me when I say the phrase<br />
10:24 - Abe leaves, invites me to follow him<br />
10:27 - Greater spirit appears, we chat, he gives me gem<br />
<br />
I went back to Ooglyn's place after the test was over. She was there, and there were no more walking Ooglyns. So completing the test of patience apparently resets all the walkers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Rafeeky, I sent in a bug report as well as spoke to a Guide about this two weeks ago.<br />
<br />
I am sure many other shamans have done the same. So far we have had ZERO acknowledgement from SOE on this.<br />
<br />
I really pity those shamans who do not read boards etc and must be wondering what they are doing wrong.<br />
<br />
Still seething about the change in city for trolls. Was so poorly done and till today, I have no idea where to get lvl 34 to 49 shaman spells and get many tells from low lvl troll shamans asking for help on this. So sad I have to tell them to ask their friendly leezard to buy spells for them from Cabalis grrrr<br />
<br />
Just shows the total lack of thought process in implementing changes etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Hanana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I took a chance and after losing my gem the first time to the bugged Ooglyn, went back to Brondl in NFP ....said &quot;you can buy booze&quot;...then followed him to the inn where i talked to the spirits to get the Opaque gem again.  With my SK friend who had been helping me, we tried again. I hailed a bugged verson of Ooglyn and she stopped to talk to me. I handed her the gem and promptly had the SK attack her then run toward the LOC neg 1600 by pos 4200, keeping her in sight.  I swam to the loc. When he got close to the loc he feigned and she came over... from there I got the quest dialogue and all npcs spawned as in allakhazam's guide (everquest.allakhazam.com/quests/Shaman_Spear_of_Fate.htm)<br />
