<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foreststalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After grinding for the past couple weeks, I should be getting Endless Quiver tonight! :D  And was wondering if I should consider keeping my fleeting quiver, or giving it to another ranger in my guild. I'm a neat freak when it comes to my inventory and I like having all of the space I can get. So what should I do for this conflict?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Legenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Endless quiver doesn't ever replace the Fleeting quiver. Endless Quiver merely gives you an endless supply of the arrow you have in your ammo slot (nothing more, nothing less), Fleeting quiver gives you archery haste (and a nice and tidy place to store the various different arrow types you might wish to use)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaeadin Stormcloud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You should definately KEEP your fleeting quiver.  The fleeting quiver provides 20% bow haste and a spot to hold any extra arrows that you may want to switch out with.  Endless quiver allows you to put a single arrow into the ammo slot and use it indefinately, it does not replace your actual quiver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Foreststalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, I knew what both Endless Quiver and a Fleeting Quiver do.  What I was asking was is it worth keeping my fleeting quiver for the amount of haste that is on it (which by the way, does it stack with all other forms of haste?) instead of switching it for another 10 slot bag.  Thanks for the answer Kaeadin, still open for suggestions or comments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The haste stacks, so... yes you need to keep it.<br />
<br />
edit: quiver haste is considered seperately from worn item haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mjfruits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I thought item haste does not stack. Has anyone verified that Fleeting Quiver haste stacks with SCHW haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Quiver haste doesn't count as item haste, it is separate and unique to bows. It stacks with everything, so keep the fleeting quiver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arborlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This taken from castersrealm under enless quiver...<br />

&quot;The ability also gives innate quiver based haste.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyone know if this is true and if so, what the haste is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally, I don't trust Castersrealm for anything other than what spells and where to buy them, and even that I take with a grain of salt . . .</div></div><hr />

<br />
The EQ ability wording in not really clear, so it keeps creating a lot fo confusion. <br />
<br />
1. EQuiver does not give you extra haste on its own.<br />
<br />
2. EQuiver will take into consideration the haste of your quiver if you have one in your inventory. (this is what they meant by &quot;innate quiver based haste&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, I knew what both Endless Quiver and a Fleeting Quiver do. What I was asking was is it worth keeping my fleeting quiver for the amount of haste that is on it (which by the way, does it stack with all other forms of haste?) instead of switching it for another 10 slot bag.

Depends on what you use archery for. If you only pull and use it for an occasional TS, then replacing your Fleeting Quiver is no biggie. <br />
<br />
If you are an AM3/EQ archer, a fleeting quiver is a must have.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aluaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is confusing to me, if why ditch the quiver just as you become a proficient archer?  Hehe if you only used it to hold arrows, a 10 slot bag would have served you better all this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jelanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just to go kick a dead horse some more...<br />
There are four types of haste in EQ, you can stack different types, but not same type (ie two haste items won't stack)<br />
<br />
1. Item haste (FBSS, Envenomed Moccs, SCHW, etc)<br />
2. Bard haste (certain bard songs stack, some don't, but its the bard's problem, not yours)<br />
3. Spell haste (Celerity, etc)<br />
4. Quiver haste (Fleeting quiver, stacks with all the other hastes, but only applies to archery.  Also haste still works with EQ)<br />
<br />
Again, most people know this, but sometimes its good to rehash something to refresh the memories.  The only reason I can see getting rid of the fleeting quiver is if you didn't want archery to be your main form of combat.  If you wanted to be a melee ranger, then you can prolly find something better to go in that inventory slot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Starwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So if you are using your bow and you have a fleeting quiver (about 20% archery haste) &amp; you also have SCHW (around 22% haste item, does that mean you have 42% haste while shooting your bow?<br />

[B]So if you are using your bow and you have a fleeting quiver (about 20% archery haste) &amp; you also have SCHW (around 22% haste item, does that mean you have 42% haste while shooting your bow?<br />
<br />
Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Venture</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The only difference between &quot;Bard haste&quot; and &quot;spell haste&quot; is when you are discussing the Bard songs that give &quot;v3 haste&quot; according to Lucy.  AFAIK, that's just the Vah Shir songs.  v3 haste will stack with other haste spells and can take you over the cap.<br />
<br />
Spells and Bard songs that give regular haste may stack with other haste spells, but that's just so the side effects of the two can both take effect.  Only the strongest haste component actually counts.  A lot of people don't understand this; I see folks with Speed of Vallon up clicking their Eyepatches of Plunder like that's actually going to do something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">yes, most bard haste songs are considered spell haste.  all of the pre-luclin ones, iirc.<br />
<br />
but there are a few other things that give v3/overhaste:  that monk haste disc, and our &quot;guardian of the forest&quot; disc.</div></div><hr />
