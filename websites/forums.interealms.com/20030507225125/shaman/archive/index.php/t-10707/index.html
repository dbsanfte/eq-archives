<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL, thanks... I was bored at work and browsed Alhaka for a while comparing this and that and made a wish list. Most of the things are farmable or purchaseable by my necro. Some I'll have to camp in zone while farming in case they drop (no drop stuffs). But I have a list now and your help is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />
