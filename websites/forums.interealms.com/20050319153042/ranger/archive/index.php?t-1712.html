HONOLULU, Hawaii (AP) -- A fishing crew rescued a dog Sunday from an abandoned tanker where it had been adrift for 19 days, Humane Society officials said. <br />
<br />
Martha Armstrong, vice president of the Humane Society of the United States, said the crew was on board the Insiko 1907 and planned to bring Forgea back to Honolulu with them when they return next week from fishing. <br />
<br />
&quot;They were trying to calm her down,&quot; she said. &quot;She's been without company for 19 days, with several flyovers, she's probably really excited.&quot; <br />
<br />
Pamela Burns, president of the Hawaiian Humane Society, said the white mixed-breed terrier was doing well. <br />
<br />
&quot;It is walking and running around, but it's quite scared,&quot; Burns said. <br />
<br />
Crew members aboard a Coast Guard plane dropped their lunches to the tanker Saturday after the dog was seen running around the deck. The crew members believed their food drop to the Insiko was successful, Coast Guard Petty Officer David Mosley said. <br />
<br />
The Coast Guard had been searching for the Insiko to determine if it posed an environmental hazard to Johnston Island, about 825 miles southwest of Honolulu, Mosley said. The crew of the C-130 spotted it 250 miles east of the island, and the Coast Guard notified a salvage company. <br />

The Indonesian tanker was disabled by a fatal fire March 13 that killed one crewman and cut off power and communications. The crew was rescued April 2 by a cruise liner south of Hawaii, but the captain's 2-year-old dog was left aboard. <br />
<br />
The Hawaiian Humane Society quickly mounted a $50,000 rescue effort for Forgea, but the air-and-sea search ended April 7 when the tanker couldn't be found. <br />
<br />
A fishing vessel spotted the ship again April 12, and the society contacted another fishing boat in hopes of saving the dog, but the crew couldn't find the tanker. <br />
<br />
After the spotting Saturday, Lt. j.g. Mia Dutcher said the Coast Guard reported the tanker's position to American Marine Corp., the salvage company the society hired to find the ship and rescue the dog. <br />
<br />
American Marine directed a fishing vessel and a tug and barge about 80 miles away to go to the area, Dutcher said. <br />
<br />
The captain of the ship and an injured crewman flew home to Taiwan on April 6. The uninjured seamen were put up in a hotel while awaiting transportation home. They hid from authorities for 10 days but later turned themselves in. <br />
<br />
The Coast Guard hadn't made an effort to track down the Insiko earlier because it was in international waters. <br />
<br />
It was expected to take a day or two for the Coast Guard to analyze data to determine whether it will have to intervene to protect the Johnston Island from potential harm posed by the tanker, Mosley said. <br />
<br />
Johnston Island was the home of a U.S. chemical weapons disposal facility for 10 years before operations ended in November 2000. The island was turned into a wildlife preserve.</div></div><hr />

Safety issues aside, I have to believe that it's worth quite a pretty penny, even if just for salvage of metals, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm not current on the laws that apply to international waters, but I thought at one point that derelect ships were more or less first come first served with possession being 10/10ths of the law.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More over just cause something is derelict doesn't mean it stopped belonging to the original company.<br />
<br />
In this dog case I wouldn't be surprised if the salvage company was hired to find and tow it back to be refitted for the company to use once again.</div></div><hr />

To be honest they were looking for the ship for salvage rights anyhow so rescuing the dog was a nice side benefit. <br />
<br />
The Hawaiian Humane Society quickly mounted a $50,000 rescue effort for Forgea<br />
<br />
The humane society wouldn't have salvage rights on the tanker. They spent $50,000 NOT finding a dog.<br />
<br />
That's an awful lot to spend searching for a dog, but it sure wasn't the dog's fault it was in that situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taamar Bladesworn</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Call your local animal shelter and ask how many animals they have had to put down this past month... if it is a 'no-kill' shelter ask how many they have had to turn away. Then ask how many they could have saved if they had recieved a $50,000 grant. It's wonderful that we tried to save this dog, but what makes him different than any other animal at a shelter who just isn't cute enough to get adopted? Priorities, poeple... use the money where it will do the greatest good.</div></div><hr />
