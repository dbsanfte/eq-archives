Pretty much a money sink for a marginally useful potion.<br />
<br />
I won't waste the money personally. 170 Alchemy and fail on them too much.<br />
<br />
I really doubt people are going to want to buy these either, they are way too expensive.</div></div><hr />

Did one 10 dose Mystical Aptitude.  With cha buffed up to about 130, fully buffed + wis gear making all attributes above 220 (wis about 240), 180 alchemy, and a philosopher's stone (+10% alchemy) I spent about 1200pp.  Had 3 failures.<br />
<br />
By the way, the best way to get skill increases is to make grow potions up to 180, at which they become trivial.  11pp per try.  You can sell them back for about 9 gold if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />

God forbid enchanters not have a monopoly on good mana regen, even at the high costs of these potions. Bah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Do not under estimate the willingness of gnomes to buy grow potions to scare their ogre friends!   I regularly sell Grow potions at 120p a 10 shot (just to get some money back for the cost) to gnomes, halflings and dwarves for the fun factor of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">4 mana regen per tick is kinda cool when you're doing long drawn out battles.  Over time that adds up.<br />
<br />
If you're using c3 (12), mystical pot (4), have your mental clarity maxed (3) and (if it stacks) Spiritual Purity (7), and PotG (6).  Plus not to mention anything in FT items.  You can possibly be doin ~48 mana per tick, 32 without FT items.  That's an incredible amount for fights that go long durations and where mana on clerics is critical.  <br />
<br />
Add onto that maxed skill in SCM and thats a hella lot of mana</div></div><hr />

Since when? The time I made a few of these someone came by and hit me with KEI, which overwrote the potion effect.<br />
<br />
Did they fix the overwriting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">since day 1 of SoL its stacked.  <br />
<br />
btw did I just coin a new term with Mystical Pot??????</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm... Then the potion must have worn off just as someone gave me KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There were stacking issues with KEI for a while (like clarity overwriting it); maybe something like that applied for potions. What I'm sure of is that I could drink a potion of greater concentration while I had KEI, 'cause my wizard did so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So ALL of the new Luclin 180+ mana potions stack with ALL enchanter mana buffs?  Is there anything, chanter mana or otherwise, with which they are known not to stack?</div></div><hr />
