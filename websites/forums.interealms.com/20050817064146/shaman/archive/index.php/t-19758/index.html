I spent 15k (all I had) within the first 20min it was up and won nothing of value. Evertime I got 100pp I would run to casino and lose it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummmmm rich people are blowing their plat, not raking it in.  I've lost over 100k myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">there are the people that get lucky. More money spent means a better chance to win. Unless of course its like the old trade skill system where if you break your pattern, get a few fails in a row =/ But I doubt the casino used the same equation to suceed.<br />
Guess your just unlucky, like me. I never even bothered with the casino, because I know i would just lose money I would spend on stuff I KNOW I will get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No one's getting rich on the casinos.  The whole purpose of it is to thin the plat in the economy and get the EQonomics back under control.  You'll notice that once you buy your &quot;tokens&quot;, even if you win more or want to &quot;cash out&quot;, you can't.  The tokens are non-tradeable and non-redeemable for cash, so basically once you've bought a stack, unless you get a golden ticket, consider yourself out 2k.<br />
<br />
At least on Xev, the only ones in the casino on a regular basis are people from the &quot;uber&quot; guilds who have gobs of cash and nothing to do with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hrm, I wouldnt know, I never been to the casino, and haven't accually been on EQ for about a month =/ Stuck at 42!! I still don't understand why people would bother with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I still don't understand why people would bother with it.<br />
<br />
DE mask!! Well, that and to get the Holgresh Elder Beads so I can taunt the nec in my guild who's spent 150ish K to get them. He's never gonna run out of stat food now, though  :D <br />
<br />

Finn: When the casino went live the first time, you could turn in bat wings and the dealer accepted them as tokens, if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I tried the batwing thing the first day, it didn't work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Batwings?<br />
<br />
Now I am curious how ppl can figure out these things.  I would never ever even have tried to turn in a item other than a token.<br />
<br />
I wonder what they tried before the batwings?  There are thousands of items in EQ and how did they figure it out in such a short time?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I had floated the idea a long time ago that would have used the system they use for Tribute in a Casino form.  That is you would turn in old items for casino tokens and spend them to get a chance at a better item.  With the Tribute System I am not sure that there is an Economic need for the casino (sucking plat out of the economy).</div></div><hr />
