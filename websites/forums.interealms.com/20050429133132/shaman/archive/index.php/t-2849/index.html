<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am now level 43, and I've been soloing/grouping in City of Mist for this level. It's pretty hard to solo here unless the spawns are broken up. Basicly I just soloed the frist to mobs you come to in the zone, just before the bridge. They happened to be broken up at the time, so I was lucky. I got about 1 and a half blues in two kills which is awesome exp :D <br />
<br />
Shaman epic quest items also drop here. You need 6 pages, and 5 of them can drop right at the entrance I believe. I have 5 so far, just need the students log. And I also got the three books from Lord Ghiosk while helping a guild kill reavers :D<br />
<br />
Be warned though, even though things mostly con dark blue to me at 43, I did get attacked by a red con &quot;goo&quot; right there at the bridge. Hit for mostly 60's and stuff but did get a few lucky hits of 100+. I almost died but I zoned in time :( <br />
<br />
But if you're into grouping, I'd say you're just about out of luck here. It's kind of a bring your own group thing :mad: <br />
<br />
Well thats about it, good luck all you shamans out there ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Granted before 49 for a shaman its not a good place to solo.  Once you hit 49 it becomes perfect.  The drops not too bad either.  Need to be lucky or hunt there a lot.  6 Master Wu's 2 Green Jades, 3 wraith bone hammers and various other stuff.  Not bad at all and of course not all at one time or same day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also, if you're lucky, you can get in on a reaver raid or at least be there while a reaver raid is in progress. Usually Lord Ghiosk will spawn several times during a reaver raid and if no shammy present needs the books, most often you will be allowed to loot them. Also, if someone has cleared the area near the high scale icon, you can just walk up and grab it. I got lucky in that on my first trip to CoM at 52 I got in on a reaver raid. I ended up with everything I needed from CoM (ghiosk's books, icon, pages) except the student's log off of the spectral courier. He just didnt spawn that day (had a ranger in raid checking for me -- he never popped). Fortunately, on my second day, he popped twice while I was there. He dropped the research notes the first time. Second time, he had the log, so as I was soloing at the time, I just gated out. I may head back though. Most of the mobs were light blue, but the exp bar still moves pretty well. Probably, I'll just come back when it's time to get serious, though. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A good time to go to CoM is to go on a raid. There are a number of quests there as well as some good drops. If you go on a raid there, you can get a really good feel for the place &amp; you'll have a number of people to back you up as well. Things can go really wrong really fast there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Like I said, I got lucky since the spawn was already broken up. Pretty hard to solo there, but I think it's worth it :)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and I now have almost all the stuff I need from CoM for my epic. Turned in the report, then turned in the three books, and I even have the icon. Now I just gotta try getting a raid together for the hole. And if all goes well from here on out I'll be the first in my guild to get their epic :D<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten much loot, but I'm there for exp. Everyone else keeps telling me to go to Dreadlands but I hate it there :( Can barely ever find a group in Sol B or L Guk either. Man I cant wait until 49 though.  The DoT's look like they're gonna be awesome.<br />
<br />
I'm facing another problem other than where to level right now. I need a major equipment upgrade but lacking the money :( Where should I go to get some easy money? Send a tell to Kaenil in game(tholuxe paells) or just post here (heh, probably easier).<br />
<br />
I'll be making a Magelo profile sometime, whenever I get the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>wyrm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">what times do you normally play kaenil? im on TP also. level 47 atm.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I play almost all the time  :p <br />
<br />
Unfortunatly I've been distracted on the luclin server with some alts of mine but I'll go back to Tholuxe soon enough :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I am mostly online at the very late/early hours and sleep the days away seeing as it's summer and no school :D :D :D :D<br />
<br />
btw, that's Eastern Time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wyrm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">look me up if you play on tp again! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jebuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am very much loving CoM.  I'm level 49 and am able to pull singles in the room after the bridge, and on the sides of the bridge.  VERY good xp here solo, and not too bad in a group.  I haven't gone further than the temple or stable area yet though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, I was soloing the whole entrance area (2 mobs before the bridge, 3 after the bridge, and 2 on each balcony) at 45 with a JBB and 850ac.  The trick is to break up the spawns slowly.<br />
<br />
My method is pretty slow at first, but once you get the pops set up right it's non-stop exp untill you go LD or the mobs turn green.<br />
<br />
Re-pop time is 27 or 28 minutes, I was too busy killing stuff to watch the second hand on the clock. :)<br />
<br />
First round: Enstill one mob at the entrance,  pull the other one to Doggy who is parked at the zone line, kill, keep the second one enstilled for 3 minutes while you cann/med.  At this point I was usually pretty beat up and couldn't get back to full hp/mana in the next 3 minutes, so i waited it out till the next re-pop.<br />
<br />
Round two: First 2 mobs are spaced perfectly, now for the fun part.  Cast enstill from as far away as you can, and 2 of them will come running at you.  Enstill the second one, pull the third to Doggy, kill, keep both enstilled for 3 minutes, pull # 2 to Doggy, kill, wait 3 minutes, do you see the pattern yet?  After the 3 mobs past the bridge, I was even more beat up than after the first two, so again get to full hp/mana and wait for a re-pop.<br />
<br />
Round three:  As long as you timed the kills in the first 2 rounds at 3 minutes apart from each other, from here on out you're in there like swimwear.  For the pairs of mobs on the balconies, enstill the one directly at the top of the stairs and the one on the balcony will aggro, pull him to Doggy and even if enstill breaks on the other one, it won't hunt you down that far away.<br />
<br />
Other important info:<br />
<br />
AC &gt; WIS for soloing like this.  (If you want to kite, play a Dr00d :P )  Use Chloro, and every AC, AGI, STA, and HP buff you have on YOU, as well as Doggy. If you have 800+ ac you are a much better tank than your dog.<br />
<br />
The lvl 44 Doggy has very good regen, but he's still an awfull tank, even fully buffed.  Let him get beat on at the beginning of a fight so you can DoT and JBB if you've got one.  But when he's at 1/3 HP it's more efficient for you to tank more and let Doggy regen on his own.  3 minutes is more than enough time for him to go from 1/3 HP to full without wasting your mana on heals.<br />
<br />
Buff Doggy the same as yourself, but add STR and Alacrity.  Don't ever let his Alacrity stay down for a full fight, he does a TON of damage when hasted.<br />
<br />
Your /pet back off hotbutton is VERY important in round 1 and 2.  Mash on it fast to keep Doggy as far away from the fight as possible BEFORE he starts getting beat on by 2 mobs at once.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, park Doggy as close to the zone entrance as you can, it's almost impossible to split mobs up if they have him to beat on.<br />
<br />
You can still get excellent exp here if you duo instead of solo.  Just make sure your tank partner lets your Doggy get beat on at the beginning of every fight while you cast your DoTs and whatnot, and take advantage of his hella fast HP regen.  The ammount of mana this saves you is amazing.<br />
<br />
You are NOT your pet's cleric untill you get Topor.  (Actually, I can't say that for a fact, but that's what it's looking like so far at 47.)  I don't even keep any heal spells memmed when I solo.<br />
<br />
X# of spawns divided by the mobs repop time = the time you need to wait between kills.  After you get that down, never worry about adds, just non-stop exp.<br />
<br />
Wow, that post turned out way longer than I planned.  Hopefully someone gets some use out of it.<br />
<br />
P.S. Does anyone on Tribunal want to help an up an unguilded Shaman get some Black Fur Boots?  (It never hurts to ask...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have low ac and low wisdom :( Recently went back there and found I could clear the whole entrance as well, just pulled with slow, back up let the dog tank for a bit while I slow any adds, then I run in and melee...maybe add a dot or something.<br />
<br />
I can only wish I had a jbb :p <br />
<br />
<br />
I don't even keep any heal spells memmed when I solo <br />
<br />
You should keep healing memorized. I know of plenty of times when I was tanking/meleeing with the dog I had to back up and heal...most recent was when I was fighting ice giants. When slowed they can still hit pretty hard. When they duel wield I had to be very careful :) With my buffs and a druid buff I had about 2k hp. Started at full mana and full hp, ended the fight with 1 bubble of hp, and no mana...and togors wore off :(<br />
<br />
Wish I could help you with the black fur boots but I play on Tholuxe Paells :(</div></div><hr />
