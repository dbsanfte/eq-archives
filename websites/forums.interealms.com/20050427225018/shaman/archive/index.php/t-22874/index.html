<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know i know grouping there is fastest exp blah blah :)<br />
my first char got 60 thru dungeon crawls in sebilis and HS. my second char got 65 in endless hours of pov, pot grinding and i find it VERY boring. i rather prefer hunting in non pop zones just because of the fact im sick of pop and think its too easy.<br />
graveyards took all the excitement of a nasty CR out of the game. <br />
Dying in pop? who cares, rezzers are arround and we have a GY. Dying in Sebilis or the hole is a total different story.<br />
<br />
Any1 has some suggestions? Sebilis and HS are my first option, but maybe im forgetting something here, i never hunted in luclin. are there zones for 50 to 60? Indoor or outdoor doesnt matter. Oh yes, i hate ssrae ;) too long camping for a silly emp key :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Acrilya Caverns is prolly a decent bet on luclin, Id rank Griegs End second since the revamp (not bad xp, plus decent cash/vendor trash).....ME, The Deep, Akheva Ruins all are in that range too but the XP in them isnt as good and the drops suck compared to AC....all my opinion of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dragon Necropolis is good if you have means to get there and back and are not KoS to CoV faction.<br />
<br />
Inner Acrylia has some nice drops and all dark blues right through to 65.<br />
<br />
Velketors is an old classic, along with the already-mentioned Sebilis. Pickup some velium and some named drops for extra pp.<br />
<br />
If you will want to get a VP key, then try some shard-dropping zones to kill 2 birds with one stone. Akheva, ME, Acrylia, The Grey etc are all reasonable xp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Planes are not my favourite.  I leveled in Jagged Pine, I leveled in Nurga, I did the hole through 52/53ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">@sudedor yeah i figured i was in the wrong section, sorry bout dis :)<br />
<br />
@goldark: thanks a ton for the hints, i went to dragon necropolis and i love that zone. the traps that spawn a gazilion little bugs are deadly as hell when soloing but thats the type of adventure im looking for.<br />
the rats are a pain in the ass and b4 i knew what happened i ended up dead in vlanikis room. PITA. thanks god i have a necro and could summon my corpse out :D<br />
<br />
Is Vlaniki a 1 grp mob nowadays? he drops a nice and _huge_ lance for shammys. just want it for the look, i didnt see a shammy wielding that lance for ages.</div></div><hr />
