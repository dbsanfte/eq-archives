<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
I just wanted to introduce myself to the shaman community as a new shaman.  I have taken the time to look at gear recommended by you all, and have created a decent shaman to call my own.  Let me give you some background on why I created a shaman.<br />
<br />
My GF and I have been playing EQ for almost 4 years, shortly after the kunark expansion.  My main characters are a Bard and Beastlord.  We play mostly with my Beastlord and her Cleric.  However, sometimes we just want to get away... away from guild raiding, away from EQ as we know it, and just spend some time together.<br />
<br />
Hence, we both started two new characters, with no affiliations to guild or comrades.  She started a necromancer, and I started a shaman.  From what I've read, the necro/shaman combination will work incredibly well for our purpose of being anti-social and just spending time together.<br />
<br />
I have great respect for a shamans abilities, and I hope I can develop the aptitude for maximizing the unique capabilities of the shaman class.  I would also like to ask for a bit of advice...<br />
<br />
Here is my GEAR (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=966511).  My GF is similarly equipped on her necromancer.  I know this isn't the best gear, but it is what we could afford and camp with out main characters.  Can you give me some suggestions on strategy for maximizing our potential as a duo team?  Obviously looking at what I can do as a shaman to help her necromancer...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi Rodann,<br />
<br />
welcome to shaman hood.  I often duo with a necro, shaman+necro do make a very strong pair.<br />
<br />
One thing I'm sure a lot of people are going to suggest is concentrate on hp gear over wisdom gear.  You have a lot of nice stuff for your lvl, but would be better served with more hp, even at the sake of wisdom.<br />
<br />
A nice thing about the combo is there are many different strategies you can use depending on the content.  You can have the pets tank, root/rot, and agro kite.  It all just depends on the nature of the mobs you are fighting.<br />
<br />
Just try to be flexible, and adapt to the given situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mojarda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Greetings and welcome to the Crucible.<br />
<br />
As far as your gear, I think it is fine until you begin to canni.  The high Wis will help with skill-ups on your spell skills and will give you a nice-sized mana pool.  Once you start to canni, you'll want to switch out some of the gear to get more raw HP.<br />
<br />
As far as tactics, just buff her pet and let it go to town.  Make sure you tank enough each level to get your defense, offense and weapon skills maxed.  While fear kiting, will be good xp for your two, too much of that and your melee skills (especially Defense) will suffer and you'll reget it later.<br />
<br />
Also buff her with regen once you get it as she will be casting mana regen spells by then and will need the HPs.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At lvl 1, and through the lower levels, raw +wis isn't going to help a whole lot, I'd definatly not wear a +7 wis ring in favor of a HP/AC ring, especially if you can find or buy a hp/ac/mana ring somewhere for a reasonable price - even if you have to grow into it.  There's a good ring from one of the boat captains (3rd boat I think?  Stormwave?) in Dulak Harbor that would serve you well, and I think it's lvl 30 recommended.  Also, camp that soulstripper from Dulak harbor as well would be a good weapon for the SHM for quite a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">She will be using mana conversion spells before level 10. I think the first one is level 4. <br />
<br />
Your gear is too focused on wisdom. Look for the highest AC and hp gear, and any wisdom or stamina on that is always an added bonus. As was also pointed out, you need to use that AC and hps by meleeing to keep your skills maxxed, or your AC will be pitiful when you get to high levels. You wont last long as a shaman with low AC or hps, because you have to take your daily beatings for slow, cripple, dots, etc. Even a non-uber shaman (like me) should have 1000+ AC somewhere in the 50's with the gear that is available today (maybe before that). It took me a bit longer to crack 1000, but I'm old school and didnt have the gear choices you have today.<br />
<br />
My suggestion, soon as you and your wife's necro are high enough level, start working on Lost Dungeon points. If you ever wind up getting your new alts up to high levels, that gear will serve you very well - even the lower point armors (like the 760 or 442).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sea Worn Ring - Captain of the Dirulia - he spawns at the front of the boat.<br />
<br />
The soulstripper drops off a Luggald guy in the secret caves in Dulak and down on the right as you cross the bridge area.  I don't remember his name, but there's some stairs down into a big room ... his spawn is in the tunnel between the stairs down and the bridge.  It should be an easy duo for cleric / beastlord, depending on your levels.  The mob is a lvl 54 ish necromancer or something and can be an annoying camp, but it's a decent 1hb weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm warning you, the necro and shaman combo are gonna be a lot of fun so don't be surprised if you find yourself missing more and more raids to play them!  <br />
<br />
The both of you are best served with sticking to getting your hp's as high as possible.  This way you guys can xp with minimal downtime.  Lich and Canni make things a lot easier on the both of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Defense and weapon skill shouldn't be an issue for this pair.  They can just sic light blue pets on eachother for defense gains or beat on the pets with weak weapons for weapon gains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rodann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thank you all so much for the advice!  It should be quite easy for me to switch my gear around to AC/HP as that is what I'm most familiar with.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the information and advice, and I'm looking forward to becoming an active and useful shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heya Rodann<br />
<br />
Glad to see new Shaman's in the game.   Like others have said, Wis items aren't the main consideration of a Shaman.   AC - HP - STA - Focus items - Resists - with Wis pretty low on list.<br />
<br />
You will not see the value of this until you get your first Cannibalize spell  at 24.  But believe me you will click it throughout your Shaman lifetime from then on.   The thought process is to have largest HP pool to live through fights and available to pull for Mana as possible.  <br />
<br />
WIS gear at lower levels in place of AC/HP are really counterproductive because they end up causing you to work more for that Mana Pool replacement Shaman style.   You shouldn't look for Wis gear until much later on after every stat starts to be max'd.<br />
<br />
Another issue is Shaman's have ability to handle Melee damage (in teh face style) and even better if they are geared right - again AC/HP/STAT's at the lower level.  And your wife's Necro's isn't going to be able to take damage directly like you will on bad pulls or when pets die.   Outside of her pet, you will be the Tank when grouping together.  <br />
<br />
Of course, with today's PoK 49 level buffers everywhere ... HP and stat's should be easy for ya.   <br />
<br />
Lastly, the equipment threads have numerous posts on gear questions and such ... which you should check out.<br />
<br />
GL and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you go to castersrealm.com or other sites, you can find a mana calculator that will add up how much mana you get per point of wisdom.  This can be extremely helpful in selecting how much mana you gain or lose by making different equipment choices.  If you haven't gotten familiar with using one, I recommend it highly, especially at low levels.<br />
<br />
What you will see is that even high wisdom gives you very little mana at low levels.  Here's how it works.  Say you have a piece with 10 wis.  At level 50, you get what I think of as full credit for wisdom.  That 10 wis piece will give you 100 mana. At level 10, one fifth of level 50, you get 1/5 the mana too.  So that 10 wis item(pretty nice wis!) is only worth 20 mana at level 10.  At level 40, it will give you 4/5 the full value, or 80 mana, etc.  You can see by this that, first, wisdom means very little at low levels, and second, that for useable mana, items with simple &quot;plus mana&quot; can be far more useful.  Make your selections on gear accordingly!<br />
<br />
As you advance, you'll need to keep evaluating your gear.  And you'll probably need to keep two sets of gear for quite some time if you want to optimize things.  If  your shaman for instance becomes responsible for a good amount of healing or a lot of slows in a fast moving group, say, in your 40's, you might want to swap in a few high mana or wisdom pieces that you normally don't use when soloing.  <br />
<br />
Shamans are extremely good at melee in the lower levels.  Get yourself a piercer, a 1hb, and a 2hb.  Go for something fast, to build up your skills quickly.  Start with your fastest weapon each time you ding, to maximize your offense.  That will let you hit for the maximum amount with ALL your weapons -- based on your skill with that particular weapon of course.  Then you might want to consider swapping in your slowest weapon, because you can go quite a while without skill ups on slow weapons.  It is easy to fall so far behind you get discouraged and stop using a 2hb entirely. Don't do that!  Get good at everything, and you'll have that many more options and that much more to enjoy.  A shaman with good defense and offense and even very moderate gear can do quite a bit of meleeing even into his 50's before he has to really start asking himself if it's time to make a change in playing style.  The ability to melee comes and goes with shamans depending on gear and spells and the particular mobs you're killing, but you should melee and get weapon skills up.<br />
<br />
One big reason is because each level of defensive skill is worth 2.5 AC.  That's 12.5 AC per level, which is quite dramatic.  It's like getting a major upgrade to a piece of armor every level without spending a dime.  <br />
<br />
Further, mobs are geared to give you a certain amount of fight.  If you cannot handle them, you could be in trouble.  When you hit 51, some shamans collapse because they've spent all their time rooting and DOT'ing, and when they start getting hit regularly in groups from the HUGE aggro the 51 slow suddenly gives shamans, they die almost instantly.  Then they get skittish and start slowing really late to try to save their cowardly hides, and everybody starts to say, hey, I never knew shamans sucked so much!  DON'T be one of those guys.  Melee enough to keep defensive maxed or very close to maxed every level.  Solo if you have to, to do it.  You almost certainly will have to solo to do it for at least a while.  Defensive raises very slowly compared to offensive and weapons skills.  Almost every shaman at some point thinks his character is bugged or broken because of the slow raise in defensive skills that seems to hit them around the 40's or 50's.  You can literally go a level or two of solid meleeing every single mob without a single increase in defensive.<br />
<br />
Tip:  keep AGI on yourself at all times.  Get a buff from a higher level shaman or ranger.  AGI makes defensive skills go up; DEX makes weapons and offensive go up.<br />
<br />
Judging by your gear, you might be hurting a bit for money.  I would suggest that you think about leveling in places where you can do more than just level, especially as you're doing it partially just to hang with your girlfriend and have fun and experience the class.  Go hunt spiders for silks and lions for pelts in east karana.  Bring a ton of patterns and a sewing kit, and work up your sewing while you're there, or just sell the silks for 10-20pp each, like they do on my server.  You can make a lot of money pretty quickly and get experience at the same time.  Same with marus seru, but it's less rich.  Still, greyhopper hides drop there that you can tailor with and/or make leather padding with to sell in the bazaar to tradeskillers.   <br />
<br />
I would suggest dropping the emerald dragonscale tunic.  I used it, and used everything you could get in my time.  The iksar ceremonial breastplate(I think it's called that) is far superior, even with I think no wis on it.  Shamans can melee very well with that on into their low 50's because it gives you 5 regen standing and 6 sitting.  This is a superb piece of equipment for a non-rich shaman.  I very highly suggest you get one, even if you have to sell off almost everything you have.<br />
<br />
I'd also suggest an iksar berserker club.  It procs at level 10 a spell that adds AC and can therefore almost function as a quick escape hatch when it procs because it buffs you up so much!  It's also VERY fast -- 7/18 I think -- and will allow you to rapidly maximize &quot;offensive&quot; each level, plus of course 1hb itself.  I meleed very well with this club into my 50's.  These days there are better weapons out there, but this one is cheap and very effective, both for the proc and the speed.  <br />
<br />
Stay away from alchemy until you want to blow a lot of money.  Don't waste money on tradeskills of any kind unless you're camping the components while you level, like I suggested with east karana, and don't do anything serious until you have extremely high wisdom -- well beyond 236 or even 250 for that matter.  I'm a 1748 tradeskiller with 200 alchemy also, so trust me on this -- you will spend a fortune in both time and money if you get get into tradeskills before you're ready.<br />
<br />
Don't worry too much about slows when you're young.  They stink and cost a ton of mana for a couple dozen levels.  Try to stomach how short lasting (and fairly useless) your buffs are at lower levels.  At upper levels, you get group spells that last longer and hit everyone all at once.<br />
<br />
If you're in groups, I'd recommend concentrating on your healing and slowing.  Nobody cares about your DPS, because it sucks.  However, if they are counting on YOU to heal, you had damn well better deliver, or you will get a very bad rep very fast, and deservedly so.  Many people in a group can usually add DPS, but the number of healers is more limited and heals are almost always more vital.  Many DPS think they're what holds the group together, but they're not.  It's YOU -- and any other healers/crowd control you have.  Otherwise those guys would be dead meat in no time.  A shaman or healer is often a silent hero. <br />
<br />
But get ready!  Master your skills and be quick to make sharp decisions, and you can help groups pull off astounding things sometimes!  I can't tell you how many times I've been in groups that have begged me to come back the next day and forever and ever, and have said, this is the best group I've ever been in by a mile, I just can't believe how much butt we're kicking.  One of the great things about being a shaman is there is so often the potential there to do and be something really great.</div></div><hr />
