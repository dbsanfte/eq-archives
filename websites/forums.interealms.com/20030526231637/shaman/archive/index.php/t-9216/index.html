<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Torpor, this spell used to heal half of our hp, now with new hp from PoP buff, it seen only heal 1-1.5 bub hp which seen take forever to heal up.<br />
<br />
look at our lvl65 new torpor, it still heal same rate except not snare and slow; we should have an upgrade torpor like 2200hp for 400mana, Quiescence isn't an upgrade sicne still 1200hp/200mana<br />
<br />
cleric have upgrade from Celestial Elixir(300mana, 1000hp heal, lvl59) to Celestial Elixir(400mana, 2000hp heal, lvl62); but shaman have upgrade from Torpor(200mana, 1200hp heal, lvl60, snare, slow, group) to Quiescence(200mana, 1200hp heal, lvl65, all target); you notice cleric have big upgrade to Duration Healing Spell ? shaman got almost not upgrade and it is lvl65 spell !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure comparison with Clerics is the way to go. A Clerics primary function is to heal, ours is not. Having said that, looking at the gimp spells we did get in PoP coupled with an increased HP level, I don't have a problem with an upgraded Torpor type heal spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Quiencience our Level 65 spell is basically Torpor without the negative effects.  To me that is an upgrade to say the least, no slow or other negative effects but the same healing.  You upgrade your torpor by getting spell casting reinforcement mastery.  I believe it ends up being 1800 points for 400 mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do you have any real concept of how good Q really is?<br />
Considering the mana regen of a shaman, it's quite possible to keep up Q on a tank for about 90% of the time in an xp group, and 100% of the time in a raid.  That's 300 health healed every tick for every moment of combat.  You don't have to wait until after combat is over to torpor someone for downtime healing.  Q is a combat heal spell, while Torpor is a downtime heal.  You can drop Q on a puller before he goes out to pull to top of his health.  You can use it as a pseudo rune type spell when you are pulling a tough mob before it can be slowed.  You can cast it outside of groups.  It's amazing is what it is.  Unfortunately the ratio is the same as Torpor, but when you consider what it will do without the negative restrictions, it's gross.</div></div><hr />

That's 1800 hps for 200 mana, and less with focus and AA. Don't talk about this anymore. You know it's too good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">honestly , i thought this needed upgrading too atfirst , but after thinking about AA work and focus effects .. more so  the AA cause anyone can get that ..<br />
<br />
its not that bad . I wouldnt be against it , i mean the heals needed at 65 certainly warrent it , but there are other fish to fry before this . not to mention a HUGE portion of shaman dont even have this ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
       Cleric don't have the same aa to increase duration on heal over time ? Anyway it's still under a ch ratio and it's normal , but 300hp per tick is hardly enough now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree, quinessence is a big upgrade for us in terms of making us more effective healers for melees, downside is that in terms of self/caster healing, its only an upgrade as far as convenience goes, and of course its a poxy rune =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taarne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In my opinion, this is pretty ridiculous, really. After having used torpor for a week now, I think it's mad - I can keep a warrior healed with torpor easily against normal PoP mobs while bigger dmg dealers do their job. For anything bigger, get a cleric. We aren't uber healers in that sense, but torpor can keep your average PC healed pretty good, and with torpor&amp;cann, you never run out of mana. If you want to make it even better, get AAs as other people have said already.<br />
<br />
Just think abaut Q and AAs... What, 1800 hps healed with 200 mana, and no negative effects.<br />
<br />
Remember, some people don't even have the normal Torpor :(<br />

<br />
If you have a REALLY skewed group (Ie 4 rogues/pally/shaman) then yeah, using torpor on the tank (Has to be a knight/ranger to be even considerable really) becomes a viable option since you have high dps already, otherwise its just slowing the group down,  KM is sufficient, its just hard work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just got Quiencience the other day.<br />
I love it its a awesome upgrade, kinda sad to put Topor on last page of book though =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">For those that are compacent with quiesense ,thank you for screwing us. Hmm lets see i can get torpor heals 1200 hps 200 mana at 60 and  quiesence heals exact same . yay, i'm so excited. Now instead of healing for 1200 at 60 i can heal for 1200 at 65 nice upgrade! We should definately be complacent with the upgrade that allows us to heal tanks since thats our primary consern when it comes to healing. NOT! If i can't heal the tank do i care , no i get a cleric !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have Quiescence, I dont see that it's 'all that', but I don't see that whining about it is likely to do anything.<br />
<br />
It certainly doesn't heal enough that I don't use plenty of direct healing if I am unfortunate enough to lack a Cleric.<br />
<br />
You need Tnargs, PoP mobs just hit for a ton and there's no getting around it. And hopefully that will be a big enough band-aid to last until you can locate that Cleric I mentioned.<br />
<br />
Melee like that I dont have them slowed/snared the whole fight, but that's really about it. I would also put the raid utility of this spell right around zero, except for maybe some AE healing. It has a small range, and an extra 200 hp/tick is not going to do a lot when mobs are quadding for 2k.<br />
<br />
As for whether we deserve a healing upgrade, I have mixed feelings. Druids and Clerics are there for a reason. I'd say we ought to heal at least as well as a Paladin (which we currently do not). <br />
<br />
If Sony really is looking to upgrade us somehow, my vote would probably go to buffing our new Focus to something a bit more equitable. 100hp over the old one isn't all that much. (clerics, druids, and paladins all got better upgrades than that), or reducing some of the completely unreasonable taunt from our DoT spells.</div></div><hr />

Healing tanks out of group is a huge plus for keeping on the rampage tank to help out the clerics, not to mention I can keep it on our MT for big mobs to help ease the load.  I grouped for 2 hours in BoT yesterday with an SK, Rogue, bard and me and had nary a problem keeping SK healed, dotting and nuking.  It's a big upgrade IMHO and I don't even have the AA yet to make it better.<br />
<br />
I used to hate it when I'd torpor myself then the raid would be called to move.  My slow ass would get to next pull spot as they already had mobs in camp, no more ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn't agree more.<br />
<br />
I was in PoV last night with a 65 bard paladin ranger rogue monk and myself.  Note that I was the only healer and slower for this group.  It was difficult to keep up with healing, but I did it for 4 hours before the ranger (hehe) finally ate it.  It was hard as hell to keep up my mana (we were chain pulling and dropping things very fast - always a mob in camp) and the entire time I was just saying to myself &quot;If I had quinnessience* I would be god right now.&quot; :)<br />
<br />
* I should probably just call it Q since I will never be able to spell it hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Using AA as an excuse to give us a rehashed version of the same spell we get at 60 is kind of stupid.  Show me another class that has one of their most important class spells treated the same way because of AA.  Q should heal at least twice as much as it does, considering hp at that point and how hard mobs hit now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've got rather mixed feelings about it.<br />
<br />
On the one hand q is definitely looking to be a very useful spell to have around. The ability to use it when ever where ever is great. I've always felt like i'm a pretty good healer with torpor just really limited by it because of the side effects.<br />
<br />
On the other hand it is rather anemic in the amount it heals. Even fully extended it's not even enough to cover half my health self buffed. The lack of side effect do make up for that some since you don't have to worry about when you have it on yourself.<br />
<br />
I would love to actually see 2 heals. Q left as it is and a new heal thats something on the order of 600hps a tick for 400 mana with the side effects back in. If I had to choose between them at this point I'd have to say Q even tho i don't have it yet.<br />
<br />
As far as efficiency goes a fully extended Q is the second most efficient heal in the game. Only being beaten by a cleric CH of over 3600hps and that still ignoring the fact that we can save more mana via efficiency focus effects which don't work on CH but do work on torpor so thats probably closer to a 4k heal or more.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
You're wrong, Q is a huge upgrade... do you even have it?  Try it for a few days and get back to us.<br />
<br />
Keeping 300 a tick on tanks in valor/BoT is nearly enough for them to not require any other healing if you've slowed the mob they're fighting.  To say this is not an upgrade is just wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Casting Torpor on ANYONE other than myself while in a group (unless under special circumstances) earns me a big, fat smack.  Getting an upgrade at level 65 that changes a spell that I always have memmed to all targets?  YES!  I'm foaming at the mouth for this!  If you want Q to be better, do the AA to make it so.  Don't ask Verant to give us something that they'll have to yank back after they realise how overpowered it is, after the first week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I DO have it and it's not a huge upgrade. It's actually rather pathetic for a 65 heal. Sorry but 300hps a tick is just not enough. It's not enough against teir2 exp mobs, and it's not enough in raids. The ONLY saving grace is that it is castable outside of the group and low aggro.<br />
<br />
Sure you can chain cast it on a tank and keep it on them full time, but even then you still have to throw in some direct heals or your tank still ends up down some hp's every fight. That's just on regular crap slowed experience mobs.<br />
<br />
You can try and keep it on a MT or RT full time during a raid, but then again clerics just keep overwriting it with THEIR superior Supernal elixer. And if your a MT, which would you rather have? Give me the larger heal please thanks.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's is a much superior heal with AA and focus effects then Q.<br />
<br />
EDIT: For all you claiming to use AA to upgrade it, sorry it still gets the big fat crap 300pts a tick. That isn't enough when stuff is hitting for 500-700 a round regularly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Torpor was already too good of a spell.

You do realize the fact that clerics are out there for more than just rezing and burning plat on buffing your hps? I have a feeling that Q was never meant to be as good as to heal enough to keep a tank healthy against any bigger than tier 1 mobs. You can chain cast Tnarg's if you want to heal lots of hps quick.<br />
<br />
Sure, if you compare Q now to how good torpor used to be against, say, your average Seb mob, sure it sucks. But you also gain a truckload more exp off a mob in PoP, and for that reason, you need a plate tank, cleric for healing and blahblahblah. I think you're living in dream world to want Q to be good enough to keep people in PoP healthy on it's own.<br />

SO what your saying is that a 62 common as dirt spell SHOULD be vastly superior to a hard to come by level 65 spell. /boggle<br />
<br />
You do realize Tier 1 mobs are light blue and green and still outdamage Q healing. That's on a fully decked out level 65 warrior with truckloads of AA. <br />
<br />
Yes stuff hits that hard, but when you level 65 there is no other option of hunting anywhere else and our heals do not scale accordingly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*sighs* Of course you don't. I've been the only healer in groups killing stuff that hits in the 500s and we've done alright. What I'm saying is that you shouldn't expect to be as good healer as a cleric, and if you want maximum efficiency, get a cleric, and don't expect torpor/Q alone to keep a person standing against a hard hitting PoP mob.<br />
<br />
Isn't this kind of stuff kinda obvious? Of course clerics are, and should be better healers than us. You don't always need one, but eh does the job best. If this isn't the case, somewhere something has gone horribly wrong.<br />
<br />
I still think Q is a damn good spell - even if &quot;stealth nerfed&quot; a little by not upgrading how much it heals /shrug<br />
<br />
What would you want it to do then?</div></div><hr />

cleric have upgrade from Celestial Elixir(300mana, 1000hp heal, lvl59) to Celestial Elixir(400mana, 2000hp heal, lvl62); but shaman have upgrade from Torpor(200mana, 1200hp heal, lvl60, snare, slow, group) to Quiescence(200mana, 1200hp heal, lvl65, all target); you notice cleric have big upgrade to Duration Healing Spell ? shaman got almost not upgrade and it is lvl65 spell !! <br />
<br />
Gotta comment on this a bit. I don't see any clerics with slows, dots, (mildly useful) pets, cannibalize and so forth.. And you may notice that our spell is actually more mana efficient. Clerics heal more quicker, but we do it with less mana. All is well, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Besides, if you want to heal so well, why not just play a cleric?</div></div><hr />

     That may be the problem . torpor ,our best heal ,was suffisant on basic a average pre pop . Mob now deal at least 2* dmg ,but our heal don't heal more. That again not a surprise we're the only priest without healing upgrade (except tnarg but it's a lifesaver) with pop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe that's because clerics and druids don't have slow - You basically need a slower anywhere in PoP to be able to get good exp and kill some tough mob, but you can do at least the exp part well without a cleric and/or druid, and you could hunt well enough pre PoP even without a slower.. <br />
The basic role of the classes is reinforced with PoP as the mobs deal a lot of damage and are worth a lot of exp.. You need a slower, and usually a plate tank and a cleric.<br />
<br />
We traded off some of our healing power for the fact that we're now a lot more needed than before.</div></div><hr />
