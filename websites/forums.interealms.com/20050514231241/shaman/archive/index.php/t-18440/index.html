<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a problem with my drogmor...<br />
I TAKE FALL DAMAGE WHEN I DISMOUNT. <br />
Is my drogmor too big for a little troll? <br />
Am i too fat and i hit the land harder?<br />
Is my troll so stupid that he can't stay on his feet?<br />
I am just curious, because 5 points of dmg is nothing, but i think i should be able to dismount my drogmor without falling to the ground. It is a bit embarrasing :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Is my troll so stupid that he can't stay on his feet? <br />
<br />
Yep  ;) <br />
<br />
Im sure its probably an annoyance, but a minor one at that. I think they tried to patch this problem a while back but evidently didnt get it. If its bothering you /bug it. I doubt anything would happen but thats your only choice, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's a silly bug, but there's a way around it-- just click on your horsey icon to dismount instead of /dismounting.  You don't ever fall that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have the same problem, and I'm just a skinny barb! I've tried leaving stuff in the bank to see if that helped, but nope. Makes for some fun times around my more sarcastic friends, tho =)</div></div><hr />

I have the same problem (made all the worse when I'm carrying 1500pp, 1000gp, 1200sp, 1000cp from killin' HGs and take 45 damage from dropping 3 feet to the ground).  I usually use /dism to get off my drogmoor, and I've found that if I type /dism and start moving immediately I rarely take damage.  'Course, I don't expect this /bug to be fixed anytime soon...God knows there're doors in HK that seriously need SOE's attention.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh man, when I first saw the title of this thread I thought it was a boyfriend / girlfriend thing.<br />
<br />
Ladies, we love ya, but please, don't ask that question. Because smart a5535 like me respond sometimes without thinking.<br />
<br />
You know I really did like her. Honest. Sure she had gained a couple of pounds while I was working out 3x a day but the sex was great and she was great to be around.<br />
<br />
Then she went shopping one day and came back with a tight, tight red dress. Now she DID look good, but she had also gained a &quot;couple&quot; of pounds in the stomache (not pregnant) and legs area. Nothing serious - but it was more than the sex could take off. I was in an onery mood and the conversation went like this:<br />
<br />
Her (wearing new dress): Does this dress make me look fat?<br />
Me ( with my nano-second response): No your stomache does.<br />
<br />
And as soon as you say it - you know the 'relationship' has changed. You make that stupid &quot;aaah&quot; sound as you try and shove the words back into your mouth. <br />
<br />
/e sighs. No luck. They're out there like a fart in a church. <br />
<br />
I miss her. <br />
<br />
Oh and speaking of falling and weight - if there's an annoying trader you KNOW has tons of money, cast levitation on them. (Note that may have changed). Out of bazaar they'll die when they fall. In bazaar you MIGHT be able to push them into arena. (Or so I have read...looks away innocently).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL Faern!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zugarbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL, Faern.<br />
<br />
BTW, this whole falling dmg from dismount can be avoided by simply clicking off the icon in yer buff bar.  In fact, it's the ONLY way I have ever sent my drog away.<br />
<br />
Speaking of mounts, I still crack up when I think about the screenshots of the horse that got charmed, bucked its owner and started attacking the group.  I nearly peed my britches. :)<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, your horse just bit me!&quot;<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
mounts, you gotta love em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A warrior friend of mine hit canni5 on his shaman bot a bit early. Canni5 knocked her unconcious, the fall from the horse killed her ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">if you ever REALLY wanna have fun with a friends account get a lev and run out from the top of the DL spires.<br />
<br />
/sit<br />
/camp<br />
<br />
when it gets to 5 on the count down you count down 2 seconds ahead and click off lev.<br />
<br />
nothing like logging into a thud ;)</div></div><hr />
