<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xmepretty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can a 65 shaman solo camp the reet froglok+juggs in seb for the reet froglok crown in seb?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes, it can be tough because of adds but you i have tanked MANY lower seb mobs at a time when they are slowed...<br />
<br />
after the jail (and in the jail if you are lucky), you can most likely invis all the way to juggs camp.  it all depends on how patient you are.  clearing juggs solo is easy if you make sure to keep them slowed.<br />
hardest part is splitting the juggs past the door.  if you are lucky you can get a 2 pull and then a 3 pull which really means you are going to win.  after this room it is all cake =)<br />
<br />
i guess if you don't have one of the torpor line it could be hard /shrug...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it took me like 15 hours of camping those stupid things to get my crown, most of which i did solo.  the best place to camp is the &quot;trak prep room&quot;, where only 2 froglok reets spawn.  gotta be really careful tho because once they flee (if your'e not proc or click snaring) they can aggro a lot fast.  fighting down you can clear to jail, kill through it, invis past juggs to the door, and then you have to clear the room with 5 juggs + 4 reets in it.  i don't reccomend camping that room, but everything beyond it to traks lair is good.  i pulled to trak prep spot, be careful tho 1 time i had a jugg warp thru that rock into the full spawn 9 mob room and had to summon &gt;&lt;.  it's doable just boring and annoying, my reccomendation is, bring a melee friend.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tasbor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wont suggest to solo in there. All mobs summon, and this is a pain for solo!! <br />
Many mobs on the way wont come single.<br />
<br />
I've gone there few days ago. We were 3 : Ranger, Rogue and me. We did very well, and got 2 crowns in less than 2 hours. We cleared all in juggs and in caverns to Trak prep room.<br />
<br />
Btw if u grab friends, dont forget to take gate gotion for non gaters, as u cant open the door while you are inside juggs. Or get an evaccer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh a bard friend and my ranger helped another bard friend camp at trak spawn the other week.. We forgot about the door so did a cheeky little trick pulling a mob which would run close to the door, killing it down so it would run off a little + open door for us then kill it once we were through :P<br />
<br />
A good one to remember, this doesnt work on locked doors by the way.. I've tried it before at crypt and door didnt open mob just went straight through =(</div></div><hr />
