<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why are people so narrowminded and afraid to step outside the box ?<br />
<br />
My story :<br />
<br />
Im went AFK in PoTactics last night and was killed by a train or something, i dont know. I log on and im too old to rez, so im like hey, no big, ill have to slum it and go to BoT or something, i mean im at 98%, i can just level for 30-50 min and find the group a new slower and call it a night. <br />
<br />
Well all goes well, i put up LFG and like 5-10 min later i have ainvite to BoT. I loathe BoT with a unparraled hatred, but hey, its the best place for fast exp that i have access too.<br />
<br />
I get to the group and its a wizzy a ranger me ( shaman ) a druid and a pally. They all run off to get C and the Pally goes LD. So after 5 min of sitting there looking at each other with no talking, im like &quot; ready to pull ?&quot; They laugh at me and say hardly, so im like &quot; You harmo and ill tank. &quot; Basicly that gets a laugh and jokes about meming gate and lots of pain come into play. At this point im losing patience as i remember times me and kraeger ( LoV ) used to do groups where i would be the main healer and slower and he would tank and vise versa. So after a few more min the wizzy says he needs to go and at that point in my mind i had enough of this group. I mean they seemed realy nice people, im not saying they werent, but i was about ready to start soling the west halls. so i left.<br />
<br />
Was i just a prick or is it that hard to realize you dont need a Pally/SK/Warrior to make enough exp that itll far out weight sitting around looking at each other.<br />
<br />
Open your minds FFS =\</div></div><hr />

&quot;Think outside the box?&quot; Are you mad!  Whether it's the holy trinity, the path of least resistance, or any variant in between, if EQ players have shown ANYTHING in the past 4 years it's that they are NOT about taking risks.<br />
<br />
Good Lord man, I mean if you died on that pull it might be 30 minutes before you get your experience back. Better to &quot;not risk it.&quot; Better still to join an already formed group than actually put one together and see how it goes. <br />
<br />
Oh for the days in Kunark when I (as a Monk) was tanking the Shroom add while the Paladin (yes Paladin), Bard, Mage and Druid finished off the King. No fear, just enjoying the game AS a game and not an electronic race to.......the next expansion I suppose.</div></div><hr />

Actually, all you really need is a tank and puller, and you probably have enough :eek:<br />

<br />
Enchanters who cannot cast rapture, pallies who acn't stun, warriors who dont use bows, rangers who cant root, Druids who dot the **** out of a mob and get themselves killed (despite being the only healer) Wizards who refuse to stop nuking, Clerics who refuse to cast anything but supernal remedy until they are out of mana.<br />
<br />
They're all out there. And face it - they're the majority. The majority of Everquest players are fvcktards. Period. Complete and utter fvcktards. So am I going to trust a shaman to tank for me? no. Am I going to let a cleric pull? no.</div></div><hr />

Its a misconception that most retarded players are below 18 and ebay their account.  Kids would not have the money to pay for it and their parents would not be paying for it either.  So basically what we really have are just your plain old everyday retards...like the majority of people you run into everyday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I go with the flow.  If I join a group and a BST is the tank, I'll give them one fight to prove to me that it works.  Sometimes it does; sometimes it doesn't.  I normally (80%) of the time go with the holy trinity (cleric, tank, slower), but I also get into kiting-groups, pet-groups, etc...  I've had groups where the cleric did a fantastic job of pulling; a BST did a great job of tanking; or a pally did a great job of healing.<br />
<br />
And conversely, I've gotten into groups where the monk couldn't single pull for his life; the ranger would take riposte damage and forget to attack off on Enrage; the wizard tells the group, &quot;wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww&quot; 'cause his head is on the keyboard; and I was the main healer in a group that had a cleric.<br />
<br />
Just gotta go with the flow and with whatever works.</div></div><hr />

The pets didn't have enough HP /sigh I offered to tank, not like things would last long with a pair of necros and I'm sure the Cleric could keep me alive easily. <br />
<br />
Instead they disbanded. Whatever, I knew there was a reason I hate pick up groups. I tank for the trio I play with, things hit me for 200ish regularly and it is no big deal (thanks mudflation).<br />

Overpull? Add? The ranger will aggro one and root it off.  It's summoning? The other ranger will tank.  Shaman LoM? Paladin slaps down a LoH and we have a canni break (with the paladins and rangers all patch healing).</div></div><hr />

Got there and things were going ok.  Getting a bit of exp and killing time.  Something happened to our sk...so I offered to tank for a bit.  Of course the group asked if I was kidding.  My reply was &quot;inc&quot;.  Slowed on pull and went heavy on dots (BoS, ASoN, and BoN) and casted Q on myself.  Healer never had to touch me.  When the SK came back, some tactless fool in the group told him that I tanked better...hehe...he left.</div></div><hr />

I am of the mind give me 6 and ill make it work, but too many people are just afraid (of what I do not know its only a game). Thats why I only do guild groups where everyone is willing to push the envelope as far as we can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">As mentioned by someone above, mudflation makes huge differences in gear.  Add the gear disparity onto the fact that you can get 1-65 now in less time than it took me to do 1-45, and you can do it without ever seeing a raid, without ever getting gear that costs more than 1-2k per piece in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
So you have level 65 &quot;plate tanks&quot; running around in half-crusty half-kunark wielding frostbringers and yaks and you wonder why these people won't take risks?  <br />
<br />
I had a group of friends screwing around one afternoon before raids.  We were playing in HoH shortly after the level restriction was dropped, and our tank left to get food before raid time.  No problem, but with the way the group was set (1 rogue, 1 rogue twink, a monk, a mage and me) I decided I would be happier if someone else taunted so I picked out a LFG 64 warrior who had wandered in (figuring anything that would hold the mob while I pulled and the others did DPS was fine).<br />
<br />
Well, after slow I noticed quiescence (used 1 per mob on the previous tank) was not keeping up with the mob's damage on the warrior.  Well, I figured it was a lack of defensive aa's, and I loaded Kraggs figuring I might get off a little cheaper that way.  Warrior hit half, I hit Kragg, and warrior was full.  Ok, recount, huh?  Why would a 64 warrior have 5k hp with focus?  Inspect...hello crusty/fine steel/assorted crap I would have sold to a vendor.<br />
<br />
How they made 64 remains a mystery.  After that I developed a mysterious inability to control my DoT agro (not hard) and saved myself mana by tanking until raid time.  Still, it is best to realize, with the gear levels some of the people are at, and the fact that your PUG partners may be used to dealing with warriors at less than 1100 AC, their timidness may be all too firmly based in experience.<br />
<br />
Still, if they had abilities equivalent to yours, and you felt like tanking, it is their loss if they didn't want in on the experience.</div></div><hr />

On tanking ... I am not the toughest tank but last night we were waiting for the mage to come back to tank for our group (?) .. we only had a rogue at that point who wasn't decked out at all.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I generally have good luck with pickup groups and I try to have mercy on those that are less EQ-knowledgeable.  I have a lot to learn, particularly about newer content, but due to the fact that I played EQ from release to just before Kunark in my 1st EQ life I have some solid foundations and oodles of grouping experiences in all types of situations.  Many EQers are students of the game and learn vast volumes of information pertaining to it...but I think there are also many that do not and enjoy the game without going that deep.<br />
<br />
Most people I meet are laid back, cool, and willing to experiment...but then some are really uptight and seem to only want 'the perfect group'.  Sad thing is, it usually takes a while to get 'the perfect group' and often the person that wanted it the most bails out half an hour later anyways.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br />

<br />
<br />
from my experience a good puller is the key. Get a crazy stream of mobs headed into the camp and people will either deal with it with skill or fall apart. Normally I can tell what kind of group we have by how they speak and look. As long as I can get whoever is pulling to chain pull in ones or twos I'm happy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">i get a bit upset when people just don't realize that I'm able to tank in some situations.  I mean, today was in a pickup group in earth.  I'm with 5 other people that I know, from the guild that just got to the elementals.  First, the main tank (sk) wanted to be the puller too cause the ranger in the group doesn't know or understand the concept of how to pull (i'm not kidding.. she's a RL friend and totally clueless).  Second, if they pulled two mobs, i couldn't get them to understand that as soon as the mob is slowed, I can easily tank the second one (had a pally in the group too for a bit, and I have more hps than he does, and he has none of his defensive AAs).  It just kinda upset me, not cause I realize that my job in the group is to slow, heal if necessary, and do exta dmg, but cause I know these people and they have gotten too used to shamans that don't have jack for hps and such.  I just think that they were afraid to let me do it cause they are used to their shamans dying too quickly around there (hell, I did the same when I first got to the elementals).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The problem is that high end EQ is so incredibly loot-centric. (Well, low end EQ is too, but the combination of mudflation and bored 65's turning to tradeskills has the average lowbie in gear that a level 50 warrior would have sold his firstborn for back before Kunark.)<br />
<br />
'There are no great warriors with a sword in EQ, there are warriors with great swords.' someone said on a board recently, and I heartily agree.<br />
<br />
AA's help some, and mudflation helps alot. (Any warrior at 65 with less than 54 ac on his bp needs to be taken out back and shot. Spend 5k in the bazaar already!)<br />
<br />
But at the end of the day you need items.<br />
<br />
With friends and guildmates I've been in many an amazing group, thinking so far outside the box that you'd think we'd wandered over to some other game.<br />
<br />
But in a PUG with perhaps 1-2 people I know and the rest a mixed group of idiots swept of the streets? No thanks. Thinking inside the box is enough.<br />
<br />
Though generally saying &quot;At worst we pop in graveyard in 15 and I log on a cleric to rez us for 96% so lets try&quot; is enough to get people adventurous.<br />
<br />
Which I guess is why I am loath to wander outside locked zones if I can help it. Err, switching to my shammy as my main and never logging on my rogue again has put me in contact with many an amazing PUG though.<br />
<br />
But, it's a game and at worst I'm laughing at someone elses expense. The cost of a death is negligible. Even an unrezzed death at 65 isn't all that much exp. And a rezzed death is just time lost and buffing to redo.<br />
<br />
God I rambled.</div></div><hr />

But aye, as shamen, we likely end up tanking adds if there is no mezzer in a group, so if we are sufficiant at that, why it doesnt occur to people we can MT the same mobs...<br />
<br />
Did a dungeon with a warrior RL friend of mine.  His sister (a bard) needed to afk, we were bored and pulled anyway.  Well we had 4 mobs from that pull.  He tanked all four for about as long as it took me to slow the 1st mob, after that I had the other 3 slowed/rooted/pet or self tanked while he picked them off one by one.  (btw his cleric-bot threw me 1 heal, rest were all self heals while he consentrated on nuking through 'em.  He now realizes the power of the shammy (was only 63 at the time) and with canny I ended the fight at about 70m =)<br />
