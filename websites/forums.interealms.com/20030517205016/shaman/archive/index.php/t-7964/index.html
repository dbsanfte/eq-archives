<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elrie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am wondering if it's possible to MQ the turn in of the Iksar Child's Tear to spawn Rak Ashiir for the final battle for the Epic. If so, is there any way to determine if the person with the tear has high enough faction?<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If the shaman doing the MQing has already been epic'd and has not taken any truespirit faction hits it should be fine.<br />
<br />
However you can go to the final quest NPC (doggie in EJ pond somewhere) and say &quot;what breach&quot; and if you get the answer I think it's ok.<br />
<br />
Make sure you do this as well, if you have factioned to skip a fight or two<br />
And make sure you have recieved a &quot;Your truespirit faction could not possibly get better&quot; message.<br />
I.e. get MAX ally Truespirit.<br />
<br />
If either of you is not MAX ally truespirit then repeat the Envy/Woe portion over and over until you are.<br />
<br />
Won't take TOO many repetitions. Took me maybe 5 to go from Giosk's books stage to MAX ally. <br />
I Think the envy/woe NPC's are 2 hr repops? Can't remember exact spawn time. Check the walk-throughs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It works, I have done it for another shaman,  but as the poster above stated you need to be max true spirit before you finish the quest.  And the person who turns it in should be an epic shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The search feature is really great on this board, use it!<br />
This question has been answerde more times that I can even think of.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Malkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, seems like I was able to get a response to the question about the breach before I had Max Ally. Think the safest route would be to the turn in Envy, Woe, and Marr's Promise again to double check it, or maybe just the first bit in Freeport.<br />
<br />
I should note that I haven't actually done the quest any further than to turning in the gem from the Wandering Spirit to the Spirit in the Emerald Jungle. I do have Max Ally though from doing it several times up to that point.<br />
<br />
Good luck in any event.<br />

Edit: Forgot a word in there... Heh, should change my Signature too, I'm level 43 now.</div></div><hr />
