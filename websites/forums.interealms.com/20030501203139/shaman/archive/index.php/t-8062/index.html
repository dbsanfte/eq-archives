<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, this is very odd.<br />
<br />
I've gotten tells in the past 2 week asking for Selos potions.<br />
<br />
Now, first time I said, &quot;You mean SoW potions?&quot;<br />
Reply &quot;Nope Selo's&quot;<br />
<br />
They told me how a buddy bought a 10 charge for 100p. Yep, you guessed it.... I said &quot;100p huh? You mean SoW potions then.&quot;<br />
Reply &quot;Nope Selo's&quot;<br />
<br />
Do a /who n00b<br />
n00b [Bard] 41!?!<br />
<br />
So I explain that I've never heard of them. And they should have a nice day.<br />
<br />
Next day I get another tell. Selo's potions and they want some of those C3 potions as well. (My alchemy skill is 98 so it's not like the &quot;clarity&quot; potions are trivial) I told them the clarity potions are no where near C3 and never heard of Selo's.<br />
<br />
So, I get  asked this 2 more times (Selo's potions) over the past week. Has anyone ever heard of these or are they all nuts/misinformed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">missinformed nuts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A Selos potion, oh yes, I can see that...<br />
<br />
100pp for a potion that gives a 6-second 100% increase in runspeed!<br />
<br />
1000pp for a 2-minute one that gives 150% runspeed!<br />
<br />
Dunno how many times I've been asked to make damage potions, &quot;you know, the kind you throw at the mob&quot;...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I love that sort of request... it always cracks me up.<br />
<br />
I tell them I'm an alchemist, not an explosives expert! Do I look like a gnome? heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Stackable potions that use the Throwing skill would be an interesting idea though... How about throwing a potion of weakness at a mob? does some dmg &amp; casts weakness on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd love that. <br />
<br />
There is a dropped &quot;vial `O sumthin&quot; (tm) that has a poison or dis proc when you throw it. Would be really cool to be able to throw debuffs or small dmg at the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Would rathe throw small tactical nuclear bombs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good idea! Shout &quot;Fire in the Hole!&quot;, lob in you're alchemical grenade and duck...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I want to throw a potion called Gnomish Revenge, and when it hits the mob, a gnome appears from nowhere and starts biting said mobs ankles for insane damage...or no damage...that's not really the important part of it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Vial of disgusting substance or a name close to that, procs desiese.  Looks like a green test tube.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shanelle Heartogold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">OMG!  I love the Gnomish Revenge idea!  But instead of a gnome... make it one of their little clockwork people.  The damage they do should be minor (maybe max of 25hp per tick) but they should be immune to everything other than melee damage, and should poof after the fight like the cleric pet does.  An ingredient could be a vendor-purchaseable gear or something.  ROFL  That would be HILARIOUS!!!  I know people that would buy that and throw it right in the middle of a huge battle just so everybody would end up dying of laughter!  hehehe</div></div><hr />
