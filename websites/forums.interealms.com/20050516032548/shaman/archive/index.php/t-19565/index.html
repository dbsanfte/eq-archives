<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'll officially wait till tuesday, but I hold absolutely no faith that the shaman will get even one bone, (crit dots weeeee so I can solo more eficiently, who the hell cares).<br />
<br />
As of tuesday i'll either, make a beastlord, make a berserker, make both, or just cancel my account.  I do hold one last breath that we get one bone but I dont see it, and without anything to add to a raid force 4 shaman in a guild is 2 too many.<br />
<br />
How do you all feel, on our server its getting tuff to get a group even for LDoN because so many shaman are 65 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congratulations you are the 4000th person on these forums to express dissatifaction with GoD.  Did you really need to make your own thread?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">wow, 9/10 posts i see on this forum now are all about how trashy GoD is going to be for us... Can we please just make a sticky and call it maybe...<br />
Express your uneeded disatisfaction with GoD here!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I say anyone who makes another GoD related whine thread similar to this one gets &quot;I'm special&quot; for a custom title :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">whatever.  seriously though.  word is for example that we are going to have raid limits of 54?<br />
<br />
are you in an elemental PoP guild?  grats on having to zerg force up to beyond the 72 headcount limit for the bigger encounters like Coirnav, Xegony, and the Rathe, only to run into the hard 72 limit in Time...  and now smaller numbers in GoD?  If that proves to be the case then SOE is killing high end PoP guilds...  because of our numbers among other things LDoN has been a total and utter waste from a RAIDING perspective for us.</div></div><hr />
