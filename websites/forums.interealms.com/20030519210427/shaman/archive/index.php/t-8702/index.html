<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hyppon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there, I'm a level 60 shaman with Malo, Torpor, Pox, Epic, JBB and horse, and I was just wondering if someone could provide information on how to do a solo Plane of Growth run.<br />
What should I do before going in? What should I do while in? What shouldn't I do? Please help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bind outside, zone in invis becasue there is an invisible whorele of natural energy at the zone in.  <br />
<br />
Anything on the zone in side of the river is slowable easily after malo/malosini, they just has a lot of hp<br />
<br />
If you get more than one root em and gate<br />
<br />
Fight the mobs near the zone line to avoid adds, work your way along the zone line parallel to the river. <br />
<br />
If for some reason everything on the zone in side of the river is dead, you can still solo the flowery things, and some of the lower level totem pole dudes<br />
<br />
Also, watch out for the wandering named mobs, especially ali the elder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Huksh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On occasion you will get a tranquil treant wandering onto you. Don't bother trying to kill it just gate. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hyppon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">so can I kill all mobs except named or are there other mobs I should stay away from?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huksh mentioned the tranquil treants. Don't bother with them because they will gate and summon you to a very nasty spot.<br />
<br />
Thiflings are pretty nasty little buggers too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hardback</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So the mobs that drop the PoG armor = to thurgadin armor are soloable ??<br />
<br />
curious since I only have one peice of thurgadin gear wouldnt mind the BP or Leg equivalent for sure. <br />
<br />
Im guessing the drop rate is insanly rare also?<br />
<br />
<br />
lvl 60 Iksar here <br />
Epic, Horse, PoX, Torpor, and 8 AA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can root/park adds,mobs aren't that tough if you have malo/torpor.Mobs have alot of HPs tho,be sure to get kei before entering the Plane.<br />
<br />
I killed some named black horse once,that bugger made me gate twice before.HIGH MR,fast,hit for 200.I had to reslow 4-5 times with many resists.Can drop any kind of legs.But be sure you know what you're doing before engaging it.Also,when I killed it,it jumped me while I was on zone wall,behind the zone in.There is very few safe spots when the zone is full.I also got an add on him when the horse was at 20% health.If you don't slow it fast,it's over,you better gate.It will take you every bit of mana to kill that thing.Alot of resists to start isn't a good thing.But everything is possible as a shaman,till you die.<br />
<br />
It's fun,decent cash but poor XP,at least at 62/63.You could end up spending more cash to get a rez up there than what you will get in there hehe.<br />
<br />
Anyway,it's fun to try.Tried it 6 times,4 of them weren't very long runs cuz i got surrounded,bad pewls or that stoopid named.<br />
<br />
Oh,sometimes the zone seems pretty empty,stay invis and explore a bit,it can be tricky.<br />
<br />
White horses can dispell sometimes,so does some stalker I think.<br />
<br />
I'm 63,with cani V,CA3,Spirit call 1,SCR1,malo,torpor,tnarg's mending and true spirit,used weapons for pet on last run only.Had virtue/kei on both of my successful run.<br />
<br />
Always watch your back when pewling,mobs like to sneak between you and your pet :)<br />
<br />
One last thing,good luck and keep gate up all the time.:cool: <br />
<br />
PS: During my 6 runs,I've seen drop:Mage gloves,wizzy piece(crap but don't remember),cleric legs,mnk sleeves,chanter gloves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Full sets of warrior/rogue armor are farmable, my warrior almost has a complete set of beserkers now, just BP and arms left to go.<br />
<br />
Shaman legs/bps, maybe dooable, but since I have both pieces already I havent had the desire to try, tbh at the level/gear requirement to take out the wisps safely solo, chances are you'll have better, they are otherwise just too resisty and hit pretty fast and hard to boot to be a safe shot in sub par gear.<br />
<br />
Otherwise all other minor pieces are easily soloed.<br />
<br />
One oddity however is the Ancient totem, duoing with a mage, nothing else was up nearby, so we thought sod it, loaded CoH and I gave it a shot pulling, at 65 the sod came single and it died to us easily, unfortunately every time I've tried pulling it solo, those little midget totems have come with it, so I have a feeling they simply were not up when I pulled it with the mage.  Does he drop bp/legs?  I have a feeling he rarely drops random legs or something, although I can't say I remember him dropping anything at all on any pog run I've done. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry, for being the complete newbie that I am on upper lvl shaman soloing zones, but can someone please explain to me how I would reach the zone in to PoM.  I know this thread talks about PoG, but I have been trying to figure this out, and it hasn't gone well yet.  Okay, I can get to ToV easily, but I've only been there twice and don't really know my way, except for entering the door on the right once I exit the entrance area.  I know that to get to PoM, i have to go to NTOV, but where and how from there.  Can I get there solo, or will I have to look for someone to be heading there and ride piggyback with them?  Any help would be much appreciated thanks.</div></div><hr />

I do not know much of that shiny brass idol, so I guess that I will have to check it out.  Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />

The flurry drakes will eat you quicker than you imagine :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I had the question about the Protectors of Growth still having zone wide agro. So i asked Henora and she said they no longer do so of course I started hitting PoG often. This place is a joke until ya get back near the phase panthers. I use the dog of course and keep annul up due to the damn ranger buffs freely passed out by the various mobs in the zone. They do have a ton of HPs so i started 2 boxing my friends monk for added damage and quicker fights. I only go in PoG for the insane cash item drops. I usually make roughly 2k and hour if the zone is fully populated and the drops are going in my favor. If money is your desire this place is pretty nice (EXPs suck though)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I love soloing in PoG.<br />
Its true the exp is very slow. At 90% AA I get 1% AA per kill which isn't horrible.<br />
However the loot is great. Very rarely have I killed a mob that didnt drop a gem/jewelry. It would drop Cystalized Sulfur or something. About 1 out of 5 mobs drops a lvl 50 plus spell.<br />
<br />
I'm lvl 61 w/o Epic, Malo, Pox, Torpor. I do have JBB tho :)<br />
I can solo these particular mobs: (sorry if misspelled)<br />
A Gale Wolf<br />
Spirit Flux Wolf<br />
Glade Stalker<br />
Sanguine Kodiak<br />
Rolling Plain Steeds<br />
A Feral Amalgam<br />
<br />
I've avoided Galiel Swifthoof and Farstride Unicorn.<br />
I've also seen a giant bear named Spirt Stalker, avoided him as well.<br />
And as the above posters mentioned, avoid the wandering Tranquil Treant. I've seen him wander all over, and when Im aggroed I let pet get on him and I run far away and sit/camp.<br />
I've never had to gate out thus far with any trouble I've ran into.<br />
<br />
I pull with Malosini, then I slow. I apply Bane of Nife, Plague, and Cripple. I tank in the face (all mobs summon). They hit for a max of 160 or so I think. Meanwhile I just chain cast JBB with pet (61 True Spirit) biting on his rear. If the mob is not a caster I use my Barbaian Spirist Hammer and swing that between the JBB casts. I reapply Bane of Nife maybe 2 more times if that. Mobs are fairly easy, but just have a lot of hps. <br />
Sometimes I do get adds, and sometimes I can handle an add that comes in during the middle of the fight. This all varies on the type of mob and if its a caster or not. Usually I can just root the add and be ok for awhile. I've only died once while soloing in PoG and thats because I went LD after pulling a caster mob and I coudlnt get back into the server cause of the &quot;Active character&quot; message for like 15 mins. When I logged back on, was naked, and I went back to PoG and couldnt find my corpse. I looked all over and no trace. I ended up buying a Necrotic Divining Device (ammo slot) for 600pp in the bazaar and going back to PoG and found it stuck in a tree, hehe.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I keep up all buffs and resists while fighting in PoG, it helps to resists the casters, as they almost always try to cast Ensnaring Roots. They seem to land Drifting Death on me quite easily and they usually have a Thorns damage shield on them which seem to tear away at my dogs hps very fast. I haven't tried pulling with a Cancel magic type of spell, it may help though.<br />
I've seen a lot of various armor for many classes drop and rot. I have a near full set of Assassin armor for my Rogue (minus the Boots and Gloves) that I have got from soloing there. The mobs corpses take 7min approx to rott which is plenty of time to camp and log onto an alt hehe.<br />
<br />
I've literally almost completely cleared the zone of all these mobs:<br />
A Gale Wolf, Spirit Flux Wolf, Glade Stalker, Sanguine Kodiak, Rolling Plain Steeds when soloing for a couple days at 8 plus hours at a time. For the past week or so, I been logging on and hunting there and its almost always nearly empty. I usually don't even pull to a spot, I just kill them on the spot if I find a mob.<br />
<br />
I've seen guilds and some groups come in the zone and they give me a tell asking where all the mobs are. I tell them that the mobs east of the stream, such as the Thiflings, Sylvan Protectors, &amp;  Serene Forest Spirits should be up. I even have Druids come in that are just there to forage Planar Oak for making Blessed Fishing poles. asking me why is the zone so empty and if there was a raid earlier.<br />
I'm not sure of the spawn time, but I believe the mobs are 8 plus hours.<br />
<br />
I make around 1.5kpp to 2kpp per hour. Great place to farm for pp, as now I avoid Sebilis and RM when trying to get some fast and easy money.<br />
Hope this info helps. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Benorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I tried PoG and it was great :)   Seems to always be scarce of mobs so it's cake pulling. (so far so good).<br />
<br />
Seem to make from 1.2k - 2k  in merchant bait loot per hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
PoG is fun, and geat loot.  as stated above,  keep bound outside so you can gate on adds.  well, unless you run into some giant tree that cast silence on you and you have to run around zone for 10mins before you can cast a spell *sigh*.<br />
<br />
2 thumbs up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tried it out with a Necro, Beastlord, Shaman (me)  and Wizard last night.<br />
<br />
Things got a little hectic a couple times with adds, but no wipes. :)<br />
<br />
Rot won various pieces of armor, the Beastlord got some boots and the final split after a couple hours was 850pp each, 3 BDs and a bunch of spells.<br />
<br />
We were going to avoid Farstride Unicorn, but the thing got close to us and agrod so we had no choice but to fight it. Easy fight, dropped 11pp. :(<br />
<br />
Great fun, plan to go back ASAP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Panou Balou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Galiel Swifthoof : did someone soloed it ? i need informations about this damn roamer on the west wall pls. :mad:<br />

<br />
KoS info: Sisters Island in the OOT, NPCs there will jump you, so try to think about it before to roam around them, one is yellow at lvl60, nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Akhasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Galiel Swifthoof is soloable. I haven't done it, but only because I can't manage to get him without adds (actually, I'm using fighting something else and he adds). I actually had him to about 50% once before I had to gate due to add.<br />
<br />
He's pretty magic resistant, but not totally.  After malo, I am usually able to slow him within a couple tries.  <br />
<br />
I've only been up there a few times soloing, and those times only for a few minutes.  I&quot;m hoping to spend more time up there pretty soon because  I need the money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Galiel Swifthoof- Pull with Malo then slow. If you can stick root do it.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fynris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">62 Shaman, w Epic, JBB, Torpor, Malo, Cann 5, True Spirit<br />
<br />
The question I have for you all is this.. what is your spell line up for soling PoG?<br />
<br />
Mine looks like this;<br />
1) Torpor<br />
2) Spirit Quickening (rotating out buffs and True Spirit)<br />
3) Cannabilize IV<br />
4) Greater Immobilize<br />
5) Malo (rotate Bane of Nife)<br />
6) Pox of Bertoxxolous<br />
7) Turgurs<br />
8) Gate<br />
<br />
MY tactic has been to use slot 2 to summon a puppy and buff it and myself all up ending with Spirit Quickening in that slot.<br />
<br />
I usually park the pet.. pull to it using Turgurs. I'll let pet engage, root mob and back up... Malo it, Epic, Pox, Bane, reapply Root back up and begin alternating cannabilizing and JBB.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Once a mob is rooted and engaged with the pet, it will NOT summon you. Once root breaks, it either summons you or runs straight to you.<br />
<br />
Each fight usually takes about 5 minutes... I reapply Epic/Bane/Pox twice, maybe 3 times max... end the fight with about 80% mana usually... I try not to use Cann 5 during the fight to prevent low life agro and issues. <br />
<br />
Comments??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">My spell line up for PoG is this:<br />
<br />
1) Torpor<br />
2) Bane of Nife (swap Pox in here)<br />
3) Turgur's<br />
4) Annul Magic<br />
5) Malo<br />
6) Gate<br />
7) Breath of Ultor<br />
8) Cannibalize 4<br />
<br />
I've just about convinced myself that I can lose Gate and either keep Pox permanently memmed or put Primal Avatar there for pet.  It's easy to mem Gate real fast if I need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm lacking the expensive spells and epic, but my spell line up is this:<br />
<br />
1) Malosini (once applied, I switch to Cripple) Buff Swap<br />
2) Replenishment<br />
3) Cann IV<br />
4) Superior Healing<br />
5) Plague<br />
6) Instill<br />
7) Bane of Nife<br />
8) Turgur's Insects<br />
<br />
I just tank, JBB and reapply Bane a few times. Plague usually wears off when mob is at 30% health.<br />
I can handle 1 add if it's not a caster by keeping it parked and slowed.<br />
I've never had to gate yet, just root and then run off far out of aggro range and camp; then log back in.<br />
I like to stay bound at PoK near Nexus stone, as I can gate back there to sell quickly, grab a KEI &amp; Virtue from the Chanter &amp; Cleric peeps casting for donations in Nexus. Then grab a port back to WL from the Wizard/Druid peeps porting for donations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Benorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">1) Canny IV<br />
2) Gate<br />
3) Torpor<br />
4) Tnarg's Mending<br />
5) Root (swap out slot)<br />
6) Bane of Knifage<br />
7) Turgur's Insects<br />
8) Malosini<br />
<br />
<br />
this place is a joke; hehe.  pull with Malosini,   Slow at camp, tank with doggy at back while epic dotting and Bane dotting.<br />
<br />
Last time I was in this place, it was so clear I was able to set up on east side of lake camp and fight the wisp.  They a frickin intense fight with only self buffs.<br />
<br />
for wisp, I pull with annul magic twice while inc.   then chain ghetto malise till it lands (god I want Malo)  if still resisting by time I get to camp, I send in dog dog to hold him off for another shot.  If malise still resisted you have no choice to but to slow and cross your fingers; hehe.<br />
<br />
First thing chanter wisp (green) will do is Tash you so it's nice to have newb posion cure or radiant cure AA to cancel it out quick.  After that, he'll most likely charm you *sigh*.  then your dog is history.  Charm isn't that big a deal though, you basically just sit there for 30secs or so and nothing happens.  Same with fear, just sit there lookin stupid for a bit (unless you're running, then fear will keep you moving in that direction. So be a man and don't run around like a druid)<br />
<br />
After you get thru a couple of charms, maybe a easily resisted dot, and fear or 2, he's pretty toasted on mana. so now it's just a good ole melee battle for 10mins and you can recast dog dog if you lucky.   <br />
<br />
Key to making it thru wisp fight is having canny5 and torpor.  when getting low on mana, just make sure you have torpor ticking on you with at least 2300hp's then cross your fingers and hit canny5 :). if torpor not gaining quick enough then it's nice to have a quick heal to save your ass (Tnarg's so powa!)<br />
<br />
Repeat and Rince with dots in between and laugh as all he can do is tash you over and over cause he have no mana to make it thru the long haul like a shammy!<br />
<br />
PS. RESLOW EARLY,  even after full malise they still reisist somewhat and last one I fought saved enough mana to chain stun my ass after slow bounced 2 times, and he rebuffed himself with haste and tore me open afterwards<br />
<br />
<br />
Wizzy wisp (orange) is same long fight, but you have to survive thru the nukage till they out of mana,  keeping torpor up and quick healing when big nukes land for a couple mins and you are home free.  I got resist upto 200 once and was still taking 600 damage from nukes.<br />
<br />
<br />
wisp are damn fun to fight, but don't try without torpor and canny5 or you'll never keep your mana up.<br />
<br />
killed about 10 wisp so far with only one death due to slow resist then the chain stun thing :(    Seen bard legs drop, but still no BP (yeah, they have our Thurg equivalent BP, check my sux gear and you'll see I need one; lol)<br />
<br />
Wisp are fun, now everyone go try; woot</div></div><hr />
