<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My wife plays a 56 rogue and I play a 54 shaman. Her gear is pre-planar with one or 2 nice pieces. My gear is pre-planar as well. We often only log on for an hour or two nightly. As such, we often have little time to find a group. Are there any places where someone could recommend we go to hunt for experience? We've tried Nadox near the zone-in from Gunthak (through the luggald castle there), but after the first room or so, we have problems with the gating mobs. <br />
<br />
Also, since I am approaching 55, I have been starting to watch the costs of the spells I'll be needing more closely. I see that on Tunare, many are quite expensive through to level 60 and beyond. At my level, would it be more worthwhile to start focusing on improving my gear with the money I get, or start saving up for the spells/research components?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your input.<br />
<br />
P.S. I need to adjust my Magelo profile a little, and will add it later (can't do that at work).</div></div><hr />
