Any ideas???</div></div><hr />

Here's a recent screenshot:<br />

I'm not sure I've posted the most recent patch of it, but I think I have.  If so, it should be at:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eddiedale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I absolutely love the look of this UI, could someone please explain how to install it.  I have downloaded the patched version from the link, but now what.  I guess I'm kinda un-educated on this stuff.  Thanks much in advance...!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yelara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Installing a UI is simple.<br />
<br />
Create a new folder in your Everquest uifiles folder. Make it something simple - Like Shaman or something (No spaces in the name)<br />
<br />
Unzip the UI files to that folder<br />
<br />
Load EQ and open the Options window (Alt-O) and choose Load UI. A list should pop up of any UI's you have installed. Make sure Use INI is selected and click Load UI<br />
<br />
After a few whirs and clicks and what looks like a screen freeze you should see the new UI files in the same arrangement as your old UI. Just move the boxes around to suit the new windows and you're all set.</div></div><hr />

Heres another option to take a look at. It's a heavily modded version of Telgar's Icey Blue UI, patched and working with all of the latest updates. I've kept it simple to give the most viewable area. <br />
<br />
The screenshot is in 1280 x 1024 but it works just as well in 1024 x 768. Any smaller and you'd most likely have to delete a chat window or 2 but it should still fit.<br />

You can download the Zip file HERE (http://www.speakeasy.org/~overshoe/Shaman%20UI/)<br />
<br />
Installing it is easy. Unzip the files into a folder named ModA in your  uifiles folder. Rename and the UI_Character_Number.ini file to your character name and server number and copy it to your main EQ folder. Load EQ and enjoy.</div></div><hr />

I run that UI in 800x600, and I like it ok.<br />
<br />
I cut out all the titles around windows I didn't want, and resized the song (short-duration buff) window a tad to make it fit everything up into the top right corner above the player window<br />
<br />
I modified the playerwindow to show fatigue as the kakhi sub-bar on the player's health, and gave a full pet bar with name and % health below it.<br />
<br />
Wis: is just above the mana window, and everything has it's numeric % out to the right.  I put current AC, encumberance, and resists just below the 2 experience bars.<br />
<br />
Group window I made a tad larger, but stripped the title off, and then put each player with a full bar for player and pet, along with F# key, and % out ot the rights.<br />
<br />
Target window, I have mob_name and %, and then my own health, mana, and pet listed again, just so I don't have to look away from the target window to see my critical bars.  Spellbar - horizontal and resized to how I like it in 800x600.  buff-window, I actually took from someone else a while back, but I've forgotten who.  Same with the pet-window timer.  They were written by someone else and I just use 'em.  Overall, it does what I need without a lot of frills, and I'm happy with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eddiedale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ok...i'm using this ui now and thanks for the help in loading it.  One question though, when i click on the pet tab a timer comes up, what's it for, and how do I get the pet commands window to appear.  now that I have a pet ( 34 shaman...yah ), i want to use the pet command window like what's in the game default ui.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Ed.</div></div><hr />

You can usually just go into your custom ui folder and delete the pet info window then repatch that will give you the default pet window back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eddiedale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ok...excuse the ignorance but, i found the pet info window in the custom ui folder and deleted it, what do you mean by repatch..?  how do I do that exactly..?</div></div><hr />
