<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let's get her this time.  Call all your wizard and enchanter friends.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, folks.  This ugly beast was the cause of five, count em, FIVE wipeouts for KoE's youger generation this weekend.  We must remedy this matter as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
To that end I am looking for groups to take her down tonight!  Here's what we need.<br />
<br />
<br />
Minimum 5 groups, I would prefer to see six.  <br />
<br />
Group 1<br />
1.  Main melee ( like to see at least level 50 here )<br />
2.  Melee<br />
3.  Bard<br />
4.  Cleric<br />
5.  Healer<br />
6.  Open<br />
<br />
Group 2<br />
1. Melee<br />
2. Melee<br />
3. Enchanter<br />
4. Damage dealer<br />
5. Cleric<br />
6. Healer<br />
<br />
Group 3<br />
1. Melee<br />
2. Open<br />
3. Enchanter<br />
4. Open<br />
5. Open<br />
6. Healer<br />
<br />
Group 4 (Team Nuke)<br />
1. Wizard<br />
2. Wizard<br />
3.Enchanter<br />
4. Wizard/Mage<br />
5. Wizard/Mage/Bard<br />
6. Healer<br />
<br />
Group 5<br />
1. Open<br />
2. Open<br />
3. Open <br />
4. Open<br />
5. Open<br />
6. Healer<br />
<br />
Group 6<br />
1. Open<br />
2. Open<br />
3. Open<br />
4. Open<br />
5. Open<br />
6. Healer<br />
<br />
<br />
We will take folks up to 7:30 EST, but no more than 40 for the raid itself.  Massive LD from too many people won't impress the dragon.<br />
<br />
Resist gear is an absolute must. CR and MR are the ones you need.  <br />
<br />
We also HAVE to have at least three enchanters with the spell mana sieve ready to go.  Vox has this nasty habit of Complete Healing herself, and the only way to stop her is for enchanters to mana sieve her and make sure she doesn't have the mana to cast the spell.<br />
<br />
I will be assembling forces when I get online tonight.  We will meet at the King room inside Perma at 8 PM EST to begin buffing and go over tactics.  <br />
<br />
<br />
As always, all higher levels who wish to attend are encouraged to come help clear Ice Giants and such.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:D <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE:  Should we not be able to assemble the forces to go after Vox tonight, I will rescedule this for Wednesday, 9-19, assuming someone doesn't beat us to the punch.</div></div><hr />

I'll park Fedora just inside Perma, and whatever day you go after her, i'll be there.  I understand if this is reserved for guildies only, but I've done Vox before, and I would like another shot at her.<br />

RL issues - getting laid-off and keeping an eye on my 3yr old daughter while my wife works has limited my availability to commit to something like this.<br />
<br />
I want to take her down SOOOOOO bad.<br />
<br />
So... I cannot promise my presence... but hopefully I will be able to make it on as the 4th Enchanter.<br />
<br />
Wed or Thursday I should be available for a more solid commitment if it does not happen tonight.<br />
<br />
Maybe I can borrow Moe's resist gear again?  =)<br />
