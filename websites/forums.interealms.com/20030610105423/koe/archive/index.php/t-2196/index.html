<br />
I’ve never approached a member of another guild and encouraged them to quit their guild and join KoE.  I have responded to questions from friends who were guilded at the time about the KoE recruitment process.  I’ve given them my opinions on the plusses and minuses of KoE membership, and my opinion on how they would fit within KoE.<br />
<br />
I personally don’t feel it’s appropriate to recruit from among the ranks of any other guild, especially those who we’re on good terms with.  To my knowledge KoE has never been accused of that, and I wanted to be clear that I’ve not engaged in it.<br />

Thanks, TGIF, see y’all in Norrath,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zelfani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To my knowledge none of our recruiting staff have ever done this as well, in fact as Timbo states, we are quite the opposite.  The individual must state up front they are petitioning US, before recruiting even makes any contact to that fact.  Some of our petitioners are still tagged in other guilds, that is their choice but we do NOT recruit from other guilds..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vhela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I second that. We have way too many active petitioners to go seeking more out.</div></div><hr />
