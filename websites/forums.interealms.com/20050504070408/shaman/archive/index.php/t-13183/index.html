<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gubthup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading the boards since I started my shaman and I can't understand why frogs are seen with such hatred?<br />
<br />
How does being an old world race somehow justify your class?<br />
<br />
I was bard in a former life and I quit the game out of bordom.  The lure of some new zones and a new race renewed my EQ career.  Now that I am in my high 40's I don't really even notice what race I am other then the fact that I am not bumping my head on ceilings and door frames.<br />
<br />
Ya there are lots of really lame names out there but ya know they were around way before frogs ever came out!<br />
<br />
I play a damn fine game with my shaman and I have never had someone in game refuse me in a group or refuse to help me based on my race.  Why does it make such a difference here?<br />
<br />
Tons of threads with people discounting a race.  Why do you care?  I care because I don't see it any different then racism.  Judge a person by their game and their actions not due to what they choose to play.<br />
<br />
/steps off his soap box.<br />
<br />
Sorry for that rant but I find it disturbing that people would delete posts or out right knock people down because they didn't choose this race or that.  Roleplaying is one thing and I am all for it... You are mad because I kicked you out of dodge? thats fine.  Don't knock me because I don't get sick from doing back flips all day!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am a frog hateing racist :).<br />
<br />
I hate seing frogs run around in the game just like I would hate to see spiders, or snakes, or bats, or any other monster as a player race.  It makes the game a cartoon and reduces my enjoyment of the game because it spoils the emersive feel of the game as a tolken / d &amp; d fantasty world.<br />
<br />
It is not so much the individual people that play frogs that I hate, ( I am a true racist and just hate all frogs ) but rather that SOE could do such a stupid thing to the game in the first place.  Next EQ race should be a pink bunny that is bards only with a big base drum.  Or perhaps we could have ducks, or mice or ......  I don't want to see the everyready bunny and I don't want to see frogs.<br />
<br />
No groups for frogs, no buffs for frogs.  Frog == Igore list.<br />

I hate them or grouping with them just like I would hate grouping with the big pink bunny.<br />
<br />
I don't discoutn any player based on his / her race.  I have no idea if they are male or female or white / black / hispanic / asian or tribal native.<br />
<br />
I discoun't them because the make the chose to play a character that is a cartoon and significantly detracts from the fatasy nature of the game.<br />
<br />
I also think that the EQ ride is comming to an end.  If all the desingers can do is come up with frogs to keep all the 12 year olds from getting board then we are in trouble.<br />
<br />
I actualy did not mind the lizards althow I am sure that some did.  The Cats was realy starting to push the envolope but having frogs  around the bank or the on the next bar stool just sucks.<br />
<br />
Some company will make a game with Micky and Donald, and Big Bird but I will not spend my cash on it.  I hate to see EQ going in this directions.</div></div><hr />

As a Troll ... I have built in enough reason to dislike and discount any frog's ribbit'ng my way.   The worst thing for me is to have frog form cast on me ... and I Love getting Scarecrow cast on me.   <br />

<br />
I am talking about the feel of the game not how good the models are.<br />
<br />
EQ is just getting further and further away from a tolken like fantasy world and I don't like it at all.  I did not like all the froglocks in places like Old Seb or the stupid mimic like chests in PoH either but at least they where not player races.<br />
<br />
Making frogs a player race is just the writing on the wall that any pretaince of maintaining a Tolken like environment is gone.  Over time EQ has become more and more like a bad AD&amp;D campaine with outragous power triping and all the characters running around with anchient artifacts.<br />
<br />
I would love a new game with a solid middle-earth flavor and great graphics.  Perhaps EQ2 will be this game.  Perhaps SOE is just experimenting in EQ to see what works and what is sucks.<br />
<br />
I have a 4 and 5 year old and somtimes they like to watch me play.  They both like the frogs just fine :(.<br />
<br />
I want a mature serious game that provides a cridible fantasy environment into which I can escape for some entertainment.  EQ started out to be that kind of game even if the graphics where more primitive (cartoonish) then now.  I still think it is the best game on he market but I do not see changes like frogs as a positive.<br />
<br />
I don't feel envy for frogs or twinks...  I feel disapointment and frustration for a trend in the game that just sucks.  I hated the frog race before the expanshion came out.<br />
<br />
I understand tha SOE may have no real options but to let the game get more and more crazy in order to keep all the children playing but the consequence of making the game into a cartoon will be the loss of people that just don't care about riding on a lizard or that next item of phat l00t.<br />
<br />
Frogs looked cool for a few short mins and the casting flip is fun.  Overall, they spoil the feeling of the game in the same way as if a bunch of froglocks showed up in the Lord of the Rings movies during a epic battle.<br />
<br />
People like me will become a smaller and smaller minority as the number of cats and frogs and lizard mounts multipy.  The comunity of an EQ server will continue to degenerate untill all that is left are a few level 65 loot d00d green frogs, pink rabits, or rainbow unicorns that can't give up all the work they put into their pixels.  <br />
<br />
I hate frogs because the are a clear sign that EQ is on the road down the drain and I have loved this game over the last few years.  I also feer that the morons at SOE that did this will do the same thing to EQ2 and I see EQ2 as the most viable option to EQ down the road.  I will be glad if all the poeple that like frogs and go around saying &quot;dood&quot; &quot;sweet&quot; or &quot;teh&quot; stay on EQ forever getting more and more powerfull gear and playing stranger and stranger &quot;toons&quot;.<br />
<br />
You may not agree with my perspect or care about the same things that I do,  but the original poster wanted to know why people resent frogs and I am telling him / her why they just make me want to puke.<br />
<br />
Anyone that equates my dislike for frogs to RL bigotry is truly a moron.</div></div><hr />

No rational reason, no jealousy, just don't like frogs.  Frogs belong in Guk and Seb so that we may kill them at take their stuff at our leisure.</div></div><hr />

I have NEVER thought of this game in anyway resembles anything Tolkienish.<br />
<br />
All characters are toons, so what does it matter.<br />
<br />
I can see you hating twinks or whatever, but to say you hate something because it is cartoonish is...well, stupid.<br />

Pleaes tell Morel,  do you want to group with a big pink bunny?<br />
<br />
How about the pink panther?<br />
How about little blue smerfs?<br />
How about a 8ft yellow bird?<br />
<br />
EQ was clearly modeled after D&amp;D which barrowed heavily from Tolkien.  All the character development could have been coded from an AD&amp;D players handbook and it was so similar I often wondered if they would have copyright problems with TSR.<br />
<br />
I have no idea if you ever played EQ before kunark but you had to be blind and stupid not to see the similarity between EQ and the Tolkien / D&amp;D.<br />
<br />
I looked at playing AC2 but the characters where not apealing at all...  some bug looking things and very artifical looking.<br />
<br />
DAoC was not bad with a few exceptions but the game never involved me in the same way that EQ has.  Also the races where all identical except for apearance and the distrabution of starting stats.  No racial abilities at all.<br />
<br />
SB looked GURP like in character development and I liked the dark feel of the world history but I have no interest in playing in a PvP game at the mercy of every 12 year old that did nothing all summer but level and gets a hard on from ganking.<br />
<br />
The game I would love to see is one with a solid fantasy world with great models, great character development and distinct races.  The origianl EQ was far closer to that then what we have now and I personaly miss the &quot;Vision&quot; TM.<br />
<br />
EasyQ may have a broader market apeal then EQ but having a would with PoK books,  graveyards, frogs,  and people riding around on lizards is not a game world that I am happy with.  Frogs are just the most visible and recent degenerative change so I hate them :).<br />
<br />
I must just be stupid :).<br />

<br />
Many people don't take their twink naming seriously, opting for puns etc. It was bad with iksar. It was really bad with kitties. With frogs, it's intolerable. Like 2 out of every 3 are a joke name. And I'm sorry, but Tasteslike Chikken is going to have a few respect issues to overcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">1) Because Trolls got thrown in the gutter to the benefit of Frogloks when they were introduced, in both the real and role-playing senses.<br />
2) PoP (i.e. PoK) makes the twinks and dippy names a lot more visible. Frogs are the first race/class introduced after PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Diku MUDS like EQ are blatant rip-offs of Dungeons and Dragons, which itself is a blatant rip-off of Tolkien.  <br />
<br />
Now, EQ always has been somewhat cartooney.  Nonetheless, the argument &quot;the game has always been somewhat cartooney, therefore they can add Stay Puft Marshmallow Men as a playable race and it wouldn't change anything&quot; is absurd.  Degrees matter. <br />
<br />
Now, are Frogloks as bad as Stay Puft Marshmallow Men?  Of course not.  But they are, in the minds of many, a lot closer to SPMM than they want EQ to be.  Perfectly reasonable for them to say they hate the addition of frogloks.  <br />
<br />
The game has always been &quot;somewhat sexual&quot; too, what with the grossly disproportional breasts on many of the models and the chainmail bikini cheese and whatnot.  If you logged in tomorrow to find photorealistic hardcore pornography everywhere you looked, I would venture to guess that you would think that things have changed in Norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gubthup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Radag I repect your position on frog or not to frog.<br />
<br />
I don't see it quite the way you do. I do see how your stance on new races is getting away from what you feel is why you started playing EQ. <br />
<br />
Anyway my main point in creating the thread was to try and understand why someone would hack on a race and not the person behind the keyboard.  I feel that I have a better understanding for that now. <br />
<br />
We all play for different reasons and we all have different likes and dislike for the game.<br />
<br />
 I appreciate all the feedback given =).<br />
<br />
I take my toon seriously and never will you see a ribbit or a froak out of me in game.  Heck I thought a frog would be great just for the sake of not having to shrink all the time.  Oh and I look dead sexy on my drogmar.<br />
<br />
Only thing I can stress to people which I see ever time I log into EQ is that there are people behind the keyboards and I feel that too many people forget that.  Too much rudeness and general lack of respect for your fellow player.  Sorry I don't mean to hijack my own thread, but that was part of why I started it in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hello my name is Zyphun and I am Froglok. Frroooaaack. <br />
<br />
** This is my own personal vent, if others have already argued these points to death I apologize for making you read more of the same. **<br />
<br />
EQ for me ended about 6 months ago. I ended for the second time a 3 year run of playing. I got rid of my account, swore the game off, this time I thought for good. Unfortunately, my roommate who I'd gotten started on EQ about a year ago was still playing. It took him a while and he ended up having to pay for the game, the expansions and the monthly payments, but I am once again playing.<br />
<br />
What does this all have to do with Frogs? Well when I came back, I laughed my ass off at the thought of playing a Froglok, anyone that spent as much and to much time as I did in Lower Guk and Seb might be able to appreciate how silly playing a frog seemed to me. So what I do? I made one, and instead of playing my beloved cleric class I went for something a bit different, a shaman. Both renewed what little fun I had in the game, well that and not having to deal with high end drama, but I digress. The point I am trying to make is that I just don't understand what problems people have (besides Trolls and maybe Dark Elves in a roleplaying sense) with Sony adding Frogloks as a playable race.<br />
<br />
Oh how can anyone think that EQ (with the wide player base it has) could ever be on it's last legs is beyond me. The writing is on the wall and it's etched in stone, EQ isn't going anywhere. As for it ever having a Tolkien/DnD air? LOL Yeah right, the minute I stepped into Qeynos (Sony EQ?) all those years back I knew I was in the middle of someone's cartoon landscape. EQ is not Middle Earth, it's not and has never been even close. What it has been is fun and not the least bit afraid to poke fun at itself (Rastafarian Otters???), anyone that payed close attention would have realized that along time ago. I am sorry if you feel your precious roleplaying environment has been corrupted, but I am sorry to say as much as I personally would like to believe it ever existed, it never did. <br />
<br />
Oh and to all you troll shaman out there... you left a few personal objects in our city, if you'd like to collect them please feel free to come down and do so, we'll be happy to kick your behinds all the way back to Neriak once you do. (* And yes I think that making Grobb a starting city for Frogs was damned lazy of Sony, atleast they could have given Trolls a proper new home *)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I don't hate frogs vah shir or even lizards, even though I rag on the lizard shaman I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Every new playable race has had SHM as a class option. I'd say sony wants to forcibly encourage more shaman, and the same could be said for Warriors. The game isn't really designed for Shaman and warriors, they don't stack well on raids and they don't get much to call their own.<br />
<br />
 Look at the AA's, shaman get healing AA's and DD AA's.. but they're not nearly as valuable to the shaman as they would be for a cleric/druid or wiz/druid/mage. There are no DoT AA's, and no debuffing AA's I can think of.<br />
<br />
 Exact same story with focus effects, Shaman used to have a nice one, it was  called affliction focus. Then SOE decided it was broken and instead of changing the percentages of the effects they pretty much eliminated it. All so DoTs can remain &quot;fixed&quot; by the higher percentages, it's laughable.<br />
<br />
 Of course I don't want to see a ton of new frog shaman's around, that's direct competition. Oh well, I can't wait for something new to play, maybe Planetside or World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the same token I can claim to not want to group with ogres, trolls, and iksar because &quot;having monsters as a player race is st00pid man!&quot;<br />

Personally, I would rather group with a frog then a troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Playing a frog now just illuminates your character as an alt, much like playing an Iksar did when RoK released, and some people still have issues with alts.  I know beastlords that could not get groups for months after SoL because they were percieved as &quot;not serious&quot; or &quot;a useless twink class&quot; and now major guilds recruit them. :p<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that most of us (ESPECIALLY old trolls) grew up in Guk and Sebilis so there may be a tad bit of knee-jerk reaction to grouping with a frog.  Newer races usually signal that a player is checking out a class for the first time and may cause people to disregard you because they feel you lack experience.<br />
<br />
Just focus on playing a shaman well and people will eventually forget about the frog thing....well most people.<br />

EQ was clearly modeled after D&amp;D which barrowed heavily from Tolkien.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt you're actually stupid, but you are a bit illogical. Using the ever popular 'slippery slope' argument to convince us all that EQ is on it's way to a deep warm place in a little basket just doesn't work. Do you honestly believe that Big Bird is going to be in the game at some point? Come on now....<br />
<br />
About the Tolkien thing....if you mean EQ is/was Tolkien-ish because of the fantasy setting and fantasy characters, then fine I agree. The problem comes in though if you mean that the EQ storyline approaches Tolkien standards. It just plain doesn't, and it's a bit offensive to Tolkien lovers to equate the two.<br />
<br />
Anywho, my take on the froggie thing is that if anybody wants to ignore/not group with a frog in game then that's 100% that persons call and alright....you deal with characters in game and it falls into RP. However, on the boards you're not dealing with characters anymore and being rude to people is really disrespectful and pointless. Why bother wasting time with negativity?</div></div><hr />

<br />
10. The only people who defend frogs are people who have frogs, or people who have to tolerate them becasue a friend of thiers made one.<br />
<br />
9. Frogs are generally clowns who have dumbass names that surpass even the Vah-Shir in cheese and tardness. <br />
<br />
8. 99% of frogs are twinks. <br />
<br />
7. Many frogs I have seen all insist upon making references to their backflips in at least 50% of their hotkeys. <br />
<br />
6. Backflips were cute for about 5 hours after LoY's release. Now they are just annoying as hell. <br />
<br />
5. Frogs are proof positive that Sony believes that they can feed us any drivel they want and we will keep eating it. And ask for more. <br />
<br />
4. Frogs are the EQ equivalent of Ewoks, Jar-Jar Binks, Webster, Punky Brewster, Alf, Barney the Dinosaur, Teletubbies, Pokemon, Full House, Americas Funniest Home Videos and Scooby-Doo. Fun and cute for a while then after about 5 minutes, it actually angers you to even have to look at them. <br />
<br />
3. They have sex with pigs. <br />
<br />
2. The tired old references to warts, frog-licking, froaking, croaking and that friggin &quot;Hello my Baby&quot; and &quot;Michigan Rag&quot;. <br />
<br />
And the number one reason to hate frogloks:<br />
<br />
I LIKED GROBB. <br />
<br />
Issue closed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Grygul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I decided to play a Shaman about a week ago. I agonized over what race to play for days. They all had good points and bad points. Eventually, I settled on the froglok. No xp penalty, decent stats, and a great back story. The chosen ones of Mithaniel Marr? Sign me up. Much to my dismay, I'm surrounded by morons. I don't think people who have managed to find yet another way to spell Kermit &quot;witty&quot;. They contribute to a problem all the new races have and that's the stigma of being a joke race. They're not joke races because of what they are, they're joke races because every moron that thinks they're clever comes up with some dumb ass name, and the people who are trying to play a serious character bear the brunt of everyone's dislike of us. I'm not saying that you should love frogloks. I'm just saying don't judge the handful of good players by what the vast majority of retards are doing.<br />
<br />
And by the way, while I completely empathize with the Trolls, loosing they're home, they don't look cooler than us frogs. Our asses aren't hanging out of our armor ;-)</div></div><hr />

9. Not quite, I play seriously although Kogu's surname is a bit of an injoke with people that know me well.<br />
<br />
8. Guilty as charged, although I didn't pl all the way to 60 by far, I refused to even flag myself for pov/pos pre 60 despite the option being there, and when the time came I arranged and sorted my trial myself.<br />
<br />
7. I've never liked fancy hotkeys, CH [ %t ] / Quick heal [ %t ] / gCH is about as dramatic as I get =(<br />
<br />
6. The other frog emotes are far better than the backflips, DI'ing or BoRing someone as a frog is far more amusing =)<br />
<br />
5. A new race was inevitable, and froglok illusion proved how popular a choice frogs would be, the model is a little on the cartoony side but /shrug, at least kog doesnt look like she has a large pole up her rear whilst running like most other races do with new models on =)<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
I'll add, frogs, and the ui additions (bankspace/guild manager/lfg tool/map) were the best things about LoY, the zones were a disapointment imho.<br />
<br />
4. A little cute perhaps, but I try not to rub in my superiority to the poor trolls =(<br />
<br />
3. I'm a vegetarian sir =/<br />
<br />
2. I find more people lick me than I lick back, its highly unsettling.<br />
<br />
1. Grobb sucks, I still say frogloks should have started in the SonH frogtown, just make kunark a free expansion now =/<br />

They are entirely a creation of Everquest, and therefore have no correlation to the fantasy land in which many players enjoy living.  <br />
<br />
That is why some people hate em.  Others hate em because they are trolls and the entire froglock expansion just pounds home the point of Sony's extreme laziness.  Honestly . . . what a totally lame way to get around having to introduce a new home city.  <br />
Others hate frogs just because they are so very cartoony, looking like nothing at all that could possibly be real.  It spoils the &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; that people try to cultivate.  <br />
<br />
Frogs are bad umkay.  Kitties were bad enuf, but at least some of them look kinda seksie.  Froggies just look like animals.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Hawbes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">MOG, this is just a game people. Personally, I am in different to the frogs, started one, played to lvl 3, and then quit. I think the big reason they added them in was 1) People asked for it, 2) Look at the number of games coming out very very soon. The lvl of competion will be getting greater. Before EQ had what....UO, and maybe DAoC, there? Now....there will be more then 50 games out by mid of next year to add to the field, maybe more. C'mon, SOE had to do something to &quot;spice&quot; up things. I can see Rags point, to a degree, But personlly, I think the attaacks on people was a little over the top man. If it chokes you up that much, maybe its time to pack itup and go away. Delete the game from your drive, throw away the disks, and move on.The only thing is, the nextgame you play will do the same thing, look at SWG, they may as well add Ewoks to the PC list now, and hang themselves and get it over and done with.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I think a lot of you are missing the point about Tolkein.<br />
<br />
Tolkein was careful to base his stories on the ideas that are to be found in European folklore.  Elves, dwarves, goblins are concepts that we have been exposed to since childhood so they don't seem at all out of place in a fantasy world.<br />
<br />
Whereas talking frogs are limited to princes in distress.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm one of the idiots that hates frogs simply because of what happened to my old hometown of Grobb.  Be a frog if you want, but don't demand that us trolls must like you.</div></div><hr />

I have never scratched my ass, nor have I ever seen another leezard do it. I never make references to eating good races- I just DO it.<br />
<br />
Lastly, just because barbies enjoy farm animals in ways other than culinary is no reason to project that onto the more civilized races.<br />
<br />
Ps. EVERYONE eats gnomes, even other gnomes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I would have liked frogs a lot better if they couldn't be Shaman. Every time they make a new race, they let them be Shaman. The frogs had less choices than most other races, and because of PoP and slowing, a lot of people decided to make Shaman. Having played a Shaman since March 99 in one form or another, I don't like seeing so many powerleveled Shaman around all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
Call me selfish, but I liked it better when people didn't like playing Shaman as much, and when you knew they had spent more than a few days getting to 60+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">When LoY first came out, I could zone into Innothule (/mourn) and &quot;/ooc free Shaman buffs for everyone who isn't a Frog!&quot; and get my jollies by the literal flood of /rudes and anti-Troll remarks.<br />
<br />
Now I zone in and theres maybe one Frog there, the legions of twinks have already been stripped of their gear and shelved it would appear. Also, why the heck was there no Gukta faction attached to the frogs in Upper Guk and Live Side Lguk? Surely the guards in Gukta wouldn't take kindly to the citizens slaying their mentally retarded cousins.<br />
<br />
Although, as an exercise in perspective, it would be interesting to see Gnolls created as a player race and the Barbs being forced to live in Surefall. Maybe they'll put the Shaman trainer in the same hut as the Druid one for extra salt-in-the-wound.<br />
<br />
Karelan, if you lost your home (notice I said your home, not &quot;the home of a race I am already biased against&quot;) because the Dev team was lazy while implenting a new race with nothing other than twinking and eye candy in mind, you just might have the same disdain for the Gnolls that's just as seemingly nonsensical as Trolls' disdain for Frogs.<br />
<br />
Losing Grobb certainly didn't stop my quest for ph47 l3w75, but it sure stung on other levels. When I first made Grayskies, I had the option of worshipping Inny for the snare clicker or I had the option of worshipping my true creator, Papa Thule. For &quot;RP&quot; reasons I went for Papa Thule, because those sorts of aesthetics matter to some, its the same thing with Grobb.<br />
<br />
BTW, your vitriol for Trolls/Ogres/Iksars is on par with alot of Troll's vitriol for Frogs, and you didn't even lose your home to them. Hi pot, meet kettle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Gubthup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I completely agree with the DEV team being a bunch of lazy bums when they hoofed the trolls out of grobb... On top of that the PoP stone out of PoK says grobb but the ingame map says Gukta.<br />
<br />
I would have much prefered a zone in to Gukta INSIDE of Upper Guk or hell make upper guk into Gukta... really who fights in upper guk anymore other then people farming a few items and the really occassional twink?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Okay.  I will admit, I do play a frog, so that can bias me a bit.  I apologize for that.  Personally, I can agree with Radag in the sense that the game DID have a better 'RPing' (although it was hard to actually RP and be taken seriously) environement then it does now.  I also didn't have a problem with lizards.  I will admit, the cats were a little weird, but at least they didn't just slap Kerrans on and call them a player race.  I also agree that SoE is lazy and shouldn't have shafted the trolls.  I also admit that I like PoP and the amount of travel freedom it has given, I also know that it has made the game much too easy and took away a lot of business from druids and wizards all around.  The problem here, is that SoE has to appeal to they players in order to get money.  People want things to be easy, people want to be powerful.  Why do you think so many people made enchanters when KEI first came out, and the enchanters that actually worked to get it, ended up getting shafted cause any little person could just waltz into PoK and practically get offered a KEI when they walk in.  Same with all the massive HP buffs that were given no lvl requirement when they were made into group buffs.<br />
Alright, now that I've gotten that off, time to get back to the topic :).  I don't really have much a problem with frogloks (and that is not just cause I play one).  I think my biggest problem is the people out there that say Froak or stuff like that.  Also the names are a problem.  I admit, my last name is a little bad, but that is just kinda a inside joke with my friends.  All those kermit idiots out there and people with just plain dumb frog names deserve what they get.  Like I said before, I think it was dumb for trolls to get moved.<br />
On to the whole list of things.  I admit, I am twinked.  I do not make dumb references to backflips.  Most of my spell casts are just 'attempting to slow %T,' 'casting ___ healing on %T.&quot;  And I don't even backflip most of the time.  I'm usually a bear, or I usually sit down right after I cast cause I don't have a mount.<br />
Alright, hopefully I got a bit of myself out there with this.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I don't have sex with pigs...  I only did that once</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Ospri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">It's been said: because there are only so many shaman spaces to go around in groups/raids, and therefore existing shaman take a jaundiced view of new players to the class--and the novelty of frogs both increased the number of shaman players and simultaneously made those new shamans easy to pick out from the crowd.  Might as well hang a &quot;kick me&quot; sign on their backs.<br />
<br />
As far as the Tolkien thing goes, get over it.  Tolkien doesn't have gnomes, ogres, dark elves, half elves, erudites, etc.  It barely has trolls. Your play choices in a Tolkien landscape would be humans, dwarves, halflings, a couple kinds of elf, orcs, and goblins.  Maybe ents.  Except the orcs and goblins would be 'monster races', couldn't have those as PCs, eh?--and those are the only 'shamany' races in Tolkien.  Doesn't look good for the shaman job market in a situation like that...</div></div><hr />

Point is this game is so far from tolkien you just plain dont know what your talkin about  if you try to compare to two.  With some slight (very slight) racial use it is nothing like tolkien.  Elves arent immortal, magic is plentiful in norrath, hobbits can use magic (EQ is more like friggen Willow than it is tolkien in this sense), Trolls are not semi-giants, I dont remember ogres being in tolkien,  Orcs and Goblins are &quot;different&quot; races in Norrath, the religion system... the list goes on and on...<br />
<br />
What EQ is,  and ill spell this out S L O W L Y for those that might require such, is a creation of a new world based on what has become general fantasy.  There are elements of the fantasy that was created by tolkien and developed by so many other great authors but there are also elements of MUD fantasy... and if anyone has played any MUDs you will realize they some have TONS of playable races.  To make it blunt... ITS THIER FRIGGEN WORLD.<br />

Have a good day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Bah, Elrond was not truly a Half-Elf in the EQ or AD&amp;D sense of the term. He may have born of one human parent but he choose to live the way of the elves so in every sense became one.<br />
<br />
I have several points to make, all of which I feel are valid regardless of the number of times I have posted on this particular board.<br />
<br />
1. Trolls have a perfectly good role-playing reason to refuse to group with Frogloks. The Frogs threw the Trolls out of what had become their home. So any troll who actively RP's should not group with Frogs. However, a Troll named Ilikephatlewt has no excuse to be abusive of Frogloks under the pretense of RPing. Likewise, this animosity only extends to those avatars who would have a problem with the Frogloks taking over Grobb. Someone who has an alt (Ooh, he said a dirty word) Paladin of Mithaniel Marr can't use RPing as an excuse to be abusive either, it is the player's personal bias showing through. <br />
<br />
2. I would love to see the name logs from '99 and '00. Frogloks were not the first race to have stupid names. Just scroll through the bazaar and check the races, you will find just as many old world races with non-roleplaying names as you will new races. Schpankme Knightly ring a bell? And these are not just alts with joke names but the mains of people with limited imaginations. I should know, I played with some of them in AD&amp;D Tournaments back in the days of paper and pencil Role-Playing.<br />
<br />
3. The Role Playing evironment died about 10 minutes after the game went live when the first person zoned to get away from a mob. The very structure and mechanics of the game denies a stong role-playing atmosphere. EQ is first and foremost a game system with a specific set of rules, rules which are tested and abused by power gamers the world round.<br />
<br />
4. Frogloks were not introduced as a new race, they were an existing race that was allowed to become a player race. The available classes choices seem to reflect some of the same ones that the monster Frogloks already had available to them. No new race was added to the RP environment.<br />
<br />
5. Norrath resembled Middle Earth in the beginning just as much as Eminem resembles Marilyn Monroe. There was a hillarious post I read on another board that took part of the Lord of the Rings which had Frodo and Samwise encounter some EQers. I wish I could remember where it was. Norrath is a fantasy GAME setting, Middle Earth is a fantasy BOOK setting.<br />
<br />
6. SOE is making too much profit from EQ for it to be heading into the tank. In fact, it is making far more money than it was supposed to. As long as it is profitable, EQ will be around. I seriously doubt that the Frogs were added as a gimmick to get more 12 year olds to play. You must be thinking of EQOA.<br />
<br />
7. It's just a GAME! Norrath is not your private playground, subject to your whims and rules. However, it is bound by an EULA that includes a PlayNicePolicy, do try to remember this when you play. <br />
<br />
'Nuff said!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">The point of my list was in reply to the idjit who made it up about frogs, notice that I just copied it and inserted old school evil race things in place. In an attempt to make a point that the old evil races are just as fn dumb as frogs. Its EQ.. its a cartoon fantasyland.. not some dour serious high fantasy setting.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned how I would feel if my toons home was taken over. I would LOVE IT TO DEATH. Holy crap if that stale static ice covered town was overrun by goblins and a small new twist added to the storyline I would crap my greaves in joy.<br />
<br />
Anyone who thinks EQ is remotely tolkienish.. all  I can say to you is... hahahahaha. You insult tolkien to compare the two even in jest. Making short people with beards, short people with hairy feet, and short people with pointy ears as players races doent make your game tolkienish =p If anything, EQ is a mishmash of 20 years of d&amp;d all tossed together and stirred and boiled so much that all flavor has been leeched out of it. FYI there was a sentient frog race in the d&amp;d monster manual(bullywug).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Grenoble</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I don't particularly hate frogs, but I did have an issue with them as shaman.  Why?<br />
<br />
Because they can also be a cleric.  In my (admittedly pre-conceived) mind, a cleric and a shaman are the same class, but a shaman is a cleric to the more 'primitive' races.  So...are frogs considered primitive?  Or more cultured, like elves?  <br />
<br />
I say they should have had one class or the other open to them, not both, because of that.  But I certainly don't hate them.<br />

Back to the subject at hand, I have a real problem with the frogs as a playable race, simply because so many of us &quot;grew up&quot; driving their civilization to complete extinction. Anyone remember when Guk was so camped, that a frog got to breathe about 0.8 seconds of air before someone killied it?...

Which race was the &quot;star&quot; race of Tolkien fantasy? The halflings.<br />
<br />
Halflings have to be at LEAST as cartoonish as frogloks. Certainly, they are reguarded much the same in Middle Earth as Frogloks are on Norrath. In fact, much of the very point of the Hobbits in Tolkien's fantasy was to show that a funny-looking, underestimated race of short people can have serious adventures, too.<br />
<br />
The froglok parable there is pretty plain to me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">small new twist added to the storyline I would crap my greaves in joy. <br />
<br />
However you get your jollies off ... <br />
<br />
As for me, the change to the storyline line in regard to Trolls kicked out of Grobb was more akin to a big coding test for the Dev's.   &quot;See Mom ... I made the big mean Trolls go live in Dark Elves starting city ... aren't I smart&quot;.   It's not the fact that they did it ... but that they did it and then dropped the whole subject while screwing up tons of content in the process.    Quests were hosed, Trade skill items completely forgotten, and in general stuff just slapped together other than a nice web site graphic with some text bouncing all over the place trying to explain why this was a 5 zone Add-On.   Heck ... for the first couple days there wasn't even spell vendors or guild leaders in FQ.   So much for testing AKA - /bug.<br />
<br />
But again ... I'm glad you're happy with a small twist ... aim low.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">A game has a life cycle and the nature of the population changes over time.<br />
<br />
At first a world is new to all and the experiance is wonderfull and all seam to have a great time.  People are friendly, cooperative, and helpfull.  This changes as people become more and more familiar with the game and the world and over time a lot of people leave the game while others enter.  The devs change the game and add content because people get bored if they do the same thing over and over and over.  Eventualy the game end up so strange and distorted that the original Vision is not only abandonded but forgotten.<br />
<br />
EQ will probably last economicly for 10 or 20 years but it will be filled with all kinds of loot d00ds that cant give up because within the context of EQ they are important / on top.  EQ will end up looking like UO and the population becomes less and less a cross section of normal society and more and more a cross section of those that have more life in the game then outside.<br />
<br />
I view this as a natural life cycle of games like EQ or even old D&amp;D.  How pathetic UO players are.  How do you view Gary Gygax who talks about himself in the 3rd person and does nothing but complain about his loss of TSR.<br />
<br />
When I say the game is spiraling down, that does not mean that EQ will not make a profit or that it will not continue to exist.  It does mean that the population will become more and more dominatated by l33t d00ds / multi - boxer / power levelers and other varius forms of pasty wite people sitting in small rooms without any kind of real life.<br />
<br />
In 3 years you will be able to get a 100 ac bp with FT 15, 300 HP, 30 to all resists,  50 wis and so on.  I personaly don't want one.  I want a serious game that apeals to normal people who I can group with and adventure with in a fantasy world.  EQ as a game will continu to deteriorate and the quality of the population will reflect that change.<br />
<br />
My hope is that EQ2 will be able to maintain some kind of &quot;Vision&quot; TM for a coupld of years and that all the l33t d00ds will be unable to give up their EQ pixels and remain forever chaising that next race / drop / key / flag in the very strange world EQ is becoming.</div></div><hr />

Do I think its bull**** people can now accomplish in a few weeks that took the rest of us months and in some cases years? Yes.<br />
<br />
What I dislike most about people who twink is they have NFC what they're supposed to be doing. I was grouped in POD the other day when I had to leave to go to class, looking for a replacement all I could find was a 57 froglok shaman. Asked the group they said it was fine. I came back 2 hours later and got a tell asking to come back to the same group. (judging by the laughter in the group and joking about &quot;thank god a real shaman is here&quot; I knew he didn't have a clue about grouping as a shaman)<br />
<br />
Certainly this isn't always the case. Some people can play a class well, twinked or not. But i'd sure as hell take a person that had crappy gear but knew what the hell they were supposed to be doing over a person with the best droppable items in the game with no clue how to play the class. Things that can only be learned by playing the class. Not just twinking a character, getting KEI and killing anything and everything you can before it wears off again. You don't learn anything that way.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents. (maybe a lil more)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If ya really want to get geeky about it, I recall no provision in Tolkien's mythology that allows for a true half-elf.<br />
<br />
Humans are mortals whose spirits 'pass on' to some other existence when they die.  Elves are immortals whose spirits reincarnate after death--but they have the option of giving up the immortality and becoming human.<br />
<br />
So what happens to a spirit that's both?<br />
<br />
Tolkien doesn't give an answer, because his lore doesn't allow it to happen.  You can't really mix the two; you can be one or the other, but not a combination--magic sidesteps genetics :)  So Elrond is an elf with a human parent, not a true half-elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Duh... read underlined passage from your quote then reread mine inserting a sense of sarcasm into the text.

<br />
Doh...  Hrothgar the great comunicator :).<br />
<br />
I also think that Kunark and even Velious where fine.  Things started to do down the john when we got a moon.<br />
<br />
The original content was just too small to keep the game going for a long time, and RoK added some great content, epics, and a lot more space to help with the problems of LGuK and SolB. Velius was also a great expansion and both RoK and Velius maintained the original Vision.<br />
<br />
I wish they had simply added more dungeon content to the first 3 boxes instead of adding a moon (boggle), PoP with all books croping up all over the world, and now frogs.<br />
<br />
If I was SOE I would do a lot of experimentation with EQ to find out what kind of things work and what kind of things are just look good on paper.  I hope this is why we have frogs now.  They are also marketing convinience with each new expansion (PoP books, bank space and such).<br />
<br />
I still play EQ because I love the game,  I will probably start over on the new server with a fresh population.  I hope EQ2 is going to be on time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To all the Tolkien experts here....Tolkien was a historian and a linguist....actually the study of ancient languages and cultures was his passion. He was extremely meticulous in developing a back story(based allot on European folklore) for years before he even started to write the Hobbit. Which made his universe somewhat 'real' feeling in the loses sense of the word. I read, although to lazy to scroll back up and check, someone said that orcs and goblins were the same...there is a subtle difference between the two, but my point is its all relative, as -you- the reader decide what is 'believable' and what is not.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to group with a frog for the same reason I don't want to group with a druid, or with a meleeing cleric.<br />

Chances are, they'll suck.  Do some of them not suck?  Sure!  But the majority of the time I group with one, something bad happens, and I'm just a lot more dedicated to having fun when I log in than I am to being overly open-minded about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play a Iksar, and i started shortly before kunark. there was actully not much in the way of twinking of iksars that i saw when i first started ( heck it was a good 2 to 3 weeks before i saw my first soft skin ) but i am nto saying it did not happon. Alot of fantizey worlds have talking lizzards in one form or another, and if you are talking about AD&amp;D worlds most if not all have them in one form or antoher. If you had a good DM with a good sence of balance you can even make the lizzards in to player races ( had been a dream for a while to play a drakonian for a while ). Frogs while not as commen, IN THIS GAME are very much part of it and are intelegent speciase ( how many races of frogs are there anyway? 2 or 3? ). would it have sutted you more if thay had made trents in to player charicters? thay are in tolken and do come to take some part in the books. personaly i had wished thay had made a playable UNDEAD race. that would have been cool as all get out. inate bones to posion and disease resist and all. no worrying about breathing underwater period ( i mean your dead already ) and liches we all know are very smart and evil to the extream. vamps have nothing on them. But this all goes back to the fact that in a fantise world anything can go ( its not real after all ).<br />
<br />
I do not mind frogs, and i dont have one.<br />
<br />
grob being robbed from you was just plane wrong expecaly since on some servers the invasion was actully held off and stopped. thay should have had put the home town ether in the LoY expansion, or put them in the swamp of no home frog town ( who goes there any way ). <br />
<br />
whats a hot key? that was about the worst thing i see most people do. you do not need to make so many elabrit hot keys couse even if i use them i stop in most group situations after a half hour couse its more annoying then not to get spamned becouse of a fizzale buy the words more then once. no one talks in pick up groups any more its all just hot keys. and if your worryed about fantice do you think in fights soem one would keep saying hay there i am ahealing you hay there i am shooting that guy that your hitting, hay there i am casting realy bad spells on him. no thay all interact like real people would and thay expect people to do there job when there supposed to and every one be aware of what is happoning at all time, now thay might say hay look out behind you, or clear big blast spell is going off, or yell INCIOMING when there is arrows flinging but not when some one is running at you couse well everyone can see that.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but you got to back that one up.  Tolkien set the standard for fantasy writing and brought it out of mearly Lovecraft/fairy tales to the beginings of modern fantasy.  Other stories that are as rich?  Who's?<br />
<br />
Tolkien set up a rich mythology, language, political system and geography before he ever set pen to paper.  I like to think of The Trilogy as a story of stories (there were many things he meantions in there that I'd love to hear about)<br />
<br />
Eddings also did all of the above for the Belgariad, but his writing was never as engaging (the Malorian was just a nightmare, but later books were much better)<br />
<br />
Brooks.  Didn't like the Shanara series, couldn't get through it.<br />
<br />
Donaldson wrote a great few books with Thomas Covenant, but his writing was too spotty and he didn't have a roadmap as to where he was going before he started, leading to some on-again off-again books.<br />
<br />
Goodkind had a very good series with The sword of truth but each there was never an overarching storyline that pulled you from book to book (you felt good at the end of each, until the next came out)<br />
<br />
Jordan.  Will The Wheel of Time never end?  I gave up on it several books ago.  Really good writing, but it never seemed to get any closer to a final resolution<br />
<br />
McCaffrey made a good series with Pern, but they started as light fantasy and later were written as juvenile fantasy.<br />
<br />
Zelazny.  Amber was pure fantasy and a great series, but not quite up to Tolkien.  His best work was always done when he synthesized Fantasy to Science Fiction and dared anyone to tell him that what he did was wrong.  His best work was also not series, but single books (Lord of Light, Eye of Cat, Donnerjack, etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>pallantides</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">I have to agree with folks that look to Tolkien as one of the main defining elements of modern fantasy, but I think he's only half the equation.  Usually Tolkien is considered the start of modern &quot;high fantasy.&quot;  The complimentary part of that is 'low fantasy' heh, or what is usually referred to as &quot;sword and sorcery.&quot;  The start of that usually traces back to Robert E. Howard.  Although, like Tolkien he also owes his success to a number of genres and authors who came before him.<br />
<br />
Eq, D&amp;D, etc etc all trace their origins to these two individuals.  Barbarians and thieves, are two recurring elements that trace back more clearly to Howard.  Also, if anything EQ reminds me more of the Hyborian Age than anything Tolkien created.  Howard created a living breathing world by borrowing from history (and more importantly the popular view of history) this let him have a rich backdrop for his characters without having to create languages and ornate histories for them.  Not bad for a pulp fiction, short story writer from Texas in the 1930's.  This world however functions with multiple power levels that remind me of EQ.  Conan stalks through a world rife with warring nations, religious intolerance, class struggles and racial prejudice.  Earning the favor of one group always meant losing it with someone else.  <br />
<br />
Almost every writer of fantasy after these two gentlemen are reacting to their styles and truthfully, have added little to the genre despite writing some exceptional stories.  I will admit to really loving Tad Williams Dragonbone trilogy though.<br />

He can be long winded and boring at times but when he wrote he had to be descriptive because he could not depend on the reader having a basic fantasy knowledge.  He built the context in which other fantasy writers create.<br />
<br />
I am sure a lot of people playing frogs are having fun and I am all for having fun I just wish SOE had marketed a modified version of EQ called EasyQ in which they could insert all the strange junk.  All the 12 year olds do need a place to play ;).<br />

I used to DM alot and yes when i decised to make up a brand new world campain or some thing like that, I would sit down and research and plan out lots of political stuff and contrys and travel times and make up and items and some difrent swords and what magic spells could and could not be found or who could use them and such. It was nto for a over all reaching thing, heck most of the time i was not able to use half of it since i did nto direct the charicters and i let the players direct there genral path throu the world ( let me say that i always saw the job of DM'ing as a refery and nto some kind of powertripping thing. ) now why did i bring this up? becouse though it makes a good back ground setting and is needed for a engrosing story simpley USEING it all and putting to much information out there is also a bad thing.<br />

so you might chack it down to personal prefrence but for my tastes tolkin put out just a bit to much information for my tastes. your milage might very. yes in the wheel of tiem i have missed the last couple of books, and i do so wish it comes to some sort of end but life never realy comes to a end so i stoped readying it realy. so call me a uncivilized reader and rake me over the coals for my veiw ( i know some one will ).<br />

What happened between Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune was one of the major factors that pushed me from SciFi into Fantasy.  <br />
<br />
Sci Fi is &quot;how does the gizmo effect society and the protaganists.&quot;  Fantasy is &quot;how do the protagonists get along in a reality where fantasic things happen.&quot;<br />

I got much less interested in the gizmo and more interested about how people were interacting, so I naturally gravitated towards Fantasy.</div></div><hr />

Windfinder, what is a Fudling?  I don't know either :), but if I am going to write a fantasy story with Fudlings as main characters in a world no one has ever visited I had best be very descriptive.  After I am done then lots of other authors can come along and have all kinds of Fundling stories which people will understand because they now have a common conceptual framework.<br />

Brooks.  Didn't like the Shanara series, couldn't get through it.<br />
<br />
Donaldson wrote a great few books with Thomas Covenant, but his writing was too spotty and he didn't have a roadmap as to where he was going before he started, leading to some on-again off-again books.<br />
<br />
Goodkind had a very good series with The sword of truth but each there was never an overarching storyline that pulled you from book to book (you felt good at the end of each, until the next came out)<br />
<br />
Jordan.  Will The Wheel of Time never end?  I gave up on it several books ago.  Really good writing, but it never seemed to get any closer to a final resolution<br />
<br />
McCaffrey made a good series with Pern, but they started as light fantasy and later were written as juvenile fantasy.<br />
<br />
Zelazny.  Amber was pure fantasy and a great series, but not quite up to Tolkien.  His best work was always done when he synthesized Fantasy to Science Fiction and dared anyone to tell him that what he did was wrong.  His best work was also not series, but single books (Lord of Light, Eye of Cat, Donnerjack, etc)<br />
<br />
Um, you seem to have forgotten a few Fantasy writers like Feist, Saberhagen, Hobb, Gemel and Williams. You also neglect to give credit where credit is due. Tolkien would have gotten nowhere without the orginal storytellers of the Norse, Finnish, Celtic &amp; Other Germanic Myths. (Bulfinch anybody?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I didn't forget them, but there wasn't enough room to list ALL of the great Fantasy writers.  I just haven't seen anything that quite reaches Tolkien's level.  <br />
<br />
And has far as the giants who's shoulders Tolkien stood upon, I think you forgot The Legends of King Arthur (The retreat to the Grey Havens IS Avalon), The Cantebury Tales, Beowulf and he took a lot from the Illiad and Odyssey.  What he did do though, was integrate these into a grand story that laid a foundation for modern Fantasy.  The foundation is key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">FJ-  yes, Tolkein did set the standard for fantasy writing, just as star wars set the standard for box office sci fi. but as we all know, that does not equate to the end all be all of their respective arts.<br />
<br />
sure tolkein created an entire language with elven, had the entire creation of middle earth with the simmarillion. and told only one story out of that created world (giving it so much depth and field that you know that there were thousands more stories hidden away in his mind).<br />
<br />
but don't get that confused with what EQ is.<br />
<br />
sure every fantasy created since LoTR is to some extent or the other relatable to the fantasy realm created by tolkein. however that is where the similarities end in each of them.<br />
<br />
the similariites in that there are elves, dwarves, trolls, and other equatable creatures in EQ is about where the similarities between tolkiens world and EQ end.<br />
<br />
Each troll that walks around scratching his butt should likely turn to stone at the break of every day, and that character never be usable again. how is it that a dwarf and elf can co-exist so close to each other?<br />
<br />
why has no one found the one ring yet?<br />
<br />
the fact that this game has things similar to tolkein's world does not make this in any way tolkein's world. this is sony's world, and how they shape it is up to them. if they want talking lizards, they create the history for it, if they want talking cats, they create the history for it, if they want talking frogs, well you get the idea.<br />
<br />
as long as things fall into the mythology of norath then it is good enough. frogs made smart by some god is good enough for me. the fact that some people can't accept that, well maybe you should work on that imiagination of yours.</div></div><hr />

You know, even with such a well-crafted mythos and world, two things have always confused me:<br />
<br />
When Gandalf breaks Suriman's staff, he breaks his power.  And yet, Gandalf gets not one, but TWO staves during the story, each time making him more powerful (he lost his first to Suriman and his second was lost along with Foe-Slayer in Kazad-Dum)<br />
<br />
The One Ring is so powerful that its destruction will finally kill Sauron and yet the only thing we've ever seen it do is make its wearer invisible.  Not only that, but the wearer isn't perfectly invisible, as they still have a shadow and Sam couldn't even pass the Warders of the Gate with it, but had to pull out the Phial of Galladrielle!  DAAAAAAMN that sounds powerful!   :)</div></div><hr />

and on the subject of frogs, im a troll, i RP, I hate the froglok in game with a fevrent passion. outside the game i think its a real nice way to lure people into the game and agree that it is a sign of the EQ apocolypse. my fiance who would get pissed at me for playing EQ started a frog. didnt get past level 8 or something before stopping again but still, frogs lured even the most anti eq person into the game and i think they are luring allot of other people in that have a different attitude to the game than the &quot;old school&quot; players and thats why many of them dont like em.</div></div><hr />

Also for the age comment why would EQ be trying to lure in younger kids as u claim when there comunity now is older. All the guilds ihave been in are older than me on Drinal and i am allways the youngest (i am 16) i know this number one cause some people flat out say they are 28 and 35 and stuff. Others say &quot; Nevermind that&quot; and &quot;I will not say&quot; which pretty mcuh means they are in the 25-40 range:). <br />
<br />
With your comment on not buffing healing helping frogs or having anything to do with them and putting them automacticly on yor /ignore is quite retarded. But that is also the way u want to play the game. With the way your getting mad at EQ in the previous post i think you shoud maybe play Dark ages of Camelot doesnt seem that &quot;cartoonish&quot; to me. If u didnt think when u started EQ when the ogres used to scratch there butts and trolls used to also and they where all fat and walked funny that that was not cartoonish than uhh i dont know waht to say. <br />

I have a lvl 30 vahshir Shaman and i have heard many times that ahh damn cats they are stupid blah F'in blah lol. People who have problems are eather takin this game a tad too serious or have problems really. <br />

<br />
Kkrush, you are without a doubt, the biggest 'tard I have had the displeasure of reading a post by. <br />
<br />
Firstly you may need this for future reference:<br />
exaggerate    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (g-zj-rt)<br />
v. exaggerated, exaggerating, exaggerates <br />
v. tr.<br />
To represent as greater than is actually the case; overstate: exaggerate the size of the enemy force; exaggerated his own role in the episode. <br />
To enlarge or increase to an abnormal degree: thick lenses that exaggerated the size of her eyes. <br />
<br />
v. intr.<br />
To make overstatements.<br />
<br />
I, as most other people with higher than a third grade reading level realized, did not mean to say that I was ready to go to blows over someone not knowing that these movies were based on books that set the current fantasy trend, it was an exaggeration meant to illustrate my exasperation at the situation.<br />
<br />
Secondly I did not have an issue with him not liking the movie, my own fiance is not a fan of the series either and I certainly wont be appearing on &quot;COPS&quot; for domestic violence over the issue. My problem is with people, similiar to you now that I think about it, that base their opinions on too little information. The person in question spent 20 minutes trying to explain how the person widely credited with the shaping of the genre was a &quot;rip off artist&quot; and based their theory only on the fact that these movies were new and that he had no idea there was a history to the works. This is where the frustration stems from<br />
<br />
Now that out of the way can't we all just get along and base a new respect for each other on the mutual hate for Froglok kind</div></div><hr />

For the record this gets my vote as the best thing to come out of this thread.<br />
<br />
Back to the original intent of the thread.  I play a frog.  I named myself &quot;Rhyswyr&quot;, nothing kermit-y about that.  I've worked my way to level 35, and yes, I've given myself some old gear I had lying around.  I was proud to finally find a use for that rubicite BP that I'd had cluttering up a bank slot for awhile, and it's been fun soloing, maxing my weapon skills, and otherwise pushing it to the edge.  I've died my share of times, learned from it, and improved.  Sure I'm an alt, but in time, I'm going to be a damn fine shaman.<br />
<br />
I side soundly with the the group that says bash frogs in game all you want if it's what your character would do.  I actually like the interactions with trolls that roleplay issues with frogs.  'Trolls' on messageboards that think they seem like bad asses... Well, they're half right anyway.<br />

my top 10 list would look like this<br />
<br />
10. they dont look like frogs. mix bewteen snake headed, half frog body, and a neon color that reminds me a stree sign. &quot;eat at joes&quot; flashy color.<br />
<br />
9. they just look stupid fighting, 1st of all i dont like the luclin fighting models, i mean ***? they arent even complete! just watch any monk/melee use a 2hb hammer wep, they pierce with it! <br />
the frogs do this kick sweep thing, that could harm a moss snake! <br />
<br />
8. that stupid back/side flippy thing they do when they cast...IVE NEVER LIKED IT! it was stupid from the time i first saw a REAL frog in guk do it back in beta. <br />
<br />
7. what the hell!! new zones! but the stupid frogs had to kick trolls out of the game....no battle, just poof! and the trolls are suddenly at the DE home....where they should be Kos anyway! why dont the tards at SOE use their heads and think of something better to do? add some new attack models, make monks monks again. give the mages an epic worth having. or MAYBE MAKE a home for the frogs, gawd! they added JPF why not add a Less laggy frog home? just smack it off upper guk or something freak<br />
<br />
6. i hate twinks....normal twinks arent bad, you know the ones with high lvl chars, that know how to play the game, but the frog twinkers seem the same people as the dumb ass charm killing druids in POdisease! you know the ones that mez a rat, fully buff it then med next to it? <br />
the ones that mastered begging before they could leave the newby zone. (both the skill 'begging' and the &quot;could you plz donate some plats to a new guy?&quot; one)<br />
<br />
5. how the hell did these soft skin anfibs beat huge ass regening trolls? <br />
its like having all the large rats in norrath attack freeport and win...it stupid! *soe noob dev. guy says* &quot;DOOD! i gots idea! gnomes take over oggak! wootage baby! that would be so roxor! gnomercy dood!&quot;<br />
i mean ***! *frog_01 attacks troll guard_01, troll guard_01 says &quot;what the hell?&quot; *Troll guard_01 steps on frog_01, turning him into fertilizer*<br />
<br />
4. well anyway i cant think of much more....<br />
<br />
i just dont like frogs, same thing as Luclin being on the moon....what is that all about!? is the soe dev. team running out of ideas? c'mon...get a clue!</div></div><hr />

The ring itself is powerfull. What the bearer/wielder can do with it is determined by his own (will)power. That is why a Hobbit and especially Frodo is the best person to bear it to Mount Doom. Hobbits are kind of.. daft, simple minded if you like. They live in their Shire and are content with it. They do not think on a grand scale and don't have any big ambitions and certainly non that reach beyond their presious Shire border. <br />
That said, these rather dull characteristics protect the Hobbits. One with little, and ambition for, power will not be tempted to use it and if he does, the effect will be very small.<br />

Remember how Gandalf refused to even touch the ring? It is because he knows, even though he is the good guy, that he can not allow himself to be tempted to use the ring, as he, contrary to the Hobbits, would be able to use the near full ammount of power the ring harnesses.<br />

Men, for whom power is most important, came under the domination of their rings most quickly, but if Sauron got his ring back, all ring-bearers would become ring-wraiths (excepting possibly Gandalf).<br />

It's hard to rank the supernatural powers of EA (the universe of Middle Earth) in terms we understand.  Sauron, Suraman and Gandalf started as beings of the same level, but their different foci changed where their strengths are.  Sauron got much of his current  power from his lord, Melkor/Morgoth (who would be considered a 'god'), before his boss got forever banished.<br />
<br />
All of the above is spelled out in The Simarillion.  It's unclear though, which Vala Suraman and Gandalf served.</div></div><hr />

This thread is fantastic for the hobbit discussion, I teach 7th grade, and we are doing the Hobbit right now.

The ease of the race. Starting a frog is very easy there is no hatred for them inate in most towns, their town is easy to get to. Now these arent truly bad reasons till you look at the outcome. The shaman was a .. hmm... special class. It took a dedicated player to deal with the races that a shaman could be.

Ogres and trolls are pretty obvious. Kitties still required a lil dedication due to the remotness of their starting point.

I kinda liked it being difficult to start a shaman, kinda thinned the herd ya know ?<br />

I have to disagree Lit... It was luclin that finally did in the Shaman class in the areas that you speak of.  And the introduction of the Nexus started to make everything more accessable in terms of getting to your hometown.  Also it introduced all the kittie shaman twinks with stupid names etc etc... then PoP got rid of your remotness argument altogether as all hometowns are now easily accessable etc etc... All in all the Shaman community wasnt harmed at all by the introduction of Froglocks with just the minor annoyance of the twink of the week being kermit or some derivative.  Frankly the shaman community has been going downhill ever since Iksar were introduced with the whiney why don't we get a jbb twinks. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">The Hobbit was written as juvenile fiction.  Tolkien keeps the narrative as much as possible in the first person and keeps to a single-threaded narrative (except when Smaug destroys Laketown).<br />
<br />
The story's great, but it's not written to the same level of The Trilogy.  The deeper meanings as I see them are as follows:  The Hobbit - don't be afraid of opportunity and if you truly care for someone, you'll do what needs to be done, even if it hurts.  The Trilogy - Industrialization dehumanizes and should be avoided.  The simple ways and the simple people sometimes have roots of iron.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u129"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p129">Finaljustice,<br />
You're right, the other posts are much more tuned to the trillogy.  I just got all caught up in the discussion (heheh).  Anyhow, my class first reads Watership Down (a good story in it's own right), and then we move on to the Hobbit.  The first person narrative keeps it easier for the kids to follow the action, but Tolkein uses enough literary elements (foreshadowing, metephor, and personification) to keep it challenging to the more advanced readers in my class.  As was stated much earlier in this thread, many of my kids are unfamiliar with fantsy settings, and ask questions such as.... what is a dwarf, elf, or goblin.   The descriptive nature of Tolkiens writting is very useful to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u130"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p130">Industrialization, anti-War/War is not beautiful, overcoming adversity, good vs bad and the thin line between the two, anti-feminism... there are several themes that can be drawn from the Trilogy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>Ospri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">The one ring was created by Sauron, and he imbued it with much of his power in the making.  The nine rings were created as slaves to the One Ring and are subourdinate to it.  Any of the lower rings gave the wearer the aiblity to rule their race (although how that's achieved isn't told).  Men, for whom power is most important, came under the domination of their rings most quickly, but if Sauron got his ring back, all ring-bearers would become ring-wraiths (excepting possibly Gandalf).<br />
<br />
The way I read it, none of the wearers of the three elven rings would fall under Sauron's sway, since he 'never touched them', i.e. corrupted them.  He has no influence over them; I guess he's just supposed to destroy the elves by controlling everyone else.<br />
<br />
I was always curious what happened to the dwarven rings--they just fall off the face of Middle Earth or something?</div></div><hr />

On the first point, no, that's something that Peter Jackson says in the movie, but is not bourne out in the books.  One ring to rule THEM ALL.  Since the Elven rings weren't corrupted, Sauron can't see what the wearers are doing, but if he takes final control, he controls all.<br />
<br />
On the second point, the simarillion says that they were consumed by dragonfire, when their wearers perished.<br />
<br />
Hrothgar, I didn't see a thread of anti-feminism here.  Tolkien was very traditional and he therefore places Galadrielle in the place of the Lady in the Lake, but we didn't see and betrayals by women or hags, etc...  Also, it's a woman who kills the lead ring wraith (using the old MacBeth gambit, with a twist).<br />
<br />
Shandrillar, I certainly agree with you that Watership Down is an excellent book.  You can see that it was written at a little more advanced level, with several converging story threads and jaunts into rabbit mythology.  This story's overall meaning is again, industiralization is bad and let no barrier stand between you and what you know you must do.  It also speaks a lot to accomplishing your goals when a major barrier is your own fear, which is a very adult message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">FJ,<br />
Thanks for the quick reply, and insights.  I have found that when I introduce a book like &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and &quot;Watership Down&quot;to young readers, they ofter read it again later when they are older.  This has 2 benifits,<br />
1) They find points or events that they had missed during the first reading.<br />
2) they are able to see deeper meanings/themes in the books, that they were not able to appreciate before, becuase they were too young.<br />
I have found that the stundent really appreciates the books even more after the second reading.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, that's right, the dorf rings got destroyed...<br />
<br />
It's been a long time since I read the trilogy and the Silmarilion, but how does the elven ring bit jive with the fact that Sauron had the one ring until Isildur whacked it off him.  Maybe they never wore them at the time, or something?  I could very well be wrong on this (as I said, it's been ages) but I was always under the impression that when the rings were being forged, and Sauron was secretly making the master-ring, his plan to control them all got screwed because he never got his hands on the three?  <br />
<br />
I guess it would help if I could remember who actually made the darned things :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u135"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p135">Sauron made all of the 'gift rings' with the help of the Dwarves.  He later went to Mount Doom and made the ruling ring.  Since the Elves hadn't used their rings yet (being wary of a trap) he couldn't take control of their rings (worn by Galladrielle, Elrond and the ship lord ? before Gandalf borrowed it).  The books hint that the nine kings fell before Sauron (The Necromancer) was defeated the first time (because their fall was widely known, even when everyone thought that Sauron was dead).  You must remember that the third age of the world (starting when Melkor broke the world and ending when Issildor defeated Sauron) was the age of the Elves.  They were at the height of their power, while Man was at his low point.  Therefore, the three elves weren't snared and the nine men were.</div></div><hr />

-Not all the dwarf rings were consumed by Dragons, Sauron recovered 3 of them himself.<br />
<br />
-When Sauron came after the 3 rings shortly after they were made, two were taken by Gil-Galad and one by Galadriel.  Gil-Galad later gave one to Cirdan.  Cirdan, in turn, gave that ring to Gandalf when he came to middle earth.  Gil-Galad gave the other ring to Elrond, I am not clear when but I think it was shortly before Gil-Galad went off to die at the siege of the dark tower in the war of the last alliance.<br />
<br />
-Gandalf (Olorin) was a Maia of Manwe.  Saruman was of Aule.<br />
<br />
-The Second Age began after the downfall of Melkor and the destruction of Beliariand (probably misspelled) and ended with the war of the last alliance.  Then you have the Third age from then until the ring is destroyed (or Galadriel leaves ME ending the curse of the noldor, the age of the elves, and all that jazz)<br />
<br />
-The first movie was a rather well done adaptation.  The second one was the cinematic equivalent of Peter Jackson walking to Tolkien's grave, dropping his pants, and defecating on it.<br />

Tolkein wasn't so stupid to think that women can only be considered as equal to men if they behaved as inferior versions of men, adopting male values.  As a veteran of the 1st World War he understood that female attributes - gentleness and compassion - are far more valuable than typical male attributes - competitiveness and aggression.<br />
<br />
He was also aware that women often have a resilience that is quite astonishing.  The greatest feat of arms (the killing of the Nazgul) in LOTR is done by a woman (Eowyn).  NOT because of dazzling swordplay, or tremendous strength, but because only a woman could even stand her ground (when all Theoden's escort had fled).<br />

Close, but not quite.  Sauron (in the guise of Annattar) helped the Elf smiths make the rings of power for dwarves and men.  Sauron went away and forged his Ruling Ring, while the smiths made their three great rings for their kin.  When Sauron put on the One Ring, the elf lords were aware of it and removed theirs.  The men were ensnared because of their lust for power, but the seven dwarf lords cared only for wealth and the gems of the earth and resisted the One Ring's call.  Once Sauron was defeated and his ability to manifest in flesh was destroyed, the Elves thought they were safe to use their rings again.  Elrond used his to keep Rivendel safe and Galadriel use hers to maintain Lothlorian.  Sauron recovered all the mens' and dwarve's rings during the first war (even though Gandalf says in the movie that the dwarve's rings were consumed by dragon fire).</div></div><hr />

Ok, I'll admitt, I may be overreacting on this matter, so here's my point of view.  <br />
<br />
1) I have worked with the haddicapped poulation (in education) for over 10 years, and I have see remarks, that while not ment to be directed at any one person, do great harm to a handicapped person's ego/feeling of self-worth.<br />
<br />
2) I have a son who is very mildly autistic, he goes to &quot;typical school&quot;, and regular classes (doing quite well academicaly) but has some socialization issues.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that you are a fine person, and didn't intend to offend anyone.  I appologize for getting on my &quot;soap box&quot; about PC and all, but I get concerned because we &quot;the posters&quot; do not know who is reading these forums, and what their RL situations are.<br />

I am missing the &quot;not quite&quot;.  The only thing in this paragraph that is inconsistent with what you quoted is your denial that any of the Seven were consumed by dragons.  On this point, I don't have time to look for the reference in the books, but both Encyclopedia of Arda  http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/s/sevenrings.html and Grey Havens http://tolkien.cro.net/rings/keepers.html say that some of them were (though they seem to disagree on the number), and I trust EoA quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

There's a shrine to The Sword that was Broken in Rivendel.  Why?  The heirs of Isildor have always carried the shards with them and it has never &quot;rested&quot; in Rivendel.  And why didn't they mention that it was now reforged after Lorien?<br />
<br />
When orcs are near, Glamdring (Gandalf's sword) glows.  Bilbo is amazed that his Sting glows &quot;just like Gandalf's.&quot;  However, throughout the battle in Morea, Sting glows and Glamdring doesn't.</div></div><hr />

They sort of mention the reforging in the extended edition of LoRT1.  They have this scene where Aragorn is at the grave of his mother and Elrond comes over to talk about his birthright and how he should not be afraid of what his roots did blah blah...

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u157"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p157">I mentioned Anti-Feminism because that is a theme I have heard on one of the documentaries I have seen on PBS or something... if I remember correctly it was part of the modern Political Correctness movement which I dont particularly agree can be applied to a somewhat old story such as this.  But Eiwen (sp?) had to disguise herself like a male soldier to fight even though the culture she came from was obviously based on Viking lore where women could fight... all other females are passing characters save Galadriel who in turn is a whore ;) hehe<br />
<br />
Hmm.. Tolikien is anti-feminist?<br />
<br />
Who performs the greatest feat of arms in the book - Eowyn kills the Lord of the Nazgul.<br />
<br />
Who makes the greatest sacrifice in the book - Arwen sacrifices her immortality.<br />
<br />
Who is the wisest of the Elves - Galadriel.<br />
<br />
The female roles in the book reflect a realistic attitude to the roles the societies in the book would allow wormen.  It does not show women as inferior.<br />
<br />
If anything, the book is anti-male.  The bad people are generally of what gender?</div></div><hr />

Tolkien as a mysogynist is funnier than my attempt at spelling the word.<br />
<br />
And Grobbles is a sicko for bumping on frog sammiches.</div></div><hr />

The inky's are ok, but they smell funny...<br />
That is why I hate the frogs.<br />
<br />
**When I group with them, I /g how much that I hate them, then /t to make sure that I am not going to far.  Most Frogs, surprisingly, have thick skins. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">&quot;Why the issue with frog Shamans?&quot;<br />
<br />
should be worded<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the issue with frogs&quot;.<br />
<br />
Stupid race decision imo.  I feel much more satisfied playing more traditional rpg characters.  If anything, I would have thought they'd release goblins as a playable race over frogs.  <br />
<br />
Basically, in my mind, anything found in Tolkien = good.<br />
Anything found in D&amp;D = good.  <br />
<br />
Random weird alien GoD stuff, frogs, walking cats = bad.</div></div><hr />

That's why.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well you need to distinguish between:<br />
<br />
Froglok and Guktan.<br />
<br />
Froglok = ownage.<br />
<br />
Guktan = gag me.</div></div><hr />
