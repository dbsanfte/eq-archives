<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I guess I'm in a good spot--running out of AA to get.  I think I have about 20ish to go before I only have stat stuff left (most of which are maxxed anyway).<br />
<br />
So . . .<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what the AA costs on level 2 and 3 of hastened rabidity and level 2 of suspend minion are?  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've been told lvl 2 of suspend is 3 pts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Trusk1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I remember correctly, lvl 2 was fewer points than lvl 1.   Isn't it 4 for SM1, and 3 for SM2?<br />

  Any questions you have on AA cost can be quickly found out with Magelo.  Just modify your profile to include the AA up to the point of which one you want to buy, then look at the Alt Adv section on profile and it shows cost of next level ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">or go here ....http://eq.crgaming.com/archetype/default.asp?Action=Cat&amp;ClassId=4</div></div><hr />

CastersRealm info is wrong. The first AA I checked had the wrong info. Advanced Healing Gift is 2/3/4, not 2/4/6 like CastersRealm says. I wouldn't trust anything on there.</div></div><hr />

Magelo isn't right for Hastened Rabidity though. Hastened Rabidity goes 2/3/4, not 2/4/6.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They also have the wrong AA cost for Spirit Call, Virulent Paralysis, maybe more. I had a brief glimmer of hope for that site when they added &quot;click here to report a correction&quot; links, but I have tried that link and guess what -- no correction.<br />
<br />
Suspend Minion cost is 5 then 3. I use it often - it's good for buffing up a pet and saving it before going invis, or before porting into an event room, or before getting a rez in the same zone.<br />
<br />
Not sure on the cost of Hastened Rabidity.</div></div><hr />
