<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, you seem to want a whole lot of information :)   BTW,  you'll love the shaman.<br />
<br />
There's tons of threads on this board about whether Shamans should focus on AC/Hitpoints/or Wisdom.  I think that a majority are big believers in focusing on hitpoints and ac, and fill in with wisdom where you can.  So, when you are looking for equipment, keep that in mind.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you buy a Ceremonial Iksar Breastplate (Ikky BP) (for the regen--very nice for shammies who canni-dance for mana starting in 20's) and a decent shield.  Buy a nice piercer, a 1HB, and 2HB weapon.  The Ikky BP runs 4-8 K depending on server.<br />
<br />
Maybe kill in fill in misc. slots with totemic/rygorr for now.<br />
<br />
I'd visit this board at least once a week and read the threads.  You'll learn what you need to about playing a shaman.\\<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck to you!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>chouka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since I came to this board, My shammy play has improved dramatically. Things that I found really usefull are as follow:<br />
<br />
1- check the zone hunting guides on this board<br />
<br />
2- when shopping follow this simple rule assing a point value to    the items your considering as follow <br />
       1ac=1sta= 1.2 point<br />
       1wis=10hp=10mana= 1 point<br />
this helped me a lot when I had limited fund and made chosing between 2 close items easyly.<br />
<br />
3- Solo a lot and swich between 1hb, peirce, 2hb this will ensure you max out those skills and especially the all important defence for the later game. (I went from 20 to 35 woiedling a Drakkel Icegrinder and I really hated myself at 40 when I got a decent sheild and peirce but my peirce skill was only 120)<br />
<br />
4- learn to live buffed. all buffs, str-sta-agi-sheild-talismam-sow- and fury/frenzy (or dex before you get that line) It does make a difference. I can solo blues at 40 with those buffs on and my pet erasyly... if one of those goes down I most likely will have to consider running. <br />
<br />
5- dont waste plats on alchemy. More than any other trade this one is a plat sick hole and unless you have a guaranteed market like trough your guild, its not worth the effort.<br />
<br />
Well thats my 2 coppers... Enjoy the game, despite all the bitching in moaning you'll read, shamam remain the best class to play!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Urthshade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks guys <br />
i decided to make a troll shammy<br />
but one question that i got is will the regen on ikky stack with troll regen and at 20 somethin i think i ger regen so would that stack also with both of them.<br />
 <br />
oh and i decided to buy a rune etched ice worm fang but should i try to get 200 wis or just hp mana items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Item, racial and spell regen all stack.<br />
<br />
With fungi, regrowth and AA regen3 I am regening at 40hp/tick at level 60 (ogre not troll). But you really do need it so you can have mana to cast spells - get used to pressing that canni button at 24, you will be hitting it millions of times on your road to 65 :).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you definately dont need 200 wis. I would reccomend an ikky bp, the cheapest horse(its worth it) 6/65 rings bs electrum ears, the reif is quite a nice piercer. Then go for hp/ac type gear to fill in the rest of your slots. With a horse and ikky bp you will regen mana and hp quite quickly. Hunt mostly outside and your total mana pool will not be a concern. I 2 box and am quite twinked but still at 39 I practically never go below 50% mana even having to slow multiple adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urthshade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">few knew questions<br />
What shield to but?<br />
and about how much do those nice dragon bracers cost<br />
are they worth it if they are expenisive<br />
and i saw a metal linked crown are they expensive if so what is another good shammy helm</div></div><hr />
