I first want to say how great a site this has been for me. The things that I have learned to do, not to do, and look for has been valueable beyond compare for me, I thank you one and all!  I am a 33rd lvl Shammy on Terris-Thule, I was in Rathe, hunting Hill Giants with a freind of mine (32 lvl Druid), when a person asked me to cast Grow on him.  Being a freindly sort of Barbarian, I said sure.  After I cast the spell on him, he gave me A Polished Tin Mail Shirt!!  Well, I'm not sure how much it is worth, but its stats beat the heck out of the Blood Stained Tunic I was wearing!!  I would like to know if this chest piece is a common thing and what it may be worth.  Was I given a really special thing by some fantastically benevolent high level person, or will it be a very common piece of armor.  Either way, I am very gratefull for the gift, I was just wondering.<br />
<br />
By the way, I still havent found out what in the world a JBB is.  Could someone give me its real name and stats please?  I guess that last question really shows my newbiness!!<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to read this, and for all the great advise!!<br />

I'm a Barbarian, so I can wear the Plate stuff, its nice to finally know what the heck JBB stands for (Even if I'm quite a ways away from it yet!!).  Heck, I still don't know what 1k plat looks like in the bank!! heheheh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A lot of the PoP loot can not be sold to vendors so people either try to sell it in the Bazaar or give it away. I'm guessing that the polished tin mail can not be sold to a vendor. Wish I had one, I still have my Bloodstained Tunic.</div></div><hr />

I was so excited to get the Emerald Dragon scale when I helped (okay, I really just died quickly after a few heals &amp; then too many slow attempts) with Wuoshi. :p  I'm wearing Rune Etched until I can get off my lazy but to grab the tusk I need for the Tunic.  All of a sudden I feel like I'm in a Bloodstained Tunic again. :(<br />
<br />
The resists are still nice on Emerald, but ~46hp +6 AC (raw) on your new shirt is much better I think.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to you though! <br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This item drops in the Factory area in PoI. I've seen at least one every trip there.<br />
<br />
It has a rec. level of 50 but is equippable with reduced stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Got mine for 3k shortly after they started dropping in the Bazaar, then shortly after that the price on them was up to 7-8k on Prexus, havent looked recently, so not sure if thats changed again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Laylana Angelhart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Friend of mine asked if i wanted one of these and i said yeah because it is a slight upgrade from the rune etched BP's from Hate. <br />
<br />
The HP/Mana comparison between the twp BP's evens out. It's approx 20 more hps for 20 less mana. :p<br />
<br />
But the added AC is always welcome. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To All:<br />
Thank you very much for the your time and expertise, It's great to get advise from &quot;those in the know&quot;.  This is just annother example of why this is the BEST Shammy site, and we are the BEST EQ class!! I was thinking of selling it for about 4k, and &quot;gearing up&quot; other slots.  After all the replies, I think I'll keep it on, it seems too good to lose.<br />
Thanks Again!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Greakan_VF</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As Seredith said, it's a drop in the factory of PoI and fairly common there. The hitch is that the factory is locked and very few have a flag for it. So far this is what has been limiting the amount of tin mail shirts that enter the market.<br />
<br />
You get a flag by doing the follow the gnome quest and killing Xanamech, the PoI dragon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've seen the boots and shirt.  Are there any other pieces of this stuff floating around?</div></div><hr />
