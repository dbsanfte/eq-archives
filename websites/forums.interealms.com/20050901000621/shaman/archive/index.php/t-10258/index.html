<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok guys so here it is. I'm going to dng level 40 soon and i wanna challenge my RL friends Monk to a duel, i know i can win but the problem is monks hit to dam fast and if he interuppts enough i'll lose. So i'm wondering on what tactics i should use eg Malo then root etc etc. All help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Start the fight with blind. Run back and root him. Stick a slow and malo. Make sure he does not ever get close. Once root breaks bling and root again. Hide behind rocks and trees and cast dot nukes and anything that floats your boat.  Be easy on mana. If he mends and your oom you are in some big trouble.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ok but warning my divination is like in the 20's and is pathetic!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">looks like you got some work to do then</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monks are simple to kill IF they have no MR. Most monks I fight (on a pvp server) do not have resists. The smart ones do and they are tough to kill. <br />
<br />
Will he let you have a pet? Do you have time to buff up before the fight? If you have a pet just haste it, give it two weapons, sow it, and kite him around. When he turns around to fight your pet dot him and try to stick slow.<br />
<br />
Go buy some damage shield poitons. Damage shield &gt; monks. Slow &gt; melee.  Just conserve mana and use pet.<br />
<br />
Blind is great in pvp IF it sticks. You should be able to make him cry easily. If you have any questions, ;tell Rallos.Meku</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If he has good resists, just run around trying to get enough space to cast malise.  Don't waste mana on anything until ya get a malise or malosi on him.  Do not nuke either.  Use nothing but dots.  Don't think you're being a chicken by running him all over the place.  You'd only be smart to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get a good damage shield potion, especially if he uses two 1-hander weapons.  Any good high level monk will have a 2hb they can pull out when they are fighting something with a DS or bad ripostes, but a level 46 might not have access to a good 2hb.<br />
<br />
Don't spend too long trying to slow him.  If you can do it, great.  If not, just dot him and run him around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blind owns.  Insidious Decay is an unresistable disease debuff.  If malo wont stick use that.  Course I think that spell might be higher than 40.  Either way there is a disease debuff spell that you do have access to.  Just hit him with that,  disease him, and run away.  Stack those DoTs on him.  I wouldnt waste mana on a pet unless he will let you cast it before the fight.    You could buy that necklace that summons dogdog, they are pretty cheap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>agoz_rz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You've got a couple options (in my long time since playing EQ some info might be off, but heres what I recall).<br />
<br />
At that level, you can either...<br />
<br />
Use your dr debuff (I think you get one at 39) until it sticks, quick recast time quick cast and it'll stick sooner or later, even if his resists are good.  Once thats on, the safe way to do it is to stick scourge then kite him till it wears off, and repeat.   This is a very safe tactic (very un mana costly) and it'll take a while, but it should work.<br />
<br />
Another option is make it quick and take advantage of your very pvp-oriented 39 spells (however, this method can be VERY mana expensive).  Malxxx, Blind, Dot, Melee (if you dont have a decent weapon/skill bag this part), Root if he tries to run and you wanna melee, other wise keep him blinded and refresh dot.  use VoS, its very good damage and fast for your level.  The only problem is that, even if he has crap resists, it can be resisted alot. <br />
<br />
edit: for second method, you can swap blind for slow and tank him if you want.  The nice thing is that slow will last a whole lot longer than blind, but its harder to land and you will be taking damage so will prolly have to heal.<br />
<br />
If he has decent resists, I'd go for the first method.  You can alway so do some combination of the two.<br />

Remember they got high ac and high dmg if they get close but thier Hp is garbage.<br />
Nukes are your friend. Blind. sick pet. root.malo.SLOW. NUKE NUKE NUKE NUKE NUKE.<br />
Nukes own monks. They never win vs wizards unless the wizard is an idiot. Any class that can decently nuke can destroy a monk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">ok, heres my plan, i'll fight him is DSP where theres loads of sapce. Ill run away with SoW(he has Jboots but they're not quite as good) blind, root, slow, sick on the dog. I slap him with Venom of snake and Scourge and reapply root/nuke as need. I'll put in malisement somewhere if need but i think he has quite low resists, sound good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do remember that dots due to a bug cause xp loss if the person dies by them.<br />
Fix this by nukign when they are at 5% life and make sure it is the nuek that kills them or fight in the old ARENA(off lake rathe). It is bigger than the bazaar one and zone is lag free nobody goes there anymore.<br />
Go forth and make us proud. And should you lose we wil find out where the monk lives and pay him a little visit :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Low resists or not his 6 levels on ya will cause resists alone.  Get a malise on him before anything else.   Once you get a malxxx on anyone you can pretty much kill them by keeping them perma blinded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just whatever you do go to the arena in the Bazaar. Theres always some high level mofos in there waiting for people to come along to kill em....and then kill em again when they try and get their corpse back.</div></div><hr />

What bug is this? It doesn't cause exp loss on pvp servers. Is it different on the blue servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Its really erratic unfortunately, and tbh, on blue servers I'm yet to see a concrete way of causing or avoiding xp loss in duels.  A dot death != a guaranteed xp loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yep ... i killed the guild mage not to long ago .. pet killed him.. he lost xp..  dots =loss of xp ..<br />

but o well ... dot the hell outta him ...</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure it isn't the dot that causes the XP loss, it's the bleeding to death.  I tend to always dot when I duel and I've only seen that issue once or twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've killed about 30 people with dots and I have only had one  person claim they lost exp.  I think most of the people that claim they lose exp really didn't.  They just imagine it.<br />
<br />
I was dueling a chanter yesterday in bazaar and a druid and necro jumped in on me.  I killed the chanter and had the necro half dead but I was dying from all the dots.  I crawled out of the arena and tried to heal myself, but I was oom and fell over dead.  I died from a dot outside of the pvp area, and I did not lose exp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>zathrys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Here is some advice from a monk....while malxxxmay be decent debuff, it can be canceled with cancel magic, an 11pp crystallized pumice clicks this effect, it will also remove blind...if you have pet sic it on him, with a 3 sec cast time and no channeling 1 hit will interrupt the monks cast....slow is your friend...monks HATE being slowed and since it uses a disease cure most monks cannot remove it.  Most monks also concentrate on mr/cr/fr..if he is iksar his cr will prolly be low unless he has some nice resist gear...fast casting cold nuke can help..stacking your poison dots will chew hp fast.  And the idea that ALL monks can be defeated with nukes is a fallacy, I dueled a 51 wiz when I was 50, 1 IC landed for partial dmg (my cr was about 40), no snare, no root, no stun landed (mr 75), he had jboots and I had run3, while jboots were faster by the time he would turn to cast I was there to interrupt.  Any monk worth his salt will have 2 fast 1handers for fighting casters and a good 2hb if there is a ds.  An IFS (38/40) hitting for 200+ pretty much negates the dmg of any ds.  Basically cast dots and kite him if you have pet, if slow lands he is done.</div></div><hr />
