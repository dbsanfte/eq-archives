<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All that feedback, and the most useless of the new shaman spells didn't even get changed... don't they see us having a level 64 version, which already doesn't get used?<br />
<br />
Make it 30 sec duration and I'd use it occasionally... Make a disease nuke *gasp* instead.  Or a poison nuke. Or anything except this crap-o-licious spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i'd like to try out a 6 shaman disease group sometime, just for fun and getting exp. obviously they're not the most practical spells, but they are the most efficient.<br />
<br />
with today's gear and effects, shamans can self tank mobs that hit up around the 600 range indefinately with q. <br />
<br />
if you had 6 well equipped shamans using the top 2 disease dots with full focus effects, you could pretty  much just mow down an endless stream of mobs.<br />
<br />
with efficiency focuses and secondary forte, you knock off about 37 percent of the original mana cost. <br />
<br />
with extended torment and burning affliction, or the better versions higher end stuff, you're getting at least a 10/1 damage to mana ratio, and shamans have more mana than anyone.<br />
<br />
6 x ultor and the new spell would do almost 50k damage, and the only other mana you'd have to use is slowing 1/6 of what you kill and keeping q on yourself.<br />
<br />
not exactly earth shattering or anything, but i think it'd be pretty fun to do an adventure like that.</div></div><hr />

This is just a plain old bad idea.  Adventures are timed.  Disease dots take 2 minutes to kill mobs.  Say you have a slaughter mission to kill 50 mobs.  That's 100 minutes just to wait around for mobs to die.  You'd lose.  Badly.<br />
<br />
Factor in the amount of mana needed for healing, slowing, etc, and it would take a good deal longer.<br />
<br />
Next.....</div></div><hr />

Na, each shammie would just pick a mob to solo.  Ultor + Pox + epic + Dog would probably kill a typical LDoN mob, which means that you're clearing about 3 mobs a minute.  Hack that in half and you're still looking ok for LDoN purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">uh, sure. if you stand around and wait until the first is dead to grab another, but that kind of defeats the purpose. the idea is to rotate through multiple mobs at the same time and grab another when the first is dead, smart guy.</div></div><hr />
