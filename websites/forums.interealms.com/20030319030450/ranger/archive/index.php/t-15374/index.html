<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lonedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All I want are some green gloves, and the stupid frog never shows up (sometimes other frogs do).  Any advice on getting him to show up at the party, or must I just wait (and kill the PH of course).<br />

Its been a long time since I killed Slaythe so my memory could be failing.<br />
<br />
I was never able to trigger Slaythe to spawn.  His placeholder despawns at 8:00 am game time.  At 9:00 am new mob spawns, either Slaythe or another mob.  The spawn spot is the center spawn as you look into the room.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think he's just a rare spawn. A group in my guild was xp'ing in that area for a few evenings, and Slaythe spawned once for them. They were killing his PH every time it popped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Looong after i had better, I happened to see Maldyn walk right past me in RM while I was killing HG's for money (by the way - Maldyn is very very rare).  So I whacked him.<br />
<br />
Then a looong time after that I was bored and decided to go down and see if I could get Slaythe.  I killed a few rounds of his PH's, maybe was down there a couple hours total, and he popped for me.<br />
<br />
So, you can get him to pop by killing his PH's.<br />
<br />
By the way, at lvl 61 I still use the gloves for the resists - they are not too bad.<br />
<br />
I actually killed Maldyn again just recently - again while killing HG's for money. He spawns right on top of the HG hill.  Popped right in front of me.  I was wondering if it was a PC for a while before I realized who it was. Probably why he is so rare - the HG's must just love to eat him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maldyn, Bootstrutter, a Drake all spawn on top of HG hill, at the very west end of the flat part where the trees start.  Only one of them is up at a time.  I think they each have timers and will Despawn eventually, or you can kill them, the respawn is 6 minutes.  The HGs ignore Bootstrutter and Drake, but love to kill Maldyn.  The monk guy used to be on the same cycle, but people complained about that 60+ monk being up so much and not beeing able to get their Jboots.<br />
<br />
As for Slythe, I've camped him a few times, finally got him to spawn for my original gloves.  And I gave up the last time cause I was just doing it for fun... got to be not so fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nightork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">not to put you off, but I spent 24 hours of game time camping Slaythe, and he did eventually pop.<br />
<br />
Other times I just popped up track and saw him up *shrug*<br />
<br />
Keep killing the PH, you'll get him eventually :)<br />
<br />
-hol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ChaseFV</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have camped Slaythe off and on whenever I could over the course of the last 10 levels, and though I saw him on track once over a year ago, I was unable to convince the guildmates with me to head over to his room 8(.<br />
<br />
Very recently (a week or two ago), I sat in the room for 24 in-game hours, and the center spawn did not de-pop at 8:00 (waited both through AM and PM). I went there yesterday, and killed for several RL hours, running back and forth to the evil eye spawn with a couple of guildmates (both the Slaythe room and the EE are on 30 minute timers), still no luck (and now deeply KoS to the live froggies 8(   ). I will go back and sit for another full in-game day to confirm, but if the center spawn doesn't de-pop, do you suggest I /bug?<br />

I don't think so.</div></div><hr />
