<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zooce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Fellow Prophets,<br />
<br />
I need some advice. I was in a classical 'conventional' group last night in the East camp in BoT, Cleric, Enchanter, Shaman, Tank and a couple of DPS. <br />
<br />
I was of course on Debuff (Malo / Malosini), Slow (Turgurs (non-named), Grummus (Named)), and when the Cleric was LOM I would heal to save his / her mana.<br />
<br />
The problem was that they wanted me to max DPS after the slow. The Mobs in East seem very resistant, even after Malo / Tash and Malosini I got a horrible number of resists with Poison and Cold. The only spells I could consistently land were Disease, and as everybody will agree these are too slow DPS to be useful in a BoT XP group.<br />
<br />
After trying everything I ended up using Tears of Saryn even though I got partial or complete resists on nearly every cast, as I had C5 mana was not an issue. This is also not ideal as when summoned I get hit by my own rain lol (if I do actually make contact to get the aggro - only happened when we swapped a Paladin for a Warrior ;p).<br />
<br />
Any advice? What do you use in East for DPS? I guess I need to get the upgrade to Malosini - will this make a big difference?<br />
<br />
Thanks Prophets,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmmm not sure which is east but heres a quick rundwon.<br />
<br />
Ocean mobs(purple nipples). Take disease and magic dots(bane/anathema) only pretty much.<br />
<br />
Sand(brown guys) take poison hardcore.<br />
LIghtning take poison and cold.<br />
Wind takes cold DD's only.. havent tried the magic<br />
dot bane on them but that should work too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Assuming this is what I call water, you're stuck with magic (and the level 1 flame spell :)), if you don't have bane/anaethma then stick FA on yourself, haste, and melee :) <br />
<br />
Pox/ultor/epic will work too but they give sod all dps so not worth bothering with really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Zooce,<br />
<br />
I had lots of trouble in BoT getting slow to stick before I got to lvl65 and pickup Malos. But I still have to cast malos everytime or I would say the resist about half the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I'm camping in East I usually will work it out with the cleric so that he keeps the party healed until I announce slow, then I take over heals so he can nuke - he can do much more DPS than me.  Its even better when a druid is the main healer.  Their fire nukes are golden.<br />
<br />
Malo on inc, then slow, then take over heals and cripple.  <br />
<br />
If I was being horribly pessimistic, I would have told the cleric to &quot;go find a freakin BST if you want max dps after the slow&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For that camp, you're absolutely right. If I were any other class, I'd never take a shaman over a beastlord/enchanter for there, at least not until LDoN came out and gave us bane. Which is a big shame seeing as that's where our ornate legs drop :) Bane has really sorted it out though, better still if you also have anaethma. Sadly I have yet to get either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Use both your top rains and you will have your best dps possible.  Don't forget to use Dog Dog just make sure s/he has 2 weapons (and taunt off). <br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get Bane/Anathema.  I'm pretty sure they work well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOL sad but true, when i need to get DPS from my shman i just bot my 65 mage =(.  I'm pushing hard to get my shaman to 65(63 40%) so i dont care about exp for my mage, i just bot him for DPS.  You know what noone has ever complained about my shamans DPS with a mage pet LOL =)&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sorry guys, but in North and East, all of our nukes and dots are highly resisted unless you use magic based nukes.<br />
<br />
Using rains isn't really worth it due to the amount of damage you do for the cost.<br />
<br />
I regularly get 1-2 rains max for a little over 100 dmg with ID4.<br />
<br />
Use your pet, take over heals, Avatar and melee unless you have bane.</div></div><hr />

<br />
were talking about eastern giants in bot, remember? This would be a perfect opportunity to flame you on the assumption that you probably haven't been to bot in a long long time.....but i'll let it slide ;)<br />
<br />
No poison or cold dps will land at east. Melee, magic, fire and diesese only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zooce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for all the info., good to know I'm not alone, maybe I shouldn't tell non-shamans otherwise I may not get an invite to East (until I get Bane /&amp; Anathema) and I need those legs! lol<br />
<br />
Anyhow looks like I need to do some LDON....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Get Bane/Anathema.  I'm pretty sure they work well.<br />
<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
I've been using Anethema for a long time and recently picked up Bane too.  Yummy.  I would highly suggest the curse DoTs to all shaman - they're handy for many situations.  If you stack Bane and Anethema you're getting almost 700/tick and the curse DoTs very rarely cause aggro...it's just spiffy to behold.<br />
<br />
I often look to enhance the damage of my companions before attempting to contribute raw damage myself, although in BoT there's usually plenty of time to do a DoT or two - and I usually have mana to do full debuffing, extra buffing, and add dps via (curse) DoTs.  So, I will often cripple critters and/or keep up a FA rotation on the melees before or in addition to doing DoTs/nukes.  I find that in many normal LDoN runs, especially if I'm slowing and primary healer, that throwing a cripple on a critter is much more effective than a DoT/nuke.<br />
<br />
If you're in BoT with a chanter, and you're most likely fighting from a mount to reduce aggro and further enhance mana regen, then you should be floating in mana and able to unload on the critters you're fighting with your full arsenal of debuffs and dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Why do you need those legs zooce?<br />
<br />
If you're going the ornate route and dont have any other foci available, you could probably use bracers/arms/boots. <br />
<br />
The rest is trash compared to ldon.<br />
<br />
If you can grab focus effects for healing(rathe ceramic range, tt mask, etc tons of stuff) you can drop arms off the list.<br />
<br />
Why frustrate yourself waiting for a drop or saving up thousands of plat when you can go do 30 normal ldons and come out with better?</div></div><hr />

Ornate legs are right-click root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A right clickable spell(with a cast time) replaced by a far superior aa ability or replacing a 30 mana spell.<br />
<br />
Ornate legs are not worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well the one good thing about the ornate legs, is that they free up a spell slot.<br />
<br />
Between having Malos, Turgurs, Tnargs, Qui, FA, and Canni 4 up all the time, I need all the spell slots I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ornate pants are excellent for CCing in LDoN groups.  VP is superb, but it is only once every two minutes and that just isn't enough in a fast group with large pulls.  For a while, I was wearing ornate greaves over rosraks greave just for the effect, even though I was losing over 100HP.  Fortunately, I won a ring of immobilization on a pickup VT raid a few weeks ago I don't have to do that any more.<br />
<br />
For anyone who isn't going to be getting rosraks any time in the near future, I would 100% recommend going for ornate pants.  The right-click root is awesome and I have used it since the second month of PoP.  For your other primary slots, LDoN armor is definately better as long as you can find a replacement for the focus effects (pottery items, etc...).  There's just no replacement for right-click root, though (not even VP , as awesome as it is).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use the Scaled Avatar Pants for CCing as well.  I have them hotkeyed for easy access if I need to root something.  Malos, Slow, pull off to the side and root.<br />
<br />
If I do win Elemental Pants Pattern, I will be conflicted what I will do.  I hate switch gear left and right, and not having to mem root is a huge bonus.<br />
<br />
Choices, Choices, Choices.<br />
<br />
If VP had a faster recast time, it would be a no brainer.  Plus, it is fun when you push mobs out of the way and a Pally and/or Cleric gets yelled at for a knockback spell.  *whistles innocently*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">rclick root is awesome - one of the sublte advantages is that you can root while spell gems are refreshing.  HUGE timesaver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ornate legs are hands down our best piece of ornate armor.  It frees a spell slot for you, which is far more valuable to me than any amount of HP (and ldon legs only have like 20-30 hp more anyways).</div></div><hr />
