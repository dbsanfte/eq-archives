<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well..im level 56 now..not TOO far from 57, and ive been starting to save up for my higher level spells..which i hardly ever see for sale<br />
<br />
saw torpor the other day for 50k, but until recently ive never seen over 10k<br />
<br />
my question, and my request for advice, is if i should even bother saving for malo and torpor?<br />
I notice Q and Malos are upgrades, and i figure since pop is the place to level they will become more common in the market<br />
<br />
hardly ever see torpor and malo for sale on my server ( lanys ) and while i am not exactly a casual player, i am not a powergamer either ..i mostly duo or find a group in pop so my cash income is not the greatest. I could scrape together the money for them..but i am wondering if it is even worth it , since i get better in 5 levels ..<br />
<br />
any advice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Torpor &gt; Malo imo... if you had to choose between the 2 to buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Torpor is a you spell, Malo is a guild spell.  You won't be worth THAT much less to a group without malo, but not having Torpor can hurt.  And your guild will hurt if they don[t get you malo.<br />
<br />
As far a Quiescense and Malos go, forget them.  They are even more guild property than Malo and Torpor are.  It'll be a long time till you see these in the bazaar and you won't be able to afford them (plus they require 5 more levels)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wouldnt worry about getting Malo.  As finaljustice said, if your guild wants you to have Malo they will help you get it.  Malo is a guild spell and you will hardly use it outside of big named mobs and high end raids.<br />
<br />
Torpor on the other hand is well worth buying.  If you can get a copy for 50k, buy it.  You won't regret shelling out the cash when your Canning down and Torporing up your mana in a flash.  It's a must have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Malo's more common than Torpor from what I've seen, as well. And yeah, like everyone else is saying, your guild will help you get it anyways. I was fortunate enough to receive a copy from mine.</div></div><hr />

I've seen more copies of quiessence for sale in the last month or so than I ever had of torpor.... and most noticable, it's for cheaper than I bought torpor for about 2 months ago (in the 65-80k range, and I paid 95 for torpor)<br />
<br />
Did I mention I hate the terris-thule market?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would go for topor for sure mages at 60 can get mala which is very similar to malo for a hundredth of the cost.<br />
<br />
If you can scrounge money for both then go for it but if you have to choose go topor.<br />

Negative.  In the past week I have seen Quint for 65k, 7th for 90k, Ferine Avatar for 40k, and Blood of Saryn for 60k all on multiple seperate occasions and from different people.  In case a lot of you didn't know, Enchanters can solo the smaller named in BoT and those guys drop runes/ornate molds.  After the chanter gets all of his 65 spells, they turn the runes in to the shaman (SOMETIMES cleric) spell guy because all of the shaman 65 spells are useful and shaman are notorious for paying way too much for spells.  They occasionally turn in to cleric guy and hope to get a Hand of Virtue, but in most cases they choose shaman due to our reputation for selling our families and homes for our spells.<br />
<br />
Save your cash and get Quint... it wont be long before its in the 50-60k range and common.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use malo constantly, daily,  hourly, minutely, soloing grouped raids, so.... shh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with the consensus here.. If you have to choose between getting torpor and getting malo, get torpor. It's awesome. The increase in soloing power is even greater, imo, than getting the JBB at 45 was.. Well, in my experience, anyways.. I have purchased malo, also. It's a really nice spell to have, regardless of situations. If you can afford it, get both. They are worth it. Malo and torpor &gt; most gear :) At least, that's what I tell myself, since I had to sell off some gear to finish getting the cash for malo and filled it with some &quot;placeholder&quot; gear. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't bother with either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Youll get malos/quiescence soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've come into possesion of both (sold malos though) and they are very common.<br />
<br />
I know someone who bought a copy of malos for 45k (malo normally sells for 60 - 75)... so I say why pay MORE for WORSE spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think a whole lot depends on your server.<br />
<br />
I'm on a server combined from two original old servers, yet it's still strangely a pretty gimp server, and I've never seen malos or quiescence for sail.  What else is, I've never seen any spell for sale over level 62 except for the very occasional str/dex singles.  No Blood of Saryn, Velium Strike, whatever you'd care to name.<br />
<br />
Look in your market place and ask around guilds if you like, to see what's going on.  It's not above many guilds to hold extras for their up and coming members, or even to keep them out of the market, either to increase their rarity and thus price when they do sell, or simply to keep others from getting ahead.<br />
<br />
And...if you're planning on getting ANY of these spells, you'd better be sure that 10k stays more or less trivial to you from now on -- do whatever farming you need to.  The worst thing is to see an opportunity vanish because you were 2 or 3k short.  It happens!<br />
<br />
Eventually these spells will probably be sold, but torpor is still 100k on my server IF it is ever for sale at all -- and it virtually never, ever is.  You might not want to pass up a good chance at a spell being sold if you think it will be a long time till you get another shot.</div></div><hr />
