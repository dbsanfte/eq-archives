<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The changes to our, and everyone elses, spells have been a weekly occurance. Having suffered pages upon pages of complaining about them (some constructive, some not), they have been changed (I would not believe for one second that is due to reading our posts) to something that a lot of people like, including myself. From now on, perhaps a big pot of salt should be kept next to everyones keyboard when we are awaiting new spell releases...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm sure that some people believe that the reason for the changes was all of the 'discussion' on our boards.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if I believe it or not.  I will say that I don't remember this many changes to spells/AAs during betas for the last couple expansions.  Something is different.  Is it our complaining?  Simply different devs at SOE?  SOE vs VI? My crappy memory?  I dunno.<br />
<br />
Either way, I agree with you that the changes are getting better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is one and only one reason for these changes and it is the discussions on this board. I don't know if the discussions directly influenced SoE devs or if some people playing on beta liked certain ideas and feedbacked heavily and it doesn't really matter.<br />
<br />
There's no way I can believe that Sony changed the Beastlord Slow twice before pulling it all of a sudden, if not for the discussions on the Crucible explaining how the -30 Slow would have benefitted beastlords more than us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If Sony doesn't maintain some minimal awareness of player sites, they're idiots.  It wouldn't surprise me if they have someone scanning a variety of player sites, at least weekly, whenever they are planning something new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, Udegish, you're right. There are few things constant in this world: death, taxes and change among them. I don't blame everyone for getting up in arms at the idea of a new beastlord slow, etc. but certainly, sometimes it's better to sit back and be patient. The gods will see to it that things work out the way they're supposed to. Nothing like suffering through page after page of complaint and flameage only to discover the offensive change has been ... well, changed. And I'll take a quick moment to agree with Cush ... I'm not the biggest SOE fan in the world, but I've got a hard time believing SOE folks don't at least scan these boards every once in awhile.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah, to sit around and do nothing reminds me of Ferdinand the bull sitting in his field smelling the daisies.  The squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Yell and complain and whine away shaman.  It's our game, it's our duty to lets sony know what we want.<br />
<br />
Slam</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I appreciate the feedback personally. Too many times people have said don't worry, they are just testing, and then it goes live the way we didn't want it. Better to speak up now then when it's too late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well one of the major differences is that I know that we have some quality shamans in the beta atm.<br />
Players who give about the class and who try to get us Spells and AA's that are as good as possible.<br />
<br />
Also the Devs who are doing the testing seem to have a better understand of stuff then during the LDoN beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Posting opinions on the changes as seen daily is a good thing.  Could be SoE looking at the comments here directly or it could be that the beta testers are looking here and making feedback based on some of the comments here.  <br />
<br />
What is/would be nice is having some of the beta testers comments about how usefull/useless they feel the spells are based on in-game use.  The one variable those of us outside beta can't evaluate is how these spells affect gameplay in GoD.  For all I know there may be some significant changes to the way the fights go down that makes certain spells more or less useful.<br />
<br />
The only problem I have, and I can't claim a perfectly clean slate in this area either:o, is the tone of righteous indignation that some use in their posts.  Rational analysis and discussion is a good thing. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Making comments about beta would be breaking the NDA...<br />
I can say that the based on comments on these boards I have made several bug/feedbacks regarding our spells. I'm sure others are doing the same...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Making comments is a great idea.  As long as you remember that it's still in flux.<br />
<br />
I don't like the flames too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This one guy called Fred living in a secluded village, the shop only sold one flavour of crisps. As far as the shopkeeper was concerned all the villagers only wanted one flavour of crisps. Until one day villagers joined together and expressed demand for a second flavour of crisps. The shopkeeper seeing there was demand for more than one flavour of crisps consequently ordered from the manufacturer and thus there was two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If he'd have been smart, Fred would have asked for chocolate. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Or perhaps a shotgun, to shoot the disrupting villagers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you don't want to look at opinions, don't read the threads.  Many people here like to discuss and opine on changes as they happen.  <br />
<br />
Beware the salt - causes high blood pressure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As perhaps a more constructive reply;<br />
<br />
As far as the shopkeeper was concerned all the villagers only wanted one flavour of crisps <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, due to lack of communication between the shopkeeper and the villagers, unknown to the villagers the shopkeeper had been approached by a large crisp company and was soon to be providing upwards of 10 flavours of crisps (including chocolate flavoured... :rolleyes: ). <br />
<br />
However, due to the sudden demand for the shop to provide another flavour, the shopkeeper was forced to purchase a cheap brand of crisps in order to please the masses as soon as possible. The large order fell through, and the shop now is stuck with only two flavours of crisps. <br />
<br />
What happens when they want a third flavour? ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree that not saying anything and letting it go live when something is obviously flawed is a bad way to go around things.<br />
Letting the right people (beta testers) see and comprehend problems is 100% better than commenting on spells for other classes; i.e. beastlords, continuously suggesting that their new spells make them overpowered when no-one has even had a chance to test them on beta and the developers have not had the chance to observe their repercussions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Having something like an NDA for yet another of an endless (?) stream of expansions for a game thats close to 5 years old strikes me as rather stupid.<br />
<br />
I simply refuse to believe that SoE are implementing their best ideas in EQ1. What you get here is leftovers from all the EQ2 internal design meetings. Anything too good is being held back for the next generation of EverQuest. Anything else would irrational. Especially now that there are rumours that EQ2 might be released before WoW.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if I am totally of track on this assumption then I am sure that all the EQ representatives that according to several shamans here visit our board and change spells and AAs if we complain will step forward and correct me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually, I believe at the moment, EQ1 serves as a beta for EQ2. I don't think SoE is necessarily holding back ideas, because it is far more advantageous for SoE to throw new ideas at EQ1 and see how people react to them.<br />
<br />
LDoN I believe is a prime example, and I bet EQ2 will have some sort of zone instancing as well as good gear availible from non-raid content.<br />
<br />
I think the same applies to class balancing issues, spells/abilities, and fundamental game mechanics.</div></div><hr />
