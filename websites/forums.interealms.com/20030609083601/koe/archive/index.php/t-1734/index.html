<br />
Due to some in game stuff going on, we are moving the normal wed night action on Jul 11 to Tuesday Jul 10.<br />
<br />
We will probably still be at SolA, but I think this will be our last night there. Everyone is getting the itch to move on. <br />
<br />
Levels range from 25 and up with a group in the 25 to 29 range and another that is 30 to 35 or so. <br />
<br />
This event is open to friends (that includes you Weezee), petitioners, and guild members.. <br />
<br />
Be thinking where our next haunt is going to be. Things to consider is we have some evils, iksar, and good characters and all have to be accomidiated for as far as binding.. General consideration at this point is Dalnirs.. <br />
<br />
Good contacts are Overflow/Helek, Calon/Klydon, and Griss/Bearan<br />
<br />
See you then..</div></div><hr />
