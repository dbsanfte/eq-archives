Wonder if this means only chars with Oow will be able to have extra spell slot and buffs? Kind of means everyobe MUST buy this expansion to stay competitive. Maybe i'm being too negative...<br />
<br />
Also less than impressed with the fact that can't even write up their marketing pitch free of dumb glaring major errors.</div></div><hr />

go ahead and rant about customer service, reference other games, do what you will. doesn't matter. the bottom line is SOE knows eq is a hot ticket at all times, and that they don't *have* to resort to giving extras away, and can instead reap the rewards of selling those things.<br />

Yes, im getting very bitter cause they took a game that i loved and kill it right before my eyes. Yes, i loved EQ, i deamed EQ, i loved it almost as much as you love a real person, it was that deep for me. And now due to greed its all crumbling. So forgive me please if i get pissed sometimes.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Come on guys, let's be real.  Sony is trying to make money.  The only way to make money on the expansion is by making sure people buy it.  The only way to stimulate sales is to put an enhancement in it that is so basic and fundamentally wanted by the majority of players that they will buy the expansion just for that one feature.  Extra spell slot for casters, more buffs slots for melee's (really all, but more important to melee's).<br />
<br />
No vision, no long term plan, no logical progression or continuation of a pattern, just a simple gimmick.  Will it work, sure.  It's just finance, sales, and marketing running the show, as it is in most businesses.<br />
<br />
Now, let's see what spells and aa's they include, and how hard they are to acquire.  Means more to me than even another spell slot.  9th spell slot is a convenience, addressing shaman defficiencies 65+ is a requirement.  I'm not pre-ordering just yet.<br />

<br />
I ain't shelling out $30.00 for something I can get along without. <br />

Now the advancement to level 70..../e sighs....guess I can do that, what's another expansion and no spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Im thinking kind of like Faern right now.  As I sit here and think about it, Im not really sure what spell I would put in the slot.  Im sure, given time, that I can find one that I will find usefull on most occasions, but I have learned to play with 8.  <br />
<br />
Good for keeping a cure up I suppose, but Ive got RC for that.  I already keep Tnargs and Q up.  Im having a hard time right now with that I would put in that slot. So, another spell gem isnt a big seller for me ATM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The fact that they say &quot;earn&quot; in reference to the extra spell slot means it will definitely be pricy.<br />
<br />
I could have really used an extra slot or two back in Velious when I had to keep a load of stats memmed, but I actually run around with an open gem half the time in GoD groups/raids.  Another slot could always be good for loading another DoT while soloing I spose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I know i'm in the minority here, but was probably going to buy OoW anyways...  So an extra spell gem is just gravy for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">omg they found the gimmick which will make everyone buy OoW, the extra spell slot. Devious.<br />
<br />
Those at the guild summit told the SoE people if they wanted to make OoW the best selling expansion ever, just add another spell gem.  They stated LoY was the best selling expansion and either they were playing dumb or just didn't know it was because players bought solely for more bank slots.<br />
<br />
I think now OoW will sell 10-15% more units than LoY did.  Actually, if it doesn't include an extra ability slot it might sell less.  I don't play melees often enough to know if they require an extra combat ability slot.  I wouldn't think so though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but this time they had to break a rule SET IN STONE to make it happen.<br />
theres a reason nobody thought the 9th spell gem would ever happen.nobody thought sony would come to the bottom feeding mentality to break a &quot;cardinal rule&quot; of the game just to make a buck.<br />
<br />
pretty cheesy sony,fix the crap thats been broken for a long time and give a damn about your players and I`ll re-activate my account.until then people will still see through your flashing lights and shiny objects.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they were Really good businespeople,they`d be trying to get back the people who left eq,a majority of the existing ones will buy the expansion without anything super-special.<br />
<br />
<br />
just my opinion.take care,folks<br />

If it's not well...lets just say I won't be beating down any doors to buy it anytime soon heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">OMG.  1 spell gem?  That's all?<br />
<br />
I would expect at least a second bank of pre-memmed spells, from 9-16.  That's more reasonable for my $30.<br />
<br />
A second set would be nice to keep for buff-cures, keeping the first set for dot/slow-heals, without having us to sit down to swap out spells all the time.<br />
<br />
Of course... this complaint is &quot;stupid&quot;, because I can see melees like warriors and rogues going, &quot;1 spell gem... yay!!!!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">note the operative word in all this is Earn.<br />
<br />
I guess you're going to have to earn that extra spell slot, not just buy it with the price of admission.<br />
<br />
How many AA's is it going to cost?<br />
Or will it be a long involved quest that forces you to go thru Uber-Guild level content?<br />
<br />
Remember the last 2 expansions where we were told that the new spells were not part of what we paid for and that only those that earned them would get them and they were expected to not be available to everybody!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Raid Set for Me is:<br />
Tnargs<br />
Quie (for when I canni)<br />
Breath of Trushar<br />
Kraggs<br />
Balance<br />
Malos<br />
Canni 4<br />
FA<br />
<br />
So Kraggs is my Swap Spot for rebuffing the dead.  Sometimes I mem cripple there as well it depends or a DD.  Thats the raid set.<br />
<br />
A 9th spell icon would be beneficial to me for sure.  Would it be the reason to get the new exp...nope I want lvl 70.</div></div><hr />

Your comment was &quot; they are good changes.<br />
<br />
So you think having to pay for buff slots and Spell gems is a good thing ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Im sorry, but its infuritating that things like making group buffs land on our pets and extra spell gems have to be bought and usaualy at a high price. i mean 20 AA for the pet buff AA ?  Come on, you really think this is a good idea?<br />
<br />
Maybe i wasnt clear enough on what i was pissed about, but i figured it was a given.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like the man said above, the key word he is &quot;earn&quot;. How many GoD spells have you earned?  Got that ancient Canni yet ? Got all your healing spells ? I know i dont. I still have issues getting groups for GoD cause im not in a guild. Im sick of it and im sorry if you dont like to hear it.<br />

Naaa, the problem is this. Its SoE's ongoing mentality that we should have to pay for and work for things that should be given to us.<br />

<br />
Seriously Val, you wanna pay 20AA for a extra gem slot? Dont you think its just a lil silly to not just get it ?   Im sure 20 AA isnt a lot to you, but to me its a lot of time i cant afford to give in the first place.<br />
<br />
I would say people complain out of habit then anything else cause we are used to getting screwed. Has nothing to do with being cool. Well atleast speaking for my self. But yea i guess i am a &quot; bitter child&quot;.  but anyone thats played a shaman as their main toon for as long as i have and as many people here have, can understand where the bitterness comes from.</div></div><hr />

How is this different from any other expansion? Why should it be different?<br />
<br />
SoE is obviously justifying the new spell gem and buff slots as enchancements and should be paid for. <br />
<br />
In my view they are fixes to basic game mechanics. Because of the massive number of new spells and effects since the original system was implemented players need more gems and buff slots. Thus they should be rolled out for everyone as an update. <br />
<br />
I can't say i'm surprised though. This is the company that sold the LFG tool.</div></div><hr />

In all fairness, I have been /feedbacking my willingness to pay AA for an extra spell gem for quite some time. If they are making it an AA option, then how can I complain when it's something I asked for.<br />

Nah - they're nice things to have, and I have no issue with buying expansions and/or putting in play time to have them.<br />
<br />
The way I would like it to be is that expansions are exactly that - expansions. Meaning that you pay for new areas to visit and new items and spells to get. Possibly also new races and classes.<br />
<br />
Bugfixes, balanceissues, UI-changes(more bankslots/maps/more spellgems...), more levels are things that affect the whole game and shouldnt be part of any expansion you pay for. And contrary to a new zone they affect you - negatively - if you dont have them. These are things that our monthly payments should go towards.<br />
<br />
I think overall there would be a lot more happy customers if SOE did it like that.....but they dont and they probably never will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">hmm.. the expansion after OoW might have 10th spell gem and one more buff slot.<br />
<br />
Someone who does not care such a trick might also buy next Expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Damn nonsence if the 'global' selling option is a new spell slot. Right up there with the idiocy of the pet affinity AA. 20 points to provide your pet with buffs you are already getting in a group buff cycle. How the hell does that (1) make sense to SOE to even implement it in this manner and (2) make sense to the player base who spend the 20 points on it and tout how nice it is?<br />
<br />
If extra buff gem slots are going to be added, add them in banks of 8. Gembank 1, Gembank 2, etc. Just like the hotkeys. Frankly, I would also like to see the option to use /alt commands tied to each spell in the book that can be hotkeyed. Then the spell gem bar usefullness is minimized altogether. Given the years of progression characters take (from a roleplaying perspective) the need for a level 65 caster to have to sit, de-mem a spell and re-mem another one has absolutely no character flow. At 65 surely a caster spell casting ability would have advanced to the point of simplifying the casting process of any spell in their arsenal. It is time for SOE to advance past the 8 spell gem setup in a fashion much more efficient than just adding a 9th slot.<br />
<br />
Of course it is far past time for SOE to step up and make a lot of changes that fall under the category of &quot;common sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amazes me what SOE will market to the masses. Scares me what simplistic bones the masses will drool over.<br />
<br />
Remember, though, the list of issues from the summit, the class representatives, the general population are &quot;being looked at,&quot; or &quot;passed along,&quot; or &quot;not being changed at this time.&quot;<br />

There have been things packaged into expansions that should have been free, I will agree to that, but this spell gem isnt one, IMHO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
hmm, I dont think anyone has said that anyone DESERVES a new spell slot for free (well, except you) it's the idea of them SELLING it to you that's so disgustingly crass that pisses people off, and they're complaining about it.  the idea that sony thinks we're a bunch of pavlovian dogs ready to jump through hoops and dump more money down the hole if they throw us a bone here or there is insulting esp to net geeks who like to think of themselves as smart rational people<br />
<br />
simply put.  this is america goddamit.  we should be buying expansions for the content of its content and the good ideas that went into it, not buying-impulse **** like bank slots or spell gems or other gimmicks a responsible company would roll out in patches<br />
<br />
there's also the side issue of the game that people love slowly being turned on its head for no good reason other than a fast buck<br />
<br />
specifcially the issue goes back to some **** that brad mcquaid, the original producer for everquest and one of 3 orignal adapters of EQ from dikumud said back when the game started getting popular (I believe a bit pre kunark when people realized that an expansion was viable and changes could be made in the game)<br />
<br />
people said, look, the spells we have we're either bought, quested, researched, looted whatever... we've earned them, they're ours.  why is it that we cant memorize more than 8?  is it a technical issue cause we could do more with more spell slots and it would be more convenient<br />
<br />
brad's reply was basically, no it's not a techincal issue but look, it's a fundamental design principle... we're never going to add more than 8 slots.  ever.  that's a definite because choosing which spells go into those 8 slots is part of the strategic part of playing the game akin to knowing when to cast them, etc etc etc.  basically no way in hell this is set in stone<br />
<br />
now... they're changing this... thus the comments about the last remants of the Vision (which was what brad always called his graphics version of dikumud) being washed away.<br />
<br />
it's kind of insulting to old timers when you think that the original &quot;design&quot; principle was jack, it's even more poopy if you think that maybe the principle WAS sound but now they're upturning it and the only reason is money<br />
<br />
the utility of the 9th spell slot is actually incremental.  the major breakthrough was spell sets.  even soloing it's a trivial matter to just load one or 2 spells into a particular spellset and autoload.   with the new UI where the book is up and only takes part of the screen, the ability to move spells iin your spellbook, horse-standing with book open and faster trading of spells in the gems, it's not like the old days where there swaping in root with a zok ghoul breating on your ass could be a manual feat.  or you were a ****ing druid starting at you spellbook and listening for footsteps of that giant in EK cause you need to swap out a dot and load a nuke.<br />
<br />
still like in many things the perception of the change is bigger than the actual impact and a new spell gem is definitely a strong selling point among the weak minded<br />
<br />
honestly though, as ingenious, insidious, etc as the idea of the 9th gem is, sony really didn't need to do it people are going to buy this expansion simply because of the level increase.. it's not like the old days where in kunark 95% of the players never saw lvl 60 thesedays leveling is so trivial that you cannot not be at the top level.  everyone who is going to be playing eq in october will buy this expansion<br />
<br />
if sony was my client (I work in advertising) as a master stroke I'd strongly advise that a week before launch as a gesture of &quot;goodwill&quot; smed announce that the 9th gem will be free to all players.  they dont need this particular bit of trickery as the only people who wont buy the new level increase are curmudgeons and malcontents like us on this board... and such a gesture might shore up some of those loose ends as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I'd also like to add that there's nothing new about sony using this technique... anyone remember that sony suddenly promised horses mid way into the development of SoL when those kickass screenshots of trolls zipping through Midgard in DAOC started surfacing in 01?<br />
<br />
so maybe Blazz is right on the most superficial level and it is gay of us to still be annoyed about this modus operandi after all these years<br />
<br />
i think the only thing that would be OUT of the usual is if the 9th gem and epic 2.0 [rolf] would actually be &quot;working as intended&quot; at launch instead of a number of months down the road like bazaar, the LoY UI changes, horses and all that other store-window crap that sold sol and loy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">I understand where yuo are coming from temuch, but honeslty, if people are buying OoW JUST for the spell slot, well, thats the choice THEY made. Personally, I think OoW is offering a nice package of levels, spells, probably gear, raids, campable stuff, etc etc. Another spell slot possibile is a nice bonus, but its certainly not the &quot;deal breaker&quot; everyone is trying to say it is. LoY and the bank thing, ok. But LoY was targeted at a specific section of the EQ population, and for THEM it was very nice. For people already well beyond the usefulness of the zones there, a couple nice perks were offered (spells, bank, lizard mounts, WAS the only place you could get a charm for the new slot, etc). That was more a marketing design than this. OoW SHOULD appeal to EVERYONE playing. Yeah, anotehr spell slot is more of the &quot;Vision&quot; being blinded, but its not the first time ol Brad's pet vision got whacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">If you read the posts on this board you would think that most people here dont give a damn about new content, so they aren't going to buy it for that. IMO anyone who buys it specifically to get a new spell slot is an idiot. The expansion offers the prospect of many things for its target audience, namely the 65 crowd. New content, new gear, increased levels, new spells, new aa skills, new epic quests. Not to mention new improved graphics (allthough in many quarters that might be viewed as a negative  :D ). That's what I'm buying it for, a new spell slot is a convience, hardly a must have item. The bone being thrown to lower level folk to get them to buy the expansion is allmost certainly this lower level &quot;task&quot; system they are talking about.</div></div><hr />
