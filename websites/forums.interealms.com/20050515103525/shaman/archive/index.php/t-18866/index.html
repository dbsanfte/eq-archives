In order to alleviate the issue of needing to /q to really clear aggro in some situations, we've added a new mechanic to feign death. If you stay feigned for about two minutes, all NPCs will forget about you. There is no message to indicate it yet, but one should be going in with the next Test patch. <br />
<br />
Glances at the Frozen Landscape....From ALL the monks i say..... THANK YOU</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Probably get that down to a good minute-and-a-half with a charisma buff...  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely worth a rep bump :p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol, i wouldnt be suprised if they did do that. But the thing is, there will still be monks out there that will never figure this out for the longest time...not gunna mention any names...Xfacter...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, something like this was posted by Sony long ago.  It was a much longer wait they said at that time however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">its still faster to /q :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">not really, at least with all the 1018 errors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Geesh dumbing down the game yet again. Whats next automatically getting 300 aa's and your epic when you ding 50?<br />
<br />
Had to be said, someone says that for every change from custom colors to getting a free bag at level 1!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Something very needed imo.  Still not as good as the bard, insta aggro drop, but it helps lol   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It was a long time coming. Going afk 30 minutes while fd ing off unwanted aggro, then having the mob that's halfway across the zone running back with a train as soon as you get up seriously sucked.<br />
<br />
I'll live with 2 minutes if it means no more /q</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, it will be nice not to have to /q I spose, but it rarely takes more than 2 minutes to /q and come back unless the servers are freaking out.  <br />
<br />
Monks will still be pwned by bards at pulling.  Fading memories should have been a monk ability from the get go.  Pacification already renders monks 2nd rate pullers in most situations.  Bards being able to pacify and instantly deaggro makes monks funny lil diet rogues.   I miss the pseudo art that FD pulling was.  That is what made me wanna play a monk.  (Got a 65 one, can you tell?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shadow Knight (and I assume Necro) pets poof at 2 minutes FD'd, I believe. That takes away what would be a big advantage this would have over /q for those 2 classes.<br />
<br />
This would still be a nice feature, but 2 minutes can be a long time when you're trying to grind and you're waiting on the Monk or SK's 2 minutes to pass so they can get up (when /q would normally be needed)...even worse in an LDoN.<br />
<br />
Basically, &quot;Meh.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">VERY happy about this change.  Pet will poof anyway(unless suspend beforehand), but will definately be quicker without the hassle of trying to get logged back in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Roamers that never forget me and requiring a /q and subsequent reload of the game and character were becoming highly annoying.  I almost shouted for joy when this change went in.<br />
<br />
Good news for those of us that 2 box or primarily play a FD capable class.<br />
