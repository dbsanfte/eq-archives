<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">is there a min lvl for the effects?<br />
<br />
have a lvl 66 toon whos an officer in a guild and so can turn on/off the tribute affects.<br />
<br />
switched to my lvl 9 sk alt and could see the clock ticking down but didnt get the effects, and yes i had opted in.<br />
<br />
is ther min lvl of 20? anyone know.<br />
<br />
btw this does work for the main, can turn on/off effects while exping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a minimum level for each of the effects, just like regular Tribute.<br />
<br />
We only use guild tribute while raiding, any other time just gets too expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how do i find out what min lvl is then??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">With personal Tribute Master, you can see what minimum levels there are by right clicking on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i dont have god tho, so i cant do this i assume.(see the min lvls)<br />
<br />
are the personal/guild tribute effects all the same or different??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You need GoD for personal tribute.<br />
Guild Tribute only came out with OoW, so I'd suspect you can't partake in it unless you have OoW installed.<br />
I don't have any officer/guildleader characters, so I don't have the same interface options you do for the guild tribute master.<br />
I'd suspect that if you right click on him, and click on the varying buffs you can buy, they will list required levels to be able to partake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guild tribute is an extension of person tribute.  You can use it if you have GoD or Omens or both.   It was originally bugged in that officers with Gates couldn't turn it on /off and couldn't use the tribute master to turn in items for the guild.<br />
<br />
It still has some bugs in the guild window where donations are showing up wrong until you sort the window once or twice and then its showing up correctly.    It also has some bugs sometimes where certain officers can't start it because the button is grayed but as soon as another officer starts it, then the originally bugged officer's button ungrays and then  can turn it on and off.<br />
<br />
I'm an officer in my guild and I have Gates but not Omens, so some of my problems may be related to that, though the posted info from Sony says I should be able to do all of it without problems :-)</div></div><hr />
