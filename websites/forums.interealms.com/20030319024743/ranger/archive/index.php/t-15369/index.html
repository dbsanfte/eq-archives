<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In Hollowshade Moor the other day killing Scarflank for fun. (He caused a 45 minute Corpse run for me a LONG time ago and now I got revenge) I see the War trigger, No message comes to tell who wins. So, I do an ooc to see if anyone else is around there to see who won out of curiosity. I get, from a Warrior, &quot;Why don't you go and check for yourself? Expecting everyone else to do it for you.&quot; Now, I didn't say, &quot;Everyone go run over to the bear caves and tell me who won.&quot; I said, &quot;If anyone is near the Bear Caves could you tell me who won?&quot; Apparently, this Warrior can't read, then I see he's an Ogre. Ok, so, he's stupid, I understand. <br />
<br />
Later that day, killing Scarflank again with a friend of mine who wanted revenge but he's a Warrior, so needed my help. I am medding just a bit, when he fires his arrow, hits Scarflank (Well, Invulnerable.) Then, the next thing I see as we start to attack and Scarflank gets closer a Druid comes up and Starfires Scarflank. Dots, kills, and then loots, says &quot;No loot, this zone sux now.&quot; Then runs off. We shout about it, and she says, and I quote, &quot;Just because he was running at you doesn't mean you had the pull!&quot; <br />
<br />
Exactly how many stupid peopole are on Luclin for these reasons? I am curious? Not the Luclin Server, but, is the moon the general idiot convention on other servers too?</div></div><hr />

The Druid was a Halfling, right?<br />
Seems to me that Halfling are the rudest race, either they on KS'ing rampage or the Newb's that camp themselves inside RV bank to beg as players that pass through.<br />
<br />
Not all Halflings are bad, just the majority of 'em.<br />

&quot;The only thing a Ranger knows more about than where he is going, is how he is going to get there.&quot;</div></div><hr />
