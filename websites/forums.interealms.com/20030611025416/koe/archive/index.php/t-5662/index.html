Not sure most of you are familiar with the Khabster, but I've tried to tag along you guys a couple of times to get your attention... Khaba is that lazy fat troll in horrid frozty armor...<br />
Maybe some of you have seen my demented munky, Cannaeb Darkweed? <br />
<br />
Congratulations to the death of the Overking and Queen... hope you can disregard whatever wierd things Cannaeb did... and instead remember how warm and friendly he is. Even though Khaba is the one listed as prospect, Cannaeb comes with the baggage... like a bad cold.<br />
<br />
Hope you guys feel comfortable with having me around, as it would be kewl to one day join your ranks.<br />
<br />
Khaba Khaan<br />
WarTroll 52<br />
<br />
Cannaeb Darkweed<br />
ApeMunky 52<br />
&quot;When everything finally was over with... Cannaeb could sit down and enjoy a pipe of halfling leaf- gay as heck.&quot;<br />
:D</div></div><hr />
