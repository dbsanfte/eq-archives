<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not like I got any chance of a developer reading this and thinking &quot;HEY!  I'll get to work on that right away!&quot;  I'm just typing up what I dream about :)<br />
<br />
<br />
  Anyway, I really liked in Velious that idea of 3 factions, and having to chose which to go for.  Except that it was essentially pro-giant or anti-giant, and the anti-giant also got to chose if they liked the dragons or not....  but anyway, I digress.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I think that they should have taken things further.   Make all 3 factions opposed to each other, and make them irreversible.  Your race/class sets you as either dubious or warmly at the start of the expansion.   Anything you do for one faction lowers both other factions, and if you EVER hit KOS to a faction, it adjusts your faction cap with them to indiffernt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  Anyway, just as arbitrary names for the factions, we will call them &quot;Arcane&quot;, &quot;Power&quot;, and &quot;Science&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arcane -   A character allying themselves with Arcane is setting themselves up for a fatastical voyage through numerous strange and mysterious lands.   The Arcane's maintain the largest Lore, and can provide many hints into the mysteries and wonders of the lands.<br />
<br />
  The Arcane's believe that personal strength stems from attachments formed in your travels.   A person's posessions are in a way alive.  As you grow and enhance your experience, if you show loyalty and care to that you own, it shall develop with you.<br />
<br />
/ooc - Ok, those chosing to ally themselves with Arcane will be going on quests.  Lots of them, and LONG ones.   You won't be asked the simple &quot;kill this monster until you HAPPEN to remember to cut off it's ear and bring it to me&quot;  These are quests in which you speak with NPCs, get riddles and such and have to move all around the place to solve them.   Sometimes you need groundspawns, sometimes you DO have to fight, but only to get to where you are heading, or to wrest an ancient posession from it's possessor.<br />
<br />
   The equipment you gain as an ally to the Arcane will not have very amazing stats, but it DOES have incredible focus and worn effects.   As you near the end game, you will see effects like boots with a &quot;Worn Effect: Spirit of Cheetah&quot;  Shoulderbads with a worn 30 point damage shield.   And when you hit the end game, mana preservation items that cut the cost by half, and effects we have never seen before (like maybe a worn effect &quot;Valiant Combat&quot; which makes it so only 1 NPC can be aggro'd on you at a time)<br />
<br />
<br />
Power -  Those finding their alliance lies with Power have simple desires.   They want to be the best, and to prove it in combat.   Nobody in Power respects you until you have managed to best them in battle.  Nobody in Power is interested in ANYTHING but trophies of your accomplishments.<br />
<br />
   Though they might sound like foolhardy meatheads, Power clan is THE master craftsmen of the world.  Their techniques have been refined and tested in combat tirelessly.  Any improvement they can make in their armor and weapons, they have made.<br />
<br />
/ooc -  Power is easy to understand.   This is raw stats gear and you get it by killing.  Every NPC in Power clan is KOS to EVERYONE, no matter what your faction is.  Once you kill them, they respawn as the NPC which you can have ally faction to and recieve tasks from.<br />
<br />
   Some NPCs will be master tradesmen in need of particular items and they decide to let you prove yourself where they could not.   Go slay their target and reap the rewards.  Some NPCs will possess mighty family heirlooms and if you can best them in combat, it passes on to you.<br />
<br />
   Items gained in this faction are going to knock your stats through the roof.  We'd be talking end game material with in excess of 500hp per slot.  Only drawback is that they have ONLY stats to them, no focus effects, and no clickable abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Science -  Those who follow the ways of Science are a driven folk.  The Scientists understand the workings of the world intricately, and perfect the use of all that exists around them.<br />
<br />
  Whether they need you to unearth the remains of experiments gone awry, explore for rare components and metals, or reclaim stolen blueprints, the Science clan will be harsh taskmasters.  They work tirelessly, and if they do get tired, their mechanical assistants take over (though in this clan it is as hard to tell the mechanical from the organic as it is to tell a light gust from a heavy breeze).<br />
<br />
/ooc -  Most of the times you'll be assisting in the collaboration of Science clan members, and dealing with the mistakes and automated defenses of them as you travel along.   They are a cooky bunch, and occasionally can ask more of you than is possible to achieve, but they never INTEND ill-will.<br />
<br />
  Anyhow, with these fellows it is mainly the old EQ stunts as usual, go here, do this, blah-blah-blah.   There is no limit to what you might be asked to do, cause killing something for the name of Science, or acquiring property by illicit means, is just another approach to perfection.  There is no limit to what you might be asked to do.<br />
<br />
  The kinds of armor and weapon prototypes you get to test for these nutjobs will always have some sort of clickable effects.   Occasionally, they are incredibly random effects (as in, you the player won't even know what will happen), but as you reach the end game, you get more stable proto-types each time.   The types of clickables you recieve would breach the class boundaries easily, cause afterall, science finds inspiration in nature.   Weapons that infrequently proc Complete heals, kits which can click numerous class defining buffs... even expendable rods of Manaburn.   The Science clan makes it all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
  End result of an expansion like this would be a GIGANTIC leap in the powerbase of the game, but at the same time, a flavoring of each character.  The ubers would be at a slight disadvantage of course since they won't realize what they are chosing between (those following behind will see the links to items and select a faction with a goal in mind).   However, the ubers still have the advantage of seeing it all first, and I know how quickly they can re-roll a character to enjoy the other 2 sides of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Anyway, that is my dream of an EQ expansion.  Be nice, but unlikely to see it sometime :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">After surviving the Velious expansion and the stress it put my guild as we had to decide as a guild which faction to pursue, I'll never be in favor of any system that divides players and makes it difficult for friends to hunt together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, thinkig about it more I think it'd be nicer (to avoid splitting people over faction) to make them not have hits against each other, but to somehow limit everyone to a single faction that they can pursue up to ally.<br />
<br />
  I can see the point about not wanting to split up friends over factions quite readily.  I just entered velious late enough that it was pretty much streamlined how to run factions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rellix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The 3 faction idea was the best thing.. I got pissed when they announced it for Luclin and it didn't really come out.<br />
<br />
I like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll never be in favor of any system that divides players and makes it difficult for friends to hunt together.<br />
<br />
You must REALLY hate PoP then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well...no, my guild was all a comparable level.  It was stressful to get everyone through trials, but after that we've worked as a guild to flag everyone.  I don't think it's a good system at all, but it beat the hell out of Velious.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No, I can't do that, I'm working on Dain faction!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I can't do that, I have two pieces of SS to chain for an alt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Yeli up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Yeli up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Yeli up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bah, Velious, worst expansion EVER.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rellix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sorry velious rocked... you just don't have the patience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At least with velious it was possible to faction on your own time or with 1-5 other people...it's impossible to get a missing flag without a raid force.  Taking even a week break from EQ can mean you could be left in the dust if you are in a rapidly advancing guild...I mean who wants to do the Carprin cycle 15 times?  Surely not someone who wants the loot.  Backflagging sux.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Velious was/is annoying, but does not hold a candle to SoL key quests or backflagging.<br />
<br />
My dream EQ expansion just has COMPLETE randomization of all high-end mobs spawn timers + or - 0 to 24 hours.  No more of this pop right after patch bull****.</div></div><hr />
