<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I started a Shaman, got him to level 11, and managed to convince one of my guildies to make me up a full set of banded.  I'm using a regular spear and a regular kite shield.  I've put my 52 monk into semi-retirement, and have taken his Jade Mace to sell, and the 2500PP he had in the bank.. With that money (roughly 7500PP on my server), I want to upgrade my weapon (at the very least), and possibly some of my armor.  Since there is no Equipment section, and I'm a complete and total n00b when it comes to Shaman equipment (been 2 years as a monk), I'd like some advice as to what I can look towards as far as upgrades go.  My Magelo profile (such as it is) is below.  Thank you for your time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sit in karnor's for a few hours and collect jarsath (affectionately known as jarcrap) pieces.  The only piece that anyone ever wants really is the legs.<br />
<br />
Rune-etched icewurm fang is a 12/19 piercer.  That's a very good ratio for a shaman weapon.  Should run you 2-3k.  If you can't find one, howling harpoon, slime-coated harpoon, and spine chill spears are acceptable substitutes.  I used a howling harpoon all the way up into my 50's.<br />
<br />
Once you've got these pieces, start filling in the holes with jaundiced.  For your jewelry, get ac/hp/mana pieces.  For a shield, try a simple charred guardian shield.  It has good wis and decent AC for your level.  Whatever you do, do not ever ever ever equip anything that looks like a book or a dolly (paw of opolla, testament of vanear).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Interesting.  I've done the Testament of Vanear with my druid way back when.  I'm curious why I shouldn't do it as a Shaman.  Will that be because I can't bash with a book?  Sitting in KC collecting Jarcrap is going to be a little difficult ATM, since I'm only level 11, but in the later levels I was definitely thinking of doing that.  Is there anywhere I can go with a good list of Shaman-able items?  The Equipment section here doesn't work.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />

No books, NONE!<br />
<br />
<br />
Go for AC/HP if you can, and get a darn weapon you can do damage with.  <br />
<br />
Shammy soloing is mostly dotting, canni'n and a healthy bit of melee'n.  WE ARENT DRUIDS! (though i did nuke kite to get through 20-23, horrible levels ;o )</div></div><hr />

b/c you look like a big silly pansy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think an Ikky BP would be my first priority, maybe 5k on my server if you shop around. Buy a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang with the rest if you can find one cheap, if not I'd go for one of the other piercers mentioned above and but the rest into items with decent ac and hitpoints. <br />
<br />
If you've got a lvl 50+ friend or two, see if they'll cover you through the first few steps of the epic, the shield and booties are useful and free. Not sure if there's a level limit on the boots, but I helped a 22nd lvl shaman get them not too long ago and they worked for her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Piercing: <br />
<br />
Bloodstained fang (Dmg 9, Dly 32) - sells for next to nothing (10 pp?) <br />
<br />
Rukgus's sticker (Dmg 6, Dly 25, +3 Str, +2 Wis, +2 Int) - probably under 100 pp <br />
<br />
Ebon war spear (Dmg 8, Dly 31, Rangeable, +4 Str, +3 Wis, +5 vsMg) - probably 100-200 pp, this one is nice because when you upgrade you could move it to your range slot to continue to benefit from the stats. <br />
<br />
Bettle stinger (Dmg 8, Dly 23, +4 Agi, +4 Dex, +4 Wis) - 100-200 pp) <br />
<br />
Spine chill spear (Dmg 10, Dly 28, +3 Sta, +6 Wis, +10 vsCold) - 200-400 pp <br />
<br />
Slime coated harpoon (Dmg 10, Dly 25, Rangeable, +5 Wis, +10 Mana) - 200-500 pp <br />
<br />
One hand blunt: <br />
<br />
Screaming mace (8 dmg, 35 dly, Effect of Screaming Mace), Cold iron morning star (9 dmg, 35 dly), Enamelled black mace (Dmg 8, Dly 28) - These are old-world weapons, now make nice lower level weapons, and are probably around 50-100 pp <br />
<br />
Wraith bone hammer (Dmg 8, Dly 26, +5 Str, +2 Wis, +2 Int), Sharkbone Warhammer (Dmg 8, Dly 26, +5 Wis), Velium Etched Stone Mace (Dmg 7, Dly 22, +3 Str, +3 Wis), or Centi warhammer (Dmg 15, Dly 32- great ratio!, +5 Str, +5 Sta, +2 Wis) - 100-200 pp <br />
<br />
Smoldering Brand (Dmg 9, Dly 22, +3 Str, Effect of Burn from level 1 - NICE weapon), Ykeshan War Club (Dmg 9, Dly 24, Effect of Ykesha from level 37) - 200-500pp <br />
<br />
Two hand blunt: <br />
<br />
Drakkel Forged Sledgehammer (Dmg 22, Dly 50) or Gatorsmash Maul (Dmg 30, Dly 70) - 50-100 pp <br />
<br />
Drakkel Icegrinder (Dmg 27, Dly 45, Effect of Ice Rend) - 200-400pp <br />
<br />
Shield: <br />
<br />
Bark shield (+15 AC, +5 Agi), Chitin shell shield (+15 AC, +10 vsPos), Crystal webshield (+15 AC, +10 vsCold, +20 HP, +20), <br />
Crustacean shell shield (+17 AC, +4 Str, +10 Sta, -7 Cha), Velium round shield (+15 AC, +10 vsCold) - 50-150 pp <br />
<br />
Clay guardian shield (+25 AC, +50 HP) - 200-500 pp <br />
<br />
Range: <br />
<br />
Goranga idol (ac 8, +25 hp, +3 sta, +4 dex) - few hundred pp <br />
<br />
Many of the above spears can be put in your range slot when you upgrade or switch out a different weapon<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Since you have a little more money to spend, you might want to consider a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang  (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3969) (12 dmg, 19 dly, +5 wis, +35 mana) as a piercer.<br />
<br />
As far as armor goes, the most common progression is Imbued Northman (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=imbued+northman)  (player made- get some Imbued Golden Ivory Earrings and maybe the necklace, too!), Totemic (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=totemic)  (couple hundred pp each, except for the helm and BP which will be a little more), Ry'gorr (bit more expensive than totemic), minor jaundiced bone pieces (gloves, helm, boots, arms), then planar/quest stuff.  <br />
<br />
Just like a monk, a shaman loves regen (at low levels you're doing a lot of bashing, at higher levels you can cannibalize hit points to more mana).  An iksar BP would serve him well for a long time if you can find one reasonably priced.<br />
<br />
This thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1379) might also help- a large list of magelo profiles to peruse to see what others have chosen.<br />
<br />
If I was starting over with 7k, I'd grab an iksar BP, slime/howling/spine chill (two of 'em- one for the range spot) spear, the imbued ivory jewelry, some Ry'gorr and the minor JB pieces, and go to town!  :)<br />
<br />
Good hunting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ikky bp definitely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had about the same amount of plat given to me to start my shaman.  Here's a link to my Magelo profile<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=79734<br />
<br />
I bought banded to begin with, and then did the Totemic quests throughout the 20s.  I had a full set of Totemic by 29.  I know I've got pretty good equipment for a lvl 36 shaman.  Just dont be in a rush to buy your gear, you'll pay way too much for it.<br />
<br />
With the exception of the belt (Flayed Turmoilskin) and the cloak (Acrylia Reinforced) nothing I'm wearing cost me more than 500pp.  I wish I had bought an Iksar BP myself, but by the time I realized how much it would help me, I didn't have enough pp left.<br />
<br />
You've gotten some good advice so far.  I'd get the Iksar BP,  2 of the 3 spears, and 1 of the 2 two-hand blunt weapons that were listed.  All of those should be well under 500pp (300-400 probably).  Definitely go with the AC6, 65HP rings!  They make a BIG difference when you are soloing at lower levels, and still are great for grouping post-24 with the Cannibalize spell.  <br />
<br />
The Tribunal imbued earrings and neck piece are very good and cheap also.  If you play on Drinal, I'd be more than happy to imbue some ivory for you.<br />
<br />
I used a Charred Guardian Shield until I started the epic quest and got the Shield of Falsehood.<br />
<br />
Please remember that you're not a druid!  You have more HPs, and better melee options!  Use them!  Make sure you tank enough to keep your Defense skill maxed each level.  If you mostly group, then dedicate one night for soloing blue cons to max out your Defense.  Like its been said here before, it's free AC!.  AC is more importnat than WIS for a long time!  <br />
<br />
At lvl 10, each point of WIS only gets you 2 mana!  ooooh!  If you find that you have too much AC (I dont know how, but you might feel that way) you can always pick up some WIS pieces to swap in as needed, but never sell/give away your AC gear until you have something better.  But of course you have a 51 monk, so you already knew that!  Sorry, I'll put away my soapbox now.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Our slam comes from our shoulder pieces, NOT shield.  You can slam regardless of what you have equiped.  Besides, books look dumb in the hands of a 7 foot tall psychopathic killing machine with the IQ of gnat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Do your quests!  I'm guessing you are a kitty since you are agnostic.  <br />
<br />
You can get a nice cloak along the way.<br />
<br />
Dar Khura Garrison Cloak<br />
LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />
Slot: BACK<br />
AC: 9<br />
Skill Mod: Brewing +3%<br />
DEX: +2 STA: +4 WIS: +6 AGI: +4 HP: +30<br />
WT: 5.0 Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: SHM<br />
Race: VAH<br />
<br />
Not bad for free.  Plus it keeps going from there.<br />
<br />
PS - I think you are going to be surprised with how much money you *don't* have.  Rune Etched Fang is about 5K.  Iksar Regen BP is about 5K,  Ac 6/65 hp rings are 500 each, etc.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and bookmark this thread for when you get in your 30s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, I'm a Barbarian.  I forgot to change the Diety section in my Magelo profile.  And, no matter HOW much money I have, it always seems that I DON'T have any money.  :)  I can probably yank the 6/65 rings from my monk, I'm not worried about that.  The REIF seems nice, but if I can get away with one of the other piercers and find an Ikky BP, I think I'd rather do that.  If I have to, I can always bring the monk out of retirement for a little while to farm giants in RM for some ching.  I notice people starting the epics early...how early?  Now, I'm not saying I'm planning on doing it tomorrow, but I notice some level 30+ with various 'epic' pieces, and have heard stories of lower levels with some as well.  What level can it be started?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I started my epic quest at lvl 32.  I killed the guy in Rathe Mtns to start it.  I had some help for the paladin and SK in Rathe Mtns (I'm not a kiter, and that's the only way that I could have killed them as eve-cons).  I think I'm going to have to wait for the Test of Strength for about 15 levels!  :D <br />
<br />
If you don't know about the Shaman epic quest, www.eqshaman.com has a great walk through, that originally came from Belgar (all shamans that knew him or of him mourn his passing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>dafyd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well if you are solo you should be able to get the shield at about 35, earlier if you are going to buy envy,woe and marr's promise.<br />
<br />
The boots solo 55+, i think, could be wrong there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have read the epic walkthrough at eqshaman.com, and I have to say that of all the epics that I've read about, the Shaman makes the most sense.  It actually has a storyline, and doesn't seem to be too confusing as to where to go next, etc.  The monk epic, on the other hand, makes no damn sense.  The quest begins in a library, involves the giving of a book that was originally just a random guess, the handing over of an item that you've spent your entire monkly career obtaining, and other such nonsensical steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you don't mind farming some cash. take the 6/65's get the ikky bp and the reif. Then upgrade the rest of your banded as you go. These 4 pieces will make more of a difference than anything else you could possibly buy in your price range. Also go for 2/25/35 ears, they are really nice too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Getting the few expensive pieces and upgrading the rest later will help you lvl much quicker than having a lot of decent stuff at low lvls.</div></div><hr />
