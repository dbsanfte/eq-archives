<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Welcome, <br />
First the joke.<br />
<br />
Make a hotkey:<br />
/shout ne pp plz PST k thx PST<br />
Keep pressing this wherever you go.<br />
<br />
If you are not a total newcomer (newbie) ignore the rest and just laugh at the joke.<br />
<br />
Now if you want to play a Shaman for the love of the class and don't have another character to twink with then you are going to have to do what we all did with our first and start beating on stuff and the money will come. <br />
<br />
Your first good selling stuff will be bronze weapon drops off of Derves in S. Ro in your early teens. For money for the first spells and leather armor there is a fire beetle eye quest in Grobb near the zone exit, instead of crossing water past the Priest go to the left of that and a guy back in the corner give it out and gives you a &quot;shiny ting&quot; that sells ok for a newbie. Do the axe quest given by the warrior guy way up top above the warrior guild. Talk to Herger, he has a quest that gives some rawhide armor. Do the quests in the shaman guild. Before they changed Cazic-Thule I would say go near there and pick up FS weapons nobody wants when you are in mid to high teens, may still be able to do that in Rathe Mtns. There is a quest for a nice pair of &quot;Grobb Oven Mitts&quot; in Grobb don't remember the particulars now. Most of all have fun, learn the game, enjoy the game and the stuff will come.<br />
<br />
Added: About level 5 or 6 the lizzy camps in Feerrot are good if the bears aren't there, a cracked staff drop sells around 9 gold and a rusty 2 handed sword about 5 gold.</div></div><hr />
