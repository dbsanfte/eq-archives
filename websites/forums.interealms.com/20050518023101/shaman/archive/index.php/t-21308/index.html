<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to state that those people worrying that level 70 will cram us all into 2 or 3 zones shouldn't spend too much time fretting over it.  I'd mainly just ask if the itemization of LDoN accounts for levels beyond 65.<br />
<br />
  LDoN still exists, and since it scales to your level, should either COMPLETELY break because they forgot to allow calculation post 65, or it will be just as viable for exp as ever once you move past level 65.  In fact this may be just the impetus I need to get off my bum and rack up some points (plus looking at the point change from 60 to 65, imagine the points you get at 70 for even a normal)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well given the way the system works I predict it will both work and be broken at the same time =).<br />
<br />
People have figured out that difficulty of the adventure is based on the average level of the group. They have also figured out that selecting hard is essentially adding +5 to that average level.<br />
<br />
So for example a group that would get the level 60 adventure selects hard and they would get the exact same thing that a group with a level 65 average would get on the normal selection. So by extension the current lvl 65 hard would be the normal adventure with an average group level of 70. So congrats you already know exactly what the lvl 70 normal adventure is going to be =)<br />
<br />
It wouldn't surprise me at all if the level 70 hard either didn't work or was the exact same thing as normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Except I'd rather pour battery acid in my eyes than spend 5 levels in those God-awful LDoN zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would fully expect to see LDoNs broken for post 65 for awhile.  SOE probably doesnt realize the full impact of adding levels since PoP.  Although I disagree about doing 5 levels in LDoNs, but maybe thats just my server.  Getting an instanced zone is a Godsend on BB IMO, lotta tards have nothing better to do than ruin ones gaming experience.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Given that the level increase will probably make some encounters trivial I would like to see a change to the gameplay at the elemental ++ levels.<br />
<br />
With a raid of level 70 people, new spells, abilities, higher hp, more mana, etc. it stands to reason that tier 1-3 progression mobs should be easier to take down for more casual guilds with lower numbers.<br />
<br />
This will lead to more pressure on the elementals/time/GoD. There is already some instancing of Time, and GoD. I would like to see something along the lines of the following take place:<br />
<br />
Make the elemental zones be instanced for raid parties. Perhaps anything over 3 groups should be given a guild instance. Flag the guild for it so that parties can join up with a raid. This would enable the grinders to be in an elemental plane and raids to also take place.<br />
<br />
With progression to TIME being faster as the new levels appear can't TIME be instanced with more instances than now?<br />
<br />
GoD already has instancing.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts. With these changes, and LDON changes hopefully people will have places to go and not all suddenly be in the elementals chasing zero mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>chikasaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">when they raise it to lvl 70. it will trivialize most of POP thats all there is to it. unless they do a massive overhall of POP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You are crying over milk that has spilled that has not even been poured yet.  Yes we do have concerns and yes we should voice our concerns but lets wait until this stuff at least hits the test server before we start crying fully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What is this test server you speak of?<br />
<br />
Oh you mean the LIVE servers....yes I play on one of those.<br />
<br />
Vis-a-vis &quot;Waiting to see it hit the test server before complaining,&quot; if there is ONE thing we have learned in playing this game, that is<br />
<br />
test server = what you see is what you will get. (Or sometimes what you won't get if it benefits the players)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im sure the new expansion will have places to exp up to lvl 70 if its introducing the new level cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You all seem to assume that getting to level 70 will be as easy as it was going from 60 to 65. They might very well make 65 to 70 extremely difficult (like requiring 100aa points per level, just as an example). So I wouldn't worry yet about what you will do when you're 70, you might never make it. We'll see....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Most every expansion trivializes previous expansions.<br />
Hell, even POP has trivialized POP encounters.<br />
I remember the difficulty our guild had at first with Bertox and Grummus and the Carpin Cycle and AD etc.<br />
Now that my guild has been in Time for about 2 months, those old encounters are so incredibly easy, it's pathetic really.<br />
Boss mobs hitting for 1200-2000 just don't compare to fighting gods that hit for 3k and have 1k AEs and dots and mana drains and slows and adds.<br />
My server has pickup raids on every god right up to RZTW and even on ele plane targets.<br />
Hell, I fight mobs that hit for 1200 for xp.<br />
I'm really not worried about stuff in Velious or Luclin or POP being trivialized.  They already are trivial for a large portion of the playing population.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just noticed something, after doing a little poking around, does it say, anywhere, that the level cap WILL be going to 70? Everything I find only says &quot;above 65&quot;, but does not give specifics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Level 70 means that the places where I go to solo for leisure, for 2% AA a kill, will become LB... and I will have to look for another zone to solo...<br />
<br />
My only wish is that we get vendor bought spells!  I'm really sick and tired of farming for spells, and playing the lottery for spells.   If I wanted to play a game of chance, I'd be at the casino, instead of the spell-turn-in-mob.<br />

<br />
Frankly, that's a great idea, Fin. If Brenlo is listening, I think that instead of a lottery turn-it-in spell NPC, you should be able to hand in a rune, and tell the NPC which spell you want.  Such as having spell merchants that take runes for currency as LDoN adventure merchants were implemented. <br />
<br />
As for level 70 grinding, I sort of hope that they will have measures to keep the best exp zones under locked doors.  While I hate flags, I have found that they determine whether or not your group suceeds. Those with more flags, statistically, do better in groups.  I've never had a bad group in PoFire or PoEarth.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, though, I don't think adding more levels is the solution the burnout problem.  There should be more content instead of difficult and boring encounters (*cough* Gates of Discord *cough*). Perhaps better AAs instead of giving us more levels would do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If they don't tie in AA requirements for level, BoT will be crazy busy with peeps trying to get to 70.  I envy those who have EP flags, you will be somewhat spared of the mass stupidity :D  <br />
