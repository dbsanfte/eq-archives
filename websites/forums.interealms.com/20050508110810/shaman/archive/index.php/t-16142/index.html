<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey people,<br />
<br />
Been a lurking non-member for quite some time but finally decided to jump on board.<br />
<br />
Play on Prexus as a member of Fallen Alliance (http://www.fallenalliance.com)  with no significant alts...gave em all up for the shammy...cya around<br />
<br />
here is my shizz<br />
<br />
@#$%@#$ me gently (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=552660)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to the Crucible :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">shammy and shizz, strike one and two, want to go for three?<br />
<br />
<br />
Would love to get strike three out of the way...the sooner everybody hates me the less I need to worry about image and can get down to the  important stuff.  :D   If strike three involves whateverdahell its called speech, I will never get it.  Just seeing it makes me cringe.  <br />
<br />
And thanks.  Good to be a part.<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
shammy - c'mon...tell me it is not true that we clean up other people's messes andl leave everything sparkling.<br />
<br />
shizz - I do my best not to swear on public boards.</div></div><hr />

He does make a good point here. We do make the impossible very doable, turn bad pulls into mad chain pulls. <br />
<br />
I have to agree with the &quot;shammy&quot; reference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you mean like chamois?  If so that might spark off the age old &quot;Shaman&quot; pronunciation debate...which might actually be a good strike three :) :) :)<br />
<br />
Or maybe you could just say...&quot;dont squeeze the shaman&quot;???? Then it would make sense for both pronunciations haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, I remember back when I joined I made a dreadful faux-pas, using Shamen as the plural form of Shaman. <br />
<br />
When we all know the plural is either Shaman or Shamans...<br />
<br />
So there, I have saved you the trouble of sparking the correct form debate, you will have to go get your own strike 3 :)<br />
<br />
(Hint - make a post saying you prefer to root-rot, that you swear by your Efreeti boots, and that you haven't maxed your defense skill. That will probably get you banned, let alone struck out!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Haha...I will admit that I am a lazy user of nicknames for classes.  I don;t take the game that seriously.  For example....<br />
<br />
Shaman  - (I will refrain out of respect for the board)<br />
Warrior , Palidan, Shadow Knight - tank (all the same to me)<br />
Wizard - hate taxi<br />
Mage - Vending machine<br />
Enchanter - paper<br />
Bard - dunno what one is so I can't comment<br />
Rogue - dps<br />
Necro - they are too busy soloing...dunno<br />
Monk - partner<br />
Druid - waste of perfectly good memory<br />
<br />
you get the point.  And I go with Shaman for plural.<br />
<br />
Root-rot?  What is that?  My group usually gets mad when I want to off tank and say three should be no problem (solro with a monk &quot;tank&quot;).  Efreeti - I...uh...wore them for a bit /flee.  <br />
<br />
Fear not!  I will find my own strike three.  :p <br />
<br />
Maybe this will do it...never got a JBB and could not be bothered with getting my epic (after my tear poofed from a zone crash in fear).   I did, however, learn the value of /report.  I did, however, use a (borrowed) fungi at low levels.<br />
<br />
Edit:  root rot example obvioulsy not specific to the situation...just an example of preference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">shammy=some stupid thing to rub down a car!<br />
<br />
shaman=ass kicking medicine man that makes every mob in norrath stash its phat lewtz and bar the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hmm, I like to root rot.  Golems in PoV hit for 500+, and a 30 mana level 14 root is cheaper and more effective than a 200 mana Torpor.</div></div><hr />
