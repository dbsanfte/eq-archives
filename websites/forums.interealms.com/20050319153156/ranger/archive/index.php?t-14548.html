<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feeldary</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only have PoP since a week (/rant european distribution), and after all i read on the boards, i was afraid of being unable to tank anything, and constantly LFG/LFM (more)<br />
<br />
i use a Druid alt who i always start groups with.<br />
and before PoP i duo'd a lot in Umbral, mobs take long time to kill coz they have 20k HP (if i landed epic slow early and switch to a real weapon for dps, it would wear off before the mob dies).<br />
<br />
then came PoP, and i was doubtfull about my &quot;i dont have to be lfg for hours&quot; capability there.<br />
but i tried, first with PoD.<br />
<br />
eek. rat!<br />
*pulls*<br />
*begins to swing*<br />
ouch!<br />
286!<br />
*uses earthcaller*<br />
*doesnt proc* (i think my proc table is completely broken btw, a 57 war in my guild proc much more often with his CBoL than i do with same weapon)<br />
after 2 or 3 droodic &quot;CH&quot;s my first PoP mob is down. woot! i guess they have only 10k hp.<br />
<br />
i also tanked in a guild group in castle, many mag/wiz mobs (undead btw) and the Guardians of the Crypt too (non-caster 471 max hit).<br />
but not the fat oogly Gryme the Crypt Guardian (red, hits for 695 + AE dot), but dont think a single group could kill him, or might be a really close fight.<br />
btw scrolls drop quite often from there.<br />
<br />
i visited PoN too, and i luv this zone.<br />
trees! /hug *giggles*<br />
the sky background is nice.<br />
and there are easy camps with easy mobs (blood raven, gnarled treant, virulent arachnid) duoable or trioable (with a slower of course).<br />
<br />
<br />
as you can see, i didnt see much yet of PoP, but i already like this expansion! do you, too ?<br />
<br />
*cheers* *hugs*</div></div><hr />

In the next tier planes (Valor, Storms being the most commonly accessible ones) mobs hit too hard and too fast for a non-plate class to tank without reliable slow. Mobs in Valor hit for about 550 max, in Storms it's even a bit higher. <br />
<br />
Usually when I suddenly find myself tanking in Valor (because the tank just went down for whatever reason), I tend to turn off attack, draw aggro with a few spells+taunt and switch to 2hs. I've found this helps a lot in reducing damage taken from mob ripostes (Never really analyzed it, but I'd bet 60-70% of the damage I'm taking when dualwielding is from ripostes)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pointie</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i tank in valor, HoH, tactics, torment for guild groups all the time.  Ranger aggro is better than normal tank aggro half the time and we do high dps groups so it all works out.  I dont have much trouble tanking yeah they hit hard on occasion but its not that bad.  I have all offensive pop skills maxed double riposte maxed and innate defense 4 atm though.</div></div><hr />

The zones are great, the travel is great, I even like the flag events.  PoI is prolly my favorite grind zone.  The golems in the factory are awesome XP with the right group, and dropparchments fairly often too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehe, that sounds about right to me, that's the biggest reason I hate tanking their, not because of migration, but because of dual weild i'm getting hit literaly twice as often as a warrior with the AA to ignore ripostes or a war using a 2h weapon, I know a monk can significantly outtank me in PoV simply cause all the monks I know have nice 2h weapons to use, I don't so i'm sucking ripostes left and right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azarius</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have frequently tanked mobs in bastion of thunder, and sometimes in hoh.  slow does make a difference and i do need more ch's then a plate class but i can do it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fufinski</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tank in PoV when I have to and we don't have a pltae tank.  I am far better then any plate class at getting the mob off the slower.  Things can be a little scary before slow as HP go down very fast.  I also turn off attack if getting low on health while still holding agro.  Riposts do seem to be very bad.  I have been asked to tank at 62 in a group over the level 65 Monk in the group.  The feeling was that I had better kit.  One thing about ranger tanks is the mob never turns on enrage, while I have had pallies and SKs lose agro when they turned off attack during enrage so the mob turns on teh melee.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way I do die tanking in PoV but teh XP gain is still great :)  A plate tank is better, but a well equiped ranger can do just fine if they have to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viken</div><div class="date">11-27-2002, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In some circumstances, rangers are better then warriors for tanking these heavy hitters since the shaman and or enchanter can debuff even before the mob hits the tank without worry of geting eaten. In the end, it works out to just as many CHs per mob. Of course, equipment does help. When I tank I have 6500hp which includes ND3 and I also have PE/CA3/CS2 and we do just fine. Sure, a warrior is going to take less damage, but with me tanking no one dies (unless I eat rage) and we can xp a bit faster. I tank in PoV and PoS often. HoH mobs hit exactly the same as PoV golems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, I had a BST tank better then me in valor, kinda sad really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RoddoTorv</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm only a level 52 ranger but I successfully tanked a few mobs at zone in to PoI when our tank went down. Once slowed they are not to bad, even managed to group without a complete heal healer. I'm not all twinked up either, buffed up I get to around 950 ac, and with druid and shammy buffs around 2400 hps. I duo alot, and I'm hoping that once I get my epic slow blade (I have swiftwind) and i get my Druid partner to 58 that we can do some partnering in the planes for awesome xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kether</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never confuse standing in front of a 75% slowed mob with tanking.  Tanking entails the necessity to conserve healer mana.  'Tanking'  without the need to do that is the same as saying 5dps being 'good damage' if its enough to clear all available targets.<br />
<br />
Better aggro can make up for lower efficiency in healign *to a point*.  Rangers can acceptably occupy a mob.  Almost ANYONE with good aggro can occupy a 75% slowed mob that only hits for 500ish.  Its a matter of who does it best overall.  Rangers can stand in for that role if need be, but honestly aren't the best suited for the task.  And don't confuse poor players with the capabilites of another class.  Rangers are not  &quot;far better then any plate class at getting the mob off the slower&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I hardly  think the thread was intended to discuss wether Rangers can tank better than other classes or not. (Although I´m not entirely sure what is the meaning of the thread.). Thats a silly agrument since we are not a tank class to begin with.<br />
<br />
However I would say from my own experience that we can tank, if needed, in PoV, PoI, PoN and PoS no problemas! Boss mobs excepted of course</div></div><hr />
