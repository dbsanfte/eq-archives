<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We have a 6 day stay of execution on panther / leopard. What shall we do with that?<br />
<br />
This is the second of three polls gathering feedback.<br />
<br />
This poll asks about the proc rate on pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A quarter of the poll think 25x550 a minute is balanced?<br />
<br />
13750 damage (cant say its resisted, we all know its got a neg 100 check AND looks for the smallest resist) in 60 seconds. Err. Thats 229DPS alone. <br />
<br />
My opinions on the the changes to panther would probably get me outcast from the crucible, but at the rate its going, and people's attitudes on the SoE boards too (**** DEVS HATE US SHAMANS AND YOU PROVED IT, for one example) I might just find somewhere else to post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I will be honest here. I voted 20 because I want 15-20. If there is one thing I will TOTALLY admit about SOE and their &quot;theorys&quot; its to ask for more and accept a smaller portion when it comes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A quarter of the poll think 25x550 a minute is balanced?<br />
Just so you know, 25-30 is the CURRENT proc rate on pets for this spell. 25-30 is the rate that ALL the mouth-breathers on the other threads say is &quot;just fine&quot;. 25-30 is the number that **I** thought was a bit high, and felt needed balancing because its in the best interest of the game, overall. <br />
<br />
Now, of course, it would seem I singlehandedly got the spell nerfed into uselessness because I strongly supported &quot;adjusting&quot; it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=26069 :<br />
<br />
Cutting to the chase, that's 277 procs during the 10 minute parse, or just under 28 procs per minute.<br />
<br />
20 per minute would be once every three seconds. What's that, like a 30% reduction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They need to leave the pet procs the hell alone. They will tweak **** until it is all messed up all the way around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A quarter of the poll think 25x550 a minute is balanced?Too early to generalize, I think.<br />
<br />
My opinions on the the changes to panther would probably get me outcast from the crucible ... /shrug, seems to me some people agree with you, some disagree.<br />
<br />
Clearly the way SOE started to do this got a lot of people very angry.  Angry people don't always say things as well as they would if they were able to take a couple of deep breaths and express themselves calmly.  So I'm aiming to get some statistical data:  opinions without quite as much rage and rhetoric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Unfortunately Macnair I have not yet stated my opinion on panther in fear of complete exile ;)<br />
<br />
And yes, I was a little early to judge, there was only about 10 people voted when I made my comment, apologies. Although 20 still strikes me as waay too much. still talking 229x0.8 DPS.. 165ish DPS on a shaman pet, thats excluding bane and curse of sisslak running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There needs to be an option for &quot;Whatever the rate on PCs is&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">There needs to be an option for &quot;Whatever the rate on PCs is&quot;Yah, you're right, Griz.<br />
<br />
PCs proc about once a tick, so 10 x per minute.  A little more with high dex and all that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Exactly, Griz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And yes, I was a little early to judge, there was only about 10 people voted when I made my comment, apologies.

Even soloing, its difficult to run more than 1 DOT if your panthering your pet. You will run low on mana fairly quickly. <br />
<br />
In groups, its not even worth it to have a DOT memmed, IMHO. Panther your pet and the MA, minimum, and any other pets in the group, even Druid or Chanter pets. No time or mana for DOTs, no real need for em either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tybor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">agree with the same as PC comments, dont think pets should get the procs any more or less than a PC, subject to the always fun RNG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh good, so everyone agrees with what's happening anyhow.  Okay, done with the pet issue, moving on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I dont get it Blazz, I run saryrn, bane, panther on pet AT ALL times in DoN solo tasks and I never run low on mana, thats including Qing and healing myself from multi mob pulls. I have Prev of Xegony and spell casting mastery... and I know they aren't game changing in this respect. <br />
<br />
I repeatedly hear people saying that it drains mana, but I just dont have that problem. Ill link my magelo as well even;<br />
