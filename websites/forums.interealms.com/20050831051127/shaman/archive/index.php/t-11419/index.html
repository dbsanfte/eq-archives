<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone PLEASE confirm that a 65k lizard is slower than a 65k horse? ... I don't want to blow 65k and then have to.... lose control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If by &quot;confirm&quot; you mean provide a truthful and accurate statement regarding the veracity of your assertion...  no, not really. <br />
<br />
I have heard that the lizards &quot;feel&quot; slower but have the same speel (in the same sort of way an ogre feels slower than a gnome when running).  I myself only have a horse, and only a cheap one at that, so I have obviously done no particular testing.  Perhaps someone who HAS can fill you in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can confirm that the cheapest white lizard is exactly equal to the cheapest white horse.   We had some races, a friend and I.  Always the same... which is slower than RS3.  I have horse, she has lizard.<br />
<br />
I would *assume* that this would apply to all the lizards... but hey, VI defying logic heh, well it wouldnt be a first eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was personally hoping for a melee mount, maybe something that could help them in battle the same way casters get mana regen without meditating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well when i waste 65k on a lizzy i'll let you know ;p 3k left!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kolte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've heard of an enchanter getting a lizzard.. and he was almost ready to throw-up because of the bucking on the lizzard... I just got the cheapie yesterday .. considerably slower than my jboots (on my mage)  But man, i lub the mana regen and not looking behind my back to mem a spell.   A tad difficulty with looting .. you see &quot; Player's mount looks amibly at you  &quot; very often  :D   <br />
<br />
The funny part is when you look at the 3rd person view, you wait for your dude to fall off cuz he bucks so much ...  9k is way too slow at taking off, expect to take some damage if runnin from a mob before you get out of range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Haven't been able to track down somebody with a 100k horse and still be in a zone for racing.<br />
<br />
I think they are just too ashamed of their horse to be seen with my lizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Twidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I believe that the 65 yhorse is alot faster then lizzy, says so in ranger section.<br />
<br />
Horse<br />
Pros- faster (not 9k one)<br />
Cons - Head gets in way an awful lot making targeting tough, although with shrink the head isnt in the way anymore, it still causes probs.<br />
Lizard<br />
Pros-What a look, no head in he way )<br />
Cons- Slower (except 9k) and hops enducing lag. ack<br />
<br />
This is all gathered from other peoples experiences so it might not be accurate *smile*</div></div><hr />
