<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ssizzor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey people... just made my first shammy ever (Iksar) on Kane Bayle, and he's level 19 at the moment...<br />
<br />
Was just wondering... What advice would you give regarding quests to do or tactics to use considering the unique position of the fresh server and the fact that the best weapon i have available is a bronze spear or FS morningstar?  :)<br />
<br />
Also wondering where to get a nice low delay piercer for practising...<br />
<br />
Cheers in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can actually do some these quests quite early, I did some pieces at level 22. These quests require gems and no drop items combined with banded armor. I went and asked if I could loot the no drop items I needed since they are useless to everyone but a Iksar Shaman and before I knew it I had Scaled Mystic BP, Boots, Cloak, and Leggings. All before level 25. <br />
I wore some banded and Rhino Hide until I got Scaled Mystic. <br />
You can wear Scaled Mystic for quite a while some have even into their 50's. Weapons were the only problem I had with my Shaman (Iksar). I was lucky enough to be hunting in the Sarnak fort when a 56 mage did a shout for anyone who wanted to loot the Jade Prod for the Chancellor. I was set until I could make my way to EC to buy a Drakkel Sledgehammer (bad weapon) delay sucks on it, even with haste its horrible. <br />
<br />
The cudgel quests are crappy, but the 8th cudgel is a nice range weapon with a right click effect (I think) called Carnage. So do those if you like questing.<br />
<br />
here is a link to the quests: Scaled Mystic quests: (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=Scaled+Mystic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>txMaddog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Quests:<br />
<br />
The warrior MM snout ring quest is pretty good exp and coin.<br />
<br />
Bone chip quest (Trooper Mozo, FOB) gives good coin usually 3-8 silver.<br />
<br />
Not sure on weapons.  FS Spear is not bad at 6/27, Fading Shadow Spear (ToFS) is 7/26 and I think drops on first floor which should be do able with a group of mid 20's.  Fungal Fiend Dew claw is 3/24 and exp in Paladual Caverns rocks, although loot kinda sucks unless your camping the bandits or the named mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">imo, id go for the levels, then worry about gear later.  make pals with a melee that plays the same hours as you do, and level like mad.  <br />
for pure plats at your current level, while you get exp, go to netherbian lair in SoL.  think the stuff in there is level 20ish, and drops up to 5pp a kill.  (i think this is around the right level, might be a few levels higher)<br />
once you get up to 55ish, you can kill the hell out of otters in CS.  On a new server, the crustacean armor would sell like crazy, id imagine.  can also salt away a ton of armor quest gems, and tailoring pelts here as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you are shaman, just ignore equipment and level up first, high level alway take big advantage especial on new server, ignore farming,ignore trading. just try level high and join top guild that only accept high level and you will ubber fast</div></div><hr />
