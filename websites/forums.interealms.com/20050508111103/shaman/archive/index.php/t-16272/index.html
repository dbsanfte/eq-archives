<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Irontree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't think Shaman are implemented 100% right from a lore/RP standpoint in EQ.<br />
<br />
Maybe my definition is wrong, but the Shaman should bring about benefitial and detremential magic by means of command of herbal and folk medicine as well as communion with the spirit realm. I think that most people could aggree with that meta definition.<br />
<br />
What I dont think EQ has done a good job of is implementing the spirit communion side of the shaman. Again, this is not about in game power/balance, but about the lore of the class.<br />
<br />
The epic, and shaman pets seem to fit the spirit realm part, but I would have liked to seen a lot more emphasis put on communing with the spirits or ancestors. I wish that as they introduced new spells, positive and negative they would flesh that out more.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How about us Vah Shir which directly worship spirits, but are denied any kind of cultural because we &quot;have no culture&quot;. <br />
<br />
Whats wrong with imbuing items directly with the powers of spirits as opposed to some overrated diety. <br />
<br />
Kitties I really think have the best setup to work out some RP shaman stuff with relation to the spirit world, but its taken no where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would reccomend just viewing all of our magic as not us casting a spell, but as us requesting the boon of the spirits.   This appears to be the aim as most are called Spirit of This, That or The Other.<br />
<br />
<br />
   If you don't wanna look at it that way though, you'll probably just have to live dissapointed :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We are also supposed to be the &quot;Battle Priests&quot;. Yet a clerics hammer makes us look useless. SoE has worried so much about how over-powered shaman have been almost since day one that they ignored or forgot what our role was supposed to be in this game. At this point we are useful in most places, and SoE will continue to ignore our lore.</div></div><hr />
