<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not really.   I really don't understand why people always say we are balanced.   Why?   We're not balanced anymore.    2 or 3 years ago we were balanced sure, but we're far from balanced anymore imo.   Staying the same for 3 years does not equal balanced when other priests/casters have gained so much.   I'm not gonna go into each and every other class and their big gains in dps/usefulness, but I can get into ours...  which really isn't much.   <br />
<br />
What are our 2 best spells other than our level 51 spell from kunark (3 yrs ago)?   Malos and Quiscenence.  2 spells that are just slight upgrades from Kunark.   Q is what Torpor should have been in most people's opinions since we are a priest class and should have been able to fill the priest role for a group but we all know we couldn't without the main tank complaining about losing his DPS.   Now with Tier 2 and 3+ zones we still can't be main healer without pulling our hair out and constant cannibalizing (pain in the arse), but clerics and druids both make fine healers.   <br />
<br />
This is all because of one spell, turgurs.   A spell that is only marginally better than what a chanter and BL can use.   And when you take into account the amount of DPS a BL offers with his pet/melee and a chanter with his charms and ownage in the CC dept.  most people will agree that the dps/usefullness each class brings to the table outweighs the 5% loss of their slows...   even more so with the amount of mitigating mobs out there.<br />
<br />
Basically if I wasn't a shaman and I was gonna form a group I would most definitely take a BL or chanter over a shaman in most PoP zones for their huge advantage of dps over a shaman.    But we're balanced.....     (not really)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Jesus.  How many times are we going to go over this bullcrap?<br />
<br />
Lemme give you a brief rundown of how this thread is going to go:<br />
<br />
First, people will attempt to rationally explain to you the major cleric mana savings with a 75% slow vs. 70 or 65%.  Then, they are going to tell you that slow is our keynote feature where clerics and druids have heals and snares/nukes respectively.<br />
<br />
Then will come the 'omg if you don't like to canni start another class&quot; crowd.  This is where the bickering and in-fighting begins, and people start talking about how &quot;this kind of crap is why I hate this stupid board &lt;insert link to random shaman site&gt;!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then it will get derailed into a completely different topic, probably something to do about pets being able to innately dual wield.<br />
<br />
Now that that's out of the way, can we lock this and move on to something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, you could have just ignored it.   And imo my opinion is &gt; yours.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Without cannibalizing a shaman sucks, agreed....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Play a different 60+ character (preferably a melee) for a while, and see if you don't want to constantly have a shaman in your group.<br />
<br />
It's easy to get complacent about everything we can do when we are NEVER in a group without a shaman.  I think you're burned out.  I can do some very entertaining things with my class that few other classes can try to do.  That's worth a lot of raw DPS and convenience to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really don't understand why people always say we are balanced.<br />
Well, because we don't really specialize in one particular thing, but we are capable of filling many roles in a group, and we've been able to do this since before Kunark, as well as being able to solo if we don't wish to group, and we can fit into any size group whether it's a duo or a 6 person group.<br />
<br />
Staying the same for 3 years does not equal balanced when other priests/casters have gained so much.<br />
Actually, staying the same for 3 years is the epitome of being balanced.  If we weren't balanced, we'd have had changes done to our class TO MAKE us balanced.  Instead, we remain unchanged because we have been and are still balanced compared to other classes out there.<br />
<br />
What are our 2 best spells other than our level 51 spell from kunark (3 yrs ago)<br />
Class balance isn't based around 1 or 2 spells.  It's why clerics weren't balanced when they were only good for Aego and Cheal back in the days of Kunark.  Class balance is based around everything the class can do.  Shaman class balance is based around the combination of all these abilities, but not limited to:<br />
Heals<br />
Slows<br />
Resist debuffs<br />
Pet<br />
Nukes<br />
Dots<br />
Root<br />
Buffs<br />
Miscellaneous Spells (like Invis, Bind Vision, Ultravision)<br />
Armor type<br />
AA abilities<br />
Of all the abilities in the game, ressing, fearing, snaring, porting, and mezzing are the only main abilities that we cannot cast inherantly.  Fear is fairly useless at high end game.  It's possible to get multiple items that will allow you to snare if it's of absolute necessity.  Porting is fairly inconsequential with Graveyards and PoK stones.  And mezzing while very nice to have can be substituted by parking mobs with root by any competant shaman.  When a class can do just about everything reasonably well, that's balance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now with Tier 2 and 3+ zones we still can't be main healer without pulling our hair out and constant cannibalizing (pain in the arse), but clerics and druids both make fine healers. <br />
If you don't like wincing, don't play a shaman.<br />
And shaman can heal just fine in any tier of zone.  The only places they can't heal ok is if you are hunting in the Elemental planes on the mobs that hit for 900+.  I can heal just fine on mobs that are only partially slowable that hit for 700s.  Quiescence and fast heals or Q and 2k heals work just fine healing a real tank in PoFire at the 1st castle.  Clerics in groups are pretty much dedicated only to healing players when the group is rapidly pulling mobs with no downtime.  A shaman solely concentrating on healing can function as the healer in a group.<br />
<br />
This is all because of one spell, turgurs. A spell that is only marginally better than what a chanter and BL can use. And when you take into account the amount of DPS a BL offers with his pet/melee and a chanter with his charms and ownage in the CC dept. most people will agree that the dps/usefullness each class brings to the table outweighs the 5% loss of their slows... even more so with the amount of mitigating mobs out there.<br />
I have yet to see a group ask for a BST to be the main slower and healer in a group.  If the BST is doing the slowing job on multiple mob pulls, he's not meleeing.  He's medding to get back the mana he's spending because he doesn't have canni.  The only damage he's contributing is through his pet.  Meanwhile, a shaman can slow all the mobs in camp, as well as heal or cast spells or do other things that a BST couldn't possibly do because they don't have the mana regeneration.  It's called balance.  BST can slow and melee if you have solo pulls.  Shaman can slow and dot if you have solo pulls.  BST can slow and med if you have multiple pulls.  Shaman can slow and dot if you have multiple pulls.  Once class is a bit better in one situation, while another class is better in another.  That's balance my friend.<br />
<br />
Basically if I wasn't a shaman and I was gonna form a group I would most definitely take a BL or chanter over a shaman in most PoP zones for their huge advantage of dps over a shaman. But we're balanced..... (not really)<br />
Oh boo hoo.  I have a monk alt that I've played here and there up to level 58 so far.  When I want a group somewhere, I look for a shaman first.  The reason I want a shaman first is because I'm a shaman myself and I know how incredibly versatile the shaman is.  The BST might do some more damage if they concentrate on a single mob, but that's just it.  They have to concentrate on single targets to excel.  The moment you get something like a 3 pull, a BST can't handle it as the support class.  Root is a huge tool we have.  2 Well placed roots are worth an entire BST and his pet in terms of mana spent healing.<br />
<br />
I have no competition from BST finding groups.  I have no competition from Enc finding groups.  I am the base of my groups a lot of the time and build my group around whatever classes are available.  If I get a healer in my group, I won't look for chanter because it's not necessary a lot of the time.  I'll look for DPS at that point.  If I grab a chanter, I'll skip on the healer quite possibly since I'll take over that role.  If I see all DPS classes, I'll take them all and just play debuffer and slower in the group.  I can do this precisely because the Shaman is balanced.  We aren't going to heal as well as a cleric or druid.  We aren't going to nuke like the nuking classes.  We aren't going to CC like Enchanters do.  We aren't going to dot like necros do.  We aren't going to do anything better than anyone else except slow a bit more.  But what no one else can do is do EVERYTHING at once in a group.  Shaman can slow and heal and add some dps and CC in a group all at once.<br />
<br />
Shaman are the class by which other classes are measured in terms of how balanced THEY are.  We are not to be measured against other single classes to see how balanced we are in relation to one other class and the aspect in which they excel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Man am I psychic or what</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Excellent response, Juujuu. From 61-64 I felt a wee bit underpowered but at 65 with a 1500pt Q it's crazy what I can pull off in a group even with my crappy gear. I've been main slower+healer in PoS/PoV/BoT/HoH/PoTa since I got Q. I can only imagine what it must be like with the 2100pt Q, LR5, high-end FT items and nice gear especially clickies to save mana.<br />
<br />
I've never loved the class more than I do now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, if you are kind of wondering...<br />
I've got LR5, ID1, SCRM so far as related AAs.<br />
I've got about 9 pieces of VT gear, ele plane arms, and an ele plane mask.<br />
I've got FT12.<br />
I've got malosini neck from VT, and pretty much every focus effect I'll ever need.<br />
<br />
There's a friend of mine that has a 56 Shadowknight.  I helped her get PoV flagged at 47.  We've been duoing in PoV ever since then.  We started out on Larvae, but moved on to Golems.  I main tank everything because she can't get aggro off my quite yet if I use both my poison dots.  I don't have to even keep my heal memmed.  As long as I don't go too low for safety, Quiescence is easily enough healing to keep myself healthy when a golem/spider is trying to kill me.  I pull with free malosini, slow, then double poison dot them, and keep up my dots the whole fight, and usually end the fight at about 80+ mana.<br />
<br />
When I go to PoFire, there's these level 65 humanoid mobs in the first castle that look like the mobs in Sol Ro tower.  They are partially slowable, and hit for about 700.  I can party with a warrior and he'll need Q and sometimes 2k heal to stay healthy if I'm duoing.  If I'm partying with a Knight, I'll probably be able to get away with just Q.<br />
<br />
With LR5 and Q, I can main tank pretty much anything that's mostly or fully slowable and hits for 700 or less.  Slow + poison dot holds aggro very well.  I can solo kill by tanking down Sol Ro mobs with difficulty, but it's doable.  The only thing I can't really handle tanking is the stuff that starts to hit for 900s in PoFire, the stuff that rampages like mobs in PoEarth, or multiple mobs at once.  Give me a healer in a group, and I can tank about 90% of the xp mobs in all of PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with Juujuu in his first statement but I view it in a different manner. we're slowly turning into a bard.... a jack of all trades, master of none. a &quot;role filler&quot; when you can't get the real thing. We do halfassed DPS, slows are barely better than enchanter or beastlords, and we cast just another HP buff that even hybrids like Paladins can cast at half potency.<br />
<br />
In my opinion our class needs to be more unique. We're almost too versatile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pre Kunark the shaman was a healer as good as druids but much worse than clerics, that debuffed about as well as enchanters, could dot as well as necros, and nuked nearly as well as druids.<br />
<br />
During Kunark, the shaman was as good a healer as druids but lost ground to clerics increased heal abilities, could debuff even better with addition of Malo, could dot about as well as necros, and lost ground on nukes.<br />
<br />
During Velious, druids got a wee bit better at healing, debuffing didn't change, dotting didn't change, and nuking didn't change.<br />
<br />
During Luclin with AAs nothing much really changed except that shaman sort of advanced in everything indirectly due to C5 and our massive mana regen.  It indirectly made all our other spellcasting abilities better because we don't have to worry about their mana costs as much, so for example while we can't nuke as well, we can throw more nukes without going oom so it sort of catches us up.<br />
<br />
During POP, we lose ground to the cheal type healing spells, but still stay competitive with Quiesence, get even more debuffing power with malos and malosinia and Cloud of Grummus, can't dot as well as a necro but still keep a close second, and lost more ground on nukes.<br />
<br />
If you look at the course of things, we haven't changed much.  We have always been close to druids in healing abilities, but pulled ahead of us because they don't have as many other things to give a group as we do.  We have always been very close to necros in terms of dotting things, and still are.  We've always been close to enchanters in terms of debuffing, but have pulled ahead with our unresistable dr debuff, dslows, and our Malo(s).  We've been close to druids in terms of DDs, but fell behind because we use our dots for damage over DDs and they needed something to make them more desirable to groups.  Throughout time we've been in the same spot as we are now in terms of heals, dots, debuffs, and nukes.  We've just gained ground in some areas and lost it in areas that we don't do as much, just on occasion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here's some examples of unbalanced classes in the past:<br />
<br />
Clerics around the time of Kunark and Velious were way too one dimensional and simple in concept to play.  They needed 1. res 2. a fast heal 3. cheal 4. hp buffs.  That's all that was needed for a cleric to play their class for the most party.  They excelled at HP buffs and heals, but everything else like utility and debuffing and melee and nuking and dotting and everything else sucked horribly for them.  What they got in Luclin to make up for this imbalance in their class is better spells to debuff like the MoR/MoK type of spells, they have bigger nukes, they have the ability to melee, as well as staying ahead of the pack in their own specialties of HP buffs and heals.<br />
<br />
Druids around this time frame were also really in need of help.  Druids and shamans healed the same for the most part, except that shaman got torpor eventually.  Damage output of each is about on par if druid nukes vs shaman dotting.  The major disparity that comes in is that druids get snare and ports for group desirability, where shaman get pets and malo and slows.  The utility of a shaman far surpassed that of a druid.  So to remedy this druids started getting better heals and better nukes to make up the disparity in the undesirability for their class compared to shamans.<br />
<br />
After making these tweaks you have to actually ponder which class you want for your group for a certain role.  You have to consider everything that the class will bring to the group, as well as the focus in which that class as at the primary role they'll be playing in the group.  If you have situations where one class is better than another, but is worse in other situations, you have balance between them.  The imbalance comes when one class is nearly always better than another class for a group spot.  There really wasn't much reason to take a druid over a shaman for a healer spot in a group around the Kunark time.  That's imbalance right there.  One class needs to be weakened or another strengthened.  And if you change either of those 2 classes, you have to still watch how they relate to the other classes.  Like, if you try to close the gap between shaman and druids by nerfing slows or our debuffs for example, then the shaman vs enchanter comparison gets thrown off, so you have to nerf the enchanter in turn to make up for it, and so on.  It's easier to make some small enhancements to a class to make up for disparities, and see how the changes affect the other classes.<br />
<br />
Shaman have been balanced since the basic game came out.  Our power wans and waxs a bit compared to other classes in some regards, but we are a good base for comparison against so many other classes because we can do so very much and it's why I like the shaman so very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why we are horribly out of balance, a combination of many things:<br />
- Mobs hitting too hard, yardtrash in elementals triple for 750ish+.<br />
- Slow mitigation, cut slow difference even more, gap is much shorter between different class slows.<br />
- High tank HP coupled with CH.<br />
<br />
Groups:<br />
Slowing:Slow mitigation is GREAT for the game but it hurts us. Coupled with high tank HPs and CH, it negates the difference between Shaman vs ENC/BST slows. Instead of that CH hitting for 3-4k average on a tank, it will hit 4-5k average if slowed by BST/ENC. Not to mention, same time was spent casting spell, same mana amount was used and same time/effort will be needed to regain that same amount of mana. Disease slow is irrelevant in XP situations.<br />
<br />
Of course BST and/or ENC bring much more utility to a group than a shaman. If you don't have a choice to pick a group member, shaman will do the job fine. If you have a choice, pick ENC or BST. They will bring you in more DPS thus  much faster XP gain. But wait a minute, how about resists? Malos is unique to shamans! I never Malos in HoH, PoV, BoT, SolRo, rarely in Tactics, rarely in Plane of Fire, rarely in Earth, rarely in Water. The best XP (Fire) or loot zones (HoH/SolRo) are filled with mobs who have nearly no resists, my personal experience after 50+ AA in elementals is that resists are a non issue. Again, advantage BST, enchanter non issue because of tash. As soon as a group has Mage, Bard or Enchanter, Malo/s is a non issue. I have a BST guildmate who 2-boxes a cleric in Earth! I see regulary Warriors with their pet cleric 2-boxing in Earth or Fire. Is really slow needed in elementals?<br />
<br />
Healing: A shaman can't heal efficiently as solo healer in every elemental zone. As soon as mobs start partially mitigating and tripling for 600+, our POS 2K CH or Tnarg won't cut it. Meaning you need to be efficient as a Druid or Cleric. Of course when one has a Druid/Cleric, instead of shaman, get a BST or ENC in some cases Bard too. <br />
<br />
Damage dealing: BST and/or Enchanter are far better than us and again, bring much more to a group than us. <br />
- Nukes: Our only good means to deal some DPS in groups. Focii and critical AA can help boost them.<br />
- Rains: Look great on paper, even after Malos, many elemental mobs resist it bad. Focii doesn't affect them.<br />
- DoTs: Horrible in XP groups unless MT is a good paladin. Poison is way to much aggro, Disease is way too long for XP situation. Bad news, cursed based DoTs for LDoN are rumored to have poison line aggro.<br />
- Pet: no contest vs our direct competition: BST or ENC.<br />
<br />
Various spells/abilities:<br />
- Haste: Enchanter has much better with nice ATK boos also.<br />
- Stat buffs: non issue, elemental guilds alreay have enveryone and his mother capped.<br />
- Regen line: Owned by Paragon of Spirit.<br />
- FA: Ferocity.<br />
- Curing: every healer and paladin can do it. Not to mention in XP group situations AE shouldn't be an issue.<br />
- Group mana regen: VoQ? SD? Paragon of Spirit? Shamans have none.<br />
<br />
Raids:<br />
- Stacking sucks. Did spider isle in Air with 2 shamans, entire plane of Fire with 1 shaman, earth rings with 2. All went smooth. MGB eliminates the need for more.<br />
- In healing we are owned by paladins hardcore, not to mention clerics/druids (not talking about CH chain of course). Most mobs have some nasty AE, what's best way to deal with it? MGB EE, MGB Spirit of Wood, group EE, MGB Paragon of Spirit or the plethora of group heals by paladin.<br />
- Damage wise, we doing horribly. 4-5 Poison DoTs means a shaman is summoned and killed, despite tank dual wielding EB weapons. Rains super resisted again, and we have to fall back to FA and Nukes. <br />
- Debuffing: our only last part where we can still say we are the best. We can slow mobs fast, take a few hits, Malos. <br />
- Curing: we are also great curers if needed. Blood of Nadox is just awesome for a few encounters.<br />
- Buffs: FA is awesome, FoS can be MGBd by a bot even, elemental+ raid guilds have STA almost capped or not worth giving that caster an extra 20 hp for 300 mana, rest of buffs are crap or very situational (resists and CHA on DI targets). Melee have STR/DEX capped already or with Focus is capped anyways.<br />
<br />
Despite putting out 42 pages of what's wrong, fixing shamans would be very easy:<br />
(1) Either reduce aggro on poison DoTs or give shamans some artificial means to reduce it: very long cast time FD like spell or a Concussion/Jolt clone. Something to able to use DoTs in every situation: XP or raids.<br />
(2) We need a bigger CH clone. 3500 would be good. It will allow us to be a much better healer (alone) for a group in high end XP zones.<br />
(3) For raids, a bigger poison nuke.<br />
<br />
Only 3 small things, and IMO, those 3 things will make a shaman a balanced class. I don't want to replace any class doing it's primary role, I don't want to be in CH rotation, not want to be the DPS king either!<br />
<br />
My 2 cents, now feel free to flame me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You people didn't get the point of my post, but that's o.k.   I've been playing a shaman longer than a lot of people on this board, I'm not whining.  This &quot;you're not a shaman if you're not wincing&quot; crap is B.S.   I've cannibalized more than any shaman I've ever seen for the 4 yrs or whatever I've been playing, and it's 2nd nature.  I just don't like the fact that we're hit with such short durations on buffs, and slow casting and huge mana costs on every spell just because of cannibalize.  It's like why did they give shaman cannibalize if they're gonna &quot;balance&quot; us by making things so tedious?<br />
<br />
I don't think looking at a level 65 shaman with all of his spells (me included, only spell I'm missing is Blood of Saryn and haven't been in a rush to get it 'cause I do have ancient scourge) is the way to look at a shaman being balanced or not.   I could be wrong, but I think it's safe to say that the majority, or at least a nice chunk of the playerbase is not level 65.<br />
<br />
The way I was looking at it was if a group has a cleric and is looking for a slower.   (Our main role has and always will be a slower)   I look at what BL's and enchanters can do other than slowing and it's no contest.  If I'm in a group with a cleric it seems like all I bring to the table is giving the cleric the ability to melee/nuke the whole time while I get to cast a dot or 2 that only do half their dmg before the mob dies.  Or we can cast a rain that takes 3 ticks (if you're extremely lucky 2 waves aren't resisted) just to do one-third the damage a druid can nuke for in the same time frame.   Having to tank a mob - either by soloing or overaggro due to dots while grouping - to feel like we're adding dps to a group isn't right imo.</div></div><hr />

Get some AA's Man. Your outlook on your class will start to change after you get cann 5 etc.</div></div><hr />

- I have to disagree. SOE should start balancing the game from the top down. They should start designing the expansions with the end boss. They should start designing loot with the drops from end boss. Then do easier bosses and lesser loot. When that's done, they should do the same with spells, AA and XP spots. Right now not everyone is 65. True, but in 6-7 months that number will shrink, and in a year it will even shrink more.<br />
<br />
Early Velious, many people, including yours truly, pointed out how retarded it was that every single boss mob was nothing more than a cleric + warrior + rogue fight because of their immunity to spells. At that time, this change affected only a small percentage of the EQ population. Not anymore. Now necros and mages can dish out very nice DPS, so do Wizards because they are not limited to using lures. Debuffers can debuff mobs and so on. This was all due to the fact that the high level players were voicing their opinions a lot in a time where only a small fraction of the EQ population was concerned with this issue.<br />

Edit:   I was in a group the other day and there was a level 62 shaman in the group with me.   The difference between the 2 of us was staggering and I felt sorry for the guy.  He was limited to throwing a dot or two on (waiting for the mob to get down far enough so he wouldn't get aggro and not doing full dmg on his dots) and using our horrible nukes 'cause we had a druid for main healer and my Q as support.</div></div><hr />

Please play shaman # 5 on a raid and tell me how much fun it is.   We need other things to do on raids than slow.  My shaman is now retired because we had an average of 5-8 shaman showing up per raid (including 2 different 2-boxed shaman) and I was bored.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I don't think looking at a level 65 shaman with all of his spells (me included, only spell I'm missing is Blood of Saryn and haven't been in a rush to get it 'cause I do have ancient scourge) is the way to look at a shaman being balanced or not<br />
<br />
<br />
   So we are comparing a shaman that isn't level 65 and doesn't neccessarily have all his spells with a BL who IS 65 and has the ONLY slow they get that even BEGINS to compare to ours?<br />
<br />
<br />
  BL don't stack up in the slowing department until level 65.<br />
<br />
  Enchies can do a lot of good in a group before level 65 and have a slow comperable to ours, but they offer very little to a group unless you are in NEED of Crowd Control.   And in PoP where mobs mitigate to the point that 5% difference is meaningless, single pulls are pathetically easy to get, and mobs hit so hard that a non mitigated 5% IS noticeable.<br />
<br />
<br />
   I think that more and more classes in teh game are finally becoming balanced.   That is what you are noticing.   These other choices are enough that SOME PEOPLE will take them over us.   But many people will not.  THAT is balance, the fact that there is a viable argument for each selection.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If we were hands down THE choice for a group when it comes to slowing/debuffing, and every group INSISTED on a slower/debuffer, then we in truth would NOT be balanced.</div></div><hr />

- When you get to elemental planes you'll notice that when cleric has to log, XP stops.

<br />
I just don't like the fact that we're hit with such short durations on buffs, and slow casting and huge mana costs on every spell just because of cannibalize.<br />
<br />
This, above all else, is what irritates me: the fact that our top-end spells don't last as long as their 60th level counterparts.<br />
<br />
For the rest, though... I've found that although slow to ramp up, being able to keep a sustained 160 DPS on a mob is really nothing to sneeze at.<br />
<br />
I've always wondered just how much DPS a shaman contributes to the group just through buffs and haste.  Guess it's time to drag out a monk and a pally and parse...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think we are balanced in experience grouping - we can get groups and we are useful.  Now I experienced the sucky shaman levels where I was always oom and frankly not holding up my end of the group and I am currently experiencing the amazing power of level 65 with 200'aa.  It's the steep shaman power curve - that's just the way things are.  Since shaman at all levels can get groups I think we are balanced in this regard.<br />
<br />
Now in raiding I don't think we stack at all and we are unbalanced. I would like to think there is a way for Sony to fix this without making us more powerful in experience groups.  A serious rabid bear improvement I think is a good solution, but unlike many in this forum I think that the reuse timer is fine, its the weakness of the dps that is the problem.  I  think its clear that rabid bear was not meant for experience groups - I think that it was thought of as a raid stacking solution.  But until they jack up the damage to monk-like levels (rogue-like is probably overpowered) its a joke - IMHO.<br />
<br />
And my other 2 pet peeves are the lack of raid shrinks with confirm boxes and I would like shaman to have something useful to do with their MGB besides f07.  What about the 4 other shaman who let theirs go to waste every raid?  How about a gimped mgb Q.....then we could be strategic with our mgb like clerics and beastlords.<br />

<br />
It feels much more fun to actually say I contributed this much to a raid in dps because that is really what most raids are about.  Especially since you the majority of shaman are not 1st shaman on raids and we all know how boring it is even being 2nd shaman on most raids.  Having to say &quot;well my buffs contribute this much 'intangeble' dps&quot; is just pansy by comparison imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You know there is one point rarely mentioned when comparing the beastlord slow to the shaman slow:<br />
<br />
Shaman do it all their lives. We're better at it through practice. While statistics, mitigation, percentages and all the other number crunching plays a part in the comparisons, it doesn't account for the most important part:<br />
<br />
The player.<br />
<br />
A shaman who has been slowing for 40 levels, perfecting it and nurturing the skill is way more useful than a class that happens to have a similar spell that they occasionally get a chance to use when the primary class isn't available.<br />
<br />
If a group needs a slower, they'll pick me over any other class every time. If they don't they will next time when they discover the beastlord isn't as adept as I am at slowing, purely through practice. They'll also pick me when they realize a shaman plugs the gaps better than any other class.<br />
<br />
Most groups really don't break down every possible percentage of every fight - they just want a capable player who does their job. For that, I'm going to get chosen, not the beastlord, not the chanter, not the necro.<br />
<br />
As for class balance three years ago compared to now, it's my opinion we were overpowered three years ago. Where we stand right now seems just right. Any balance issues fretted over now are minor. A shaman can find a group anytime, anywhere. We're balanced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Unless there is a mob an enchanter can DC, or the group really really really needs KEI/VoQ, I bring more to an exp group than an enchanter does.<br />
<br />
2.  I bring decent dps (not great or outstanding, but decent) to an exp group, and very good healing(but not as good as a cleric) to the same exp group.<br />
<br />
3.  A beastlord brings outstanding dps to a group, a decent mana regen spell, and lower level shaman buffs.  Comparing their healing to our healing is comparing our healing to a cleric's.<br />
<br />
Depending on the group makeup and zone, I'll usually, but not always, bring more to the group then the other two classes.  Now my point of view is elemental planes, BoT, and PoV exp groups.  If you think you're an asset to your exp group or guild, take a break.  Your original post has a touch of burnout inbetween the lines.<br />

I tank in the PoTime Earth trials, and alot of times end up tanking for a few rounds or so in the other trials, although not usually by design.  It's just a bit satisfying to know that I can do it.  I know a few of our rangers and beastlords have done it, but the difference is that I can actually have a chance to save myself if I don't get a heal from a cleric or druid.  <br />
<br />
I don't know about you, but I do enjoy playing my beastlord, but he will never compare to the thrill of playing my shaman.  Half the time I sit there and keep hitting the canni button only to realize that I can't do it.  Makes me very sad.<br />
<br />
Either way, i honestly think that the only people that actually complain that they would rather take a beastlord in the group than a shaman.. are the shamans who are complaining that the beastlord is better.  I have never met someone that is not a shaman and has said this.</div></div><hr />

The whole we can get a group easy argument is shallow and what does that actually disprove?  In fact I think this is easily counteracted by the fact that stacking on raids is second to maybee necros... this leaves the fact that we heal worse than we did since kunark we do less dps in relation to the other classes around us (druid crits, chanter pets, bsts have always been absurd at dps... etc) our buffs are needed less etc etc...<br />

Seriously though the main problem I have is satisfaction.

As a shaman I remember spending most of my time canni'ing like crazy so I can get some mana back before the buffs fade again / the next pull needs slowing. It makes the group much more efficient, but the play is not satisfying to me. I'd like to see these questions answered.<br />
<br />
3rd+ shaman on a raid does what?<br />
<br />
The group has a cleric / chanter combination, I add what? 5% (before mitigation) slow advantage isn't nearly enough.<br />

The only places they can't heal ok is if you are hunting in the Elemental planes on the mobs that hit for 900+. I can heal just fine on mobs that are only partially slowable  that hit for 700s. Quiescence and fast heals or Q and 2k heals work just fine healing a real tank in PoFire at the 1st castle.  <br />
<br />
     Really doubtful. So you're in elemental plane (with gear) but you can't heal on them ? Ah and you can malo/slow and heal on 700 hit critter mitigating partially ? Q do nothing on them ,but well you're probably one of those which can chain tnarg indefinitely.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

- This is why shaman DoTs are never going to get fixed. How would you like if mages never used their pets because aggro? How about wizards never use their single nukes instead using inefficient AE spells because of aggro issues?  Or how about enchanters never using mez because of retarded aggro issues?<br />
<br />
DoTs are a KEY component to shaman class and their current status is beyond broken. But it's ok because you can use spells that get resisted easy or some very inefficient nuke? Hey that wizard can use AE nukes to do damage, make him stop using single target nukes! That ranger shouldn't use the bow and do supberb DPS, have him nuke instead!<br />
<br />
Juventus sez: Stat buffs: Stamina is nice, the rest are a joke.<br />
- To many elemental+ shamans stamina is a joke already. Melee are capped, hell even lot of casters are capped, and rest starting to realize that they get almost no HP gain from of STA because they are close to cap. My twink SK is 30 points from cap, I estimate that 2-3 month into LDoN a lot of people will be capped, making the entire shaman stat buff line a horrid joke with some very limited use for CHA (DI).<br />
<br />
Ice cream sez: You pessimistic peeps really show your asses from time to time. Juventus just basically spelled out how every aspect of the shaman class sucks. Then quit. Seriously.<br />
- Truth hurts? You can't accept that other people have different opinions than you? You sure rebutted every point he made ... wait a minute, you didn't. Not to mention his points are dead on. When you are XPing or raiding in elemental planes maybe you will realize that some points pointed out are quite valid. On the same note, head over to warrior boards and tell them to quit also. Every warrior with half a brain knows his class is in ruins. You will like the pessimism there and you will be able to tell them to quit too!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">What the hell is unbalancing about a class that is in constant demand for xp groups in every zone and is the most powerful soloer in the game (not the best, the most powerful).<br />
<br />
Don't you realize what balance is? It means that OVERALL your class is approximately the same desirability as other classes. That means across the 3 situations: solo, group, raid. That means across the attributes: buffing, DPS, utility, CC, healing, tanking. That means across levels, 1-65. That means across EVERYTHING. You consider every detail, the aa skills, the dots, the slows, heals, ....<br />
<br />
Where does a shaman fit in respect to other classes? (subjective arguments follow)<br />
<br />
1) Soloing<br />
<br />
Shaman is the most powerful soloer. Can solo summoning mobs no one else can (like VT mobs). Also is above average at xp/hour soloing and can solo indoor or outdoor as easily.<br />
<br />
2) Raids<br />
<br />
Shamans are VERY important on all raids (even unslowable mobs for buffs/quiescence). But stackability is low. Yet overall they fare slightly below average, since the following classes have low overall stackability: enc, bard, monk, war, pal, sk, nec.<br />
<br />
3) XP groups<br />
<br />
Shamans don't compete directly with tanks (they are a support class). They dont directly compete with any int caster (they are healers). They compete with support classes, and to a lesser extent healers (clr/dru/shm). There are 4 classes that can fill nearly every support role in a group: Druid, Shaman, Bard, Beastlord. Those 4 can do MOST of the following (not ALL): hp buff, haste, slow, heal, DPS, CC, reduce downtime, utility. Most of these are required to support a tank properly. Utility can be debuffs, sow/selo, ports/evacs, stat buffs, cures, resist buffs, etc.<br />
<br />
How does shaman stack up?<br />
Healing: 3 (1=cleric, 2=druid, 3=shaman, 4=bst)<br />
Hp buff: 2 (1=cleric, 2=shaman, 3=druid, 4=bst)<br />
Haste: 3 (1=bard, 2=chanter, 3=shaman, 4=bst)<br />
Slow: 1 (1=shaman, 2=chanter, 3=beastlord, 4=bard)<br />
Reduce downtime: 4 (1=enc: kei, 2=bard: cracksong, 3=bst: paragon/SD, 4=druid: po9, 5=shaman: canni reduces self downtime only, so its indirect)<br />
utility: 3 (1/2=druid or bard, 3=shaman, 4=enc, 5=bst)<br />
DPS: 4 (1=bst, 2/3=druid or bard depend if melee heavy group, 4=shaman)<br />
* chanter depends if CoD being used<br />
CC: 3 (1=chanter, 2=bard, 3=shaman, 4=druid)<br />
* note shaman better than druid since both root but shaman can slow add.<br />
<br />
SHM is 3/2/3/1/5/3/4/3 (special ability: cannibalize)<br />
DRU is 2/3/*/*/3/1/2/4 (special ability: port)<br />
BRD is */*/1/4/2/1/2/2 (special ability: pulls very well)<br />
BST is 4/4/4/3/3/5/1/* (special ability: paragon)<br />
ENC is */*/2/2/1/4/1or5/1 (special ability: CoD)<br />
<br />
* = cannot do the ability at all<br />
<br />
Looks balanced to me. Notice shaman can literally do everything (to some extent), bst can do all but 1 role, and dru/brd/enc cant do 2 roles. And notice that 2 of them (brd/enc) have no heals or hp buffs. And people say druids highly compete for groups but they have no haste or slow.<br />
<br />
This is all subjective but I wanted to point out the areas of balance, the wants/needs of groups, and how shamans stack up to their competitors. Obviously some abilities are more in demand than others, such as DPS, healing, hasting and slowing. And it changes per expansion (since Pop, CC and stat buffs are not as important)</div></div><hr />

Warriors are the unbalanced class.  Maybe monks.  Rogues whining, however, is a joke.  <br />
<br />
That said, nothing wrong with Zorlac's suggestion that we get a 3500 heal and a better nuke.  It wouldn't unbalanced anything, and Kragg is just stupid as a spell.  Hell, 2800 would be ok. <br />
<br />
I don't really mind poison aggro.  It's a useful tool at times, and folks SHOULD have to worry about their own aggro.  One problem with the game now is that too many folks don't have to worry about aggro.  Just mindlessly click away and let others do their thing to keep lock aggro.</div></div><hr />

I play a 58 warrior and I'd much rather have a shaman 90% of the time then an enchie for 3 reasons.  First, resist debuffs.  I was in a PoD cy group yesterday and the enchie had a heck of a time getting slows to land - and mobs tend to get PO'd at someone chain casting slow on em.  Yes, the enchie can tash, but that's massive agro, which leads to my second reason.  If the shaman gets agro and my first taunt doesn't get it back, no problem....the shaman can tank for 10 seconds while I get agro back.  If an enchie gets agro and my first taunt doesn't work, no problem, the cleric can rez them after the fight is over :p .  The third reason is mana regen.  A good shaman almost never runs out of mana, and if they do, they get it back much faster than any other class.<br />
<br />
When I play my warrior the first thing I want is a CH in the group (prefer cleric or druid.)  The second thing I want is a shaman with enchie being a reasonably close second.  Once those 2 slots are filled, then we can talk about dps classes like mages, wizzies, beastlords, etc.<br />

<br />
I was duoing in Halls of Honor with a DC druid (we're both level 63), who had charmed some little critter.  Now, all joking aside, druids actually provide quite a bit of DPS when you factor in a DC pet, along with druid DoTs and nukes.  I'm guessing he's pushing 120 DPS with his DC pet, and he's a rather un-uber druid, except for DC.  120 DPS is respectable.  The dude chain-nukes like it's going out of style.<br />
<br />
So I'm back medding at camp, and he says &quot;INC&quot;.. then he says &quot;2&quot;.  Alright, 2 wimpy-ass casters vs. 2 mobs that hit for 500+.  *cracks his knuckles*<br />
<br />
I Malo both on incoming, and he's already sic'd his DC pet on one of them.  Then I slow both mobs, getting the 2nd one's attention... and I sic dogdog on him.  He snared both of them.<br />
<br />
At this point my mob is still nearly full health and his mob is already down 5% due to his DC pet ripping the 1st mob a new ******* from behind.  Dogdog is a loyal companion, but does not perform like a DC pet.<br />
<br />
So we kited around these 2 mobs, each doing our best to kill our respective mobs quickly.<br />
<br />
I didn't have epic at the time, so my arsenal consisted of just Bane of Nife and Envenomed Bolt, and dogdog.  The druid was Doting, nuking, and had the DC pet.  I was thinking the druid was clearly going to finish off his mob first.<br />
<br />
So 10 mins go by, and we're stilling kiting these mobs around lol...  finally I see a &quot;You gain party experience!&quot; message -- the druid has finished his off.  I look at my mob's health --- 4%.  Remember the druid got a 5% start.<br />
<br />
So I was hanging with a DC druid DPS-wise with just 2 DoTs and dogdog.  Now I realize this is a different circumstance... under normal xp-group situations I can't go all-out on slow and DoTs without getting a ton of unwanted attention.  It's not often a shaman kites mobs, or at least for me it's not often.<br />
<br />
The druid was impressed how much damage I was able to inflict, I don't think he regarded shamans as being able to dish it out, as do most people.<br />

Don't want to hijack =P but HoH DC pets (least the Chanter Necro, so I'm assuming Druid are the same) are around 150dps hasted. So your druid friend would be doing a lot more than 120dps with the pet + dots and nukes. Which works out great for you =P Grats on showing him whose boss =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to play in your world.  Wizard, Druid, bards are all vastly superior soloers, necromancers are still quite capable.  Besides, who in their right mind is going to solo for exp in VT?  Hardly even worth the effort.  Mind you, we're still decent soloers when we need to, but nowhere near what you seem to think we are.<br />
<br />
2) Raids<br />
<br />

<br />
Can get away with 2 shaman at a raid, although 3 is better.  Could do ok with more, depending on how well your shaman get along with each other.  Still quite important though, they won't stop a raid cause theres no shaman.<br />
<br />
3) XP groups<br />

Paladin heals better than shaman, for sure, and I don't see them in your list. HP buff is probably right, since it stacks with everything but the shielding line. <br />

The ICH was the biggest slap in the face our class has recieved since they wouldn't listen to us that alchemy was broken.  The problem with both the nuke and heal situation is that in theory they guage we do as much if not more healing and nuking as the druid due to our mana regen and make our spells less effective, even gimpy.  the problem is the spells have long casting times and low damage meaning in fixed fights we do way less.  If the casting times on our nukes were cut by 25%, I think that would be adequate rebalancing and the ICH were cut in favour of a AA/focus affected slow cast 2k heal.<br />

Since when?  DoTs have only been good for soloing.  They still are good for soloing.  Even before the first dot nerf, pre Kunark, when you could just dot up a critter and run it around for 10 or 15 minutes they still only good for soloing.  Dots have never worked well in exp situation.<br />

<br />
Yes, I'd like melee re-examined, I think we've fallen away from the original class design by the end-game.  I also feel that heals probably need a slight boost at the end ... maybe a 3000-hp range heal at 64 or 65.  10 seconds is a bit too long for 1950, and the 1300 is too pricey for the effect.  I also think having our best slow be at 51 is kind of silly.  We should have a new slow spell in the 60s somewhere that's faster-casting, or cheaper, or has a better resist check, or a secondary effect, or something.  As our defining line, it's kind of silly to stop it at 51.<br />
<br />
That said, I can without a doubt work with the tools I have now.  These are annoyances.  I know that the groups I'm called to are either surviving because I'm there, or doing much better because of it.<br />
<br />
We don't have the best buffs?  Since when is this news?  We've NEVER had the best buffs.  Clerics have always had better defensive buffs.  Enchanters have always had better offensive buffs.  Why?  Because most stats are only marginally meaningful.  This isn't news, we've been saying this for years.<br />
<br />
When I'm the 5th shaman on a raid, what do I do?  Sometimes I volunteer to be the healer for that wacky 4-warrior and a ranger group that always ends up as group 11.  Or, I nuke like mad and have an easy raid until the excrement makes contact with the ventilation improvement engine and we have a 6-pull that's all of a sudden not too scary because we have a ton of shamans all doing their thing.  And I enjoy the relaxing ones because tomorrow I might be the only shaman around working my butt off, but enjoying that too.<br />
<br />
Don't like to Cannibalize?  Well, ok.  Go sit with the monks who don't like to feign, the rogues who don't like to evade, the warriors who don't like to taunt, and the necros who don't like to Lich.  It's a tool of the class.  Nobody says you have to use it, but if you don't, that's nobody else's fault.<br />

Actually, the agro is not the reason that I don't use dots in exp groups.  Monks with GSoFWs allow me to lay on a dot or two, to say nothing of actual taunting classes.<br />
<br />
I don't use dots because they're a waste of mana.  Tactics, BoT, HoH, wherever we're hunting, the mobs don't usually last long enough for it to be more efficient to use dots over nukes.<br />

1) Beef #1. I went 1 year at 60 without torpor or malo because on Quellious it was not for sale - period (I looked EVERY day for 1 year!) and I was not in a raiding guild at the time.  Sony fixed it finally - 3 year delay - grrrr.<br />
<br />
2) Beef #2. Dots.  Actually I have come around on the dot issue because I always thought that dots were supposed to be our primary method of creating DPS.  I thought the duration and agro was a joke,  but, now I realize they are for soloing - period.  And that's ok.  But, lol of course as soon as I am at &quot;peace&quot; with dots Sony gives us bane instead of an upgraded nuke.  Now I'm hopeful that Bane is a nice spell, but I would have preferred a spell that could be upgraded by our direct damage aa and not created additional agro issues.<br />
<br />
3) Beef #3. Stuff that doesn't get affected by our aa's.  I have not used our 1950hp 10 sec heal ever!  I can't imagine any shaman using it -stupid stupid stupid. But, in Sony's defense if they didn't give us the spell when they gave the druids their one this message board would have gone ballistic.  True? oh yes.<br />
<br />
4) Beef #4.  Limited or NO means of creating DPS in certain situations.  On resistent mobs in either a experience group or raid where there is sufficient healing we are dead weight.  Now, I don't want to beat this dead horse, but it does happen and the higher level you are and the harder camps/raids you are on the more hopeless the situation is.  I have founds that all our poison nukes are resisted in these situations and maybe, maybe our cold nukes might land every once in a while.<br />
<br />
Now, the $100 question has always been how can you jack up shaman melee damage so that it is not unbalancing.  Well, first off I suggest that this problem is a level 65 problem so make any fixes only relate to that level.  A easy solution I would think is to introduce a new aa which can be trained at 65 which would give us perma rabid bear (without that stupid bear form).  I would then change the recast reducer aa into a dps enhancer.  Just keep the melee damage below what a shaman can generate with his spells under a normal resistent mob and we are good to go.<br />
<br />
So in summary, impliment #4 and add in raid shrink and I have solved most of our issues and not created a &quot;superclass&quot; that can do it all.  Giving us a way to contribute in those oddball situations is not overpowering - and I can hear it now folks would complain that it would make us better soloers.  Well, as I have mentioned above, soloing is boring, boring, boring.....not very safe, not better experience any more and not particularly lucrative (a nice drop in a group is better than the hundreds of pp items you get in solo play).  In short way overrated and LDON has NO solo content as we all know - thank goodness.<br />
<br />
NOW is the time to jack up shaman melee ability - since soling has been nerfed all the heck (which in case you have not figured out I'm happy about since this is supposed to be a social game).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Well shamans ARE unbalanced I think, because they are such a complex class.  I think that Turgur's was much more powerful than the designers foresaw when they put it in the game.  Because shamans are so multidimensional it is extremely difficult to change one thing without affecting their balance in other areas.<br />
<br />
Having had some time in the elemental planes now, I can see where some of our deficiencies lie.  Here are a few observations:<br />
<br />
1.  Healing abilities are ok for normal situations, if things go bad, however, we can't keep up.  We really only have 2 viable heal spells: Tnarg's and Quiessence, which must have AA and equipment enhancements to be effective.<br />
<br />
2.  DoT's are at best situational, most useful on boss mobs with many hitpoints.  Our DPS is lackluster in short fights because DoTs are extremely inefficient if they don't do their full damage.<br />
<br />
3.  Slow mitigation clearly has hurt our role, but can still be effective.<br />
<br />
4.  Our CC role in elemental planes is lackluster.<br />
<br />
5.  We cannot solo efficiently in the elemental planes, although we can solo by root/rotting in some instances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">This thread stinks of beastlords trying to prove their worth.<br />
<br />
Reality:  When group members look for a slower for a group it goes<br />
1.  Shaman<br />
2.  Enchanter<br />
3.  Beastlord<br />
<br />
Why?  Because ppl are greedy and want what betters them best.<br />
If any slower leaves the group without finding a replacement.  The melees speak up wanting a shaman for the best buffs and to help take the least damage.  Human nature to want to better oneself.  If an enchanter is already in the group cleric will ask for the best slower because it will easy his job.  Again bettering oneself with less responsibility.<br />
<br />
Beastlord does not challenge our position as a slower in the group in any form or fashion.  As stated if the beastlord is the slower in a chain pulling group you can forget the beastlord doing anything else but trying to get the mana back spent on slow.<br />
<br />
A.  Beastlord DPS is over rated and can be closely achieved with dual weilding pet (*grin*), &quot;lots o'canni&quot;, SCMIII, and back to back rains of Tears of Torent and Saryn.<br />
<br />
B.  And lets not forget on raids how much Beastlord or any melee or pets get chewed up by AEs in the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
C.  Monks, just about any pure melee, necros and mages look to duo with the Shaman class.  I hardly ever hear them wanting to duo with a beastlords.<br />
<br />
We are wanted big time and we balanced.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Zoria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">On the chanter vs shaman argument.<br />
Im a former chanter (180ish aa), currently a shaman (90something aa).<br />
<br />
A chanter dancing through a group keeping 4+ adds under control is a wonderful feeling, not really possible to properly describe it until you have tried it. However the state of most high end players these days (newbs/ebays) makes it impractical to play a good chanter either because people are too afraid to fight more than one mob at a time or because they break mez too much to make it a viable option. Did i mention PoP mobs tear through my cloth armored hide like a level 5 paladin?<br />
<br />
Im really enjoying being a shaman, i can tank, heal, dot (no, chanters cant dot), nuke, and i got insane mana regen. Grab a tank of any kind and you got a group ready to kill. But i miss some parts of being a chanter, charm was not something i did a lot of but when i did it (very situational) it was fun and worked to great effect. And i miss the lull line every day.<br />
<br />
Both classes can be great to play, or they can both royally suck. But as a shaman expin in pop for the most part, i generally prefer to get an extra tank to deal with adds (since most chanters suck too, at least compared to some of the stuff i used to pull off). And KEI can be bought for 50pp off your local chanter anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">I tend to look at balance as the value a class adds to a raid or an experience group.  I think we bring alot to experience groups but not in terms of direct dps.  IMHO we function best as Debuff, CC, patch healers and buffers.  At raids however, outside of buffs, I think we offer very little.  Very many bosses and even named these days are either unslowable or mitigated.  Dots are good if you can get em to land and the boss has sufficent duration.  But take for example the Ryda'Dar encounter in HoH or Behemoth.  If either of those mobs is left standing for more than a minute or two, raid is wiped.  How are dots gonna contribute useful dps in these encounters?  <br />
<br />
I would love to see the same dot dps with a shortened dot duration.  I would love to see a combo version of malos/tugurs that produced an essentially unresistable slow for 80%.  I would love to see a short casting spell that reduced slow mitigation.  A stat less attack buff of 150 or more would be good.  But that's me, I'm greedy when it comes to power.  Seriously, I really would like to feel more useful on raids in particular.  Right now, I feel like buff boy, whose main value is in the max out those greedy melee with thier stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">I saw a post somewhere else on weird groups and someone was referring to one with 5 mages and a shaman.  &quot;It was really cool,&quot; they said, &quot;but it was the shaman who made it work, and we all knew it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I play a 65 shaman and a 63 Mage..  Man you give me a competent shaman and 4 other mages, we will rule the world!  If some of you shaman have not signed up to be in a pet group yet, do it.  The XP flows like the water over the falls at Niagara.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Well, people say that slow mitigation hurts the shaman class, I don't really think it has.<br />
<br />
Even when mobs mitigate, people want them slowed, and would rather have them slowed by a shaman than an enchanter or beastlord, part of the min/max thing.<br />
<br />
Yes, an enchanter adds mind buffs, haste and crowd control. When they can use charm/dire charm, they can add DPS. But an enchanter gets more agro with tash than we do with malos, and is more fragile. How many enchanters do you know who have HP as their prime stat?<br />
<br />
Yes, a beastlord adds stacking buffs, and DPS. But their slow is significantly worse than a shamans, and their buffs aren't as good. Plus beastlords aren't yet common enough to be an option much of the time.<br />
<br />
A shaman adds buffs, some DPS with pet, debuffs and backup healing (sometimes main healing) all with the best slow.<br />
<br />
Of course, they all stack pretty well - I love having both enchanter and beastlord in my group.<br />
<br />
When I'm leaving an exp group, and ask who they want to replace me, most often I hear, &quot;Look for another shaman&quot;. Sometimes they'll say &quot;Enchanter or shaman&quot;. Very rarely has a group suggested beastlord - once when they'd already established there were no shamans or enchanters lfg, and once when one of the group members had a BL friend who was available.<br />
<br />
Lets face it, groups love us. With PoP, people have come to realise how powerful slow is. Even in the face of slow mitigation, a group will want a slower. It's almost mandatory. This is why there are so many twink/bot shamans around, along with twink/bot clerics - when groups often fold because of a lack of a class, some people will create that class to 2-box with.<br />
<br />
I *do* think we're balanced too much towards slow for most people's liking - it's the main thing we're invited to groups for, it's the main thing people know about shamans. I realise that most shamans don't like to be so one-dimensional.<br />
<br />
With slow mitigation on many mobs, I don't think it would hurt for us to have slightly better damage output, nothing to make us challenge a &quot;dps&quot; class, nothing so powerful that we'd be invited to groups because of it, but something to help us feel we're contributing something more to each fight than just the slow.<br />
<br />
So yes, I'd like slightly better damage nukes (I'm thinking something like 1100ish damage cold, 850ish poison, with slightly better efficiency than our current nukes, to put us in line with other support classes). And yes, I'd like slightly better melee, we are the &quot;battle priest&quot; with the best melee skill caps (I know many shamans are irritated that clerics can melee better than shamans).<br />
<br />
I would like these things, but I will carry on playing without them, and I still don't think we're broken.</div></div><hr />

- People are stupid. Actually I tend to beleive 90% of the people playing EQ have no clue about basic game mechanics nor elementary mathematics.<br />
<br />
Cleric CH with shaman slowing: 3700ish average heal.<br />
Cleric CH with enchanter slowing: 4200ish average heal (longer cast time slow).<br />
Cleric CH with beastlord slowing: 4500ish average heal.<br />
Mana used in all cases: 400ish<br />
Time used to cast spell: 10 seconds.<br />
Time needed to regain that mana: same for all 3 cases.<br />
<br />
Is it so hard to understand? Mitigation nearly blurs the difference between slows from different classes, add CH to the mix and it's irrelevant who is slowing. Before you ask, no I don't have fancy graphics to prove my point nor do I have fancy spreadsheets with numbers on them. I see regulary beastlords solo with a 2boxed cleric in EarthA. I see regulary warriors solo with a 2boxed cleric in Fire. <br />
<br />
Is it still the best slow? Hell no. <br />
<br />
How many enchanters do you know who have HP as their prime stat?<br />
- Every single one in my guild. Not to mention you forgot a &quot;slight&quot; 2K runes they can stack.<br />
<br />
Yes, a beastlord adds stacking buffs, and DPS. But their slow is significantly worse than a shamans, and their buffs aren't as good. <br />
- Paragon of Spirit is not as good? Spiritual Dominion? Shaman talisman line? Oh no, you'll be missing 100ish HP! 100HP means jack in XP groups. Not to mention you'll be missing out on the uber AGI and DEX buffs! <br />
<br />
Plus beastlords aren't yet common enough to be an option much of the time.<br />
- The only thing keeping shamans and other people from realizing the real potential of a beastlord.<br />

<br />
Excellent buffs, Slow, Haste, Nice DoTs, DD's, Heals, Cures, Utility out the arse.<br />
<br />
Shaman can tank a slowed mob very well in a pinch, Solo well, group well, Reduce a mob to 1/4 power and all the while cranking out some pretty nice DPS.<br />
<br />
Try playing a monk, rogue or warrior and then come back and tell me Shamans need an upgrade. If anyone needs an upgrade it is the 3 pure melee classes. Hell, my 65 Monk cannot solo for experience like most casters can, The DPS being put out by a 65 Monk is not that much better than alot of casters are doing and even less in alot of situations.<br />
Now, why should a Shaman be able to out DPS a monk, or even come close to it?<br />
<br />
They shouldn't, but they Do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Balance to me would mean that ANY class could bring value to a group.  That means that in some cases we most certainly COULD be replaced by another class, be it chanter, beast, whatever.<br />
<br />
The goal is that no one class will stand out as more powerful than any other.  That any class can fill an open slot in a reasonably role balanced group and the group still be effective.<br />
<br />
Does the poison dots agro a lot?  Yeah they really do.  Ask yourself though, if they reduce the agro on our dots, couldn't we become a very NICE DPS class?  I know that by stacking my dots I can achieve &gt;100DPS not including my melee or pet.  That's nothing to sniff at - however, I CAN'T stack my dots that much because I will steal agro from the tank.<br />
<br />
If a shaman could do 100DPS, be main healer, be main slower, have pets, the best buffs... THEN we would be un-balanced.<br />
<br />
Frankly, we're balanced just fine.  Checks and balances seem to be working good - you want DPS? you get agro.  You want the best buffs? you get shorter durations.  You want dots AND nukes?  ok - but you won't have the best in the game.  You want the best slow in the game?  you get higher resists and agro.  For every positive, there's a countering negative.<br />
<br />
That is the definition of balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Reading through these points it seems to me as though Shaman are balanced just that we've all got things that we'd like to improve about our class.<br />
As for Beastlords.The wife has a 63 Beast and from watching her i personally dont think they're overpowered.<br />
As far as i know she has never been invited into a group as the slower.She does slow in groups the odd occassion there is no chanter or Shaman available but the 25% difference in the slow is so noticeable that compared to Shaman slow it hardly looks like the mobs been slowed.<br />
Is there anyone out there who would honestly have a BL in the group instead of a Shaman when there is a Shaman available.<br />
Beastlords buffs are like Shaman DOTs only good for soloing (SR exc).<br />
Only difference with BL's is you can have 2 in a group :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Hmm, <br />
  Read the thread and figured I would add my 2 cents.  From my perspective, Shaman are doing pretty well.  I have a few issues with some of the spells, but basically, I think we are fairly well off.<br />
<br />
If I could change anything, it would be buff duration, and perhaps some of the buff effects.  We are supposed to be primarily buffers/debuffers and we do have the best slow in the game, however, our slow does not exceed a chanters slow by as much as their haste exceeds our ability to haste...always thought that should of been about the same.<br />
<br />
My chief beef has to be buff duration.  Its silly that our top end buffs last not only less time than some of the buffs we get at lower levels, but they are just incredibly way short of the duration of buffs that other classes get.<br />
<br />
My favorite example of this one is KEI.  How did chanters rate that one?  Clarity 2 didnt last that long...it had a duratoin of 35 minutes, Enlightenment (wis/int buff) lasted an hour, and gift of insight/enlightenment lasted a bit more than an hour.  Suddenly at 60 they get a single spell that does more than the combination of those spells and slap a duration on it of 2 and a half hours...with very little increase in mana cost<br />
<br />
Clerics get Aego...lasts 2 and a half hours, costs less mana to cast than <br />
the three spells it replaces, and each of those spells only had about an hours duration...<br />
<br />
Druids got protection of the glades or whatever, and it lasts an hour and 40 minutes and buffs ac, hp and mana regen.......<br />
<br />
We get Focus, it lasts an hour and 40...buffs less hp than the druids and aside from adding some fairly meaningless stats doesnt do anything else.<br />
<br />
Whats funny, is the shammies constantly lost ground as they leveled up.  The never buffed hp/ac as well as a cleric, but always better than a druid...but the margin slowly changed till at the end they were buffing worse than both cleric and druid.  Meanwhile, cleric durations went thru the roof in comparison.<br />
<br />
Its even worse with our resist buffs...why does our 62 last less time than our 58 one...(only one with a decent duration)...a druids higher level buff lasts exactly the same amount of time as his lower level one...(both the same duration as our 58 one).<br />
<br />
The only other real worthwhile buffs we have are stamina, which slowly becomes meaningless as players approach the cap, and the Avatar line.<br />
<br />
The Avatar line would of been fine if they hadnt put it on all those weapons, but frankly its ridiculous as it stands now.  No shammy in his right mind is gonna cast a 6 minute duration buff that uses an emerald.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I would like one simple change, and would be happy for shammy.<br />
<br />
Change Focus...make it buff HP and ATK...in other words an Avatar/Focus combo...then I figure it would justify the 1 hour and 40 min duration.  Hell for that, they could even put a component on it...<br />

Indeed Zorlac.  It is funny to see the myth that our slows are significantly superior to that of beastlord and enchanter.  When it all comes down to it people just use shaman still because &quot;it has a higher number&quot;... but when you look at the real comparison numbers the difference is marginal even without mitigation.<br />
<br />
Beastlords could slow as well as Chanters and it wouldnt cause one noticable difference in most situations.  They just don't because of other reasons.  But does that mean you can use this pathetic argument? no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">why are you always trying to achieve balance vs other classes ?<br />
Everquest is a PvE game for the most part (except for 3 or 4 servers), for this aspect of the game the shaman class is balanced in my opinion.<br />
<br />
If you want to play a game thats balanced for pvp play daoc, the lines between classes in daoc are extremley blurry to achieve PvP balance.  This can not be the goal in a RPG game.<br />
<br />
PvE balance does not mean that all classes are of equal power, it means you combine a set of characters and their skills to be able to acomplish something with a decent amount of challenge (not like the game is much of a challenge these days outside of raids).<br />
<br />
What you are calling balance i interpret as a cry for more versatility in your skillsets, however, giving new skills to any class at this point would take away from the uniquness of other classes.  <br />
<br />
Shaman are a very powerfull class in everquest, our solo ability is diminished in PoP, but our overall desireability has increased with pop.<br />
<br />
Slow mitigation in my opinion is a savior for the class, since most of these mobs would just be immune if they would not have *invented* slow mitigation.  And that would mean that a shaman is just about the least desireable class out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.: a class that can duo in the plane of fire is hardly underpowered.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Honestly, I've never really had that much of a problem with the way the shaman class is balanced vs the other classes with the exception of beasties.  Beasties seem to have become essentially a battleshaman with a better pet considering the fact that they get such a good slow and very nice buffs.<br />
<br />
That being said, I really do enjoy the fact that with Canni V KEI is really a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; situation.  Its a must for pretty much every pure caster class but us since we can just make our own mana and cheaply heal up.<br />
<br />
The only real complaint I have about the class (other than alchemy of course) is the fact that if you have more than 2 or 3 shaman on a raid, it gets very boring very fast.  Basically, we buff, then we set up a channel to talk about who's gonna malo, who's gonna slow and who's gonna cripple.  DoTs are no good since they're always resisted by high end mobs, our dd spells suck and our heals aren't good enough to be in any sort of heal rotation.  It looks like some of our new LDoN spells will mitigate this issue, but being outnuked by a stinkin' tree hugger is really depressing.<br />

<br />
Slows, of course, got no upgrade (except for beastlord and bard), and mitigating mobs make the difference in damage prevented by slow infintesimal between shaman/ench/bard.  Fine, slows get no upgrade because they are &quot;overpowered already&quot;.  What about cani and torpor, two core shaman abilities?  How many other classes got absolutely no improvement in important class defining spells? (hint: I can count the number using the fingers on zero hands)<br />
<br />
Passive mana regen of all kinds (including lich) got significantly upgraded.  Cani got nothing.  The PoP shaman spells are at even more of a mana penalty relative to other classes' comparables.<br />

<br />
Why?  ft15+focus-effects casters can go full burn for 5-10 minutes, while a shaman can cani 50% of the time and spend the rest of it casting, mana-intensive, low damage spells?<br />

Fixes:<br />
<br />
upgraded cani or self-only lich or manaregen buff<br />
<br />
400 hp/tick quiescence<br />

slow mitigation changed to preserve the same DPS-differential between slowing classes e.g. partially = 25% shaman, 20% ench, 15% bl (same 5% difference)<br />
<br />
as for dps, velium strike is too slow casting for the damage, and spear of torment is way too inefficient.  dots are ok (if you want to be the tank), but in general nuke aa should apply to dots as well (for all classes)<br />
<br />
longer duration buffs<br />
<br />

alternatively, you could argue for some sort of half-melee make-rabid-bear-viable approach (maybe a procing weapon like the clerics), but that seems silly given that beastlords play half-melee half-shaman already.</div></div><hr />

First enchanter slow is worse than the shaman slow, many people are saying the difference is trivial but the fact is shaman slow is superior and they will be sought out for that.  <br />
<br />
Second is KEI ... you can buy a KEI that lasts 4+ hours easily enough, you do not need an enchanter in your group for that and unfortunately many people do not bother with one just for this reason.  There are more enchanter BoT's in my guild then there are enchanters for this very reason.  Then you take into account shaman mana regen + KEI and your mana output lays waste to ours.. Now granted your spells do cost more but I duo a shaman/enchanter and I know who has mana issues and who does not between the two.  Barring possibly CoD, a shaman can sustainably output much more DPS than an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Third, although enchanter haste is better than shaman haste I find the reference to superior stats associated with the haste to be laughable ... shaman haste + ferine + focus more than makes up for any &quot;extra&quot; buffing associated with the enchanter haste.  The haste cap is the haste cap and whether an enchanter 68% haste + 40% haste item gets the melee to the cap or shaman 60% haste + 40% haste item gets the melee to the cap is immaterial.  <br />
<br />
Hell if you consider a 5% difference in slow trivial I cannot imagine how you consider an 8% difference in speed when most melee will hit the cap without it very signifigant.<br />

<br />
Our Rune lines are nothing compared to a shamans ability to mitigate damage when they get aggro with heal spells, superior armor, superior HP and superior defensive skills.  Arcane Rune = 1 Quienscence and is a heck of alot more expensive for us to cast.<br />
<br />
In POP with huge zones and low aggro range it is trivial to pull singles and unless you are completely untalented you never get more than 2 with 3+ pulls usually wiping you out.<br />
<br />
Shaman, similar to enchanters, get the best Crowd Control tool available for these circumstances ... a -30 MR root.  Mezz is great in close quarters or with lots of mobs but almost all POP zones have wide spaces and lots of mobs kill you dead.<br />
<br />
So ....<br />
<br />
- Shaman have a better Slow, not by much but better.<br />
- Shaman have an equivalent haste and FAR superior stat buffs since the haste cap is the haste cap unless you are a bard!<br />
- Shaman have a much better ability to sustain aggro.  Enchanters can do it for a short time but Arcane Rune is Brutal on mana and we do not have Canni V to replace our mana with.<br />
- Shaman can Heal, Enchanters cannot<br />
<br />
That leaves DPS ... ah COD.  Once upon a time it made us Gods but that has been nerfed down alot.  Outside CoD our DPS sucks compared to a shaman and our mana regen cannot sustain it ... unlike a shaman.<br />
<br />
Many groups do not want a CoD pet to &quot;steal&quot; xp from them, they are much more difficult to control now and while an enchanter focuses on controlling a CoD pet his ability to do other things drops dramatically.  Both mana wise (CoD is expensive) and attention wise (CC is limited).<br />
<br />
So yes, enchanters &quot;can&quot; do more DPS in the right situation with the right support team (a second slower/healer in the group dramatically increases our ability to do this).<br />
<br />
But it has not been my experience in POP that enchanters are more desirable in a group that a shaman.  The ONLY thing we can do that even puts us in the same ballpark as a shaman in POP is charm and the nerfs to charm have brought us back down into balance.  We need an alternate healer/slower in a group to charm easily and guess what class meets that requirement? <br />
<br />
I am hoping with LDoN that I will actually start enjoying playing my enchanter more than my shaman again but there are conflicting reports on how much is charmable in LDoN and people report pulling controllably without too many issues so we will see.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">why are you always trying to achieve balance vs other classes ?<br />
Everquest is a PvE game for the most part (except for 3 or 4 servers), for this aspect of the game the shaman class is balanced in my opinion.<br />
<br />
If you want to play a game thats balanced for pvp play daoc, the lines between classes in daoc are extremley blurry to achieve PvP balance.  This can not be the goal in a RPG game.<br />
<br />
PvE balance does not mean that all classes are of equal power, it means you combine a set of characters and their skills to be able to acomplish something with a decent amount of challenge (not like the game is much of a challenge these days outside of raids).<br />
<br />
What you are calling balance i interpret as a cry for more versatility in your skillsets, however, giving new skills to any class at this point would take away from the uniquness of other classes.  <br />
<br />
Shaman are a very powerfull class in everquest, our solo ability is diminished in PoP, but our overall desireability has increased with pop.<br />
<br />
Slow mitigation in my opinion is a savior for the class, since most of these mobs would just be immune if they would not have *invented* slow mitigation.  And that would mean that a shaman is just about the least desireable class out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.: a class that can duo in the plane of fire is hardly underpowered.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this is probably the best possible view for class balance.  I believe you have hit the nail on the head re: challenge in PvE versus the PvP game.<br />
<br />
Shaman fill a niche in EverQuest, and fill it quite well.  We do what we are supposed to do better than anyone else (hell, even the Prima Everquest books got that right).  <br />
<br />
We bring something relatively unique to the tables:  best slows, best all-around melee buffs (minus haste of course), and ... god what the hell am I talking about?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">oks I have ready many of these type of posts and heard the same comments over and over .... and alll i have to say is blah.<br />
<br />
most of the peeps that post to these topics are just the top end of the shaman class. I touch the advice and lvled to 65 once i got just one spell in it ( bought blood ), I grinded out AA like a fiend and got can5, I have gotten the best armor that i can realisticly get with how fast i can produce money to buy it or earn it on raids ( in a large guild you dont get many upgrades expesaley since we have been moveing on from content so fast not very many peeps get more then one upgrade ) .... and I can say uniqivcaly say that i do NOT see all this power that you say we get. you say get can5 and the world changes .... no its not. I still piss out WAY more mana then i take in even with VoQ up and running. can5 ONLY gives me back little more then 1 bub of mana for takeing nearly 50 percent of my health raid buffed. I am still CONSTENTLY can4ing. this is just playing slower, maybe a malo on ever 4th mob, and a tears of sayrn  on every mob. this is in most groups not even worrying about my health ( druid or clier is there to heal so thay heal me just like melees ) 10 to 1 if i am getting ponded by a unslowed mob that hits above 200 I will not get off a torpor ( yes i am 65 but have only SEEN 1 rune drop and only have a net iincome of about 100plat  a week pre-LDoN ). maybe this is becouse i am trying to get by with just fear/PoG + a few bazzar items ( I have gotten the best i can with the lvl of time commitment i can put in or have the stumice to put in at this point ) in a 2tier PoP/VT level guild.  If my mana pool was any larger I would see even less movement in my mana bar every 3 minetes and it would feel even worst. I have never been the 1st shaman on the raid, I have never even been the 2nd shaman. We can have 5 to 6 shaman on a normal raid up to a max of 8 ( all are none bootted ). with the rate my guild is goign I can very well see being in some of the lower level elemental planes in pretty much the same gear i have now. I can stand around for hours looking for a group just like the next monk. all you people that say you get group request just for sitting around all i can say is .... must be nice.<br />
<br />
I do not think that shamans are balanced for the sheer fact that the power curve for shamans IS so very steep. realy no other class has such a steep power curve.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">With LDoN we are in trouble.<br />
<br />
Prior to LDoN I was the typical gimp (missing torpor, no 65 spells but malos) 65 Shaman doing just fine in exp groups in PoP.  I raid once a month with my guild and really don't miss Fo7 or MGB.<br />
<br />
With the introduction of LDoN my EQ world has been turned upside down.<br />
<br />
It is now impossible to get a PoP Exp group.  I put LDoN and PoP in my LFG message but I have yet to be invited on a PoP group since LDoN came out.  At first this was not a problem since I was jazzed to spend all my time in LDoN.  I did get a bit bored of MMC but I was having a good time.  The problem is that now I can't even get a group in PoP if I want one.  I hope the novelty of LDoN wears off a bit and folks start grouping in PoP for exp again.<br />
<br />
After a few days the invites for LDoN started to slow down.  Folks started to realize what classes were the most valuable for LDoN and Shaman ain't one of them.  ( I know the Shaman Fanbois think we are the cure for cancer but. . .)  We are a great last spot class since we are a Swiss Army Knife, but more and more I am finding that folks are passing over Shaman for Beast Lords.  I am sure that other classes are experiencing similar problems.  I think that Clerics are in danger in the DPS is King environment of LDoN.  A Druid can heal and nuke.  Bards are darlings of the LDoN world since they can &quot;buff&quot; in a way, pull and add damage.  Monks can't sing.<br />
<br />
Prior to LDoN I would not have paid this thread a bit of attention, but now I have to admit that I am concerned.  The saving grace may be that we are not the only class that is in this position and others have it worse.  I think traps and chests may have been an attempt to make everyone useful but dungeons have come down to DPS and nothing more.<br />
<br />
I do have one bit of advice for Shaman and Clerics.  What ever you do; don't stand around the camps.  Folks will ask you to buff their groups.  Being my usual friendly self I did this without hesitation since I have Canni5 Right?  That was until I started to realize that these groups did not invite me to go with them!  If folks want our buffs they have to be willing to drag our butts through the dungeons with them.  Getting paid a KEI for a whole set of group buffs just ain't gonna get it.  I want APs!  If a Chanter, SK, Druid, Wizard and BL want my buffs they have to tell the Ranger who is OTW to get lost and pick me up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most often you don't see a group looking for a healer and slower.   It does happen though, I'll give ya that.   When a group already has a druid or cleric and is looking for a slower BST and chanter wins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">My 2 gp.<br />
<br />
I've played a bit of LDoN recently and I did alot of grouping in the Elemental planes over the summer.  I agree with Zorlac that there is a real disparity between what we have to offer versus other slowing classes, ENC and BST.  Similarly, we've lagged behind the utility and power that DRU and CLR offer to groups.<br />
<br />
My gut feeling is that the core of our balance problem is the fact that our mana regen abilities haven't improved since Luclin.  Cannibilize IV does almost nothing for me.  And Cannibilization gives me like 14% mana.  When playing in a group in a LDoN dungeon I constantly play at less than 20% mana.  I could be casting more stuff, but really even when optimizing and casting Can 4 all the time I need to be casting even more stuff to stay up to snuff with the other classes.<br />
<br />
Similarly because of the perception that our mana regeneration is so good, all of our new spells are more expensive then they should be, compounding the initial balance problems. <br />
<br />
By not upgrading our mana regeneration during PoP, LoY or LDoN, the developers are impliciting saying that our mana situation is OK.  <br />
<br />
I think they are wrong.<br />
<br />
Spell selection-wise, and ability-wise we are balanced.  But my sense is that we can't take advantage of our versatility because our mana abilities have fallen behind the curve.<br />
<br />
edit: small typo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">For someone who questioned the need for a chanter (actually a good bard is better, but so rare) in LDoN you have to think of it as primarily an efficiency modifier. killing is increased and healing mana decreased if there is always one (active) mob in the camp.  Even better when you can handle multi-pulls there's no need to even consider messing around with feign or pacify pulling. You can survive without it, but it makes the dungeons so much easier. Also lets you lock down casters, which slow can't do.<br />
<br />
Not to mention a cleric who gets their KEI dispelled puts a major crimp in efficiency.<br />
<br />
In reality LDoN normal mobs just don't hit that hard. As long as there's only one it's barely worth slowing given a mob life expectancy of 30 seconds. However when you have 3-5 mobs focusing on one character the risk factor goes up dramatically.</div></div><hr />

Spell costs have improved(less mana used) with the implementation of PoP Focus, and spell casting cost hasn't increased, so how can anyone say CanniIV doesn't do anything for them. CanniIV is still incredibly useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Hi friends,<br />
<br />
Well I always like to chime in on things.  Beastlords are absolutely amazing in LDON no doubt about it.  So is a high AA shaman.  I (shaman) group with beastys all the time - man that paragon is good stuff.  We stack beautifully and no group in their right should hesitate for 1 second about adding a shaman and a beastlord.  You know its not all about DPS unlike what some peeps say, its about a safe and enjoyable 1 hour as well.  Thats why I don't mind having a cleric in my group even though I am usually the only healer in most groups.  My 2c is THANK GOODNESS Sony made regular level LDON somewhat easy so you can mix and match things.<br />
<br />
Anyway, and I hope I dont get to be board fodder on cleric and enchanter boards but they are the ones who are in LFG trouble in regular LDON because they truly don't bring as much to the table as other classes because Virtue and Crack are soooooo important and can be bought.  I'll preface that since a good pulling enchanter certainly is pulling his/her weight - a sit back and mez one is not really necessary nor fun (IMHO).  Now, in hard settings both are a must have, so I think that things balance out.<br />
<br />
Oh, about shaman....our power curve is very late coming I think we are balanced in the end game even though I do wish that instead of Bane we got a direct damage spell that could be improved with our AA's. Oh and also out-of-group shrink, etc. same old same old, blah blah...<br />

I did all the slows, healed and buffed for the entire adventure.  Show me one other class that can do that, and I will accept that the Shaman class needs some work.<br />
<br />
Sure there are other classes than can slow like us, and there are certainly other classes than can heal better than us, but there are none that can do both as effectively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Spell costs have improved(less mana used) with the implementation of PoP Focus, and spell casting cost hasn't increased, so how can anyone say CanniIV doesn't do anything for them. CanniIV is still incredibly useful.<br />
<br />
Absolutely Can 4 is very useful.  <br />
<br />
It is the only thing keeping us remotely close to balanced.  <br />
<br />
What I probably had in mind, was the fact that Can IV doesn't even move my mana bar, and does nothing to my health bar.  We've got alot more HPs than we did at the beginning of Luclin. <br />
<br />
But the fact of the matter is that our mana requirements have gone up since Luclin.  The key in my opinion is spell casting haste.  The fact that we are casting spells faster means we're casting other useful spells in the meantime.  Similarly we have Tnarg's Mending now, something that did not exist during Luclin.  We just didn't cast Superior Healing all too much during Luclin.  It just wasn't too effective.  I cast Tnarg's alot more than I ever cast Superior Healing, especially considering the fact that it is a larger heal and a faster spell, especially with spell casting haste.  On the other hand, spell casting haste does mean we can cast more Can 4s, but really come on, 82 mana every 5.5 secs (really 6 secs with server delays and internet lag),  isn't all that much when you keep in mind that Necromancers are getting 50 mana per tick for 63 hps totally passively (though that doesn't stack with VoQ/KEI which would really make it 35-37 mana/tick).   82 mana isn't much when our spells are in the 400 to 500 mana range.  Spells which we are supposed to be casting on nearly every significant mob we encounter.<br />
<br />
I agree that spells have gotten better than the Luclin era, sure we have better healing ratios and better damage ratios, but the reality is that we're casting those spells alot more often, and similarly MOB mitigation and damage has compensated for any gain from better spells.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a Can V with on the order of 150 mana for 300 damage.  Keep the same ratio as Can IV, just make it a bigger spell.  It won't increase our theoretical maximum mana generation but it will help alot practically by reducing the constant clicking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Well there are 2 sides to this topic:<br />
<br />
At the plus side you have the well geared, high AA, level 65 shaman. This guy is normally a member of a raiding guild, is equipped in elemental or time stuff and groups with people from the same level. Pick up groups are rare thing for this guy.<br />
The equipment and AA skills allow this group to kill a normal level mission in almost any group composition (as example I myself did a slaughter mission in a group with 3 shamans, 2 rangers and a pally and we did it in 22 minutes).<br />
This person has little or no reason to fear for a group spot, after all he can be the tank, the healer, the puller or any other function that is needed in the groups. (if it was not for my TA I would not even bother slowing the mobs as they go down fast enough to not cause any major damage).<br />
So at the high end life is good, groups are plenty, xp is fast and the AP come in a steady flow.<br />
<br />
At the down side we have the non uber shaman, his equipment lacks hp, mana, FT and focus effects. He groups (if he gets a group) with people similar equipped and thus they have a hard time completing mission. For this person life is far from sweet, he has a constant pressure on his mana, his heals dont cut it to be single healer, his buffs are obsolete except for FoS and maybe Sta/Agi. For a group in this composition in general it would be a lot smarter to get a beastlord or a bard as slower.<br />
<br />
So yes the shaman class has issues, issues that can be solved with AAs and equipment but how is a normal shaman expected to get his hands on 140 hp/mana equipment, on the good focus effects, on the high AC stuff? Well he wont.<br />
<br />
And that is a shame for a lot of shamans out there and something SoE should have a look at. Balancing a class by equipment never works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">It really astounds me to hear the griping on this thread.  It's hard as heck to find a shaman for an upper 50's group on Emarr.  I have a 52 shaman I've just been using to buff my groups lately, and almost every time I log on with him I get tells asking to join a group - and I'm not even lfg!  Maybe it's just my server, but I don't think so.  <br />
<br />
For those shaman (or any class for that matter) that say you got ldon groups initially, but now you can't find any...take a look at how you play in a group.  I'm not trying to flame anyone, just be helpful.  Since ldon has come out I've been in more pickup groups then I was in the prior 2 years total.  Some good, some bad.  In all cases I evaluated how I thought each player did.  If they helped the group, I added them to my friends list.  I'm sure lots of people are doing the same thing and this may be why you can't find groups anymore.  (again, I'm trying to help so don't take this as a flame)  When I first grouped with my druid I quickly realized I wasn't helping the team because I was using solo tactics...so I totally changed how I played.  Some of you may need to do the same thing with your shaman.<br />
<br />
One thing I am curious about...for those people that think shaman are underpowered, do you play other classes of comparable levels/aa's?<br />
<br />
I don't know about the high end game, but up through 60, I definitely don't think shaman are underpowered in the least - even for ldon.<br />

<br />
every class has advantage/disadvantage when you stack them.   Compare BST to Shaman.  They got the DPS.  But if you multi-pull.<br />
they aren't going to be doing a lot of melee as their mana runsout.  AE Slows and AE rains are great in LDON.  They can't heal.  Quiessence is often the &gt;&gt;BEST&lt;&lt; heal for LDON runs.  They can root/park   <br />
<br />
As for 3+ shaman on raids.  Man we raid often with 6 to 8.  And I have a blast.  We race/compete with slow calls.  Heck back in the VT day there were some truly massive trains that we survived by raw shaman slowing power.  Bane doesn't have that much agro and rocks for easy dps.   Hell, at the planar level on mobs like General Rape, its easy enough to lose enough people that it rocks to have extra MGBs available.<br />
So on.  <br />
<br />
Here's another way of telling balance.  In guild chat, the single most common Group looking for X... is ...Slower.  I never have problems getting groups.  The classes I see most often in Guild Chat saying LFG repeatedly.... 1) Monk 2) Warrior 3) Druid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">why are you always trying to achieve balance vs other classes ?<br />
Everquest is a PvE game for the most part (except for 3 or 4 servers), for this aspect of the game the shaman class is balanced in my opinion.<br />
<br />
If you want to play a game thats balanced for pvp play daoc, the lines between classes in daoc are extremley blurry to achieve PvP balance.  This can not be the goal in a RPG game.<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ is competitive, just like PvP games.  It is just more indirect.  You compete for group slots, you compete for guild spots.  Most importantly, everyone wants to feel like they are contributing as much, overall, as all their friends are.  Nobody wants to be the obvious charity case deadweight.  That's why balance is important.<br />
<br />
I agree with your other point (that shamans are decently balanced with other classes now).  Most of the things I would change about our class are just convenience things (the avatar line, out of group shrink, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">When a group is looking for a slower, they always look for a shaman first. Why?<br />
<br />
Not only do you have the most usefull buffs out of any class, you slow, you have a pet, crowd control, and some DPS (I said some. Not alot, but some).<br />
<br />
The ~10% difference is haste is minimal when you have a +34% haste item, which most melee do (I don't, however. But most.)<br />
<br />
As a warrior, I rely on procs for aggro, since the 55% taunt success rate is pittiful, but that's a different story. I, along with many other warrior I'm sure, would rather have the 50 dex you can (given you don't have avatar) over the hate modifier.<br />
<br />
While other classes may come close to doing your job, they are never sought after first for that job, and I think that's what alot of what balance comes down to. Desireability.<br />
<br />
I do find it rather intrigueing that both slowers and tanks are upset at hybrids for being so god damn powerful (shm: beasts for slows. monks/rogues: beasts and rangers for dps. wars: pally/shadowknight for tanking).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">I'm very happy with my Shaman after I got good hitpoints, focus items and aa's - we rule at that point!  A little gimpy before that (let's be real here folks).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've never used our lame ch. but I certainly don't have druid envy - Sony just screwed up and should have made it druid only from the get go - they just threw us a bone to shut us up.  A better fast heal would be nice, but frankly we are ok without it (when you train your healing aa's) and we certainly dont need any slow casting heals. We can be the only healer in a LDON regular group and &quot;rock the house&quot; - our heals are fine.<br />
<br />
I think that Sony still thinks of us as a Priest class instead of a utility character like a Bard/Chanter.  It has been my experience that we rarely compete with a cleric or druid for experience group spots, its the bards, chanters and the beastlords we should be balanced against.  I think a lot of the problems Sony had in trying to fix druids stemmed from them paying attention to shaman rather than balancing druids vs clerics.<br />
<br />
Now, to be balanced against the bards/chanters/beastlords I think that it is reasonable to focus on the dps area and a nice nuke spell in LDON would have improved things much more than Bane which will never be used by any competent shaman in regular LDON.  Maybe Bane will be useful in raids or hard adventures, I have my doubts due to agro.  Another indirect way to increase damage and balance us against Paragon (to be frank) would be some sort of attack buff (stacking with FA).<br />
<br />
Oh, let's not forget about the never ending request for out of group shrink.  Also, I would like to see a use for our MGB other than doing F07 -like a smaller healing group Q or something like that.  To have our MGB go to waste on multi shaman raids is just stupid IMHO.<br />
<br />
About rabid bear, frickin frackin you would think Sony could figure out something that would work.  It is my opinion that rabid bears best use is to help stacking issues on raids for shaman on magic resistent mobs. Whether that was Verant/Sony's intent I don't know.  But why not make it more powerful instead of a faster refresh?  Boggle??<br />

Think about it, every class even pure melee when they are well played and have big aa's are tons better than a 65 with little or no aa's.  Regular LDON is trivial to ANY group configuration of these classes. Any configuration.<br />

<br />
I gotta agree with this statement 100%. I have had some screwy group combos in LDoN of high AA guildies and we just shredded, no matter what the make up. On the other side of the scale, I have had some &quot;near perfect&quot; LDoN pick up groups that failed miserably, mostly due to a lack of skill, but somewhat to a lack of gear-AA.<br />
<br />
All in all, while some shaman may be having trouble getting LDoN groups, I am not. If I spend more then 10 mins LFG, I simply start my own. We haveachannelset up on my server where 3 or 4 of the &quot;Top 5&quot; guilds hangout if they are looking for LDoN groups. It has allowed me to meet folks from other guilds, checkout the cool **** they have (especially the PoTime guys) and have a ton of fun while improving inter-guildrelations at the same time.<br />
<br />
Oh, and asfor the BL vs Shaman debate, I play regularly in LDoN with a BL, and we work AWESOME together. Multi pulls are such a blast, he takes one himself, slows and starts killing it. I slow the primary and any other adds and root them off. Then I can focus my ownD PS (which is fairly decent in root-park battles) and not worry about the BL one tiny bit.</div></div><hr />

So, now you're comparing lvl 65 melee's with ton's of AA's to lvl 65 classes with no AA's??  That's not a valid comparison.  That's like comparing lvl 60 melee's to lvl 45 casters...of course the lvl 60's are more powerful.  Duh!! <br />

A high AA-d 65 is certainly going to be good, but not overpowering.<br />

If there is one spot that the game is balanced it is at the very upper end with high aa's and excellent equipment.<br />

Every class properly played kicks serious rear end.  EVERY CLASS.  The only reason I downgraded the pure melee slightly is that they need a strong supporting cast to shine.<br />

monks and warrior are running around completely worthless, and your bitching that shaman are unbalanced. hold on while i get you a ****ing tissue. <br />
<br />
for the slow folks of the group (no pun intended) i have broken this down into a mathematical formula so the dumbasses in the group can understand...<br />
<br />
best slow + best buffs + best debuffs + infinate mana = necessary for groups and raids<br />
<br />
not to mention you get pets, dots, DD's (AE dd is not bad dps) and a hand full of other stuff that makes shaman good.<br />
<br />
whens the last time you saw a 65 group or raid go without a slower? <br />
<br />
your a dumbass, please go kill yourself by drinking a bottle of bleach<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">...<br />
<br />
best slow + <br />
- No objection here.<br />
<br />
best buffs + <br />
- Voice of Quellious, Hand of Virtue, Blessing of the Nine, Vallon's Quickening, Ferocity, Spiritual Dominion, Kazad's Mark just to name a few buffs that are superior to all shaman buffs. But fear not, we have tons of utterly useless stat buffs. AGI anyone? <br />
<br />
best debuffs +<br />
- Enchanters have tash, cripple. Mages have Malosinia, Mala. Best slow yes. Best debuffs? Yes but not alone. <br />
<br />
 infinate mana = <br />
- You have obviously not seen Necro mana regen. Or mage. Not saying shaman manaregen sucks but we are far from only class with good manaregen. Your point was?<br />
<br />
necessary for groups and raids<br />
- For groups? No. For raids? 2-3 for MGB buffs, a few more for some specific fights with mobs having curable Disease/Poison AE. Shamans are the class that stacks the worse, well maybe enchanters too.<br />
<br />
 dots,<br />
- One line is nearly worthless in XP groups. So so use in raids (Disease). Other line is a death sentence (Poison) and finally the best line has recast issues (Curses). <br />
<br />
whens the last time you saw a 65 group or raid go without a slower? <br />
- That doesn't imply that slower MUST be a shaman. Other classes can slow great too, especially with mitigation in place.<br />
<br />
so the dumbasses in the group can understand...<br />

Sure no problem, but Zorlac took already most of the arguments  :( <br />

As stated exactly one (count with me  - 1) of your arguments holds water, shaman got the best slows (stop the press for those shocking news ...). The rest is either blatantly wrong, seriously flawed or incomplete - take your pick. May want to read up some of the basics of a class, before you go out to flame it next time?<br />
<br />
&quot;Monks and warriors run around completely worthless&quot; - exaggerate much? Contrary to your post monks and warriors are NOT worthless. As most know already, those classes have some issues, that will hopefully be looked into, but that's about it.<br />

<br />
I've played a lot of classes over the last four years, and really think the shaman is one of the more &quot;balanced&quot;. IE, they are not too powerful and not too weak. If anything I think they lean toward the weak side. But the class is 90% dependent on SLOW. If SOE ever nerfs the skill or makes everything mitigate slow, the desirability of shaman will drop massively. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">well I have not re the entire thread but 1 thing I would like to say about the ENC / Shaman Slow thing is that most want a shaman because we can survive a bounced slow or 2 whereas most enchanters I know cannot. The ones that can usually have ALL of the defensive AA's and keep runes on at all times and even then I stand a better chance of surviving and I have none of the defensive AA's.<br />
<br />
As far as balance ... I hate to say it but i think we are fairly balanced ... execept for 1 thing ... buff slots ... there are not enough buff slots for us to make real use of one of the shaman's key features  ... Alchemy , yes it is a key feature we are the only ones that get it. Personally there have been many times that I want to use potions on raids heck even in exp groups but there are not enough buff slots for me to use the potions in addition to the buffs I already have. the have added a new class and new lines of buffs ( not to mention clickies) and yet have never added more buff slots. And yea I know alchemy is expensive as all hell ... but so are the components that other classes have to use for their spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">well I have not re the entire thread but 1 thing I would like to say about the ENC / Shaman Slow thing is that most want a shaman because we can survive a bounced slow or 2 whereas most enchanters I know cannot. The ones that can usually have ALL of the defensive AA's and keep runes on at all times and even then I stand a better chance of surviving and I have none of the defensive AA's.<br />
<br />
That's an important point.<br />
<br />
If a shaman gets slow resisted, he can channel in the face of the mob if necessary (not considering root here) and slow it.<br />
<br />
If a chanter blows a slow and pulls aggro, in PoP/LDoN, he's dead unless he manages to channel a stun or root(and provided it lands).  If you doubt this, watch what happens when a mob resists mez and attacks the chanter.  They die...quickly.  After the mob eats through the chanter's rune, they're dead meat.  Just replace &quot;mez&quot; with &quot;slow&quot; and you get the same result.<br />
<br />
I'm no uber-equipped shaman, but I can take a pounding from a mob due to my high HP (4.8k max buffed, 3.1k self buffed) and high AC (1090 buffed), where the average chanter with gear the same value as mine (plat wise) and with the same number of AA points won't last even half as long.<br />
<br />
Of the slowing classes, Shamans and Beastlords do this best, because we can survive if we take aggro (heck, in some cases, shamans intentionally take aggro to split mobs).  And since shamans have a much more powerful slow (75% compared to 50%), we make the better slower of the two.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">Shaman vs ENC/BST slows. Instead of that CH hitting for 3-4k average on a tank, it will hit 4-5k average if slowed by BST/ENC. Not to mention, same time was spent casting spell, same mana amount was used and same time/effort will be needed to regain that same amount of mana.<br />
<br />
If your cleric is healing 3-4k with a ch then that is a reflection of their trust in you.. 9k tank and the ch is landing when tank is at 5-6k hps.. jesus... in my xp groups clerics land ch at around 25% so it's more like double the numbers you mentioned.. <br />
<br />
I have no insecurities.. I looove when a chanter or bl joins me. Chanter can tash and gimmie candy and I hate hasting and I love chanter haste so I can proc more =] When bls join I malos+slow and if it's a resist I say resist and nuke, he can slow it that time.. if you think a chaner or bl likes to slow you are dead wroooong.. they HATE to slow, only reason they like it cause makes em get groups more.. just ask a chanter or a bl..<br />
<br />
I see regulary Warriors with their pet cleric 2-boxing in Earth or Fire. Is really slow needed in elementals?<br />
<br />
So what you are saying is elementals down slow is just a luxury not really needed.. I don't think you are right.. I don't think it's fun chaining ch with your pet cleric and having it land with you on 20% life read 1800 hps with a 900 hitter.. A shaman saying slow is really not that great of a spell... didn't think I'd see that one!<br />
<br />
A shaman can't heal efficiently as solo healer in every elemental zone. As soon as mobs start partially mitigating and tripling for 600+, our POS 2K CH or Tnarg won't cut it. Meaning you need to be efficient as a Druid or Cleric.<br />
<br />
If I'm the main healer and slower in an elemental group it's dangerous cause I might get aggro then healing mt gets me more aggro.. but other than that I can keep heals up.. w/o needing any breaks...<br />
<br />
<br />
Enchanter are far better than us and again, bring much more to a group than us. <br />
<br />
So after the chanter tashes if he's not summoned he's slowed and if he's not summoned he waits until 50% ish and nukes... at least that's what I've seen aggro wise from tash.. I usually in elem malos slow and go in and melee and nuke.. I usually only aggro if I proc x2 in a row for 400.. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Haste: Enchanter has much better with nice ATK boos also.<br />
- Stat buffs: non issue, elemental guilds alreay have enveryone and his mother capped.<br />
- Regen line: Owned by Paragon of Spirit.<br />
- FA: Ferocity.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can get the melee's in my group 100% hasted with my haste.. so the enchanter just really adds +atk.. the bl does not do haste as well as us and so adds +atk and resist so in the end just +atk since resists don't matter.. I can do more atk than the chanter so that puts me way ahead.. the bl can do more atk than me so my haste is more anyway =]<br />
<br />
and 1600 hps and 400 mana every 15 min is cool but not a make or break for xp groups.. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Stacking sucks. Did spider isle in Air with 2 shamans, entire plane of Fire with 1 shaman, earth rings with 2. All went smooth. MGB eliminates the need for more.<br />
<br />
You probably did not slow any of the yard trash and waited until late with the nameds to be able to do all of fire with 1 shaman.. and gotten lucky to boot.. I also looked at your magelo if you are in time and doing this it's then a totally different story.. <br />
<br />
<br />
(1) Either reduce aggro on poison DoTs or give shamans some artificial means to reduce it: very long cast time FD like spell or a Concussion/Jolt clone. Something to able to use DoTs in every situation: XP or raids.<br />
(2) We need a bigger CH clone. 3500 would be good. It will allow us to be a much better healer (alone) for a group in high end XP zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
For 1, I kept BoS/BoU on Fennin Ro and I was nuking w/o aggro problems.. if you are having problems check your tactics can't cast bos get a resist then chain bos until it lands or something like that.. For 2, you are telling me you want to heal for 3500 in 10s and that will make you happy? that's a complete joke.. tnargs is still better than that by far..<br />

But in reality, durability comes down to your clerics =)<br />
<br />
Enchanters are more durable than Shamans, hands down. They have 2300+ points worth of Runes and an insta AA rune for 800ish every 11 mins. The Rune prevents that they get pushed when they are hit, which makes it almost impossible to interrupt them.<br />
The Enchanter can stun/mezz and if he chooses so cast &quot;Boggle&quot; to reduce his value on the hate list by 500.<br />
<br />
The highend Enchanter dies a lot less to Slows and aggro in general than the Shaman, unless he doesn't know what he's doing.</div></div><hr />

- You didn't understand my point. Once you have an enchanter or beastlord in group, adding shaman is not a good idea. Unless you have some very specific task in mind (babysitting enchanter on hard ventures with charmed pet). Second point was, when you need a group member and have 3 choices: Beastlord, Enchanter or Shaman and you don't need healing, the best choice would be either Enchanter (caster heavy group) or Beastlord (melee heavy group). Both of those classes bring a wide variety of abilities that surpass anything the shaman can bring to a group. <br />

- Countless times I've been only shaman or we've been 2 shamans on raids from NToV to Ssra to Elementals to Time. If you have 2-3 competent shamans on a raid, there is simply no &quot;work&quot; for others. Yes they can heal, nuke, dot ... but if you could replace them with specific nuke, heal or dot classes would you? I sure would in a blink of an eye, more raid DPS or much better healing efficiency. Of course there are 2-3 encounters where having lot of shamans helps, Rathe, Bertoxxulous or Quarm comes to my mind. Rest can be done very easy with 2-3 max. And for many, all you need is a few bots for MGB Seventh. PS: I slowed all in fire, thanks to broken Bards only one mob is pulled to camp at one time, some rare occasions maybe 2. Not to mention when you have 60+ people beating on an XP mob, slowing is really a non issue. And one shaman can slow a named. You don't need 5 for that.<br />

<br />
Zorlac the fact is you ONLY SAY you have seen it regularly because you wish to down play the better success, slow from a shaman, adds to the raid.  <br />
<br />
Saying that Slow is not necessary on a raid where the mob is hitting for 900 damage a pop is just plain ignorance.<br />
<br />
1.  Slow saves the cleric some mana<br />
2.  Slow helps to save the lives of melee<br />
3.  Slow eases the tension on clerics to deliver a CH.  (Its bad enough clerics in a CH chain if they miss one CH hear about it.)<br />
4.  Slow does nothing but increase the chances of a successful raid so your findings in which YOU BELIEVE SLOW is unnessary is sloppy research, at best.  <br />
<br />
Anything that increases success is deemed good to have.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Now, now, don't put words into my mouth. I questionned the need for slow considering the efficiency of CH AND mob slow mitigation. I never said slow was &quot;not great&quot;. Slow is an aweseome spell.<br />
<br />
See above, about the need for slow...<br />
<br />
If you agree that Slow is such and awesome spell then you will agree that many MA tanks and clerics respect the need for a 75% slow from a shaman ... over a 65% slow from a beastloard.  For if a raid ends up depending on a 65% beastlord slow over a 75% shaman slow that means the MA Tank will be taking 40% MORE DAMAGE.  Hence, many, many clerics and Warriors respect shaman slow over beastlord slow.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Someone already beat me to the punch, but chanters have deaggro spells, 2k Runes, 400-500hp less than shaman. Not to mention a chanter with Serpent of Vindication is a faster slower than a shaman. Tash only takes a second to cast. <br />
<br />
1.  But you forgot that Enchanters are on an entirely different damage migration table.  Casters take more damage per a hit.<br />
<br />
2.  Shamans have more access to better and more AC than enchanters.  Less AC causes enchanter to take more Hits.<br />
<br />
3.  Mentioning Deaggro spells in a enchanter's defense is a Moot point.  Deaggro spells are NOT fast enough if Tash is not timed  when casted on the mob. Hence, the term &quot;Tash Suicide&quot; came about.  Inwhich the enchanter would die several split seconds after tashing.<br />
<br />
4.  So you want to add Tash aggro and slow aggro to the enchanter... sounds non-necessary and adds more risk to the enchanter.  <br />
<br />
Why not have and even fast and better method to slow be used:  Inwhich the shaman sees the enchanter casting Tash and reacts by casting his slow.  Resulting a faster slow method, better slow, and distributed aggro between the two characters.  <br />
<br />
<br />

Zorlac Sabboth we all know here you are PRO-Beastlord.  <br />
Infact you dropped your shaman to play the beastlord.  <br />
But please don't try to make up for your mistake for changing classes by now feeding propaganda on this board.<br />
<br />
Shamans provide more than just buffs and slows.  Shamans can produce damage.  <br />
<br />
Infact Shamans can out burst a beastlord in damage.<br />
<br />
In some cases in which a quick timely kill is needed a shaman can actually provide more damage than a beastlord to a raid.  <br />
<br />
Lastly, another reason why would a shaman would be picked over a beastlord and enchanter:  M-A-L-O (which helps all caster classes and some hybrids)<br />
<br />
<br />
- Countless times I've been only shaman or we've been 2 shamans on raids from NToV to Ssra to Elementals to Time.

Yes they can heal, nuke, dot ... but if you could replace them with specific nke, heal or dot classes would you? <br />
<br />
Some guilds actually ask for all their members to attend raids.  I mean far from me to say that a guild says,<br />
<br />
 &quot;No extra shamans, don't come we don't want your added damage or heals (for casters and clerics)... &quot;<br />

ridiculous Zorlac...<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: I slowed all in fire, thanks to broken Bards only one mob is pulled to camp at one time, some rare occasions maybe 2.<br />
<br />
As your beastlord, good for you...  <br />
Bet even less damage would have been taken if a shaman or enchanter was slowing /shrug.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to mention when you have 60+ people beating on an XP mob, slowing is really a non issue. And one shaman can slow a named. You don't need 5 for that.<br />
<br />
Slow is not an issue, man, where have you been for the expansion PoP where some form of a slower, (except for probably Tier 1 planes) are deems very necessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
And one shaman can slow a named. You don't need 5 for that.<br />
<br />
So rather than having insurance as to whether a single shaman gets his slow off.  We can just for-go the need for any other shamans for healing the casters and clerics or for damage purposes...  <br />
<br />

<br />
Saying that Slow is not necessary on a raid where the mob is hitting for 900 damage a pop is just plain ignorance.<br />
- There is your lack of understanding english language again. I was talking about mobs people experience on them, AKA yard trash. Dumbass. 900 damage from an XP yardtrash mob is just that ... insignificant for a raid of 50+ people, especially when mobs come alone or in pairs. Basic english is your friend!<br />
<br />
1.  Slow saves the cleric some mana<br />
- So if CH heals for 6000 damage it will cost less mana than if it would heal for 7000? Moron.<br />
<br />
of a successful raid so your findings in which <br />
- Stop putting words in my mouth dumbf-uck. I clearly said warrior XPing with a cleric bot or beastlord XPing with a cleric bot. So ST-FU and learn basic english. I mentionned shaman stacking issues on raids also. Moron. My entire &quot;raid findings&quot; were related to poison dot aggro issues, something totally unrelated to slow/healing. Basic english comprehension is still your best buddy!<br />
<br />
40% MORE DAMAGE<br />
- Everyone can skew numbers into their advantage. Or are you saying that a mob will do 200% more damage if you only use a Walking Sleep? Are you inventing mob doing extra DPS? <br />
<br />
Infact you dropped your shaman to play the beastlord.  <br />
- As I was loggin on for a raid last night, the only character on my character select menu was a level 65 shaman. Dumbf-uck.<br />
<br />
Shamans provide more than just buffs and slows.  Shamans can produce damage.  <br />
- Wow. Did you need 3 years to figure that out? This is the revelation of the century. You deserve a Noble price ... in something.<br />
<br />
Infact Shamans can out burst a beastlord in damage.<br />
- /goflclap. Bravo! Superb! You just found out something every caster can do vs any melee (well maybe not some fellstrike disc or mega SK HT). Congratulations on a new revelation in EQ.<br />
<br />
Lastly, another reason why would a shaman would be picked over a beastlord and enchanter:  M-A-L-O (which helps all caster classes and some hybrids)<br />
- Last 100+ wins in regular adventures I casted a whopping Z-E-R-O times Malos. Your point was? Last 5+ hard mission wins I only casted Malosinia on chanter pet. Again your point was? <br />

 &quot;No extra shamans, don't come we don't want your added damage or heals (for casters and clerics)... &quot;<br />

Sometimes you may gloss over an occasional point and eat apart what they said, but I honestly couldn't care less, they are just as enjoyable to read.<br />
<br />
One point you missed/glossed over to get maximum flamage:<br />
<br />
1.  Slow saves the cleric some mana<br />
 - So if CH heals for 6000 damage it will cost less mana than if it would heal for 7000? Moron.<br />
<br />
If the mob is slow'd and the cleric lands CH for 7000 both times there's less mana spent/bigger gap between CH's.   I think that's strait forward, but just wanted to make that clear!<br />
<br />
<br />
The biggest value of slow outside of raids is when a CH is not possible though.  It's when some non-tank gets hit and cleric needs to fire off a blast heal.    Frequently slow will cause clerics to be less mana efficient because they'll use smaller heals on the MT rather than CH.<br />
<br />
Gagner67's comment in regards to BL slows and 40% MORE DAMAGE...<br />
<br />
omg, for the hundreth time, BEAST LORD SLOW IS  ONLY DOING 10% MORE DAMAGE (Thought caps might help get that across...).   Add mitigation and this gap is nil.   Do the math yourself, it's not rocketscience.  We need something in the medicine cabnet to expalain this I think...<br />
<br />
<br />
And I didn't realize you couldn't be interrupted with rune up.  That's awesome.<br />
<br />
Also, Anyone notice that Mages have more HP's on elemental glove/boots than shamans?  That makes 0 sense!<br />
<br />
Personally, I may have some class envy, but I don't think we're out of balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">Khozik, back in January I ran extensive tests on dots in Vex Thal, I died to every boss at least twice trying to find a combo of poison dot + something else to do some damage.<br />
<br />
I tested poison dots on water and fire minis too. I tested  and died to: AMY, Quavonis (normal because of charm), Reparm and Blazzax. In water it was Ofossa , Kirzzik and Hydrotha who killed me. <br />
<br />
All tests were done without me being the slower/debuffer, usually after the 6th or 7th poison DoT landing I was summoned. Now, when Bane/Anathema came out I ran some tests on a multitude of minis, only died to Quavonis and Reparm (normal because of tank switches). I kept Ofossa and Hydrotha Baned the entire fight with throwing in poison nukes without getting on rampage or being summoned. Also kept Bane on AMY and Blazzax, great results, no deaths.<br />
<br />
However, I didn't do any tests with the new aggro generator augs (xxx of Ykesha or Anger xyz). Maybe if a warrior is dual wielding aggro generator weapons each augged with aggro generator procs, maybe then using poison DoTs is less dangerous for shaman's health. I frankly gave up on poison DoTs.</div></div><hr />

I too have been playing EQ and raiding since the game came out in March of 1999.  So please indulge me.  <br />
<br />
I still think you are incorrect did you even answer anything in the above quote? :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
- There is your lack of understanding english language again. I was talking about mobs people experience on them, AKA yard trash. Dumbass. 900 damage from an XP yardtrash mob is just that ... insignificant for a raid of 50+ people, especially when mobs come alone or in pairs. Basic english is your friend!<br />
<br />
Its all to common when losing face with in an arguement to attack some ones character rather than get to a point.  Weak...<br />
<br />
Zorlac, suggest you answer khozik question better:<br />
<br />
<br />
So what you are saying is elementals down slow is just a luxury not really needed.. I don't think you are right.. I don't think it's fun chaining ch with your pet cleric and having it land with you on 20% life read 1800 hps with a 900 hitter.. <br />
<br />
For Chaining CH in any situation may it be raid or exping of yard tash his example is very valid and is a waste of a mana spent on a CH.  Where as slow would end up saving mana for the cleric.<br />
<br />
<br />
- So if CH heals for 6000 damage it will cost less mana than if it would heal for 7000? Moron.<br />
<br />
*sigh Zorlac please read again.<br />
You do realize why slow is necessary:<br />
<br />
1.  Less damage inflicted = less mana spent on CH<br />
2.  The cleric has a better chance to time CHs<br />
3.  Lastly, a mob double hitting for 900 no matter what encounter it is going to outputing more than 14K in damage especially if it is NOT slowed before it dies.<br />
<br />
Think about the above examples before answering.  And don't blindly ramble slurs where every other word is childish adjectives.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Stop putting words in my mouth dumbf-uck. I clearly said warrior XPing with a cleric bot or beastlord XPing with a cleric bot. So ST-FU and learn basic english. <br />
<br />
1.  No, one was putting words in your mouth infact that is why I use the option &quot;Quote.&quot;  (I noticed you do not...)<br />
<br />
2. When it comes to basic English please take your own advice the above quote is terrible English.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mentionned shaman stacking issues on raids also. Moron. My entire &quot;raid findings&quot; were related to poison dot aggro issues, something totally unrelated to slow/healing.<br />
<br />
No, you simply said:<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll be blunt: I don't beleive it. I did countless tests with poison DoTs, never survived a fight. Show me a parse <br />
<br />
Zorlac even you admit the below:<br />
<br />
However, I didn't do any tests with the new aggro generator augs (xxx of Ykesha or Anger xyz). <br />
Perhaps you should do those tests.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Everyone can skew numbers into their advantage. Or are you saying that a mob will do 200% more damage if you only use a Walking Sleep? Are you inventing mob doing extra DPS? <br />
<br />
<br />
Zorlace,  No one was inventing numbers. <br />
Hell, these findings were found by the community of shamans on this board.  <br />
If a tank is depending on a beastlord's 65% slow instead of a 75% slow from a shaman typically the MA tank is taking 40% more damage.<br />
<br />
So feel free if you want to argue with the findings from many shamans compared your simple words.  Go for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
- As I was loggin on for a raid last night, the only character on my character select menu was a level 65 shaman. Dumbf-uck.<br />
<br />
You logged on with your shaman last night.  /shrug so?  <br />
That answers nothing.<br />
<br />
Zorlac the fact is that the board knows you have a old shaman that was your main and now you play your beastlord more.  Now your feeling the need to spread propaganda about the beastlord class and shaman class to make you feel as thou you did not waste time.  Time spent on your Beastlord in your self belief that the class was better than your shaman.  Please own up to your mistakes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow. Did you need 3 years to figure that out? This is the revelation of the century. You deserve a Noble price ... in something.<br />
<br />
- /goflclap. Bravo! Superb! You just found out something every caster can do vs any melee (well maybe not some fellstrike disc or mega SK HT). Congratulations on a new revelation in EQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  This is just a flame.<br />
2.  Gives you no validity to your postings.<br />
3.  Does not answer the question.  In result the above quote is just dodging the fact that you were wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Last 100+ wins in regular adventures I casted a whopping Z-E-R-O times Malos. Your point was? Last 5+ hard mission wins I only casted Malosinia on chanter pet. Again your point was? <br />
<br />
My point was very valid and clearly defines a option a shaman provides over the choice of an enchanter or beastlord.  I directly answered your question about why a shaman would be picked.  <br />
<br />
Zorlac why did you become defensive slinging out those two questions in weak defense when you know I clearly answered your question.  Perhaps because you knew you were wrong.<br />
<br />
Incidently, the debate as to the value to casting malo every fight has been talked about on this board numerous times.  I suggest you use the search feature I believe you will see that an over whelming percent of the shaman community states that malo should be cast every fight.  <br />
<br />
After, all why not cast malo it helps with landing your spell as well as everyone elses spells?  It makes sense to cast something that betters the success of the group.  <br />
<br />
Your point to refuse to cast Malo is unfounded and selfish in may respects.<br />
<br />
<br />
- When you get into Plane of Time give me a call ok? Or when you do LDoN raids give me a call also ok?<br />
<br />
<br />
Already do.<br />

Hate to break it to you, but Zorlac is winning this argument. You show a clear lack of understanding of basic tactics and game concepts.<br />
<br />
#1 might be true, depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
#2 is also true in most circumstances.<br />
<br />
I have no idea how you came up with #3. Why 14k? That's going to be completely dependent on the gear/AA/class of the person tanking, the DPS of the folks killing the mob, and the RNG. There are plenty of 900 hitters that will do no damage before they die... your calculation baffles me.<br />

Um, yeah. We've all heard this little mathematical gem before. Did you also remember to read Viscerator's post regarding his parses of mobs that mitigate slow? You know, like darn near everything in the elemental planes? You might find that 40% damage difference slipping through your fingers.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is absolutely not true. There are many times where casting Malos is a waste of time and mana. In a melee heavy group against low-MR mobs, it's not worth it. In a caster heavy group it might be worth it, depending on how long the mobs live and their average resists. Casting Malos on inc is a relatively new tactic, brought on by the hard-hitting mobs in PoP. Or did you Malo all the shrooms you fought in FG? How about frogs in Seb?<br />
<br />
I went back and looked at the original post. He's talking about normal difficulty LDoN. I doubt anyone bothers with Malos on anything but the bosses in assassination (and not even then, sometimes) on this difficulty, since the mobs die so fast. Nice try, though.<br />

Tash aggro? Hello? You still living in the Velious era?<br />
There's more than 1 item with a focus that lowers tash aggro by 40%, Enchanters get spellcasting subtlety which reduces aggro by another 20%. Not to mention that Enchanters have a buff that makes their spells generate less aggro as well.<br />
<br />
Stop jacking up numbers. A Shaman slowed 900 hitter will not do 40% less dps than a Beast slowed 900 hitter(which btw isn't a raid mob, but an exp mob. Welcome to PoP, dude!), no matter how you try to **** up the numbers to your favor. May i introduce you to a new feature called Slow Mitigation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u159"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p159">Giac, <br />
<br />
I can site numerous posts which your very much pro-beastlord.  Please stick to stats for discussion, I am just providing our communities findings for discussion in the link above.  <br />
<br />
Please remember, mitigation effects &quot;all&quot; slows by the same multiple.  <br />
With mitigation, you can do the math and find that nothing has change in the *&quot;percent&quot; of &quot;damage&quot;* done to the MA Tank between the uses bst, shm or enchanter slow.  Again, For the simple fact mitigation effects all slows by the same multiple. <br />
<br />
<br />
If a mob doing 25 dps vs a mob doing 35dps means that the mob is doing 40% more damage, then I agree with you!  I'm not sure how tho.<br />
<br />
Agreed.  The thread is long but they discuss the impact of beastlord  65% slow, enchanter 70% slow and shaman 75% slow.  They compare the damage a MA tank takes over a period of time.  End conclusion was typically an MA tank will take:<br />
<br />
40% more damage while relying on a Beastlord slow compared to a shaman slow.<br />
<br />
20% more damage while relying on an Enchanter slow compared to a shaman slow.</div></div><hr />

A woman comes in on Tuesday that needs to bake a lot of pies for a bake sale, and to bake these pies she needs 75 apples. This leave's Johnny's mom with 25 apples.<br />
<br />
Then on Thursday, the truck comes with enough apples to make it so Johnny's mom has 100 apples again.<br />
<br />
The same woman comes in on Friday saying she needs apples to bake more pies, as many apples as last time, plus 20% more. How many apples does she need?</div></div><hr />

BTW, my e-peen &gt; your e-peen. So there!<br />
<br />
Silliness aside, I love my shaman and feel that I always bring something and contribute to groups of any size - and I can always solo if I have to (not all classes can say this with authority) - in fact, to read some of the stories here one might think that shaman are god's gift to soloing.<br />
<br />
The ONLY thing that's really bumming me out about shaman right now is how much lube we need in regards to spell costs at 60+.  There are ways to get around the sodomy but in general looking at how we get violated for spells is rather depressing.  I'm less concerned about class balance than I am about gameplay balance at this point - ie, I want to be playing my shaman and having fun, not farming to be able to obtain my spells.  I was looking at the costs of 60+ spells in the bazaar last night and thinking, this really sucks, why am I subjugating myself to this, I'm gonna make an old-school monk who runs around naked beating on stuff with my bear hands and like it.<br />
<br />
You know, many of the people with negative outlooks on their shaman are those that are level 65 with tons of AA, who have probably done ever raid in the game 30 times, and who have ridiculous gear.  AND, these are usually people who have already got years of enjoyment out of their shaman.  AND, I don't think these people are frustrated about class balance - they just don't have anything better to do than complain - they've done and acquired everything the game has to offer or are damn close.  I think you need to step back, realize it's just a game, look at the big picture, and realize that things really aren't that bad (and more likely are pretty good).<br />
<br />
I think if you compare your average joe shaman with your average joe from any other class than we're doing pretty good.  I'd think that at the highest levels, with lots of AAs, and insane planar gear that anybody is gonna be a super hero regardless of class and who cares if one type of superhero is marginally more powerful than another when all superheros are overkill for almost all situations.<br />
<br />
I've played several MMORPGs and I'm in my second run with EQ.  In my first run with EQ all we had at 50th was naggy, vox, PoF, PoH, and maybe, if you were feeling truly bored, Kedge.  Most folks at that time were pretty fed up with the highest levels.  (I left just before Kunark to play AC)  In AC the devs delivered new conent via patches every month and the people at the top were always bitching about there being nothing to do about 1 day after they devoured new content.  In DAoC people were always bitching about the inadequacies of the end-game/high end game.<br />
<br />
Devs have to balance games for everyone, not just the hardcore folks that play 50-60 hours a week.  Not everybody reaches the highest levels, maxes out their AAs, gets every piece of phat lewt known to mankind, and raids every day.  Consider the big picture - there are people of all types playing styles that want to enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. I took a year off from EQ and my shaman due to the depression caused by gear/spell costs and a general raiding boredom. I came back with LDoN, but started a necro after looking at the spell costs for shaman and those for necros. I ran my necro up to 56 in 14 days and started farming pp and spells in order to restart my shaman. <br />
<br />
Its insane to have to level up a another class/toon just to be able to make enough cash to pay for spells (my necro also researches spells, go me, I have torpor already). For comparison, in bazaar on Prexus I typically find 2-3 top end necro spells selling for over 20K. Most sell for under 2K. My shaman spells (torpor, malos, Q) all go for over 25K and my secondary spells are all over 5K. <br />
<br />
I think shaman are pretty balanced. They are not gods but they are not gimps either. They have a good role in groups and can marginally solo. My necro, OTOH, is a god. Utterly unstoppable solo and since LDoN greatly desired in groups for my sustained casting ability and massive dps.</div></div><hr />

Yes, an enchanter adds mind buffs, haste and crowd control. When they can use charm/dire charm, they can add DPS. But an enchanter gets more agro with tash than we do with malos, and is more fragile. How many enchanters do you know who have HP as their prime stat?<br />
<br />
Yes, a beastlord adds stacking buffs, and DPS. But their slow is significantly worse than a shamans, and their buffs aren't as good. Plus beastlords aren't yet common enough to be an option much of the time.<br />
<br />
A shaman adds buffs, some DPS with pet, debuffs and backup healing (sometimes main healing) all with the best slow.<br />
<br />
Of course, they all stack pretty well - I love having both enchanter and beastlord in my group.<br />
<br />
When I'm leaving an exp group, and ask who they want to replace me, most often I hear, &quot;Look for another shaman&quot;. Sometimes they'll say &quot;Enchanter or shaman&quot;. Very rarely has a group suggested beastlord - once when they'd already established there were no shamans or enchanters lfg, and once when one of the group members had a BL friend who was available.<br />
<br />
Lets face it, groups love us. With PoP, people have come to realise how powerful slow is. Even in the face of slow mitigation, a group will want a slower. It's almost mandatory. This is why there are so many twink/bot shamans around, along with twink/bot clerics - when groups often fold because of a lack of a class, some people will create that class to 2-box with.<br />
<br />
I *do* think we're balanced too much towards slow for most people's liking - it's the main thing we're invited to groups for, it's the main thing people know about shamans. I realise that most shamans don't like to be so one-dimensional.<br />
<br />
With slow mitigation on many mobs, I don't think it would hurt for us to have slightly better damage output, nothing to make us challenge a &quot;dps&quot; class, nothing so powerful that we'd be invited to groups because of it, but something to help us feel we're contributing something more to each fight than just the slow.<br />
<br />
So yes, I'd like slightly better damage nukes (I'm thinking something like 1100ish damage cold, 850ish poison, with slightly better efficiency than our current nukes, to put us in line with other support classes). And yes, I'd like slightly better melee, we are the &quot;battle priest&quot; with the best melee skill caps (I know many shamans are irritated that clerics can melee better than shamans).<br />
<br />
I would like these things, but I will carry on playing without them, and I still don't think we're broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the actual effect of mitigation on slow. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mitigation really distorts the #1 slower Title.<br />
<br />
with no mitigation you got the m= 70, with sd = 4.08 basically this is based on the population of slowings being n = 3 <br />
<br />
that puts shaman at z = 1.22, chanters are z = 0 and beastlords at z= -1.22<br />
<br />
now with mitigation (standard deviation stays the same)<br />
<br />
at 75 percent effectiveness:<br />
<br />
m = 52.5 now the z scores for each are now<br />
shaman: z = .92, enchanter: z = 0 and beastlord z = -.92<br />
<br />
(mitigation to 75 percent lowers the effectiveness of shaman slow by 30 points and raises the effectiveness of beastlord slow by 30 points.)<br />
<br />
at 50 percent effectiveness:<br />
<br />
m = 35, the z scores for each are now<br />
shaman: z = .61, enchanter: z = 0, beastlord: z = -.61 <br />
<br />
(mitigation to 50 percent lowers the effectivness of shaman slow by 61 points and raises the effectsness of beastlord slow by 61 points.)<br />
<br />
at 25 percent effectiveness:<br />
<br />
m = 17.5 the z scores for each are now<br />
shaman: z = .30 enchanter: z = 0 beastlord: z = -.30<br />
<br />
(mitigation to 25 percent lowers the effectiveness of shaman slow by 92 points and increases the effectiveness of beastlord slow by 92 points.) <br />
<br />
Mitigation changes the gap between beastlord chanter and shaman slows which used to be 122 points apart to only 30 points apart. Mitigation greatly diminishes the power of our slow and raises the power of the beastlord slow.<br />
<br />
If you understand statistics youll understand that..this is a dramatic change in effectiveness of shaman slow to other slows</div></div><hr />

Nice explanation if the facts were true.. but of course slightly does not mean 25% it's up to 25% so could be even less (meaning bl is better) BUT there might be a table where BL is mitigated more than SHM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u179"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p179">Khozik makes baby jesus cry.<br />
<br />
I can see why this class is getting screwed every expansion. Most don't ****ing understand basic game mechanics, so they think &quot;Hey let's **** Shamans, since the majority won't figure out what we did to them and we can ignore the little crying crowd. I wish the ****ing Druids would be stupid like that.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
What facts are you talking about?  The entire thing is a mathematical explanation of how mitigation affects varying levels of slow.  It doesn't matter what the mitigation percentage actually is, what matters is that the higher the percentage of mitigation the smaller the gap in slowing effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Although...wait, do you actually think the game is checking to see what class is casting a spell before determining the percentage of mitigation?  Please say yes, wait, please say no, wait, I can't decide which is worse so don't answer.  <br />
<br />
I really hope this isn't representative of the general level of understanding that players have of the game, but I really suspect it is.  Hell, I'm begining to suspect that even the game designers are right there with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is exactly what I think might also happen.. for example.. the reason Beastlords can land slow w/o debuffs is because:<br />
<br />
a) they have a resist mod on their spell<br />
b) the game is checking to see what class is casting the spell before..<br />
c) they are just lucky or don't notice the way we do.<br />
<br />
It is my understanding from lucy that a is incorrect, c sounds flaky so I think it's b.. what do you think? or is there a choice I missed?<br />

This post was about:<br />
<br />
For 1, I kept BoS/BoU on Fennin Ro and I was nuking w/o aggro problems.. <br />
- I'll be blunt: I don't beleive it. I did countless tests with poison DoTs, never survived a fight. Show me a parse.<br />
<br />
If you want to talk about what heals to use and when then that's a different topic. I proved my point =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u184"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p184">Somebody please tell me Khozik used more than just Blood, Ultor and Velium Strike and that i just missed it, please...<br />
<br />
You are in the Elemental Planes, yet you have such a little understanding of the game. <br />
Tetrass' conclusion is basically what i have been saying for a long time, most people in EQ and may i add particularly Shamans, don't know or understand a whole a lot about game mechanics or simple elementary school math. <br />
So how do we expect to see any sort of useful info and suggestions on changes on these boards ever? Especially when some people still think balance isn't achieved on a class vs. class base.<br />
<br />
If you only play your Shaman and don't know much about other classes, you will of course think chloroblast(as an example) is the ****. 70 DPS worth of DoT's is a ****ing joke and nowhere proves your point saying that you got no aggro problems when you &quot;DoT mobs to hell&quot;.<br />
<br />
Please, reconsider your view on how Slow Mitigation works. Just accept that the Shaman lost a lot of relative power vs. other slowers with the implementation of Slow Mitigation and that we got nothing to compensate for that.<br />
I was able to read this thread from the first to the last post today and the number of things that made me boggle could fill a book, so I'll just go with my own suggestions of what needs to be done to bring the Shaman class back to being balanced(Not like anyone who really has any say on how things should be changed will read this at page 6 or listen to a single opinion, no matter how valid it is. You need MANY people asking for the same thing to get it done in EQ, hence why we keep getting neglected):<br />
<br />
1. Implement a Resist Adjust for Debuffs and DoT's for Shamans(We shouldn't be punished for having Malxxx and disease debuffs. We should have the same if not better chance to land our spells as other classes AFTER we applied our debuffs<br />
<br />
2. Lower the Hate on all DoTs, especially the poison line, or give us a way to reduce it(If it's a reduction a skill exclusively for Shamans or you will widen the gap to Necros even more)<br />
<br />
3. Increase our Mana Regen through a Canni IV like AA button(so that it can be cast during the spell gems refresh) or an additional Cannibalization(Canni V) upgrade. <br />
(We have no passive mana regen abilities at all, so unless we take the time to(which you simply don't have usually) actually stand still for 2.5 seconds and not being able to cast anything else for 5-6 seconds(2.5 sec cast + 2.25 sec gem refresh + whatever server lag adds), we regen less mana than anyone else and totally destroys the oh so illusionary theoretical but incredible mana regen, which we are known for and which is the source of all the high mana low efficiency spells we get<br />
<br />
4. Reinstate the Shaman as the best(not just on paper or marginally) Slower and Debuffer in game. Other classes come too close to what, by definition, are our primary abilities. Bards can cast a lurish slow and lower MR, CR and FR more than us(I know they stack, but so do Greater Healing and CH, it doesn't matter if they do).<br />
My suggestion is to give us the ability to cast slow checking versus all resists(Magic, Fire, Cold, Poison, Disease, make us toggle it through an AA skill) or have it automatically check vs. the lowest resist of the mob to reflect our mastery in it.<br />
<br />
There you go.</div></div><hr />

That is all I cast, our tank did not call disc down:<br />
[Thu Nov 20 19:50:43 2003] Psychoo tells the guild, 'think disc is down but im to drunk to notice'<br />
<br />
So I did not switch from doing damage to healing.. nothing else to do but damage or heal.. however I was keeping tack of time to kill..<br />
[Thu Nov 20 19:51:19 2003] You tell sotshaman:1, 'time to reslow'<br />

<br />
I am on this web site to share knowledge and to learn of course.. and I of course don't think I have as little as you think I do :) but besides that, we as a guild use chloroblast and it's worked for us.. whatever you use if it works for you great, but you can't say something bad about a technique that works :) Something like you don't know what you are doing you used chloroblast on quarm, I don't care if you won anyway just doesn't make sense.. <br />
<br />
I never said dot mobs to hell.. just look at my post it's an EXACT quote.. I kept bos/bou and did velium strike w/o aggro.. are you saying I didn't? I think what you might be saying is that just because I can keep bos/bou up and VS doesn't mean squat cause the wizzy is doing 200 dps.. that's not relative to the issue of aggro.. <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Implement a Resist Adjust for Debuffs and DoT's for Shamans<br />
2. Lower the Hate on all DoTs, especially the poison line, or give us a way to reduce it<br />
3. Increase our Mana Regen<br />
4. Reinstate the Shaman as the bestSlower and Debuffer in game.<br />
<br />
#1 I do get resists on dots a lot as you can see on my post, I'd love less resists, but then tha wouldn't increase dps (your primary concern it seems).. same with #2 except I don't see aggro issues AND it still doesn't increase dps (one of your biggest gripes or no?).. Increase our mana regen.. I pride myself on our mana regen.. after a rez just compare with others take aside your fave necro and take the rez at the same time and see who gets fm faster... 4 just sounds unfair, what do the other classes get then? You want less aggro, less resists, higher dps, best debuffs, even better mana regen, best slower.. OMG just listen to youself.. I might not know much about the game mechanics according to you, but I know what you want is not feasable.. you give no reasons for why you want what you want.. or how it would impact the game..<br />
<br />
Also is there proof we're on the same slow mitigation table? no there isn't so do that math.. The reason there's no unified front is because not everyone thinks things are wrong the way you do..</div></div><hr />

<br />
While i don't want to add to the rampant 'i am right' - 'no you are not' discussion going on, some few points:<br />
<br />
Khozik what please is a 'slow mitigation table'?? When you try and use such a hypothetical new system to backup your argument, it is your part to show evidence for it, not Giacs to disprove it. To my knowledge there was never ever even the slightest hint of such a system, so until shown otherwise, it doesn't exist (and cannot be used to support your claims).<br />
<br />
I do not agree to the full extent of Giacs ideas, but some points have merit:<br />
1. Debuffs are mainly OK (the high end ones are too expensive though). DoTs could use a small resist modifier.<br />
2. DoT system should be reviewed (aggro generation, mana efficiency, maybe resists). That should go for ALL dotting classes.<br />
3. Mana regen is mainly OK, but an update to CannIV to prevent carpal tunnel would be nice (not necessarily the canni rate, but the 'casting comfort' should be increased).<br />
<br />
Quick idea for an update:<br />
A Canni (VI) with 3 times the hp loss of canni IV and triple the recast time. Conversion rate somewhere around 0.8 or 0.9 of current canniIV. So you could choose to be a slacker and cast canni VI for quick regen or chain canni IV for best rates.<br />
<br />
4. Why would it be 'unfair' to any other class, when shaman were again prime slowers/debuffers with enough distance to the other classes? Shaman were the top debuffers/slowers to start with and it is their main function. So no class would really 'loose' something, when that situation would be fixed. All other slower classes have other functions to add, enchanters CC and charm, beastlords melee, pet, mana buffs, bards CC, pulling and a ton of other situational songs to help the group.<br />
<br />
I would add:<br />
5. Decrease the gap between shaman and druid healing already. No need to close it completely (let druids be 2nd best healers, fine), but the gap IS too large at the moment.<br />
<br />
One more thought to 4.:<br />
That is quite difficult to fix, as you cannot change slow itself (works on mitigating and non mitigating mobs as well, so would outbalance shaman for non-mitigating mobs). The only way to fix i see would be to change the mitigation formula. It should mitigate more on lesser slows to negate/limit the posted statistical effect.<br />
<br />
Contrary to what Absor states ('we don't use expansions to balance classes out ....', not an exact quote, paraphrased), i believe SoE was fully aware on that impact and used it together with the heal changes to 'balance' shaman (in their opinion, not mine). So i highly doubt, anything will be done for it.<br />

I don't have bane yet thanks claw for the reminder :) but bane of nife does 1600 points in 42 seconds and it takes up a dot slot.. I would never use that pos when I can nuke for 1k.. If you are saying we have aggro problems after landing 5 dots.. then I agree with you.. but I don't think it's something soe needs to look at and fix.. 1 VS negates most of our dots bane of nife and lower IMO.. <br />
<br />
You used one poison and one disease DoT and you started dotting 2 minutes into the fight, what exactly did you prove? :(<br />
<br />
First it was 1 minute after engage, and I waited for him to be debuffed and slowed before I dotted.. my dot landed less than 20seconds after malosinia.. how soon do you want to be able to dot when you say you want dot aggro fixed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 we do heal fine, sure its no fast healing or any big thing, but we can keep on going forever, due to ft/cann4 &amp; 5. <br />
<br />
 we deal decent dps if we really get into some decent lasting fights, if you useing poison - sure you will get agro, but bane line dont agro a hole bunch.<br />
<br />
 we slow and we do it nicely, actually better then any other class...<br />
<br />
 we have a the best mana regen in the game if you wanna work for it...<br />
<br />
 we have the gear avilable to optain high ac considered to a bst/enc.<br />
<br />
 we are highly wanted in exp groups/raids. - and yet we can solo anything we feel like...<br />
<br />
 we have very good CC toys available, includeing VP, tirgirs, root and therelike.<br />
<br />
 agro is our biggest problem when we are dealing with dps - as it is to most classes, but do lack a agro clearning spell or skill, but its the question if we should get that ? - that would make us even more powerfull... its not our job to deal dps, its our job to atlast anything, with our slow heals, dots, and high manaregen... we can keep fighting without any stop.<br />
<br />
 bst might be close to a shaman class, and alot say that they would choose a bst over a shaman any day, but i dont get it... they lack the manaregen and so, with fast pulling group they wont have the mana to chainslow, they have no healing worth anything, no CC.<br />
<br />
 yah, maybe i was too fast to judge too many whiners here, but i was reading the first 10 posts and kinda gave up. i dident see anything useful.<br />
<br />
imo ppl that want us haveing better healing abilities or lower the hate on dot agro, dont know what they talk about. you have to look at it how it would effect the game style, imo it would ruin the needs for druids completely... heh</div></div><hr />

BackStabber tells the guild 'OMGZ GUYZ! THIS OWNZ! THX ALL!'<br />
-- BackStabber has looted an UberPokerOfUberness. --<br />
<br />
Yay! He is super happy, badass poker, nice look. <br />
<br />
First raid fight ... he draws insane aggro from backstab, despite taking all precautions, of course ... he dies. Second raid fight, same crap.  Third raid ... as expected, back at bindpoint again. He then starts a deep reflection ... &quot;Why did I draw so much aggro?&quot; ... a few hour of systematic analysis follows: he didn't make any mistakes. Somehow the Gods didn't smile upon him. Probably a bad day. He tells himself: You will do fine next time. With this false sense of security he goes to the nearest tavern and gets drunk.<br />
<br />
Next day, no raids planned. Our happy rogue goes off to some exiting LDoN adventure. Behold! The party are descending into the  Random Name Dungeon! With his five friends, they enter the forsaken crypt. The paladin, Sir TauntALot, attacks a vile orc. Everyone moves quickly in position, the orc is getting a nervous twitch but it keeps it's glowing red eyes fixed on the paladin! Our happy rogue decides it's time to backstabb this vile creature back to the Void that Binds! To everyone's suprise, the orc turns back draws out his &quot;spear&quot; and shove's it in our happy rogue's behind. Barely concious he wakes up with the paladin around him and asks himself: &quot;What the hell?&quot;. He never drew aggro. Something is wrong with this poker ... What did he do wrong?<br />
<br />
He then goes off consulting his good old friend Sir NukeALot the wizard. After the wizard chants some ancient mantra, he turns back to the rogue: I have examined your weapon, it is perfectly fine, not cursed. However, I have noted some strange irregularity with the proportion of hate this &quot;backstab&quot; skill of yours generates towards mobs. The poker is fine, however, your backstab is what causing your failures. But I don't understand it all ... every other person I know, mage, wizards ... they don't have this problem. Yet they do a lot more pain to vile orcs!<br />
<br />
The rogue then tells the wizard: But it's my most efficient way of putting things to dead1 It can't be! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Screams of agony and despair can be heard throug the tower of the wizard.<br />
<br />
The days, weeks and even years go by. This once happy rogue is now a nervous wreck. He can't backstab ... or he will endanger the mission, put stress on healers ... he is often seen on his knees in the night yelling: &quot;WHY CAN'T I USE MY MOST EFFICIENT MEANS OF DEALING DAMAGE IN 95% OF ENCOUNTERS?&quot; sometimes he even blames his God: &quot;BRISTLEBANE! WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sad tale indeed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, we aren't. Of course everyone is free to have his own opinion, but your arguments miss (better to say they dance around ...) the core problems.<br />
<br />
 we do heal fine, sure its no fast healing or any big thing, but we can keep on going forever, due to ft/cann4 &amp; 5.  <br />
<br />
Fine for a lvl 24 druid with epilepsy? ;) Again, healing a corpse is not healing 'fine'. Immediate heals are superior than heal over times for practical use in any critical situations. It does't matter if we have a mana/hp-ratio of 1:9 or 1:90, when the tank is DEAD.<br />
<br />
we deal decent dps if we really get into some decent lasting fights, if you useing poison - sure you will get agro, but bane line dont agro a hole bunch.  <br />
<br />
Simple question: how many percent of normal group targets offer that 'decent long fights'? Maybe 10 percent or 20 to be generous. So in like 80-90 percent of all group situations DoTs are USELESS. Granted raid situation is better for DoT-using, but grouping is still a major part of shaman life, or? And you mention bane. Hm, so shaman have to wait SIX expansions until they get their first decent, usable DoT? That statement alone shows, DoTs are not OK.<br />
<br />
  we slow and we do it nicely, actually better then any other class... <br />
<br />
Agreed, our main function is still best of all classes - that's why it is our main function to begin with. As others have pointed out, it's relative power has decreased with slow mitigation though.<br />
<br />
 we have a the best mana regen in the game if you wanna work for it... <br />
<br />
Often used argument and still flawed, because the point is incomplete. Yes we have the best mana regen in game. Anyway that is countered and 'balanced' against mana costs and mana efficiency of our spell setup.<br />
<br />
 we have the gear available to obtain high ac considered to a bst/enc. <br />
<br />
A chain class designed for sporadic melee and getting bashed on resists has higher AC than a pure robe wearing caster class. Nerf us please! :rolleyes: Beastlord AC is next to irrelevant, as melee ability is not defined by AC alone, a major part of a classes ability to melee is based on skills, AAs and innate class abilities, in that area BST &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; SHM as it should be.<br />
<br />
 we are highly wanted in exp groups/raids. - and yet we can solo anything we feel like...<br />
<br />
Groups yes. Raid yes - 2 or 3 of us. Solo? The ability to solo anything does mean ZERO (i really get tired of that 'dragon'-argument), the only solo ability that counts, is the ability to solo efficient, with a reasonable risk and reasonable risk versus reward expectations. When you use that definition, we are somewhere in the middle of all classes, nowhere near the top.<br />
<br />
 we have very good CC toys available, including VP, tirgirs, root and therelike. <br />
<br />
Very good? Enchanters are 'very good', bards are near 'very good', druids combining root/snare are 'good'. Mages and necros are 'good' for certain mob types. Our only common CC ability is root. Tigirs, VP and the like (what else do you mean btw? Snare necklace for 1 race, or pack dogs with a 12 min timer and a rather long cast time are the ONLY other 'toys' i can think of) are highly situational - 'toys' is the rather fitting term, you used.<br />
<br />
CC for a limited number of mobs can be successfully done by every experienced shaman. But i still wait for a group to say 'Hey, we need some CC. Let's look for a shaman'.<br />
<br />
Much like some whiners tend to use all available negatives to present their request as justified, you present all 'positives' in a very flawed and incomplete manner. Both statements 'boohoo, we are totally broken' and 'woot us, we are so powerful and all is fine' are wrong.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Since when do heals not land with runes, khozik? You're wrong, they land.<br />
<br />
They land, but they don't help. Your friendly neighborhood cleric can't heal damage dealt to a rune. Once the AA rune is gone, it's easier to keep a shaman alive than a chanter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Boggle isn't fast enough? Would you say concussion is fast? Boggle &gt; Concussion<br />
<br />
One significant difference is that Concussion is generally used as a preventative measure, that is a wizard will cast it between nukes as nukes generally don't need to be used ASAP. A chanter often does not have the luxury of waiting to cast tash and slow, or of taking the extra time to mix Boggle in.</div></div><hr />

But it's sure we can use an upgrade for our slow (lvl51) and cripple (lvl53) !<br />
It's sure our DoTs got too much aggro and we can't use them in raid specially on a boss. On a fight boss, we have only 2 choices (after debuff time) : we help on heal (it s what i do) or we nuke (but we got the worse nuke on the game). We can't use dots or we are dead.<br />
Perhaps we could use a self decrease aggro ?.<br />

You can cast boggle after tash and slow, if you don't have the time to cast it in between. Boggle is used regularly to drop aggro as is concussion. <br />
Both spells are used as preventive measures usually. Boggle is just easier to channel and lowers hate even more, which makes it a great tool for those times, when you have to deal with unexpected or expected aggro.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I have used a dot in a raid or group in a long time.<br />

Probably because I have Spell Casting Fury III, Fury of Magic &amp; an Improve Damage IV waist item is the reason I use back to back Poison Rains and Velium Strike.  /shrug  (I have no aggro problems either.)  <br />

Its simple really.<br />
What the general population knows is that shamans are the best slowers.<br />
If a pick up group knows they are going to fight mobs that mitigate slow?  Guess what, they still pick up the best slower out of kindness and respect for the cleric who to my experience will speaking up about it.  You can yell about mitigation until you lose your voice.  To the general population fighting mitigation mobs = get best slower it will ONLY help more with healing.<br />

2.  And between a Shaman and a Beastlord, As to the question who take more damage from a mob that is DIRECTLY attacking them.

You've completely missed the point. When a chanter draws aggro, a chunk of his effective hit points are a one shot deal. Once they're gone, they're gone. All of a shaman's hit points are replenishable by the group's healer. <br />

 <br />
Both spells are used as preventive measures usually. Boggle is just easier to channel and lowers hate even more, which makes it a great tool for those times, when you have to deal with unexpected or expected aggro.<br />

Actually, Boggle is used far more often as a reactive measure than concussion is, due to the differing timing requirements between a nuke and tash/slow.<br />

<br />
Four situations - raids, high-dps groups (usually full groups), low-dps groups (duos, trios, bad groups), soloing.  Dots are useful in 3 out of 4.  Practically all of our means of soloing revolve around the use of dots, and always have.  <br />

For one, it would morelook like this: Shaman with 5k HPs and Enchanter with 4.2 k + 2.3k points of Rune.<br />
The other thing is that the Enchanter will drop the aggro immediately, not requiring further or usually any healing after the slow, while the Shaman is going to tank and require heals for as long as it takes the tank to regain the aggro.<br />

It's not like you can only cast Boggle as a reactive measure. *If* you have to use it as such, the Rune will help you getting off that Boggle immensely. I said Boggle is the better spell for proactive *and* reactive measures. Not clear yet?<br />
<br />
Actually, Boggle is used far more often as a reactive measure than concussion is, due to the differing timing requirements between a nuke and tash/slow.<br />
<br />
I agree there. I am not sure where you are getting to though. Boggle is still used more often as a proactive measure than it is as reactive measure. Enchanters can use it more reliably for both. Enchanters are not always slowing, but if they have to they have this sweet tool.<br />
<br />
Should they not use it when they can, because the nature of aggro dictates that it is smarter to use it proactive than reactive?<br />
<br />
And which is it? Are they both regularly used to drop aggro, or are they used as preventive measures usually?<br />
<br />
There goes the reading comprehension. Here's what i said:<br />
<br />
 Boggle is used regularly to drop aggro as is concussion. <br />
Both spells are used as preventive measures usually.<br />
<br />
 Regularly and usually are 2 different words. They are used as a reactive measure regularly (because you can't always avoid getting aggro and it's agreat tool to lose it again), but they are usually used as a proactive measure (since everyone prefers to not get hit at all.</div></div><hr />

- Hi.<br />
<br />
To the general population fighting mitigation mobs = get best slower it will ONLY help more with healing.<br />
- The general population is like you: clueless. Please keep ignoring the DPS your group gains from BST/Enchanter instead of a shaman in a group, and by adding more DPS you reduce the lifetime of a mob, thus reduce the healing required to keep the tank up. Basic logic &gt; you.<br />
<br />
1.  Shamans do generally have more hp and more AC readily avialiable to them than BST<br />
- A beastlord with equal level of AA and gear has more HP than a shaman. Lack of knowledge of basic game mechanics &gt; you.<br />
<br />
 More damage from the Beastlord would mean the fight is over quicker<br />
- Wow. This deserves a Nobel Price in something. You are a genius. A groundbreaking observation. More DPS means faster mob death. Truly amazing.<br />
<br />
you would hope the beastlord was meleeing while being attacked.<br />
- No, of course not. I mean melee classes just STAND around a mob looking at it and doing nothing. Yeah that's it. <br />

How do you figure that mages have the best mana regen in a group situation. They have FT and mod-rods useable by everyone else.<br />

Pet cannibalization<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me guys while I completely kill my DPS for 5 minutes, I need to eat and resummon a pet repeatedly and I can't do anything else in the meantime. What do you mean you're grabbing a rogue?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pet cannibilization is hardly a feasible means of mana regen in an xp group unless you're talking extended periods of downtime.<br />
<br />
3. Increase our Mana Regen through a Canni IV like AA button(so that it can be cast during the spell gems refresh) or an additional Cannibalization(Canni V) upgrade. <br />
(We have no passive mana regen abilities at all, so unless we take the time to(which you simply don't have usually) actually stand still for 2.5 seconds and not being able to cast anything else for 5-6 seconds(2.5 sec cast + 2.25 sec gem refresh + whatever server lag adds), we regen less mana than anyone else and totally destroys the oh so illusionary theoretical but incredible mana regen, which we are known for and which is the source of all the high mana low efficiency spells we get<br />
<br />
Passive mana regen abilities = Meditate, Flowing Thought.<br />
<br />
Buffs aside, we regen exactly the same amount as all other casters.<br />
<br />
Now add in self-buffs.  Some casters regen more at this point.  However, they can keep their damn 8 mana a tick in passive regen and I'll take the approx 35 FT from canni 5 alone AND whatever I want to regen from canni 4 and laugh all the way to the bank.<br />
<br />
Our mana regen isn't illusory.  Oh ya you have to hit a button every 3 minutes, several buttons if you want even more....<br />
<br />
Mitigation changes the gap between beastlord chanter and shaman slows which used to be 122 points apart to only 30 points apart. Mitigation greatly diminishes the power of our slow and raises the power of the beastlord slow.<br />
<br />
And this unbalances us?<br />
<br />
We're not one-dimensional classes.  We do other things than just slow.  Beastlords have an edge in the DPS department.  We have a HUGE edge in the healing department, and depending on the make-up of the group or where you're going a slower that can heal to can be very appealing.  <br />
<br />
Everything goes to hell and the cleric gets multiple add aggro, the last thing they want to hear is &quot;chloroblast inc!&quot;.  With full AA and healing focus I crit tnargs for over 3400.  Hello support healing.<br />
<br />
So it depends on what the group needs or wants.  Do they want more DPS?  Or do they want a larger safety net in the form of a damage mitigator who is also support healer + some DPS.<br />
<br />
Tnargs was a huge upgrade for our class and was added in approx the same time as slow mitigation.  It more than *quadrupled* our fast-heal potential.  IMHO this makes up for any lost ground in the slow department.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u217"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p217">If a Shaman can save his ass with his own heals, you can bet the Enchanter has enough time to drop the aggro if needed. It's 2350 HPs in Runes btw + an instant Rune AA(Eldritch Rune) for 1500 theycan throw in when Arcane Rune drops.<br />
<br />
Your figuring that the enchanter is also using component rune in your above explanation.  I will be the first to tell you Enchanters don't bother with that.  <br />
<br />
Componentless Rune and instant Rune is only 1500 hp and they Don't stack.  And is what is used only during the majority CC done by an enchanter for a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
This was part of the discussion whether Shamans or Enchanters are more durable not whether Runes or Heals are better. I think it's quite obvious which class is more durable.<br />
<br />
If you believe that shamans are not equivalent or better then enchanters for damage prevention then you don't have Quies. or Targ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u218"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p218">Did i state Eldritch Rune and Arcane Rune stack? <br />
No, i didn't. Read what you quote sometimes.<br />
<br />
If your Enchanters don't use Rune of Zeb, that's their problem. Arcane Rune is the Rune that will absorb damage before Rune of Zeb, so that you can just pop Eldritch Rune and keep your Rune of Zeb.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I am not sure anything I will say will make you realize that your reasoning is flawed. <br />
You realize that every Tnarg's you cast makes it harder to lose aggro and that it hardly can make up for the damage you are taking, when we are talking of those tripple 900 hitters?<br />
<br />
The ability to drop aggro at will isn't replaceable by self healing.<br />
<br />
Enchanter's durability &gt; Shaman's durability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u219"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p219">For one, it would morelook like this: Shaman with 5k HPs and Enchanter with 4.2 k + 2.3k points of Rune.<br />
The other thing is that the Enchanter will drop the aggro immediately, not requiring further or usually any healing after the slow, while the Shaman is going to tank and require heals for as long as it takes the tank to regain the aggro.<br />
<br />
Or it might look more like a shaman with 6k hit points and a chanter with 4.2k hit points and 2.3k points of rune. Either way, it should be clear that a healer will be able to heal a shaman for more than they will be able to heal a chanter. Couple this with a shaman's superior defense and  the ability to Quiessence themselves and you have a rather more survivable character.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not like you can only cast Boggle as a reactive measure. *If* you have to use it as such, the Rune will help you getting off that Boggle immensely. I said Boggle is the better spell for proactive *and* reactive measures. Not clear yet?<br />
<br />
<br />
Just as Quiessence will allow the shaman to get off a root, or live long enough for the tank to taunt the mob away.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree there. I am not sure where you are getting to though. Boggle is still used more often as a proactive measure than it is as reactive measure. Enchanters can use it more reliably for both. Enchanters are not always slowing, but if they have to they have this sweet tool.<br />
<br />
Except that if they have to slow, they can't use Boggle proactively to prevent drawing aggro (in most situations). Using Boggle reactively is less effective than using Concussion proactively which is where your initial comparison falls apart.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
See above. The nature of slowing often demands reactive tactics, whereas nuking does not. <br />
<br />
[quote]<br />
There goes the reading comprehension. Here's what i said:<br />
<br />
 Boggle is used regularly to drop aggro as is concussion. <br />
Both spells are used as preventive measures usually.<br />
<br />
 Regularly and usually are 2 different words. They are used as a reactive measure regularly (because you can't always avoid getting aggro and it's agreat tool to lose it again), but they are usually used as a proactive measure (since everyone prefers to not get hit at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means!&quot;<br />
<br />
From Mirriam-Webster's:<br />

It's fairly clear that your use of the word 'regularly' would pertain to the fourth defintion of the term regular, and thus would be a synonym for 'Normal' or 'Standard'. Clearly if it is 'normal' or 'standard' practice to use the spells in question reactively, they cannoth also 'usually' be used proactively, as both cases imply occurence a majority of the time, and are thus mutually exclusive. If you're going to descend to personal insults, best make sure you're right.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Excuse me guys while I completely kill my DPS / slowing for 5 minutes, I need to eat myself repeatedly and I can't do anything else in the meantime. What do you mean you're grabbing a BST?&quot;<br />
<br />
Our canni needs time and so does pet canni. And with suspended minion he keeps his buffed up. As we can stop canni for slow / heal so a mage can stop pet canni for nukes or get his buffed pet back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mohaha, with the gloves of dark summoning I got last night in VT, an item I've desired for a very long time, I can regen around 240 mana/tick with only my own items/buffs. I parsed two pet canni rounds this morning, going from nearly OOM to FM - the results showed that the pet canni by itself was 210 mana/tick. Without gloves, it's only 150/tick. Add FT 15 and the self-buff XPG for another 6 to that, and it's around 240/tick. I also realized that it's actually possible for a mage to by himself regen 300 mana/tick, needing only two items: Swirling cloak of elements(PoStorms odd rare drop) and Symbol of ancient summoning(Bertoxxolus in PoTime).<br />
<br />
The formula is that when you reclaim, you get 1 mana back per 10 HP of the pet, and the 65 earth pet focused with the PoTime symbol is supposed to have 6.2k HP ungeared/unbuffed. The summoning base cost is 400 - 10% off from SCM 3, 10% off from specialization, 13% off from the average of 25% summoning effiency IV means an average casting cost of 268 mana.<br />
<br />
620 - 268 = 352 ; one pet canni cycle is 7.5 seconds, meaning it's slightly above 280 mana/tick. Add XPG for 6 and FT 15 and you've crossed the 300 mark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u221"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p221">- The general population is like you: clueless. Please keep ignoring the DPS your group gains from BST/Enchanter instead of a shaman in a group, and by adding more DPS you reduce the lifetime of a mob, thus reduce the healing required to keep the tank up. Basic logic &gt; you.<br />
<br />
Not true.<br />
A Shaman depending on the duration of the fights can output more damage than a Beastlord by far.  Shamans can out damage a beastlord both in Burst damage and damage done in long duration fights.  Its only the middle of the two where the Beastlord shines.<br />
<br />
<br />
- A beastlord with equal level of AA and gear has more HP than a shaman. Lack of knowledge of basic game mechanics &gt; you.<br />
<br />
Not true look at the list of magelos provided on this site.<br />
Shamans in the upper levels have more HP and AC than beastlords.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Wow. This deserves a Nobel Price in something. You are a genius. A groundbreaking observation. More DPS means faster mob death. Truly amazing.<br />
<br />
The fact you can't have a normal conversation only hurts your creditability Zorlac.  <br />
<br />
Why don't you tell us, again, about how your conclusive studies found there is no way to prevent over aggro with the use of our dots in a normal day to day fight.<br />
<br />
 <br />
- No, of course not. I mean melee classes just STAND around a mob looking at it and doing nothing. Yeah that's it. <br />
<br />
Then you understand that the beastlord taking the damage from the mob is also taking riposte damage.  If a shaman is taking damage from a mob more than often they don't attack back taking less damage avoiding ripostes.<br />
<br />
 <br />
- While you waste time soloing, a smart shaman is going to get into some XP group getting (1) Much better XP (2) Some nifty loot (3) Adventure points. Again, another groundbreaking observation: shamans solo better than rogues. Pure genius. /golfclap<br />

What are you talking about Smart shaman and Xp grouping?<br />
Zorlac please pay attention that portion of the quote was coming off the subject of soloing.  That is why I mentioned how I solo better than the classes I gave as examples. <br />
Zorlac your pety interruptions of what is being said are sad.<br />
Zorlac if you want to remark on someones post use quote.  At least people then know your not making up things.<br />

I'll give you a cleric bot. Can you duo in Earth as efficient as a beastlord in Earth? Or Fire? Hell no. <br />
<br />
Why do I need a cleric?<br />
<br />
Oh you mean the Beastlord needs the cleric. <br />
<br />
Otherwise a beastlord at the zone line in PoF has to pet kite in that zone without a cleric. LOL<br />

Shamans can continue to do damage while we cannibalize.  Dots can be active, our pet doesn't need to be bagged.  We can even break our canni into chunks - a c4 here, a c4 there, q when needed.  Not to mention we can canni while our primary job function is still being performed (the mob is slowed).<br />

A mage requires at *minimum* (max speed focus) 20 seconds for 1 pet cannibilization.  While they're doing that, they cannot nuke, and their pet is doing no damage.  Their primary function in an xp group is DPS.  While they canni they do zero DPS - except passive DS damage. :P</div></div><hr />

It takes 8.5 seconds(with Quicksummoning 3. 6 second cast to summon the pet + server lag + 2.25 for the spell gems to refresh) for a Mage to regain around 230 mana(with Improved Reclaim Energy) by reclaiming their level 65 Earth pet over and over. <br />
So if they chose to to do damage inbetween they could basically nuke infinitely, which would more than offset the damage lost due to the &quot;suspended pet&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u225"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p225">I think shaman shine is less than ideal groups. LDoN has really reinforced this idea for me. When I am in one of those &quot;crazy&quot; pickup groups that are so common in LDoN, the combination of shaman abilities really shine. <br />
<br />
- high AC/HP to survive bad pulls long enough to do your job<br />
- slow/root/dogdog can turn a bad pull with no CC into a win<br />
- On Demand mana regen is better in a bad situation than mana regen over time<br />
- DoTs can do a LOT of damage if needed<br />
- I am often the only healer after the others go oom in a bad situation<br />
<br />
There are many cases where I have slowed and rooted 4-5 mobs, started canni/stoicism to recover mana and switched over to heal mode once the other healers when OOM; and we have won. Granted, once I go stoic we either win or I am certain to die. <br />
<br />
Other instances the group pulls 3-4 mobs + a LDoN named and then the tank doesn't get on the named. I've slowed/rooted everything, canni'd some mana back, reloaded some dots and basically solo'd the named with root and dots. <br />
<br />
The only class I could think that would be better in a &quot;bad situation&quot; would be necro. They can drop mobs much faster than I can and can survive the agro better than I can. But they can't slow. With my shaman we may lose 1-2 players but with my necro we may lose everyone but the necro (FD rocks) if I can't slow the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u226"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p226">Here is the actual effect of mitigation on slow. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mitigation really distorts the #1 slower Title.<br />
<br />
with no mitigation you got the m= 70, with sd = 4.08 basically this is based on the population of slowings being n = 3 <br />
<br />
that puts shaman at z = 1.22, chanters are z = 0 and beastlords at z= -1.22<br />
<br />
now with mitigation (standard deviation stays the same)<br />
<br />
at 75 percent effectiveness:<br />
<br />
m = 52.5 now the z scores for each are now<br />
shaman: z = .92, enchanter: z = 0 and beastlord z = -.92<br />
<br />
(mitigation to 75 percent lowers the effectiveness of shaman slow by 30 points and raises the effectiveness of beastlord slow by 30 points.)<br />
<br />
at 50 percent effectiveness:<br />
<br />
m = 35, the z scores for each are now<br />
shaman: z = .61, enchanter: z = 0, beastlord: z = -.61 <br />
<br />
(mitigation to 50 percent lowers the effectivness of shaman slow by 61 points and raises the effectsness of beastlord slow by 61 points.)<br />
<br />
at 25 percent effectiveness:<br />
<br />
m = 17.5 the z scores for each are now<br />
shaman: z = .30 enchanter: z = 0 beastlord: z = -.30<br />
<br />
(mitigation to 25 percent lowers the effectiveness of shaman slow by 92 points and increases the effectiveness of beastlord slow by 92 points.) <br />
<br />
Mitigation changes the gap between beastlord chanter and shaman slows which used to be 122 points apart to only 30 points apart. Mitigation greatly diminishes the power of our slow and raises the power of the beastlord slow.<br />
<br />
If you understand statistics youll understand that..this is a dramatic change in effectiveness of shaman slow to other slows<br />
<br />
This is a bad application of statistics if I've ever seen one.  The analysis is also terrible.<br />
<br />
First off, a z-score is a measure of distance (and in which direction) from the mean of a Normal distribution (the bell curve).  A z-score is (value - mean) / standard deviation.<br />
<br />
All mitigation does is change the shape of the bell curve because you're multiplying it by a constant that is less than 1.  As that constant approaches zero, all slows will become equal (at 0).  This effect can be seen without the application of Normal distributions and statistics.  Take the numbers 75, 70 and 65 and multiply them by 0.9, 0.8, ... down to 0 and you'll see they all converge to 0.  Z-scores are meaningless.<br />
<br />
There is no gain in the power of a beastlord's slow with mitigation.  All slowing classes lose power.  For any fight with a duration longer than about 90 seconds, you'll want the best slow on the target, and that slow will always be a shaman's.<br />
<br />
Sony introduced mitigation because they were too lazy to change the standard raid encounter: CH chain + DPS.  They didn't want older encounters to become trivial if they decided to release more powerful slow spells.  It was also too much for them to redesign every raid encounter from Velious on up.  They realized slow was a very powerful spell and before PoP, they made some raid bosses immune to slow.<br />
<br />
Also, our unmitigated slow is very powerful and mitigates a lot of damage.  Look at http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/priest_mitigation.php for a good statistical analysis of priests and you'll see why mitigation was introduced.</div></div><hr />

Their calculations are wrong, they dont include recast times at all.  So w/ recast time figured in their actual mana regen is approx 69 percent of the listed values (7.25 seconds not 5).<br />
<br />
Still 69 percent of 281 mana a tick is waaay higher than I would have expected to see ;x<br />

hehe, after reading your comments a few times, i am still not sure if you disagree or agree or only comment on my points. But never mind. Some of your additions i can agree and i acknowledge the rest as your opinion and the world actually doesn't shatter, if people have different views on a topic  ;) .<br />
<br />
As you asked, i was referring to the humor aspect of Zorlacs 'rogue post' with an actually joking comment.<br />
<br />
For the actual discussion going on, i would personally prefer more focussing on the topic, but /shrug. Maybe it would be a good idea to reduce the arguing and try to get back to discussion or simply drop it? Anyway not my part to judge any poster here, just seems the general tone of some posts isn't healthy for the discussion at hand.<br />
<br />
Jzak,<br />
<br />
sorry, mitigation IS lowering the gap between the different slowing classes.<br />
<br />
Let me try the math (as always open for corrections):<br />
<br />
Let's take for example a 100 dps hitting mob:<br />
<br />
Not mitigating: Shaman slows 75 percent, beastlord 65 percent, shaman prevents 10 dps more than beastlord. In other words when a beastlord is in this group, the healer has to heal 10 dps more opposed to a shaman in group.<br />
<br />
Mitigating 50 percent (let's say fix value for easier calcuations): Shaman slows 37,5 percent, beastlord 32,5 percent -&gt; shaman prevents only 5 dps more than beastlord.<br />
<br />
As you correctly stated, mitigation reduces the 'shape' of possible slow results. Actually in my opinion it reduces the SCALE of that results, directly impacting the absolute numeric difference between the slow results. Granted the relative percentage values stay the same, but what counts for the healer is the RAW absolute number of damage to heal, and the difference of this number between shaman and other slowers decreases with mitigation.<br />
<br />
To give an apple analogy  :D:<br />
When i get 100 apples and my brother gets 50 apples, i get 50 apples = 100 percent more than my brother. Now mommy decides to cut our apple supply in half - i get 50, my brother gets 25 apples. I still get 100 percent more apples, but in total numbers i only get 25 more instead of 50  :( .<br />
<br />
This calculations are admittedly based on 2 assumptions:<br />
1. Mitigation is calculated based on the value of slow as percentage value, not subtracting it (any subtraction of the mitigation value would result in Zero or even negative slow values). So a possible formula would be: dps_after_mitigation = base_dps - (base_dps * slow_percentage * mitigation_percentage).<br />
2. Mitigation is not based on different mitigation tables per class (no evidence for it).<br />
<br />
Edit a small addition:<br />
Most shamans on this board are not very happy with Thott's graphics (i nominate this 'understatement of the year' ...). Search for 'Thott'  reference on this board, if you want to read up the fun and check why the majority (i think it's safe to say) of posters here view his graphs as terribly flawed. I could use other terms but sadly that ain't The Grey  ;) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u231"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p231">This is some of the most high quality flaming I've read in a while, and also some of the most idiotic arguing.<br />
<br />
I agree with most of what Zorlac has said. Slow looks so good on paper that even the Shaman class is too blind to see that it's not everything it's cracked up to be anymore. Our best weapon (dots) are virtually un-useable because of aggro and we're stuck playing wanna-be wizards to do damage; accordingly our realistic DPS has now probably fallen to the lowest of any class. Our healing is so anemic that Paladins are often considered to be better healers. The stat line of buffs has become all but obselete with ridiculous modifiers to stats on items; even pure casters are reaching the stamina cap without much trouble. Our crowd control skills are no better or worse than any class with with root. The only thing we have that hasn't been totally passed off to another class yet is Malo(s). And what's the biggest use of Malos? Ensuring slow sticks.<br />
<br />
Most classes are greater than the sum of their parts. Shaman are not. That said I don't feel we are the most unbalanced class in the game, either. However we're moving that direction more and more with each expansion. The problems with Shamans lie in game mechanics that are unlikely to change, and our most powerful spells are not nearly as powerful as they seem.</div></div><hr />

I do so love the pretty line that shows Shamans can indefinetely heal a tank as long as the mob isn't doing so and so DPS.<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice that almost everything put in the game with PoP is above that DPS line?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something people tend to be forgetting is that unless your group is uber, all shaman buffs add immensely to the dps and capability of the group, especially when an enchanter is not around.<br />
<br />
Plus...<br />
<br />
Our slows make things a lot less stressful for the healers (or ourselves), and if things are really good, maybe even the cleric can provide some dps himself because of our slows.  Our roots and virulent paralysis can provide extra crowd control.<br />
<br />
Our doggy and spiritcall are great personal crowd control/protection, especially when they can enrage, plus they provide some minor free dps as well.<br />
<br />
Our mana regen allows us to use inefficient nukes to aid with the dps as well, be it with tears of saryrn or velium strike with an ornate sceptre/raintraveler's cloak... or whatever.  We can provide extra damage when all the slowing, rooting, and necessary healing is done, and rains don't give as much agro as straight nukes.<br />
<br />
Our malos makes it easier on the nukers and other casters so they don't get resisted or partially resisted.<br />
<br />
(Our radiant cure and blood of nadox will get rid of nasty debuffs/dots.  Our greater remove curse can get rid of horrid curses.<br />
Our shrink gets rid of annoying horse heads or overcrowded dungeon problems.<br />
Plus we can heal really well in many situations in case we're lacking healers.<br />
We have sow.<br />
We have tons of utility)<br />
<br />
If all else fails, there's always rabid bear too ;-P<br />
<br />
Our dps comes not only from our own nukes and dots, but from everything else we contribute to the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u234"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p234">Never mind, I think people addressed this already.  So basically the issue is that if you are in an uber-geared group, shamans are mediocre?<br />

Not true.<br />
A Shaman depending on the duration of the fights can output more damage than a Beastlord by far.  Shamans can out damage a beastlord both in Burst damage and damage done in long duration fights.  Its only the middle of the two where the Beastlord shines.<br />
- Check out FoH boards or The Steel Warrior boards for BST parses. Here is a snippet, since I figure you are too dumb to look up anything:  Kilantiz, our beastlord, was pulling 106 DPS with his melee (unbuffed) and pet (unbuffed, no imbues), this was BEFORE he got his Shinai using Puresteel Wraps and BATTLE FISTS (yes, from Tallon Zek). The monk was doing 134 dps with a SHINAI and a Wraps. . Furor, leader of FoH posted that. Now let me help your retarded brain understand this. A totally unbuffed beastlord with a totally unbuffed pet was doing 106 DPS with average weapons (Elemental God + gimp tier 2 mini God). I won't bother pointing out the obvious how this 106 unbuffed DPS can turn into a metric crapload of more DPS when he has haste, ATK buffs, pet Buffs, pet haste, whatnot. Of course a shaman does more damage by far. Dumbass.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not true look at the list of magelos provided on this site.<br />
Shamans in the upper levels have more HP and AC than beastlords.<br />
- My guildmate. We both have similar level gear, although some might say I have a small edge with augments (nearly 200 HP), his gear: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=118597 . Now check out my profile:  http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28251. You still won't beleive me? Care to explain why me, with slightly better gear, have 500 less HP than this beastlord? Dumbass. <br />
<br />
Why don't you tell us, again, about how your conclusive studies found there is no way to prevent over aggro with the use of our dots in a normal day to day fight.<br />
- You got owned and trying to change subject again? Totally expected.<br />
<br />
Then you understand that the beastlord taking the damage from the mob is also taking riposte damage.  If a shaman is taking damage from a mob more than often they don't attack back taking less damage avoiding ripostes.<br />
- Wow. Another groundbreaking revelation. Mobs riposte. Tanks take damage from riposte. Your &quot;insight&quot; in game mechanics is amazing.<br />

Sadly there was no sarcasm  :rolleyes:<br />

1.  Zorlac your not that beastlord and very few are.  <br />
<br />
2.  Shamans do have a higher burst damage than Beastlords it is simple logic.  Constant high level NUKES &gt; Constant Melee.<br />

You can't take it?  That your beastlords manner of soloing is melee. Inwhich you take more damage sitting infront of a mob than a shaman's method of soloing.<br />

if you cant heal a group - maybe you suck and/or your group due to lack or common agrocontrol... and then just bring another healer ok ?<br />
<br />
if you cant CC, maybe you suck and should bring a enc kk ?<br />
<br />
if you find shamans useless in groups, maybe learn to play your class kk ?<br />
<br />
with a shaman pulling, you can easy root off any adds and start rotting them in a ldon group, and that way you get lots dps out of your dots, and you wont loose any melee dps, who care if you have agro, we have the ac/hp to tank anyways in exp groups... or get a better tank/root agro -- there are some nice clickable root items avilable in poair / vt and ornate legs... ok ;p ?<br />
<br />
hehe - i said that bst have alot lower ac then shamans...<br />
 go look at my guildmate naggek (number 1 in ac serverwide for bst) and compare to my ac - im rughtly 200 ac infront of him...<br />

420+320 = 740/6 = 123.33<br />
Fabulous. The Beastlord was listed as approximately 120 DPS unbuffed. Do you realize the significance of the unbuffed part? A Beastlord in my guild with everyday buyable equipment does 140 self-buffed with his pet. I have no doubt that Time-level Beastlords are capable of 200+ DPS. It's also worth pointing out that this level of damage can be kept up indefinetely, it will never miss a tick, and it is manaless damage. Cannabalize, FT, or AAs or not, you're running out of mana trying to keep that kind of damage up on a mob. Then there are the aggro issues.<br />
<br />
- Enchanter's durability &gt; Shaman's durability -<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1689&amp;source=Test<br />
That's why. This spell gives Enchanters enough effective HP to equal a Shaman, and the Rune part doesn't need to be healed. Then there are the almost instant casting stuns.<br />
<br />
with a shaman pulling, you can easy root off any adds and start rotting them in a ldon group<br />
we have the ac/hp to tank anyways in exp groups<br />

Add haste, ATK buffs, pet haste, and whatnot and that Beastlord will hit 180+ DPS easy. Retard. Now read the sentence again, associate the word &quot;unbuffed&quot; with beastlord and pet.

(2) Cast Ancient Scourge of Bane of Nife<br />
(3) So far you casted 2 DoTs. You are with me? 1 + 1 = 2. Get it?<br />
(4) When those DoTs wear off ... repeat! This is the hard part. You have to actually *gasp* recast those DoTs. <br />

 - so if there is the mobs avilable, -ie more in camp and such - there is enough to hit dots on, we are actually high dps.<br />
<br />
i know that encs do have runes and such- good for them, if they didnet, they would die even faster... but yet 650 less ac, hurt hurt hurt, no matter what you say... and maybe the encs have runes, so what ? we have heals, try self healing as well sometimes, hell - even kite...<br />
<br />
 my point is, if there is alittle chaos with quite a few mobs in camp, the healer dont notice the enc takeing a beating before his health drop, and by that point his rune is far gorne, and all he have left is eldrick rune. (sp)<br />

Cut your HP pool by about 1500 to bring yourself down to an &quot;average&quot; Shaman and try it again. Right now I scratch 5k raid buffed, but admittedly I'm very far behind. I'm spotting you 500 hp on what I have; go ahead, try and tank the stuff in Hard adventures!<br />

Dot Foci brings the DPS to 160ish, assuming full 30% every tick. You're still nowhere near what a Beastlord is. I also reiterate if you miss so much as one tick, your DPS bottoms out. Even counting the pet you aren't even close.<br />
<br />
and in fact we have more then just those two dots... and in fact we can nuke while they tick... and you forget we have a pet aswell heh...<br />
Here is my challenge: show me a log against an Elemental or higher boss where you keep up Blood of Saryrn and Bane continually, casting the first dot less than 20 seconds into the fight, and nuke between dot castings. I'll be patiently waiting. Until then your arguments of damage potential are completely moot, because they are simply not applicable in any real situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u247"><b>Woodoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p247">heh ok!. ill bring a log from next time we do potime!.<br />
<br />
 what mob do you want a log from ?. ofcourse there are mobs like quarm where we dont do dmg, we cure, as well as bertox and so on, so ofcourse we dont dps those fights... <br />
<br />
 but seriously sir... haveing a war useing DBOTW - it take a decent skill to steal agro if your not trying.<br />
<br />
 noone wanna load 3 poison dots along with the others, thats just asking for agro. but ill show you my logs from next potime cleaning, maybe that would make you change your mind:).<br />
<br />
and btw - i never said anything about the avarage shaman, i was talking about what gear was avilable to the shaman class, you wanna equal out stuff, if we talk about a avarage shaman, we do compare to a avarage enc or beastlord i hope ?.<br />
ofcourse gear makes life alot easyer, and its a totally diffrent playing style from when you optain some gear - if you take the TA, rightclick turgurs are simply too godlike compared to a non TA'ed shaman, in exp groups and therelike.<br />
no mana on slows, hey i know its not much - but it will add up... give you time to root and rott adds. as well with the non recast on it, thats seriously allmighty, and i really hope one day everyone will get to wear that spear proudly :).<br />
<br />
im around 8300 hps buffed atm and 1835 ac, and i do can tank hard advs :(. not with me being the only healer, but with any druid or clerics its fine.<br />
<br />
 and 6 shamans ldon groups are the best btw! :D you should all try it sometime!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u248"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p248">Your post makes nosense whatsoever, Woodoo.<br />
<br />
I usually would point out different parts of your posts that add absolutely no value to the discussion, but it would be useless. Take your eyes off your Magelo for a second and try thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u249"><b>Woodoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p249">heh, i was haveing a conversation with aselus... read my posts again for them to make sense ?<br />
<br />
all i stated was that shamans do have alot higher ac items avilable to them - that means they can tank better... that was the issue that some ppl dident belive :P. try catch my point before makeing such statement ?.<br />
<br />
i was pointing out that shamans can tank in exp groups, as someone stated was impossible...<br />
<br />
i was pointing out that aselus statement was very wrong reguarding bst dps compared to shaman dps.<br />
<br />
and im gonna fix a log for me to prove it... hell - he play a shaman too, he should know better ?</div></div><hr />

Your going to have a heart attack if you keep taking things so personally. I'd recommend a long holiday, preferably somewhere nice and sunny.<br />
<br />
Then come back and re-read your posts, methinks you would be quite surprised at your tone.</div></div><hr />
