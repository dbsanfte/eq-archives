<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks.<br />
<br />
Someone made a comment in another thread and I thought I would ask the quesiton here.<br />
<br />
I was in the Arena last night as a 51st level Shaman.  I was the only one there, and doing the slows.<br />
<br />
I had fair to moderate success landing slows, even on things that were red to me.  (Chanter was tashing a tad late, but whats a troll to do?).<br />
<br />
Mostly, I had an extreme camera angle, would assist off the main tank, and slow when Tash was called.<br />
<br />
The question is: Does proximity affect the chance to slow?  Should have been between their legs and casting instead of hanging back just inside cast range?<br />
<br />
Or is it only applicable to dragon mobs, etc?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In Kael, on the ones you can slow, Proximity is not a factor on the giants (i.e. usually talking about w/in melee range).<br />
<br />
&quot;Or is it only applicable to dragon mobs, etc? &quot;<br />
<br />
No it applies to others as well you just have to learn which ones they are. For example the Fire giants in Sol B you have to be in Melee range to slow them.<br />
<br />
It is all part of learning the game :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Generally its good practice to get close up and personal regardless to avoid your raid having to play ping pong if mobs start making beelines for you. Nothing annoys those silly melee more than having to run about after stuff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you ever fight cubes, I believe you have to stand inside of them for anything to land.  I have also found that I just generally have better luck if I stand right up next to something to slow.  Probably just a coincidence, though.  As seredith said, always get real close so that it doesnt chase you around if you take aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am not sure 100% - but I believe as long as you're in melee range (i.e you hit autoattack and you (*gasp*) missed instead of the you are too far away message) your resist rate will be the same as if you were standing under the mob.<br />
<br />
Personally I prefer to just jump over everyone and stand inside the mob so it doesn't ping pong... after all I'm just gonna get summoned in there anyway :p</div></div><hr />
