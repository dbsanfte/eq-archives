<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TrollKrunsh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya ppl,<br />
<br />
Im a new Shaman, and new to this Forum as well. I was wondering if the experienced Shamans, could give me a few tips on how to arrange my spell book, and is it possible to make some short cuts or something like that ???<br />
<br />
<br />
Thx alot for ur help guys<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can make hotkeys with the command /book &lt;page number&gt; (eg /book 1) to go straigh to a page in your spell book<br />
<br />
I organise mine then by type.<br />
<br />
1-2 Buffs,<br />
2-3 Heals/resists<br />
4-5 Offensive spells<br />
6-7 Misc (Canni, Gate, Summon Dog, Shrink etc)<br />
8-9 Misc (Summon food, drink, pouches, EB, Lev etc)<br />
10-11 Group buffs<br />
12-13 Twink buffs<br />
<br />
Then got a gap to page 20 and have all the spells I dont used any more from there onwards organised by level.<br />
<br />
Hotkey bank 2 is used to get to all my spell pages.<br />
<br />
Edit: Need to re-organise my spell book but am waiting for the new interface so that I can have more spells on a page :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Everyone probably has their own way of doing this; this is how I have my own arranged:<br />
<br />
As a spell becomes obsolete I move it to the back pages of my spell book.<br />
<br />
Pg 1-2:   Heals and Regens (Cannibalize kept here also next to regen as these 2 spells share the same slot)<br />
<br />
Pg5-6:   Shields and Resists<br />
<br />
Pg 9-10: Buffs (STR, DEX, AGI, HEALTH, FURY, etc)<br />
<br />
Pg 13-14: Damage spells (Nukes and Dots)<br />
<br />
Pg 17-18: Divinination spells and other utility spells<br />
<br />
Pg 21-21:  Divinination spells and other utility spells<br />
<br />
Pg 24-25: Misc<br />
<br />
To create a hotkey to these you would do the following:<br />
<br />
R/click on one of the SOCIALS buttons and name it say HEALS; in line 1 put /book 1<br />
<br />
R/click on one of the SOCIALS buttons and name it say SHIELDS; in line 1 put /book 5<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I organize my spellbook based primarily on what I swap in and out the most often, and secondarily based on having lesser used spells more page flips away from where my book always opens.<br />
<br />
So, my SPELLS hotkey is /book 3; that way I have 4 pages within a single flip, rather than the 2 I'd have if my book always opened on the first page. That &quot;home base&quot; page has the typical buffs I'll be using, and the spells that usually occupy my swap slot (my poison spell, and a lesser slow spell).<br />
<br />
One flip backwards gets me to most of the spells I want to memorize after I die, or other spells I want to have in a hurry when needed, like gate, invisibility, and cure poison/disease.<br />
<br />
One flip forwards from the home base gets me to my bread and butter combat spells--my most often used damage spells and debuffs.<br />
<br />
Another flip forward is for more specialized combat spells--the extra poison dots I'll sometimes use, or voice of the berserker which I reserve for soloing.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, it becomes a bit more haphazard; I try to keep &quot;travel&quot; spells in the same area, f'rinstance, but the lesser-used spells have organically found homes that are further away from home base the less often I find use for them. <br />
<br />
I don't have extra hotkeys made, because it's just as easy for me to type /book 10 to get to resistance buffs as to hunt down a hotkey in an out-of-the-way place.<br />
<br />
I hope that's of some use.</div></div><hr />
