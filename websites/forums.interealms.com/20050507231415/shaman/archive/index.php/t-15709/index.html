<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've gotten an SK up to 58 in order to duo some interesting places.  I know exp dies off gradually, but I'm getting pretty tired of the same old places (tier 1).  I was wondering if you knowledgable shaman have any tips on where to hunt in order to prevent burnout while i grind to 60 and above.  While loot is always welcome, Exp is what I'm most after (I have no problem farming for pp once he hits 65)<br />
<br />
My shaman is 65 with 103 AA, so he's pretty much set.  So far I've been keeping him grouped so he can grind a couple of AA while the SK lvls up.  I know it would be faster playing the SK solo, but to be honest, I'm working on QB3 right now, and this seems like the best way to keep from going insane while I save up the 9 AA.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help/suggestions.<br />
<br />
p.s. I have used search...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try CoD. Sk should be able to handle the mobs there, can single pull with fd and hold agro while ya slow. Should be alot better than tier 1 xp and loot wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a 65 Shaman with 100+ aa you should be able to tank anything in tier one and chew it up.  I was leveling my necro the other day in PoD lcy.  Just dot the hell out of it and watch it die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well if all you are looking for is variety try some of these places:<br />
<br />
Crypt of Nadox - all the undead trolls and luggalds are dark blue at 65, and you'll find a lot of gems and some pretty cool items on the named mobs when they spawn.<br />
<br />
Hate's Fury - whole zone is dark blue at 65, still good gem drops but itemization wasnt as impressive to me.<br />
<br />
Veksar - havent hunted there a great deal, but most of it was dark blue once you got into the golems and beyond. <br />
<br />
Pocket zones - Halls of Betrayal and Mines of Solusek (or whatever it's called) are both good exp and I know HoB has good loot and spells. SolC probably pretty much the same way.<br />
<br />
Droga/Nurga - more good exp and mobs here probably have less hps than Nadox or Hate's Fury, and there is a cool sword there that I plan to get for my warrior (sword of the bloodsworn).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would go to Droga.  The xp is pretty nice, and even just a duo can crawl around pretty easily.  A few nice names that are easy to pick off for some easy selling loot, up to 25pp per mob in coin... Nice.<br />
<br />
Just be sure to have reasonable resists.  The caster mobs in there love to root, debuff, nuke and dot.  Even the wizards by the FM zone in can nuke for 700+.  On a multi pull that can suck. :)</div></div><hr />
