<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I always thought this looked nice:<br />

<br />
Of  course, all the quests are a pain in the ass and require multiple trip.  Each boss drops *one* quest item, 13 classes...you do the math.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most plane of sky quest pieces absolutely blow for the amount of work needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I plan to get the mantle and crimson ring of desinence soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just hope for the best on turn-ins to quest mobs.  I had all the components for the shawl eaten and a GM later explained that they can't do anything about PoA quest mobs. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Were you absolutely sure you summoned the right POA quest mob? There is a shaman quest guy with all the other class quest guys, and then you have the option to ask the shaman quest guy for two different shaman quest mobs, each responsible for different quests.<br />
<br />
So, there are actually three shaman quest mobs in Sky and you have to know which one you need!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yup, right mob, right stuff, no dice.  The freeti guy can become 2 different quest givers and the one that had the correct text was a barby if I recall right.  Only thing I can figure is that I was lagged and mebe that had some effect.  <br />
<br />
Too bad the GM was not a little more understanding, but &quot;that is the policy in these situations&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The key to the Plane of Air should now disappear when the character leaves the plane <br />
<br />
I assume they mean all the keys.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yep, that sucked.  Had 4 Sky keys in the bank, they just went 'poof'.  Being able to keep the keys made the damn place possible.  Thought that was a great change, figures it was a bug. ;p<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm LP for the shoulder quest item, the one that drops from the Spiroc Lord of course.   Have one item for the Ring.  But those are the two I'd like as well.<br />
<br />
Anyone actually still have a Stein of Flowing Ichor still around?  If they wanted to make a useless item be useful, they might have put some Focus effect on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">is there any detailed info out there on the crimson ring of desinence quest? alakazams has nothing(pretty much) /cry<br />
i am wanting to get started on this quest, and need a walk-through(or something spoiler-like) so i can start planning!<br />
thank you in advance for any additional info on this quest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hate to break it to you, there is no way to &quot;plan&quot; on getting that ring unless you're in a group that's ready to clear Sky multiple times.  <br />
<br />
IIRC the three drops are:<br />
<br />
* Spiroc feather - Island 5<br />
* Bixie essence - Island 6<br />
* A ring from the Sister of the Spire - Island 7<br />
<br />
Remember, the sister only drops one quest component at a time and there are 14 classes (not sure if BLs have any sky quests now or not).  So, yes, you could get incredibly lucky, or you could be like me, I've had the spiroc feather in the bank for over a year and have cleared Sky multiple times (farming Mage crowns) and have NEVER seen the other two pieces.<br />
<br />
There is no way to &quot;do&quot; any of the Sky quests, you have to be in the right place at the right time and be able to win a random (if you're guild does randoms) over several other interested parties.<br />
<br />
Sky is NOT fun!  Your guild will probably go for necro cloaks and ranger globes and warrior blades and mage crowns, but after clearing it a few times, they aren't going to want to go just for &quot;fun&quot; or the chance of completing a hellishly rare upper island quest.  It's long, boring, bringing more than 24 people is incredibly time consuming and cost prohibitive.<br />
<br />
Bleh, Sky.   Rusty daggers, indeed.</div></div><hr />
