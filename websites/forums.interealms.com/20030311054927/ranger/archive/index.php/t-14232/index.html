Got a small question. I remember hunting spirocs in Timorous Deep with my wizard in the low to mid 40s. But since they have hit me so rare, I have no idea if they would be doable for a well equipped 45 ranger (Magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=65430).<br />
<br />
Has anyone of you done this before? Are they good exp? <br />
<br />
Oh, and I am always open to suggestions where else I can hunt. I prefer solo most times though.</div></div><hr />

And usually old world mobs are much easier to fight (although they give a bit less exp, but actually I can tank a lot of them).</div></div><hr />
