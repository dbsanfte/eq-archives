This was one of the most abmitious patches I can remember. 500 people playing on Test are never gonna find all the bugs and little loopys that happen when it goes live for 100K people at once. They pushed it back once, to push it back again would have inevitably led to a large number of &quot;Incompetent SOE programmers&quot; threads. Proverbial Rock and Hard Place, thats for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Umm Blazz, do they actually push the patch to test first?  Because there are some blatantly OBVIOUS bugs, et al, that unless you are blind (and that begs the question of how you play the game) you would catch.<br />
<br />
As much as it pains me to admit - DAOC had a MUCH better system.  And a LOT fewer people on their test server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not gonna disagree Faern, I think what happens is they prioritize the de-bugging, and when they get to a certain point, they go for it. Sure, some known bugs hit the live servers, but lets face it, TRUE player-testing is done more on the live servers than the Test server. We have known this since day 1, heh.<br />
<br />
So, while some glaring bugs do slip through, how many are REALLY REALLY horribly affecting game play. Inconvienant, yes. But once live, other things can be found, stuff that really DOES affect more than how big a pet is or whether CoH brings the pets along or not, etc etc. Honestly, I am not trying to defend them too much here, but SOE is really damned if they do and damned if the dont. Given those choices, they tend to pick &quot;put it out, fix the old known bugs while waiting for new ones to pop up, then re-patch&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You say that like it hasn't been happening since the game went live.  This has been a player complaint for five years.  If you've been playing any amount of time you'll know that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Some of the bugs should have been caught before this went live, but the real problem is the lack of people on test.<br />
<br />
Sony should give people ano option to clone their char onto the test server so that people can check out the new feature with their char before they go live. This would give tow benefits, firstly that bugs will get spotted, and secondly it give people the chance to say wait this &quot;fix&quot; is not enough etc.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet that some of these bugs were found by the guys on test and /bugged, but the dev's considedered them to be insufficant to pull the patch from going live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">First time I ever zoned into test (can't remember how far back, been playin since beta IV and it all meshes together in my memory) there were two people on the entire server.  The other guy was AFK.  I was a scared little gnome starin at a million Kobolds fresh from the camps.  Haven't logged on since.<br />
<br />
But seriously, ever since the first Item wipe on Test, I've just plain scoffed at choosing Test as a home.  It takes SOOOO long to get a good inventory and skill list built up in EQ, and you get attached to it.  Knowing it can be wiped at any moment is not reassuring.<br />
<br />
They should make the Test Server playable for a lower monthly fee, like 5 bucks or something.  Heck make it free for a month for people who want to test the game... oh wait, they're already doing that with regular servers.  Heck I dunno, but do something!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
the real problem is that all the testers quit.  they got sick of sony bull**** and left.  from experience, there's usually a pecking order of intelligence/ingenuity among players and it's usually something like guys who are interested in testing and uber guild leaders at the top.  a lot of the testers wised up and left some time before the uber guilds did<br />
<br />
back when I used to play on test quite a bit, you'd /bug all manner of things like corpses poofing, dead end quests, ad nasuem and you'd see the exact same **** published to live.  not like I'm uber_tester_007, I used to log on mainly to check out cool new stuff before it got published but I did have a lvl 50 toon way way way back in the day.<br />
<br />
and unlike what blazz or other clueless might mouth off about, sony has its reputation for a reason, it's not a matter of shoes for the foot or whatever that means.  roll a char on test and see what it's about<br />
<br />
and yeah, a patch followed by 3 or 4 consecutive days of downtime really isn't doesn't rate very high on the due diligence scale nor is it very good business.<br />
<br />
blazz or whoever is correct that if sony pushed the last patch, then the next one then the next one back then people would bitch about that too.  but that's understandable.  there's a limited amount of goodwill a company has, once its run it into the ground time and again like sony has then people are very unforgiving about screwups<br />
<br />
look at Mythic.  it's not the best company but it's professional.  they've often pushed back key publishes like housing, revamped AA etc and nary a peep from their customers.  that's because they trust that they do this for a reason.  with EQ you'd probably have a pushed-back date for a patch and STILL have tons of downtime afterwards (wait, that just HAPPENED)<br />
<br />
but that's SONY.  &lt;3 sony.  &lt;hugs&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Knowing it can be wiped at any moment is not reassuring.<br />
<br />
Test was wiped once, ttbomk, over three years ago.  That's it.<br />
<br />
Over on the Xev boards an anonymous poster gave a detailed and scathing indictment of the Test server.  Cliquish to the extreme was one point.<br />
<br />
Another is this - Test DOES go up and down a lot.  Now, what happens to named MOBs when this (server re-set) happens?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I agree; the Test server should have a higher population.  Ever since item wiping was ended it has become just a slightly different ruleset server and not the testbed that it was intended to be.  The people that are there do try, and I appreciate them, but there are simply not enough people to be able to adequately test ALL the changes that go live and test them over and over for consistancy.<br />
<br />
I have long thought that Sony could select people from live servers to help augment the low population of Test to assist in...testing.  Now, if they get cloned versions of their current character or a /betabuffed character wouldnt really matter a whole lot; the important aspect is getting 4 or 5 thousand people testing something before it goes live.  Getting a population that is there simply for testing and that does not have other interests in the server.  For the people that play regularly on Test have other interests; they want to get to the next trial and get the next mob drop.  They are trying to progress like everyone on the Production servers.  <br />
<br />
I think there is a point where 'testing new stuff&quot; conflicts with &quot;playing EQ&quot; on the Test server.   New changes might be played with when they are implemented, but for how long?  During 30 minutes of non raid time before the next trial run?  Or exhaustivly untill no more bugs can be found with the test items?  <br />
<br />
This is not intended as a slam to the people on the Test server, but as a simple question of the workings of the server.  I've spent time on Test.  Ive tried to level characters to use in assisting in testing but its next to imposible.  Why?  There are a few hundred 65's in raiding guilds and a few hundred /testbuffed 25's.  Other than that the server seems to be empty.<br />
<br />
/shrug  Ive gotten used to the fact that Live servers do about 85% of the testing.  What annoys me is when bugs are introduced and allowed to continue for 2 or 3 months and become accepted and then &quot;nerfed&quot;.  That bothers me more than anything else, because more often than not the &quot;bug&quot; was beneficial and its removal seems punitive to me.  Perhaps Im taking it a bit to personally though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know.  But you can read their terms, and it says they <br />
<br />
RESERVE THE RIGHT<br />
<br />
to wipe the server at any time.<br />
<br />
Just because it only happened that one time doesn't mean it won't happen again.  I said knowing that it CAN be wiped, not WILL be wiped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bopes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Honestly, these latest patch changes are worth it.  Abit of downtime and afew patches is worth having my pet zone along with me, and being able to see how long my buffs last (not to mention the other fixes).<br />
<br />
I think they are on the right track and we can expect some more nice changes in the near future, as they now realize they have to try and hold onto their player base the best they can.  It works for me, I'll keep playing till I'm sick of it and / or till everyone I know quits.<br />
<br />
But yeah.  Patches suck.  They'll always be there, just like a rainy day.  Just gotta wait for the storm to pass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You dont happen to have a link to that do you?  I think that might be interesting reading.  And the server IS cliquish.  Any questions asked in /ooc are met with immediate outcrys of &quot;/occ return to your own server proddie, this is ours&quot; and simmilar such nonsense.  Its no wonder that more people dont want to play there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I really don't have that big a problem with them testing on the live servers. I understand that Test is a much smaller player base. I can even understand that there are problems they push out knowing that its a bug and people are going to die from it. <br />
<br />
What I *DO* have a problem with is the complete lack of concern on their part when someone who has been a customer for 4+ years dies to this bug and he does a /petition and the guide, gm, whatever shows up (2 - 3 hours later) and says 'I can't rezz you, I can't rebuff you, I can't restore the XP lost because you had to pay someone to rezz you and you lost 4%'. <br />
<br />
When you have issues then you put together a team of guides or GM's or whomever to restore those people who die to your bug to where they were before they died. Not having enough people online to do this, them not having sufficient responsibility to allow this to happen easily is the huge problem. <br />
<br />
In the real world lawyers make a TON of money getting companies to restore people not only to where they were before the incident but get them compensation for pain and trouble. I am not suggesting we get compensation (although it is within reason). I *AM* suggesting that when we get damaged by their bugs that they fix us back to where we were in a reasonably short time. And not give us GRIEF about it.</div></div><hr />

Hmm sounds familiar. DAOC :)  You can clone to test to play with just about anything. They also actively enroll betatesters to do the expansions. They are not perfect (ToA sucked) but they blow the pants off of SOE. In the end I decided I was sick of PvP when I prefer PvE :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">In the midst of all this patching, we had perhaps the funniest thing ever.  Last night, doing emporer ssraeszha(sp?).  Got our cc crew all ready, assigned targets, etc, we were raring to go.  Enter his room, ranger pulls blood and co, punches ws..... nothing.   Woops.<br />
Our cc crew didn't have quite as much time as expected to pickup their targets and blood was killed before the cc crew had things totally under control.  Emp spawns, wipeola.  Our paladins' lay hands didn't work either.  One warrior complained that defensive didn't activate either.<br />
But the funny part... Here we're sitting at zone in, getting corpses summoned, and the gm message pops on our screen.  You know the one, to the effect of &quot;we apologize for screwing up aa's&quot;.  I can just imagine every single one of us falling out of our seats laughing, its what I did :D</div></div><hr />

SC and ASC would be a lot more desirable to me if they left the functionality where you can use either one(but on the same timer).  3 pets for max DPS, 5 pets for positioning,  I like that kind of utility.

They changed this yesterday.  If you create a hotkey for your PoP ability Spirit Call it will read &quot;Spirit Call&quot;.  Then go in and create a hotkey for your Gates Advanced Spirit Call and it will read &quot;Advanced Spirit Call&quot;.  So, they both have the same timer, but you can decide what one you use in the situation.  Biggest thing for me was to remember to change my old position one to the advanced form.  It took me about three casts before I remembered that they changed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As it is annoying having a patch that ends up having a series of more afterwards to fix what should have been working the first time around, I'd rather have them keep patching than wait 1-2 months to fix it that can be done the next day or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Karamil_Barr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">also a big problem on test is thier attitude.. I do play on test regularly.. have my shaman on main servers and found test as a nice place to start alts of other classes and get away from the rush rush rush of the main servers ..<br />
<br />
 But unfortunatly test is very ... how should i say ....unwelcoming to anyone who is not already from test server ...<br />
<br />
 Sit in pok on ANY day that the main servers are down ... and you will find about 40 or so /testbuffs... granted some people will just /testbuff and start trouble but for the most part people think that test server is just like other servers ...<br />
<br />
 Did you know that selling buffs in Pok on test is the easiest and quickest way to get perma flamed ...<br />
<br />
  Did you know if you even think about using the /shout channel you will be hounded by the regulars on test...<br />
<br />
 Did you know that if you (god forbid) you get in trouble or wanted to (gasp) explore and get killed in a very bad area .. that  none of the regulars on test will lift a finger to help no matter how polite you are if you are under level 45 .. <br />
<br />
 on test once you get past level 32 or 33 your grouping days are over till your mid 50's .. anyone in your range (for the most part) between 30 and 50 are alts of test regulars and being PL'd and dont wish for company....<br />
<br />
 Anyone who uses the /lfg tool is automatically deemed a &quot;proddie&quot; (thier term fer people who play on live servers)..<br />
<br />
<br />
 Overall if you want to just solo and make your own way test is a great server .. dont ever have to worry about contested spawns  or someone running over your camp or training you.. its got the low population ..  but its silly that the people who play and use test as thier main server will be on thier board ( test registry or something like that) complaining that they need new blood and that the server is dying ... while at the same time making any new player feel very very unwelcome ..<br />
<br />
 Playing on test  Pre 50 is very frustrating .... there are a few good people on there but a good bunch of them are .. as i like to call them ..&quot;testholes&quot;...<br />
 <br />
<br />
 and with thier current attitude i dont think even if sony offered test server for free would many people want to play there .... if sony would want test server to have a higher population the first thing they would have to do is try to get the test regulars to welcome the new people .. not drive them away ..<br />
<br />
<br />
 and if any of the &quot;testholes&quot; are reading this .. test is not your personal server .. it is everyone's ..  so get over your holier than thou attitude ....<br />
<br />
 (like i said earlier not all the regulars on test are like that .. i have met a good bunch of people so far but more than likely anyone who logs onto test will not be welcomed but ridiculed simply because you used /testbuff ..)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played on test for 2 years.  Have a 44 monk and 57 shaman, before starting over on Terris.<br />
<br />
Yes... Test was item-wiped exactly one time, 6/10/2000.  This was the result of a particular guild getting and keeping &quot;test-buffed&quot; type items and keeping them.  I don't believe there has been anything like that since then.  My main reason for playing on Test was smaller server crowds.  That was it.  I admit I didn't test anything, unless you call logging in and noticing that every character shows up as level 1 or something, testing.  I was sick of playing on Bristlebane as a level 8 warrior and having 50 newbs attacking the first skunk or bat that spawned outside of Kaladim, hehe, that wasn't fun.<br />
<br />
I think a large part of the population on Test has the same reasons for being there.  Smaller server population, less competition for spawns, and the added bonus of seeing bugs before everyone else does.  Also, get to farm the hell out of mobs that spawn on server resets.  We used to do Venril Sathir in KC every freakin' night, til everyone had Kunark pants.  The penalty?  Yes, Test tends to come down a lot, during prime playing hours.  Although, live servers after patch days are just as bad :P. <br />
<br />
And yes, my experience from playing on Test was that it was the most elitist pompous group of people you could ever find.  We (myself included) would ridicule the &quot;proddies&quot; if they dared to log on to Test, like if you played on Test you knew everything.  See for yourself the reactions you get if you log on there when live servers are down.  Also, if you weren't in the in-crowd it was hard to do anything or get anything and the situation has become worse since PoP, due to flagging, etc.  There are a couple guilds or guild associations that are elitist and run the shows there.<br />
<br />
But anyway, the players do little testing, they just might notice some bugs if it happens to directly effect their game play.  But part of the problem is also SOE.  Look at SWG too.  I was in beta and saw all the bugs that were pointed out over and over - and guess what... when June 26th came about, game went live, bugs and all.  Some are still there I'm sure.  SOE cares about the money and will meet deadlines, bugs or no.  Pushing back a patch for more testing was a noble effort, but apparently a fruitless one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">They changed this yesterday.  If you create a hotkey for your PoP ability Spirit Call it will read &quot;Spirit Call&quot;.  Then go in and create a hotkey for your Gates Advanced Spirit Call and it will read &quot;Advanced Spirit Call&quot;.  So, they both have the same timer, but you can decide what one you use in the situation.  Biggest thing for me was to remember to change my old position one to the advanced form.  It took me about three casts before I remembered that they changed it.<br />
Right, but has it been said for certain that this is the correct behavor or it will it be &quot;fixed&quot; in the future?  I was wondering if they had perhaps changed it again with today's patch.</div></div><hr />
