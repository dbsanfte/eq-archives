<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The new shared bank slot makes eq alot better I can twink a new char.. or give stuff to my mule. THe problem I have is my mule gets all the money and my main is stuck.. I am unguilded I play at odd hours so finding a bud to transfer plat is tuff. I was thinking if a certain gem or stackable item had a near cost price. I should probably get my lazy self and check out the vendors. Maybe someone here knows of such a good item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hyllus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go to the bazaar and buy diamonds for 190ish plat from people selling them resell price to merchant is like 180-190p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They just added the ability to transfer pp in a 'shared' account yesterday on Test.  Still being worked on (the patch was super buggy, spells were hitting for 0 damage, buffs didn't do anything unless you recast them) -- so I'm not sure what it looked like post-patchfixes (went to bed).<br />
<br />
But... I'm assuming next prod patch y'all will be able to transfer pp between chars on same account like we can on Test now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Awesome.  Transfer plat will be a big help.<br />
<br />
I think what most people are doing is buying gems from vendors and reselling them at a slight loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">checked it out over lunch.<br />
<br />
Can only transfer PP -- no options for gp, sp, cp. ;)<br />
<br />
The new box appears right below the two shared slots, so there shouldn't be any confusion with which account you're in.<br />
<br />
Not sure if there is a max -- we play on Test, so don't have a lot of coin (what we get immediately get's invested in tradeskills) but it looks like it would hold at least 10,000 pp -- maybe more.  After it goes prod one of you rich folks can figure out just what the max is.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well even if it is a limited amount its just more time consuming, take the cash from shared, put in yours, relog mule, etc /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
For people who would be interested in transferring money between accounts, who even keeps GP, SP, or CP? After I convert to plat I delete GP, SP, and GP.<br />
<br />
Will be yet another nice addition to EQ though, someone at SoE is finally getting a clue on how to make the game more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />
