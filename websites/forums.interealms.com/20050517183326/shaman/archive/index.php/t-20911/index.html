Please let me know if you have any luck with them since targeting has been so hosed lately....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grumpf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i am just happy that they put this in as a new feature, and didnt replace something like the switching of he last 2 targets.<br />
pretty nice for slowing ganged up piles of mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">100% agreed.<br />
<br />
This has to be one of the best features added yet.<br />
<br />
Makes cycling through multiple mobs for debuffs/assist heals very easy.<br />
<br />
The only thing I have found is you have to have the mob in sight, either from 3rd person view or first person view to cycle to the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The sad thing is that one of the last things requiring skill has been the targeting for quite some time now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, this is so true. Sorting through 60+ people when there are 5 mobs there, and your the only shaman, trying to Malos-Slow them all, it was actually tricky to run around, get close enough to F8 (usually mouse clicking was impossible) and move to the next. <br />
<br />
While I am all in favor of these types of features, the whole thing just keeps getting more and more Playstationesque. Just waiting for the &quot;Run, Jump, hit button, Jump back, platforms raising and lowering, gotta get to the top and Ring the Bell&quot; puzzles to show up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure that trying to click on individual mobs inside a mass of mobs is what I would call skill.  Frustrating, annoying, irritating - yes to all of those...but no to it being a &quot;skill.&quot;  The fact that 5 mobs can occupy the same space is more of a bug then a &quot;game challenge&quot; in my opinion.  This feature just fixes an existing problem in the game.<br />
<br />
By the way, and thanks SoE for this feature!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sorry, but I have been used to strafe/f8/mouse(you'd get the feeling for what worked best in any situation) target for a long time.

<br />
I said it's sad that this kind of issues were something where a player could make a difference still. I wish there were more sensible aspects of the game that allowed that instead of just being the sum of your items.<br />
<br />
When they removed the insta spell gem refresh through clickies they removed a bug(I'll call it a feature since it was a 3 year old bug). I am positive that the practice and skill I had &quot;exploiting&quot; that bug made a difference between me and the next Shaman regardless of what gear he had and I liked it that way. <br />
<br />
Anything wrong with that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm...maybe I misstated my position a bit.  (no personal attack was intended)<br />
<br />
Yes, using f8 and a mouse for targetting was difficult and challenging (and, yes, I can do it fairly well), but I don't think it was difficult in a way that made the game more realistic or fun (at least for me.)  In real life, if there are 10 people in a room and I want to throw a pen at 5 of them (believe me...I'd like to do that in some meetings I go to  :p ), it's easy for me to select a target and throw.  <br />
<br />
But, in the game - before the patch - selecting these 5 targets could be extremely difficult due to targetting issues with f8, lag, collision issues, etc.  It was difficult, it was challenging, but it was also very frustrating  and it wasn't something I considered a good addition to gameplay.  I'd put it along the same lines as the old boats.  (from when EQ first came out)<br />
<br />
Everyone is going to like/dislike different things, and in this case it sounds like something you like is something I dislike.  <br />
<br />
Also, don't get me wrong...I like to be challenged and I really hate easy camps or easy raid targets.  My main is a warrior and I usually pull in xp groups.  If the group is good I don't hesitate to pull 2 or 3 (or 6  :cool: ) mobs to keep things exciting.  I like to ride the line between success and failure.  It just happens that I didn't care for this one particular feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, you're right. I have heard much praise for the players with l33t targetting skillz. Most times I was invited into a group it was because I was known to have high skill in targetting. That's what proved my worth as a well played shaman or dimed out who was Ebayed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, right.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't know about you, but I'll take any way where I can find and actually target the ghost type mobs in places like Uqua.  I really do like this place cause of the difficulty, but making it so that I can't target them is just frustrating at times.  When they are stacked on top of each other, and in a crowded environment and F8 or mass clicking won't get them on target just irks me at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, targetting is a skill, when you are able to use the mouse to target a player or mob, but with GoD, using the mouse just doesn't work in many places.<br />
<br />
I consider myself to be quite adept using the mouse to target with, but when you hit an area with those translucent elves, it just isn't reliable, and as someone else noted... 4-6 of them stacked on top of one another pretty much negates any skill you may have.<br />
<br />
I won't use the target cycling all the time, but I do know I will be using it in certain areas/zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Part and parcell of what made a good Enchanter (and Shaman) was the ability to lock down large pulls.  One key to this was the ability to: a) not panic, b) quickly mez or root those that needed it and slow / mez the rest.<br />
<br />
Up until the DX9 patch (or thereabouts) I had no problems in many zones shutting down large to extremely large pulls. From 9 in old Cazic to lots in Seb (thanks Dazzle) to 7 in a normal LDON. (Delayed Aggro)<br />
<br />
With the DX9 &quot;upgrade&quot; I couldn't do that, heck I couldn't target something standing right next to me unless I used F8 and GOOD LUCK on a large pull.<br />
<br />
Yes, this was needed, but it was needed because Sony, in their infinite wisdom, added and screwed up the existing paradigm.<br />
<br />
And yes, the &quot;cure&quot; to the clicky effect (which I never used but people thought I did - toot toot) and the &quot;spell re-fresh&quot; was not needed. <br />
<br />
Among the Enchanter community, you get a rep as one who can CC or one who, in plain English - sucks. The same for healer / slower in the Shaman community.  This &quot;fix&quot; while needed (see above) merely lowers the bar to being a better Enchanter / Shaman. Sadly, I have a feeling that many who in the past &quot;sucked&quot; will continue to suck.<br />
<br />
(So yes O'toole, there was something to targetting, only it wasn't called that - continue to strap hang onto raids)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You guys are amazing... can you do anything but complain?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Faern, get a grip man. Perhaps the strap should be for you?<br />
<br />
A well played shaman or enchanter were considered WELL PLAYED because they were attentive and managed to do their jobs quickly, effectively, and efficiently. Period. No matter WHAT BRAND of targetting skillz they used, it was the fact that they acted quickly AND wisely not their particular targetting style that got them noticed.<br />
<br />
How many times did you ever get asked, &quot;Geez, Faern, how do you TARGET so quickly?&quot; <br />
<br />
I would ask Giac the very same question because it was his comment that I quoted about one of the &quot;last things&quot; in this game requiring any skill was targetting. PUHLEESE!<br />
<br />
For the love of sweet Jesus, people, anyone with working appendages (natural or prosthetic) can find a way to target something and do that well. Doing your tasks quickly, and understanding HOW those tasks effect the environment of the encounter is far more skillful than targetting.<br />
<br />
I can be the FASTEST, LEETEST, most &quot;skilled&quot; targetter in EQ history and still be an azzwipe of a shaman or enchanter because I don't know how to manage aggro, run around like an idiot because the big bad mob summoned me, don't know how to multitask, and don't know what my spells are capable of doing to fit a raid's/group's needs. <br />
<br />
If I'm a hardcore soloer, no one will be the wiser anyway.  :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You didn't know that doing the Konami™ code with Mort the banker targetted gives you infinite plat? :D<br />
<br />
For my part, yay to another ripped-off FFXI feature! I will only use it when it's needed (Hail, a_DX9_2D_object_bug), cause after all these years of shamaning, I (like most of you) target in my sleep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Actually my Enchanter has been praised from level 20 -&gt; 65. For CC. Dismiss it all you want - targetting quickly and correctly is a function of CC.<br />

<br />
I find myself doing mostly old style click &amp; move, but the cycling is very handy indeed.<br />
<br />
Now if I could just loot things after I kill them.  It's still a clickfest to get the dang body targeted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Dismiss it all you want - targetting quickly and correctly is a function of CC.<br />
<br />
It is a function of CC, granted. However that is not the &quot;last bastion&quot; of skill in EQ (akin to Giac's comment). It's not even close. Target quickly all you like. Cast the &quot;wrong&quot; (read: not optimal) spell and your l33t targetting skillz just hurt your group, not helped them.<br />
<br />
For the record - &quot;Strap Hangers&quot; is an Airborne term. It is not a compliment.<br />
<br />
Yeah, Faern, I got that part... I wasn't complimenting you either in my mentioning of a strap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Targeting has been broken as hell since the DX9 upgrade.  That is why this is a good thing to have.  I can target like the next guy, it has just been recently that I have been hating it. <br />
<br />
Another point is since you can target nearest NPC or cycle through your group anyways, why they never put this in ages ago is retarded.  The targeting key functions have been so limited forever.  As long as you get the job done, no one is going to complain how you did it. <br />
<br />
Why even waste time ranting about a good implementation??</div></div><hr />

its prolly me being blonde :p  but could you possibly explain it a lil better? i cant make it work and none of the other posts seem to explain how to do it... Thanks  :)</div></div><hr />

(a.) alt-o (options) (b.) keyboard tab (c.) category - target (d.) left click with your mouse - cycle through nearest npcs, under the keypress column (e.) now press the key you want associated with targeting npcs (f.) close options and go use it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Skill in targeting is a very valuable skill, as is skill in most things.  I do agree though, that mob stacking and some targeting bugs created very annoying situations sometimes.  Hopefully these new functions will help us work around that.<br />
<br />
Be Well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Guess I should check out this new feature. Sounds like it might make the job easier. I'm a bit hesitant to change styles, I still have never used targeting rings. This ability to cycle thru targets sounds like it may be very useful in certain situations though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Damman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'm failing to see how anyone considers this a bad change. I fell in love with it on my first 6 pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I am baffled by any complaints as well. It basically helps with targeting in situations where geometry or MOB stacking previously made precise targeting hard (moving and using F8) or impossible (stacked MOBs).<br />
<br />
Sure, it will also help some people who are not quite as fast with the mouse as me, removing a tiny amount of skill from the game. At the same time it inserts skill into an area where before the change you basically had to F8 and hope for the best. Net loss in skill needed to perform at peak efficiency? None. Net gain in comfort? Lots.<br />
<br />
Sounds good to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I can say it's made me better at doing my job, it's also made things easier for me.  If you don't use this feature, you're a lesser shaman.</div></div><hr />
