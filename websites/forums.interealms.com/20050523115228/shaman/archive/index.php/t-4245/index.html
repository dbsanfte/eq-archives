<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bodabag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone tell me if all regen items stack with our regen spells?  (Which do/don't?)  Was thinking of looking for a regen BP but if all it's going to do is save me a temporary spell slot, then might not be worth it yet.<br />
<br />
Also, how do we change our face now with the new UI?  I'm using the Ice Blue one from this board so maybe the option was removed, but I haven't seen the face button since the new UI came out.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) Yes, all regen items stack with regen spells.  For example, fungi tunic stacks with regrowth stacks with bear form stacks with bard song.   The only thing I can think of that doesn't, is the fungi staff from the Spore King in OS, it no longer stacks with regrowth.<br />
<br />
2) You can change your face with the /facepick command</div></div><hr />
