I tanked a named in WoS the other day just after our tank went LD but there was a drood and cleric spam healing me :)<br />
Hmm if you died in WoS its very rare there will be a see invis mob there unless SH is up or someones pulled the Guardian out.<br />
But i must admit that the OoW zones are very boring layed out as if no thought went into them.<br />
Is it just me or is mob variety sorely lacking recently as in gfx wise gives maybe 3 or so models in OoW.<br />

<br />
That's what makes the game fun, to me, is knowing if you slip ONCE, your group is done for. The tension that creates can be exhilarating.<br />
<br />
As for CR'ing with a see-invis mob near your corpse ... the vast majority of mobs in WOS do not see invis, unless you were (as posted above) dealing with ShadowHunter or some other named (Velitorkin does not see invis). <br />
<br />
And for those that play in god mode cause they are fully equiped in PoTime or better equip and 300+aa's dont go saying how easy it is to off tank adds cause it isnt for normal shamans.<br />
<br />
I broke 5k HP unbuffed recently (buff out to right around 8k), and have 291 AA ... hardly &quot;god mode.&quot; Never seen Time, and I can off tank WOS adds if necessary. Normally I just debuff and VP them and forget they're there, but if I'm feeling adventurous I can tank, no problems. Healing isn't hard, either. <br />
<br />
As was said above, WOS is best done 65+ ... but you're 65 you said, so post us a Magelo and some detail as to the problems you had, and perhaps we can offer some advice to help you keep it from happening again.<br />

LOL, my equip sucks thats the prob. And yes with 5k unbuffed your in god mode compared to me ie normal shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your complaint seems weird to me. You are saying you want to grind experience in a zone that tolerates mistakes on your part and where your gear is sufficient.<br />
<br />
Why Wall of Slaughter then? At 65 with bazaar gear it is probably quite challenging and 65 seems to be the lower end for grouping there from the level range I see in that zone. Try out Noble's Causeway or some of the instanced zones in Dranic's scar or the likes. Instanced zones would also have the advantage of not having to deal with CR, although I can not say I have found many see invis MOBs in OoW at all.<br />
<br />
As for not being able to take on a half dead MOB I have no clue how you could fail to take it on, unless it was a named. With a shaman, cleric and necromancer you have root times 3, two healers, slow (I assume this was in already), multiple pets, stuns, DoTs and resist debuffs at your disposal. It seems to me that killing an already debuffed half dead MOB would be trivial, if perhaps not all that mana efficient.<br />
<br />
Overall OoW is certainly easier then PoP was when it came out, far far far easier. I can understand complaints about OoW when people cite not enough zones, similar MOBs, no new design ideas and the likes as reasons.<br />
<br />
Complaints about how hard MOBs hit (no worse then in GoD), how hard CR is (very easy compared to almost any other expansion), how one add will wipe you (it is quite easy to get singles only in most of OoW) and how hard to kill individual MOBs are for casters (resists are way lower then in GoD) however I have a hard time understanding.<br />
<br />
Just judging from your complaints it seems like you went from normal LDoN adventures straight to OoW. If that is the case everything will indeed seem incredibly hard. You will have to get used to not being able to tank everything yourself if need be. You will have to get used to heal early, to root, to control your aggro and to pull carefully and possibly to time repops.<br />
<br />
If you have previously been playing in GoD however I seriously do not know what you are complaining about because every single bit you mention is better/easier in GoD then it was in GoD (and in PoP when taking into account level 60 and Luclin gear).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">How long were you away? Getting close to 5k unbuffed isn't that hard these days, there's been extreme mudflation of gear. I think you are mistaking &quot;god&quot; gear with &quot;been playing straight through PoP, GoD and now OoW and gathering gear through both exping (BoT and Sol Ro for ornate) and through bazaar buys, then augmenting the pieces with 40HP augments from LDoN.&quot;<br />

<br />
It's all relative. Tordail isn't poorly equiped that for sure but I'd still consider him a fairly average geared player. He's got a couple nice atunable peices from OoW. A bracer from tipted and a ring from Ikkinz but nothing that I would consider really raid gear.<br />
<br />
Since you where gone for a while i'd guess it's more of just being low level for the zone and behind on gear and aa's and being below average really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">http://www.eqrankings.com/<br />
sort by shaman, all servers, HP, all levels and then click on page 1.<br />
that is what i would consider &quot;god&quot; gear, not to be confused sololy with GoD gear. if you want  you can sort by AA, the first 50 or so double (or more) my AA count.<br />
<br />
there are some &quot;god&quot; profiles.  One can almost baz 5k raw hp in gear now...at least 4k, which still puts one over 7k buffed makeing one more than able to tank WoS slowed trash mobs.<br />
<br />
i realize you were gone for a long time, but i think before you start ranting perhaps it would be better to ask questions, reflect, try new ways of doing things, and possably look for &quot;new&quot; (to you) gear upgrades.  posting a magelo in the gear section will most likely help...<br />
<br />
yes, the task system is crap....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LOL, my equip sucks thats the prob.<br />
<br />
That's probably half the problem right there. Make a post in the Equipment forums with your Magelo linked and see what kind of suggestions you get. And ... 5k unbuffed is pretty run-of-the mill nowadays, especially if you're paying attention to the gear choices you're making. I am at the top of the class in my guild, but hardly &quot;god mode.&quot;<br />
<br />
Level 65 is on the low end of WOS, as Murtak said, but a well-geared 65'er can handle it, IMO. His suggestions were right on, however; if you're having problems in WOS, try Noble's Causeway. That might be easier, and you can pick up some sporty gear (ie. FT shield). Dranik's Hollows are good, too. Plenty of threads on the boards; do some research and see what you come up with.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Also which AA's you have is really key, alot of the flashy oh wow ones don't actually help.  No one congratulates you as you survive tanking a mob from 80% on down in PG cause the tank died early, they congratulate the cleric for keeping you alive even though he wouldn't have been able to if you didn't have your defensive AA's done.<br />
<br />
HP's don't mean JACK if you can't keep them.<br />
<br />
Critical hits on Nukes, worthless, Critical ticks from DoT's, detrimental.  If it doesn't help you survive the encounter you can wait on it.  <br />
<br />
Nearing 300 aa's and doing alright on hps for haveing just a touch of elemental and god gear, mainly LDoN and early pop gear so I might hit your idea of a GoD profile, but the amount of gear I have from raids I can count on the fingers of one of my old shop teachers hand.</div></div><hr />

But you have to admit that its goten FAR easier with OoW loots dropping so abundently. Even LDoN hard drops, like Boots of the Mystic, are down in a reasonalbe 3-5K range. Lvl 70 LDoN &quot;normals&quot; drop that stuff now, I saw a no-drop range item with 85/100 hp/mana on it the other day. <br />
<br />
Getting gear is like anything, it takes time and work. Making cash isnt difficult. Go into Crystal Caverns and pick up a ton of Velium. Learn a tradeskill thats cheap like Baking or Brewing, and make Misty Thickets (all but one item vendor purchaseable, and even that item is cheap and common) and Kaladim Constitutionals (pick the shrooms in Kaladim, rest is vendor purchasable). Heck farm Spider Silks in EK for an hour, or clear out Sol A for FS, or any number of other opptions. Any lvl 65 playing this game can make a few K pp an hour without breaking a sweat.<br />
<br />
As far as OoW goes, people pretty much already made all the comments that needed making. Personally, I think its a gravy expansion, but I styill enjoy it very much. There is progression available for every style of player, from casual non-raiders, to hard-core raiders, and everything inbetween (hard-core non-raiders, for example, have Quarm level loot available in the PG single-group trials). But I agree overall that you may have jumped in too far. To put it into PoP terms, you basically went to BoT at lvl 61. Of course its hard, and you cant handle the mobs one-v-one. But once you hit 63ish (67-68 for OoW) you can take a few pops off a BoT Giant (WoS feran or whatever). You should think about dropping back to the PoV-PoS level of OoW, which is Nobles, Bloodfields, Harbringers, DS instances, etc.</div></div><hr />

it is easy to make PP without Ebay.  there are dozens and dozens of threads on this board ranging from how casual players can make plat to how high end players can make plat...being a casual player, it may take you a week to make the cash to buy a piece of gear where as someone who plays more often could buy it sooner.  Isn't that part of the fun of the game, you can progress at your own speed?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Also, you have to be a savvy shopper. I probably spend like four nights a year in trader mode. A friend quit for EQ2 and gave me a Citrine (+3 DS aug) that he won in an OoW group. So I spent the night in trader mode. I got 50K for the aug and 10k for something else that had been taking up bank space forever. Also, I normally only check for the droppable OoW quest items, since I was under the impression that there really weren't any droppable upgrades for me any more. But on a lark, with 60k in the bank, I searched for Shaman-usable +HP items, and I got a +90 HP Earring of Holy Ferver for 8k (replaced +55 HP ear).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">. Even LDoN hard drops, like Boots of the Mystic, are down in a reasonalbe 3-5K range. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm this phenomenon hasnt hit the BB server yet these still go for 20-30k.<br />
Must admit though i love the easy availabilty of gear upgrades for me due to OoW.<br />
Ive upped my HP by just over 900 and now sit just slightly over 4k unbuffed since OoW came out through OoW drops (yes stuff ive looted not brought) and a couple of LDoN items and could up it more if i were to spend the plat.<br />
<br />
I hate to say this as ive often been on the other end of this sort of thing.<br />
But you're a shaman if youve got Canni 5 (if youre hunting in WoS cant understand why you wouldnt have it) and Q then you can survive in any group.<br />
Yes you wont be able to offtank etc but how many Shaman can nowadays.<br />
If you and a necro couldnt take down a halfdead piece of yard trash (your quote) then im sorry but I dont know *** you were doing.<br />
<br />
Also patience is a big thing.If you want the drops from OoW and cant afford to buy them then WAIT for them to drop for you.<br />
Theres a Earring drops in NC 95hp etc clr/shm/dru.You realise how many times that drops and how often ive seen it gravyd as ive got one that i won earlier and often so has cleric etc.<br />
Yes you may have to lose on a few rolls for stuff but if youre that badly equipped and hunting with decent people you'll get plenty of upgrades NBG'd to you.<br />
Also a lot of the good (well good to me but not to upper end players) stuff in OoW sells ridiculously cheaply as its so common.<br />
Sounds to me like you died in your 1st ever group in WoS and decided that it was **** etc.<br />
A final thing all i can say is its a damn good job you didnt come back for GoD and try a trial as your reintroduction to EQ :).<br />

I got a good laugh reading the above paragraph. Nobody said getting 4-5k HP was casual or simple, to my recollection. It takes work. Twenty runs through Tipt for that damn bracer made for the longest week of my life. I've never purchased plat -- I've farmed spider silks and sold off some droppable LDON upgrades and sold some items I've won in WOS/NC groups. Farming cash IS easy ... sheesh, go to Velks and kill some named. SCHW still go for 3-4k on my server. Everything Blazz mentioned above, not to mention farming HQ/MQ pelts in East Karana. Farming plat is easily done by the &quot;casual&quot; person. People act like acquiring plat is a horribly hard thing to do, and it's not. Honestly, I've never had more than 50kpp on me at any one time ... bazaar farming just isn't my thing. Besides, it doesn't take plat to get 4-5k HP anymore. Remember LDON? Items STILL drop pretty frequently in OOW zones, too. Upgrades are relatively easy to be had, even for &quot;casual&quot; folks. Patience, as Wulfbane said.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hmm this phenomenon hasnt hit the BB server yet these still go for 20-30k.<br />
Honestly Wulf, it coulda been a fluke, not sure if thats a &quot;regular&quot; thing, I just remember it striking me seeing someone auctioning a pair of these boots for 3500 pp the other night, since I had been doing LDoN hards for a friend a long time ago to try and get her some, since they were in the 80K range in those days. I am not a bazaar &quot;regular&quot; by any means, although I have been spending more and more time there recently, converting my OoW drops into pp for buying Runes for myself and my friends. <br />
<br />
I think the true secret to making steady, solid cash in EQ is in the consumables though. Food and drink, and TS items. I remember doing the Signet of the Arcane quest, I would virtually wipe out some peoples supply of many TS items I needed for the skill ups. Stuff thats a pain to farm like Arctic hides, Acrylia (I since found out some better spots for that though, bah, coulda saved a FORTUNE with a few invested farming hours) etc. These days, I also find myself stopping by the bazaar daily to get supplies for my pet, since I can usually cast him once and keep him for the entire session I am on (love the new invis thing). Couple new mage weapons on our 67 pet and hes actually a pretty reasonable source of sustained DPS in XP groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Post magelo and I'm sure you'll get some good advice on how to benefit from oow.<br />
In terms of rvr there has never been an expansion better than this for the casual gamer.<br />
Personally I've never made so much plat or made so much decent gear from my tradeskills for such little effort.<br />
Seriously this expansion is money/loot for jam. <br />
As an example I've yet to fail on a single bazu chain armor combine, which when compared to the difficulty and pain of farwater chain is just insane.<br />
I've also found the shaman spells and aa to be significant after you wade thru the useless spells like the rest of the casters.<br />
