<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not the only one having this problem, but it appears that since the latest patch when I have EQ loaded I'm running at 99% CPU usage and generally sitting at 1-3% packet loss, sometimes jumping all the way up to 99-100% in player intense zones like PoK and Bazaar.<br />
<br />
I asked both in /gu and in /ooc and other people reported the same problem. I'm just trying to figure out how widespread this is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Happening to me also, ever since the fix patch after LoY. Have tried turning off all luclin models, turning off texture cache and re-running patch...<br />
<br />
Still having massive packet loss in PoK, bazaar, SH and nexus. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah since the new patch i noticed that im laggy in alot of places where i never was before. they sure did something, and i hope they go back and fix whatever it was.</div></div><hr />
