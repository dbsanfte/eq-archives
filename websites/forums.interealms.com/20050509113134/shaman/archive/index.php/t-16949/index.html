<br />
When you die and logoff the account and dont login with another character. Does the rezz timer still count down on you corpse?<br />
<br />
If your corpse is out of rezz time. can you still rezz it, but without any exp regain? So you can get too your corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">a) the 3 hour timer for an exp rez is an ACCOUNT timer.  so logging to another character, or even logging into the chat server will use that time up.  If you are not logged into the account at all, the timer is not counting down.<br />
<br />
b) The second timer is a 7 Day timer - it counts down even when you are logged off.  I am *reasonably sure* that you can get a rez for no exp during that time.  After 7 days the body rots.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone else can confirm or correct my post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can confirm that the corpse rots in 7 days (or less).  I spent a week playing an alt and came back to discover my bridle was missing.  Then I remembered leaving it on my corpse for rezzing later, as we were in a dungeon at the time... good thing it was a cheap horse!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well stupidity has it own reward. Thought the corpse timer didnt tick while you where offline. Lost my all my equipment on my alt. bye bye 100kpp.<br />
<br />
Some lessons hurts too learn......well no need to cry over a few pixel<br />
<br />
 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Area</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd petition it cant hurt to try, GM's can check your last ingame save and see you havnt been on. Worth a try at least.<br />
<br />
Think saves are held for 3 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd petition it cant hurt to try, GM's can check your last ingame save and see you havnt been on. Worth a try at least.<br />

Hail,<br />
<br />
I would also recommend trying a respectful petition.<br />
Explain clearly that it was your misunderstanding &amp; your mistake, and that if it is at all possible you would very much appreciate either a rollback to previous save or simply recovery of your lost items.<br />
<br />
I have had excellent luck with this approach on more than one occasion.<br />
A long time ago I inadvertently destroyed a critical part of the Prayer Shawl Quest, and after a few days I was able to get it returned.<br />
<br />
More recently (like last week), I accidentally lost my range slot item, the Brain of Cazic Thule, because I left it in a collapsible toolbox that I <br />
purposefully destroyed.  That was retrieved the same day after a lengthy wait for a GM (Guide responded within ~15 min though!) &amp; a brief investigation.<br />
<br />
If you have the time/date/last known location of your alt's body, that will help your request, as that helps narrow down the searching the GM has to perform in order to verify that you aren't trying to scam them.<br />
<br />
Also, while not relavent to your specific situation, if you make a mistake (such as vendor selling something invaluable in error), use the /report function ON YOURSELF to show the lines of text that will prove your case.  A friend of mine inadvertantly sold a weapon worth about 20kpp on the open market to a vendor for 11pp and change. :eek:   He included a report showing the vendor purchase text and mentioned the report in his petition.  It took some time, but he was able to retrieve the weapon (he had to pay the same amount the vendor paid him, lol) using this method.<br />
<br />
The old days of online CSR never ever doing anything to help the players are mostly over.  It always helps if you can clearly &amp; succinctly state your case (w/o cursing or whining) in your petition as well as having the supporting data that will help them help you.<br />
<br />
Remember, a Guide is powerless to help you in this type of situation, and that's who you are going to run into first.  Politely explain the situation in greater detail (since your petition is word length limited) and then request the Guide add any missing pertinent details &amp; ask him/her to  bump your petition to the GM queue.  Thank the Guide for their time &amp; response.  Also, if the Guide doesn't let you know, specifically ask the operating hours for GM service on your server, as this can vary.<br />
Normally the GM specific server coverage will be for a specific 8 hour time period, and then there will be another 8 hour period of cross-server coverage where the 'floater' GM's hop around helping the most dire petition cases (which unfortunately yours is not).<br />
<br />
It may take a few days or even a few weeks, but it can't hurt to try (as long as you are polite) and if you recover your gear it will definitely be worth it.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps &amp; best of luck to you. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can't imagine why a GM &quot;wouldn't&quot; replace his stuff ... I mean he obviously didn't MEAN for his corpse to rot.<br />
<br />
I read something one time that in a huge lag spike a guy accidentally gave his Epic to his pet. The GM would not replace the Epic because he gave it away or some such crap. Come on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">...but epics are ND?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can give no drop items to pets its just they wont use them. One time a friend handed in the last piece for the BoT flag to a wizard familiar because it got in the way and GMs didn't do anything about it :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ouch Armak, nasty. Petition it online, I'll remind you next time I log on mate :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another question on this topic, are you sure that the rez timer does not tick when you are off of the account ?<br />
<br />
Last week I was in a group in BoT and took a dive, 5 seconds after PoK loaded my computer crashed, and i wasn't able to log back in, kept giving me errors, so i stopped trying. Then later that night ( 5 -7 hours later ) I came back, and the rez timer was gone, I couldn't even get a rez to get there, had to run. So again, are you sure about the timer not working when off of the account ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The timer definitely stops when you are offline.  Was your error 1018?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">yeah thats the one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think after the 3 hours is up, the corpse can't be rezzed at all.  I think it gives message like &quot;This corpse is too old to ressurect&quot; and the cleric can't cast on it.  Not too sure on that though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">IIRC, a 1018 happens when you're still showing in the world for some reason. If you were 1018 for 3 hours (I know it lasts for what seems like forever sometimes but not had a 3-hour one myself yet ;)), then the timer would have run out. And yes, after 3 hours you get a msg that the corpse is too old to be resurrected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">...but epics are ND?<br />
<br />
Havent you ever done a quest? Pets are npcs - you give no drop items to npc's all the time.</div></div><hr />

How to avoid stupid n00b tricks<br />
<br />
1) Don't go afk while under water<br />
2) Don't go afk at a zone line in a zone with aggressive mobs<br />
3) Don't go afk while zoning into or standing in a space that has limited room (you make other players mad)<br />
4) Don't bind yourself near any point that MIGHT have an aggro mob later<br />
5) If you are bound in a place where you have recently lost faction, bind somewhere else fast<br />
6) Beware falling from Kelethin trees<br />
7) Make sure you have plenty of daylight left before crossing Kithicor Forest<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are plenty of other n00b lessons we've all learned the hard way...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">And, of course, the ever-popular:<br />
<br />
Make sure you hit enter before starting to talk to an npc. I dont think there is anyone in the game that hasnt done the 'Wha-' *Gank!*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This time, it was not only my fault. My warrior where left in Arry pit in NToV after last guildraid. I checked with the guild raiding NToV at the moment (2 weeks after our raid, wanted my warrior out of there)if i could get a TL out.<br />
They say its okey and that the Arry pit is clear, but i should hurry, since it could repop soon.<br />
<br />
I ask what side in NToV they are -they answer the right side.<br />
<br />
I log in, sure Arry pit is free - phwee, now i just have to run up the right side. Straight into a butterfly. I manage to get back too arry pit too die.<br />
<br />
I tell the guild thats raiding that the right side had full spawn. They answer, upps meant left side. They didnt have time to go back and rezz me, and i werent in zone for CoH and Corpse summon. So i log out the account, <br />
<br />
thinking the corpse timer wont tick &lt;-- thats the noob mistake and the hard learned lesson...and ofcourse never trust that people can distinguish between left and right  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Will try too petition today</div></div><hr />
