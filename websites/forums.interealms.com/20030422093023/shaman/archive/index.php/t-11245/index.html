<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been trying to determine the relative merits of the different Haste potions, of which there are four.  I just wanted to know how each compared, exactly what each did, since I do occasionally sell these from my merchant on Test.<br />
<br />
Anyway I know the data from lucy is derived from Test data and they're apparently changing a lot of things around, but here's my confusion:<br />
<br />
Vial of Untamed Mercury  Effect is supposed to be &quot;Flurry Quickness&quot; but my potions right now just show &quot;Flurry&quot; as does the info at lucy:<br />
<br />
Increase Attack Speed by 11% (L1) to 40% (L30)<br />
Duration: 1.2 mins @L1 to 5.0 mins @L20<br />
<br />
Adrenaline Tap  Also lists effect as Flurry.  Harder and more expensive to make than Untamed Mercury, and if their effects are the same, what's the point?<br />
<br />
Assailing  Effect Assailing:<br />
<br />
Increase Attack speed by 30% (L1) to 51% (L65)<br />
Increase Strength (STR) by 15 (L1) to 79 (L65)<br />
Increase Agility (AGI) by 15 (L1) to 79 (L65)  <br />
Duration: 20 ticks (2 minutes) <br />
<br />
Graveyard Dust  Effect: Graveyard Dust:<br />
<br />
Attack Speed unknown calc: 120 range: 70 -&gt; 0 <br />
STR unknown calc: 108 range: 28 -&gt; 0 <br />
AGI unknown calc: 108 range: 28 -&gt; 0 <br />
Duration: 1.8 mins<br />
<br />
We weren't sure how to interpret this, a friend thought this worked out to 70%-134% haste but that sounds awfully high.  But  it seems like it might be a higher haste than the others...?<br />
<br />
Anyone else have info/comments?  They seem to be playing around with some spells on Test, maybe that's why the first two potions have the same effect now?</div></div><hr />
