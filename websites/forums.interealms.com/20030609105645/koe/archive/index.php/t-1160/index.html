<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Estrosiath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking for three pristine emeralds, as they are needed for a quest for magicians in Thurgadin. They apparently drop off mobs of the 45-55 range in approximatively all of Velious. And it would seem that they are NOT nodrop. So, if anyone finds one, and doens't need it, or is nice enough to think about giving it to me, it would be more than appreciated.<br />

Thanks a lot,<br />

<br />
We are gathering all the gems we get to distribute once people need them (ie. once they have the needed faction and the other component for the quest), Aaeamdar has a mule for this exact purpose.</div></div><hr />
