<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Time for Mr. Scaley guy and I've got one group to do it with:<br />
58 BST, 60 cleric, 60 chanter, 57 shammy, 60 rogue, 60 druid.<br />
<br />
I've gathered he's an SK so a rune or two on the tank (bst) and me (shammy) would be good.  Other than that, is he like most epic mobs and totally MR?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">he wasnt totaly MR if i remeber right , we took 2 groups and beat the snot out of him . it was harder getting to him , then actualy doing him.<br />
<br />
camp a  rouge at entrance is all i have to say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is that so you can look good while killing him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've got two halflings perma-camped in The Hole. :)  Rescutte and Rescuelle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kirn's not totally MR - I've done him 3 or 4 times and managed to slow him every time.<br />
<br />
Litgruv is right - getting to him is the hard part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">kirn is a pushover...did him with 3 people<br />
me, 58 monk(Hipp), and a 60th cleric(abel)<br />
all my spells landed no problem, hardest part is getitng there.<br />
850 point HT, and he never hit for over 150, i cant believe people complain about him lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Boy, I'll say he's a push over!  We had 2 people playing 6 chars.  First we went via the waterfall, but for some reason, my cleric splatted on the ground and missed the water...  Why didn't I think to DA?  <br />
<br />
Second time down we went down the tunnel.  Getting through that last level of city is tough because of the aggro and pathing.  But once you get to the undead tower, it's a cake walk.   Enchanter runed us all because I was paranoid and even my I survived the battle.<br />
<br />
Next is Neh and Rak with the same group probably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Horen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">this is about hte easiest part of hte quest.  hardest part is a getting a group.  We got to him in just under 45 min. Pulled with slow and a Ce on me and I never went under 1/2 life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">sad if you could get to him solol. you could solo him =P</div></div><hr />
