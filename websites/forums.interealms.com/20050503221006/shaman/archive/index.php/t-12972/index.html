<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cythilix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all,<br />
I had quit playing EQ (I thought for real, then) about 9 months ago, deleting my only character a  51 iksar shaman on FV in the process and gave his stuff away.<br />
<br />
Well I´m back now, and after playing a bard, beastlord, mage, necro  and SK to teens I realized that I really want to be a shaman again. The GMs can´t revive my old shaman so I´ll start from scratch.<br />
<br />
I play EQ for the &quot;journey&quot; and not necessarily the end game. The problem is, I don´t want to go through a similar experience and here I need your suggestions... <br />
<br />
What´s one race / play strategy that would be very different to a casting heavy iksar shaman? I was thinking an ogre &quot;battle shaman&quot; (if they really exist) perhaps but open to any other suggestions as well.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Cyth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cythilix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh and one more thing:<br />
<br />
How viable would toe to toe combat be for a soloing ogre shaman? And more importantly, what weapons skills for the best damage? Should I go piercing all the way or try to get a good 2HB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You will never really be a great melee after 15 but I to have been thinking about making an Ogre twink.<br />
<br />
The part I liked is a slightly better chance of casting due to no stun frontal.<br />
<br />
Ogre would be a fun change.... and JBBable.<br />
<br />
Get a good shield and a great cheap 1hb... there are tons of them.<br />
<br />
Also try to keep those others skills up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You will never really be a great melee after 15<br />
While its true you'll never come close to the melee damage output of melee classes, you can (and should) have the hp/ac to tank mobs you're fighting.  The benefits of prioritizing hp/ac over wisdom have been gone over ad nauseum in this forum so I'll stop right here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I do the battle shaman thing with my Vah Shir.  I'm now 51 and other than having trouble finding a good hunting spot that's not permacamped am still doing fine.<br />
<br />
Ogres and trolls would be better for the fighting shaman than any other race.  Higher starting STA means more HP at low levels and the regen/unstunnabilty are useful.<br />
<br />
You won't be an MT for a group but you can solo dark blues pretty easily.<br />
<br />
As for equipment it would depend on your wallet.  There are a lot of topics here on &quot;How do I equip my new shaman?.&quot;  If you can afford a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang that wil take you to the planes, otherwise a good 2HB is the way to go.  Better ratios for far less money than you will get from piercers or 1HB.  I personally recommend keeping all your skill up though.  Much better to do it now than later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well I melee a whole lot with my barbar shaman ... and I have piercing and 2hb maxed (1hp to 135) I use 2hb but then I have the barbarian spiritist hammer which procs winters roar (same a jbb) often (with self buffs)  but that is barbar only</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Battle shamans are still an option..maybe more so nowadays since everyone has adopted the hps before wisdom philosophy. I was a battle shaman all the way through 50th level, and still some after Kunark came out (had to learn my piercing). I dont tank nowadays (got 4 level 58 wolves to do that for me), but I dont run when a mob comes a knockin' either.<br />
<br />
Piercing with haste (if you have a decent spear) would probably net you better damage than 2h blunt, but it all depends on the ratio really. Some 2h blunts would probably outdamage a piercer. I maxed both skills. The main drawback to 2h blunt is you'd be hard-pressed to find any weapon that could make up for the stats you'd lose from a nice shield in your other hand. There are some nice 1h blunts out there also, so that's of course an option too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Steelbear on the 2hb thing.  Those generally have a better damage to delay ratio than piercers.  Class selection is still tough.  Iksars are totally cool for the regen, and the AC bonus!  End game stuff, they can wear anything an Ogre could.  Ogres are darn cool because they can't be stunned, but certainly interupted.<br />
I suppose if it were up to me, I would pick the Ogre or Troll.  JBB helps.  I would probably go for the Troll if I were just doing it for fun just so I could use that snare necklace!  I think the effect stops taking effect on really high level mobs though.  I'm not totally certain.  Or they tend to move pretty fast with the snare on.  Really cloudy recollection here.  Troll<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IMO best race for a shaman (I'm a barb) is Ogre all the way.. hps/wis in the end it's all the same... but unstunnability means you can go to ct entrance root 1 guy slow the other (2 guards at gate).. then slow the first one still rooted, then if health is low cast a heal spell w/o worrying about interruptions (leaning against the wall).. my biggest concern when I solo is if I can root the mob go away and heal myself before root breaks and he interrupts me, with ogres you can just stand there.. also jbb is a lot more effective solo if you are constantly doing the 30dps instead of every other time if that..<br />
<br />
In pop if you die most likely it's because you got stunned..</div></div><hr />

Hi!<br />
<br />
If I can be an Warbard as an Tree Elf then you can be an Warshaman. Just remember your limits.<br />
