Still grinding lvls with no aa's.........................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congratulations Finny!!  It's all downhill from ding 60.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't worry, 60 totally flies by, though you'll hit molasses at 61.  I recommend grinding out Canni V at that point, but what do I know?<br />
<br />
60 is a great level if only for the nostalgia of our state of balance in the Kunark era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Id say get to 62 before you grind out Canni5.  AA's are a little faster in BoT and you have a chance at some ornate drops.  And all you have to do is battle the boredom that comes with BoT. (The last time I was there was over 6 months ago and I dont miss it a bit)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">GRATZ!  be prepared for LOTS of....'can i get an FoS?' :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Numgrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gratz to you. Hitting 60 is a big accomplishment  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grats, like they've said, it's a lot easier from here on out.<br />
<br />
GRATZ!  be prepared for LOTS of....'can i get an FoS?' :p<br />
Actually, get ready to have to explain to every melee in the game how your single-target version does the same thing as the group one, and they shouldn't feel slighted. If I get asked just one time more a week than I already am, I'm making a hotkey for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Finnyous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ive read that the mobs in bot will be very difficult to slow at 62.  Pov exp is sick 2.5 aa per kill or 1 reg exp per kill at 60. Last night i made my first aa for the hell of it then went back to reg exp and almost dinged.  So still debating on what to do.  I really want my new dog dog so i many just lvl to 61 then grind it out?!?!?--thanks guys for the replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">PoV exp is nothing compared to BoT.<br />
<br />
Sticking Slow in BoT is easy . . . Malo . . . Turgur . . . done.  If you don't have Malo, perhaps you will have some problems sticking Slow in BoT at 62.<br />
<br />
I do agree though . . . BoT is the place to grind AA's before you get SolRo or greater access.</div></div><hr />
