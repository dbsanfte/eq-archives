<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">anyway uber items help,but it's  the way we play our shaman who count the most.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have seen a Sceptre of Destruction go for 200k before....  I am not sure if that's the kind of thing you are looking for.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We sell a lot of stuff for guild funds.  All those dots, coffins, reagents..we burn through a LOT of money.<br />
<br />
Trak bps and VS legs are sold a lot by my guild, as well as anything else not needed for a main or a twink.<br />
<br />
As far as big ticket, droppable items that we get (not for sale, for mains):<br />
<br />
* Cowls of mortality<br />
* Lodi shields<br />
* Choker of the Wretched<br />
* Red/white/green dragon shields</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Droppable items that aren't usually sold but could probably fetch huge amounts if sold:<br />
<br />
Scepter of Destruction<br />
Helm of Rallos Zek<br />
Blade of Carnage<br />
Horn of Hsraga<br />
Mithril Helm/Boots/Gloves</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Something not mentioned so far was <br />
Boots of Flowing Slime<br />
7ac 20 hps 40 mana various stats, 10 MR,<br />
Flowing Thought III<br />
<br />
They drop from a named goo in the sewers of CT zone.  I've seen em drop 5 times now . . lost roll every damned time<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Those have gotta be worth some serious serious cash.  I'd guess 100k for starting bids. . . <br />
<br />
Oh and yes they are droppable.<br />
lvl 51 restricted, all casting classes can wear including hybrids. <br />
<br />
I've not seen any single item more useful to a caster than these boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmmm.. most valuable item in the game?  Sceptre of Destruction is a good guess, same with dragon scales, maybe a pre-nerf fungi staff?  I've heard of positively insane cash changing hands for one of those.  Those are all super-rare, though.<br />
<br />
But the item worth the most has got to be the super-mega-uber Crystallized Sulfur.  I just happen to have one I'd be willing to sell for a pittance- say 100k?  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/em check his pockets for his mana stone and polishes it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Best things to farm are spells IMO.  Can always get phat cash selling torpor and malo to desperate shammies!! hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Souldreamer Bearspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The highest priced item I've ever seen acutioned that to me was worthless was a mask of tinkering.<br />
<br />
Person wanted and go 100k+ for it (not sure the exact amount).<br />
<br />
I also know that a monk sold his barbarian pants too, but not sure how much he got for those (person was in a guild, then sold, then that person sold all of the items and Pacutioned the PP).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Cazic thule, in general now, has the best droppable-sellable-attainable loot in the game. Almost all the pieces are amazingly good for multiple classes and are no longer no drop. The best part is that 1 group can do most any of it. <br />
Target the melee items because they always seem to have an abundance of PP lying around and stupid enough to pay for things.<br />
<br />
For instance, the mosquito earing's are now selling for 100kpp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've saw the other day:<br />
<br />
&quot;WTB flayed barbarian skin leggings, paying 250kpp&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It would grow back, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Yep, some AoW loot is 'not' no-drop.  Flayed legs...blade of carnage...both of those could possibly sell for incredible amounts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Spitulski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Some big-name items I can think of:<br />
<br />
Sceptre of Destruction (since we got jacked on TM, there's been a few sold 500K+)<br />
Pre-nerf Fungi Staff<br />
Mithril Helm<br />
MQ of full suits of quest armor or rare quest components like rare PoM shiatz and Narandi's head for 10th ring<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
Blood Runed Greaves sold for 250k on TM when the first pair dropped - I lost the roll by 10 or so, it was very sad =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Khervek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Crown of elemental mastery from the 7th island of sky go easily for 80-120kpp on my server.<br />
<br />
Hardest part is getting to 7th , once there you can farm a couples .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Zlandicar's Talisman's up there with droppable things that you wouldn't see being sold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Friend of mine got Sceptre of Destruction this week for 250k on my server.</div></div><hr />
