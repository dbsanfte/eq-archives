<br />
It was 1987<br />
<br />
At a lecture the other day, they played an old video of Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings. (during the Regan administration).<br />
<br />
There was Ollie in front of God and country getting the third degree.  But what he said was stunning!<br />
<br />
He was being drilled by some senator;  &quot;Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security system?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ollie replied, &quot;Yes, I did sir.&quot;  The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't this just a little excessive?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No sir&quot; continued Ollie.<br />
<br />
Thought you might enjoy this little bit of history.<br />
Take care and have fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;No? And why not?&quot;  The senator asked. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Because the lives of my family and I were threatened sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Threatened? By whom?&quot; the senator questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;By a terrorist, sir.&quot; Ollie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His name is Osama bin Laden sir.&quot; Ollie replied.<br />
<br />
At this point the senator tried to repeat the name but couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't.<br />
  A couple of people laughed at the attempt.  <br />
<br />
Then the senator continued.  &quot;Why are you so afraid of this man?&quot;  The senator asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of.&quot;  Ollie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what do you recommend we do about him?&quot; asked the senator.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of the earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
The senator disagreed with this approach and that was all that was shown of the clip.<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested, the senator turned out to be none other than Al Gore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ashur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember watching that on television back in the 80s and I found myself thinking &quot;Wasn't it Abu Nidal that North was concerned about?&quot;<br />

Sure enough, if you go to Ollie's web presence you can see his commentary on what was posted above.<br />

FROM THE DESK OF LTCOL OLIVER L. NORTH (USMC) RET.<br />
NOVEMBER 28, 2001 <br />
     OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, I HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL THOUSAND E-MAILS FROM EVERY STATE IN THE U.S. AND 13 FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE ORIGINATOR PURPORTS TO HAVE RECENTLY VIEWED A VIDEOTAPE OF MY SWORN TESTIMONY BEFORE A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE IN 1987. <br />
<br />
     A COPY OF ONE OF THOSE E-MAILS IS ATTACHED BELOW. AS YOU WILL NOTE, THE ORIGINATOR ATTRIBUTES TO ME CERTAIN STATEMENTS REGARDING USAMA BIN LADEN AND OTHER MATTERS THAT ARE SIMPLY INACCURATE. THOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO CLAIM THE GIFT OF PROPHESY, I<br />
DON'T HAVE IT.<br />
<br />
     I DON'T KNOW WHO SAW WHAT VIDEO &quot;AT UNC.&quot; (OR ANYWHERE ELSE) BUT, FOR THE RECORD, HERE'S WHAT I DO KNOW:<br />
<br />
1. IT WAS THE COMMITTEE COUNSEL, JOHN NIELDS, NOT A SENATOR WHO WAS DOING THE QUESTIONING.<br />
<br />
2. THE SECURITY SYSTEM, INSTALLED AT MY HOME, JUST BEFORE I MADE A VERY SECRET TRIP TO TEHRAN, COST, ACCORDING TO THE COMMITTEE, $16K, NOT $60K.<br />
<br />
3. THE TERRORIST WHO THREATENED TO KILL ME IN 1986, JUST BEFORE THAT SECRET TRIP TO TEHRAN, WAS NOT USAMA BIN LADEN, IT WAS ABU NIDAL (WHO WORKS FOR THE LIBYANS -- NOT THE TALIBAN AND NOT IN AFGHANISTAN).<br />
<br />
4. I NEVER SAID I WAS AFRAID OF ANYBODY. I DID SAY THAT I WOULD BE GLAD TO MEET ABU NIDAL ON EQUAL TERMS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD BUT THAT I WAS UNWILLING TO HAVE HIM OR HIS OPERATIVES MEET MY WIFE AND CHILDREN ON HIS TERMS.<br />
<br />
5. I DID SAY THAT THE TERRORISTS INTERCEPTED BY THE FBI ON THE WAY TO MY HOUSE IN FEB. 87 TO KILL MY WIFE, CHILDREN AND ME WERE LIBYANS, DISPATCHED FROM THE PEOPLE'S COMMITTEE FOR LIBYAN STUDENTS IN MCLEAN, VIRGINIA.<br />
<br />
6. AND I DID SAY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD MOVED MY FAMILY OUT OF OUR HOME TO A MILITARY BASE (CAMP LEJEUNE, NC) UNTIL THEY COULD DISPATCH MORE THAN 30 AGENTS TO PROTECT MY FAMILY FROM THOSE TERRORISTS (BECAUSE A LIBERAL FEDERAL JUDGE HAD ALLOWED THE LYBIAN ASSASSINS TO POST BOND AND THEY FLED).<br />
<br />
7. AND, FYI: THOSE FEDERAL AGENTS REMAINED AT OUR HOME UNTIL I RETIRED FROM THE MARINES AND WAS NO LONGER A &quot;GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL.&quot; BY THEN, THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAD SPENT MORE THAN $2M PROTECTING THE NORTH FAMILY. THE TERRORISTS SENT TO KILL US WERE NEVER RE-APPREHENDED.<br />
<br />
                               SEMPER FIDELIS,                                OLIVER L. NORTH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Morgrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Strange, I saw this video with my own eyes.<br />
<br />
It is being used as an intro to Counter Terrorism seminars that due to the nature of my job I have been attending.<br />
<br />
Seems it is time for me to stir a huge pot /grin.<br />
<br />
Take care and thanks for the info, gonna have some peeps check the validity of everything now.<br />
