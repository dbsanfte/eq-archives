<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play on firiona vie server, and we're EXTREMELY heavy with shamans.  Beginning at upper 50's, shamans might be the most lfg class on this server.  Getting more than a couple groups in week is unusual unless Im willing to lfg for hours at a time.  Add to this the fact that I hate to solo, and its become a problem.  More shaman coming up too, bazaar is full of people shouting to sell their stuff and buy shaman gear.  Kind of came to a head today, when I went into pov and out of 10 people in zone, 5 were shaman.  This is after a week where the only xp I got was when I solo'd out of desperation.  I simply haven't got hours to spend lfg.  I get many complements about how I play the class, yet that doesn't seem to matter.  Most people view us as totally interchangeable.  A certain shaman I know levels much faster than me despite the fact that she NEVER canni's.  Always insists that since she's got kei, nothing else needed.  Simply having the time to wait lfg is the key.<br />
So, I'm trying to decide whether or not to delete the shaman.  Starting over on another server is an option, but not a good one.  Going through the whole plat farming bit over again would probably drive me away from the game altogether.  And, if I do kill him, what else to play?  I used to be a paladin, so I probably want to do something different than that.  I have a beastlord alt, but I dont think I'd like it full time.  Being a Cleric will get you a group almost instantly, its a shame I dont like playing one.<br />
So, theres my conundrum, any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I've heard that for $75, you can transfer servers with all your gear, I could be wrong. That would be an answer to moving and not having to farm. Might be worth lookin into.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What server, account is the beastlord on?  If on another account on FV, I'd assume you'd delete it first before you delete your shaman.  I think you need to ask yourself if you still like playing your shaman and if the surge in FV shaman is really what is setting you off.  If you are unhappy because their seems to be too many shaman currently, I think you could find a way to make things work with a little bit of time. If the game is just work to you now, take some time away from it for awhile.  But I bet you'd probably regret deleting all the work you've put into this character.  I'd encourage you to make an effort to group with people on your friends list, even if pickup groups are your norm.  Building a solid group of leveling buddies made the biggest difference in my exp and fun levels.</div></div><hr />

Exactly the wonderful insight I've come to expect :D  Newsflash, not every shaman likes to solo.  If I wanted to solo, I'd have been a druid, period.<br />
Starting your own group isnt so easy when 90% of the people wont go out without a cleric(never any available).  Most of the clerics wont go out without a chanter.  Most of the chanters wont go out with a shaman.  Nice cycle eh?  I've gone around that ferris wheel any number of times.  Most nights this is unsuccessful.  <br />
I didn't create ANY of my characters with the purpose of becoming yet another solo only looser.  There are simply better ways to spend my entertainment time than playing this game alone.</div></div><hr />

Can't transfer FROM or tranfer TO Fironia Vie?   <br />
<br />
<br />
As to shaman being very prevaliant... Like was said, start your own groups.  I see a lot of people LFG all the time, isn't too much trouble to set up any kind of group you want.  Best luck is to go for LDON - since it is new, it is the flavor of the month right now.  Seems everyone I know is still gung-ho on that.<br />
<br />
It would be a shame to quit a class as great as Shaman is for something like that.  Just my opinion.<br />

<br />
<br />
Well, enchanters and clerics are almost always wanted in groups.   And especially with LDON,  Bards (if you can stave off carpol tunnel) are the same.<br />
<br />
Paladins seem to be valuable, too.  I dont get too many chances to group with them, but from what i've heard they are the most valued tank class right now.<br />
<br />
Rogues have their plusses, too.  Are you looking for more of a caster, or more of a tank, is the question, and if you want any ability to solo.  <br />

How about a nice little Monk?<br />
<br />
And by the way, I think I'd rather be a soloing looser than someone that sits around for hours lfg.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">To be honest, I'm a little aimless about it right now.  The shaman is what I want to play, just not solo.  Again, this game is just too damn boring solo.<br />
Monk is actually an attractive alternative, melee is in short supply on fv.  A fairly large amount of the time, if a group is looking for more, they either want tanks or melee dps.  Usually not more than a couple warriors lfg.<br />
As far as solo vs lfg.  My solution is simple, log and do something else.  So, no, I wouldn't rather solo than lfg.  I'd rather enjoy my few entertainment hours each week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Can't transfer FROM or tranfer TO Fironia Vie? <br />
<br />
Both.<br />
<br />
But you can actually transfer FROM FV with all gear intact for a little more cash. Go to SH for a month, then request a geared transfer from there. It ends up with another $27 in cost though. (39.99 for the month of SH, as opposed to 12.99 for a regular month.) Then 75 to get off SH to some good server. (Unless you make tons of friends on SH and decide to stay there.)</div></div><hr />

First off, everything is slowed and or rooted and or DOT'ed to high heaven. Then you've got 5 Wolves chewing on said MOB. You darn sure have the healing covered. Take turns whacking the MOB, re-apply DOT's as needed, Nuke and Canni at will.<br />
<br />
We had a group a LONG time ago outside Karnors (aka DL) with 3-5 Shaman in it. (As they came and went). People were BEGGING to join our group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Class numbers fluctuate from month to month. It is hard to ride it out but if you really want to play a Shaman then you should. I know how boring solo'ing is and I understand having limited time but wouldn't it be rather silly to delete your Shaman only to find in 2 months that there's now a shortage of the class? <br />
<br />
When I switched servers a while ago I made a Rogue because there was an extreme shortage of active ones. When I got to the level of joining a raid guild the class was closed to recruiting more often than not. I found myself in a semi-raid guild where I was #4 of 6 active Rogues and often 1 of 10 over 60 /lfg during the week. About a month after retiring that character my guild was down to 1 active Rogue and it wasn't alone in that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">First, I want to apologise to anyone who was offended about my remarks about soloists.  I've just always seen it as a sometimes necessary evil, like prostate exams and root canals.  A certain number of jerks who only solo tend to make me a bit dubious of the breed.<br />
I recently set up a second account mainly for the purpose of riding out a bad spot of lfg, guess I really need to decide on a class to play with that account and let the shaman enjoy a well-deserved rest for a while.<br />
I've become a bit frustrated because its difficult to find/form a group not because of skill/equipment/etc, but simply because of supply and demand.</div></div><hr />

get a group of shaman tho, and i think your problem will be solved.  i love being in a group with a second shaman, i think 3-5 would be fantastic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I also play on the FV server and though I agree with the original poster that the shaman community is heavilly represented I disagree about finding groups.<br />
<br />
On raids I tend to be the 4th or 5th shaman which basically results in me patch healing or being excited when 3 waves of torrent actually hit.  When not raiding I can put  /LFG on and get a tell for 1-3 groups within 20 minutes.  There are always groups looking for a slower or a healer.  Though I hate playing cleric sometimes it is neccessary.<br />
<br />
What classes the FV server really seem to lacking is:  Warriors(Go Figure) and Bards.  I cannot find a bard to save my life most days.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am a 65 shaman on FV. The few times I have gone LFG (making groups at raids) I have had several tells in minutes. <br />
<br />
That said.. I have been in two pickup groups in my entire career.  One at 23 seasons, one at 60 seasons. <br />
<br />
Make some friends. Populate your friends list, find a guild. If you are as good a shaman as you say you are then you will not want for groups. <br />
<br />
In the short term... Pick a partner, any partner. that plays when you do. Duo with this person while LFG or making a group with you two as the base. <br />
<br />
Most times I have to be my shaman on raids, though I also have a 60 ranger who I prefer to raid with.  The need for  a 65 shaman is pretty high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">OK, here's the thing. I have a 58 shaman alt, on another server. I don't like to solo, although I'm quite good at it. I can do it happily if I'm close to an important level, as I'm feeling highly motivated then. But otherwise, I don't like to solo. <br />
<br />
Since I only play him sporadically, he has no regular friends to group with. So any time I want a group, I have to go for a random pickup group. So what to do? <br />
<br />
Solo WHILE LOOKING FOR GROUP. If your reaction to not being able to quickly find a group is to log off, you never (or rarely) find a group. Play for an hour and you'll likely find a group. Or as someone else suggested, find someone to duo with, and try to find a group for both of you. Or get a duo partner, and go somewhere like PoN or PoV (depending on class/level of partner), and duo while you're looking for more groupmembers. <br />
<br />
If you can find a spot to start that two can get exp, and just keep adding people as you find them, you can have a group. <br />
<br />
You should also consider trying odd group compositions/strategies. If there's 5 shamans in PoV, great, grab all of them for a group. If you can add one of any snare class to that, you'll have a fantastic aggro kiting group. <br />
<br />
If the ONLY thing you like doing is six person dungeon crawls, then you only have one option. Find some friends that you can play with, and group with them as much as possible. It might take a little time, but build up a friends list of people who like to dungeon crawl and have similar play times. A competent group at L 58 does NOT need a cleric and enchanter to do LDoN. In fact, you don't need either one. I've had some very good LDoN groups with two shamans, no bard, no enchanter, no cleric, no druid. The best LDoN group I've had, actually, was 2 shamans, 2 rangers, a rogue and a wizard. Because the players were all good - amazing for a pickup group. But if you can find some competent players to play with, a perfect group is not required.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">b) You don't like soloing you shouldn't have started a shaman, make a cleric.<br />
<br />
Strongly disagree.  I made a shaman because I want to group.  A good shaman is a great asset and is highly desired for groups.  Shaman can solo, but our strength lies in enabling, which is most efficient in a group setting, IMO.<br />
<br />
I can usually get a group pretty fast if I want to.  I'm a little worn on rough pickup groups and bad master looters lately so I'm being a little more selective in my LDoN groupings lately.  If I just want a random pickup group all I have to do is flag myself /lfg and I usually have an offer quickly.<br />
<br />
I'd agree on finding a duo partner as it can be a really good option.  I'd think a shaman can compliment almost any other class to make a strong duo.  I duo with a BL and we do very well.  In fact, I've duoed with a few BLs and the shaman/BL duo is very strong - I highly recommend it (KEI + spiritual beastiness + canni = total carnage).</div></div><hr />

He's level 61 with good gear, how does that make him a twink? Just curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hmm, thought this one would be dead :D  Guess I should answer a bit.  Ummm, not really sure where you got the uber twink bit.  I've just hit 2500hp unbuffed.  Guess you should see the 5-6k guys.  Likely any of the gear I'm wearing is attainable at 61.  I did buy it in bazaar, but little of it is nodrop, you can get it on any server.  Spent maybe 1/4 of my former characters' (a paladin) early life killing stupid goblins giving me a little plat to work with.  After that, its just been over a year of very carefully watching what I buy.<br />
Just posted this originally because I am a bit directionless right now.  I've a full time job, family, etc.  Play time is at most 3 hours in the evenings, and sometimes on weekends when the family is off doing their own things.  Taking an hour to find/form a group leaves little time to actually do anything.  I feel like its doing a giant disservice to others to join a group and leave soon.  In this case, I just log, rather than create ill will with other people.  For this same reason, I've not joined a guild.  I just dont feel like I can offer enough time to a guild, and dont want to be one of those people who are constantly complained about.  I'm realistic enough to know I'm not going to be able to join late night raids, since I must be up at 5am.  Weekends are sporadic, so I remain unguilded.  Friends list is much the same story, over time, people I've met and liked have simply outleveled me, moved off server, quit, etc.<br />
As for getting groups in minutes just like everyone else, well, what can I say.  The same people are lfg the same time each night when I am.  There's rarely less than 3 equal or greater leveled shaman lfg at the same time, not including those in zone shouting for a group.  Part of it may simply be timing.  Saturday for instance, spent and hour in the morning looking, then put the shaman in the bazaar and went out with the family.  Throughout the day, I looked in on the computer, and sure enough no shaman lfg.  Afternoon comes, housework done, etc.  Hit the lfg, yep, 4 shaman.  And better known, more active people are going to get groups first.<br />
I think some have misunderstood me about this.  I'm not at all unhappy with my shaman.  The problem with staying leveled with people will be a problem with any character.  I was kind of hoping someone with similar experience might be able to tell me 'dont change, it gets better' or even 'quit it altogether, you dont have the time for it'.  Even 'try class x, it makes solo fun', although I might not believe that one :D</div></div><hr />

b) You don't like soloing you shouldn't have started a shaman, make a cleric.<br />
I thought this was uncalled for, he's not whining at all and shamans are excellent grouping characters.  Most people determine what class they want to play by what class they find fun, not by how in-demand said class is in groups.. In-demand or not, I don't think I personally could play a cleric; It's not my cup of tea.  Now I perhaps can't relate too well to the original poster, as I almost exclusively solo, but I can relate to being flamed to a crisp on these boards simply for existing, not for asking an oft-asked question or anything of the sort, so I thought I'd speak up on this.<br />
<br />
Your three basic options, as have been stated, are to move servers, to form your own groups, or create a different class.  What will be best for you is a very individual thing, and so I won't offer advice that would work for me.<br />

<br />
the key to find a group as a shaman are 1 know alot of clerics and 2 know alot of chanters.  A shaman coupled with either a cleric or a chanter is a strong start to any dungeon or planar group asumign you dont hit the shift where tanks seem to be nonexistant.  <br />
<br />
If you happen to find a good chanter and cleric to join you, your group with be godly in dungeons...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'm in the exact same boat playtime wise.  I have joined a guild, though.  I made sure they knew upfront about my playtime and they were understanding.  It's a small guild with a loose association of other guilds, so when raids come there are always plenty of people.<br />
<br />
I haven't done a lot of LDON though.  With my 3 hours a night, once we actually get into the adventure - anything that goes wrong could make the adventure outlast my playtime.  I think it would suck for me to abandon the group at that point, so I have stayed away for the most part.<br />
<br />
It's not really about the shaman class though.  Our playtime restrictions makes the MMO genre hard to excel in when compared to the jobless, familyless students that are skipping their college classes to play EQ 24x7.  I think you'd have the same issue with any class except maybe cleric.  We can always find any class we want except a cleric.  I haven't found playing a cleric to be a lot of fun though, so I understand why there are so few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I know I've given some or all of you the wrong idea.  I wasn't intending to post any kind of 'i cant get groups' whine.  Theres no class love/hate/envy involved.  I've simply been trying to decide if continuing my shaman with my specific circumstances is worthwhile.  The reason I mentioned the large number of shaman is simple really.  When you have a choice of 3 or 4 people from a given class, you will naturally choose the one you know the best.  Unfortunately, thats not me.  People with much more play time will naturally get more groups, simply because they are better known.<br />
I guess what it comes down to is, is a lack of reputation/guild/friends going to be more and more of a hinderence, or less?  Is it worthwhile to push through to 65, hoping I can find more people with a similar schedule?  Or is it, in short, time to quit the shaman.  I think I did an unintentional faux pas with the title, I probably should have written it &quot;time to quit MY shaman&quot;.<br />

<br />
I wouldn't discount guilding yet.  I'm not on FV, so maybe this is circumstancial, but Zeb has several respectable and capable guilds with no playtime requirements and you don't get the critical eye for not showing up to every raid.  This is so much the case that I am hanging out with a few of them (I'm untagged atm) just to see which one I like best.  Sure, you may not be doing EP's every other day, but it's a great way to meet people and build some regular partners/groups.  <br />
<br />
If you want to make friends without spending 6 hours a night, every night, playing, just jump on some epic raids that are open to the public.  Helping people with their epics and the like as a volunteer is a jump start to getting on some friends lists.  You're right, it's difficult to stand out based on your playing skills alone.  But when you're there for people in their time of need and ask nothing in return, your friends list will grow quickly.  Watch your server board for people asking for public help with raids.  I duo'd for about 55 levels and didn't know a soul on the server except for my rl friend.  We jumped on a few raids, helped a few peeps, and now we're in Tell Hell.   :p <br />
<br />
I know I'd be amiss for direction if I was in your position.  After playing a CLR, PAL, and a WIZ, I know that I like no other class as well as the SHM.  Good luck and don't delete.  You'll regret it.  <br />

Sigh, another edit because original text could be taken either way.  I meant I grouped with those particular people for the first time in months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Bilgoba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I haven't read all of the replies on it but I can tell you this.  Since the post of a shaman soloing a WW dragon came up, shaman became almost a trend as duo partners or &quot;I want to level fast&quot; people.  This has left a lot of servers (Atleast from what I've seen, I'm from Povar) with a lot of high level shaman but most of them suck.  A lot.  Give it some time imo, make sure you learn your class, and you'll never be short on groups.  I personally hate /lfg when being used on raids because I get tells from like 3-5 groups everytime I put it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">*boggle* the person who posted this has 1k more unbuffed hp.  Not to put down the OP's gear, it's very nice.. but how do you get off saying this? [this guy is heavy twinked] I'm baffled by that statement, maybe you misworded it?<br />
<br />
When a level 65 shaman with elemental gear has 1.5k more hps than a 61 shaman w/o elemental gear then I think it's ok to say he's twinked. Most of his stuff is no drop because of the augmentations.. Just mentioning this so you can unboggle yourself..<br />
<br />
Anyway from further reading I mis spoke because you [original poster] seem like a genuine nice guy just trying to get advice on what to do. I think I agree with everyone else. use the lfg tool and tell some people meet me at blah blah we gonna xp!!! and soon enough you'll make some friends (and figure out who not to invite) and have a blast.. when you have to go, GO! nothing wrong with that everyone understands.. best thing to do is pick up a chanter / bl so they can replace you when you go.. most of the friends I have made I made before I joined my great guild.. we just have all guild groups all the time so much that I never get an opportunity to meet new people and that sucks sometimes..</div></div><hr />
