<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zozo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, don't know what to say about the Shaman class.  But this is my third time making a Shaman.  First was an Ogre he was ok just too big and bulky.  :P  Second was a Barb not having night vision isn't fun.  Yah he can cast a spell but like the built in effect.  Now the improved Shaman is my Troll.  So far he is a BLAST to play.  :)  Played my monk for almost 2 years and it is time to put him on the shelf.  Only going to use him for duo's and raids.  Other than that just don't have the heart to play him.<br />

Not sure what it is that I like about the Shaman class that keeps bringing me back but something does.  :)</div></div><hr />
