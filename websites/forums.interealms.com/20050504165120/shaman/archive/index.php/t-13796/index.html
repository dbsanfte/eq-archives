<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sony always seem to pull down the servers at 3AM PDT for patches or maintenance, this always, always gives the euro playerbase the pick of the spawn on server up, by the time we have enough online to mobilise for anything worth killing it is either dead or about to be. <br />
Though i am Australian, i play in a largely North American prime time bias alliance. When i have a day off work i log on at about 6 in the morning, and watch all the top mobs die till my alliance finally has enough on to do anything at about 11am, frustrating.<br />
We waited 2 months for Marr, the euros had him locked down in thier time slot, his 7day respawn to the second made it impossible for us to even get a lookin, one day though we were lucky enough to have a server crash that went in our favour, that does not happen often.<br />
<br />
Is this a trend that is only affecting Karana, or do some on other servers suffer aswell?<br />
<br />
I know that things will not change, I assume servers are maintained and patched where ever they are within the 9am to 5pm working day, I cannot expect people to work out of hours away from families, ect just for the sake of a few thousand grumbling dorks who want to kill some monster. I live with it, but i like to grumble every now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is like that on Sol Ro also.  I think they should change the times each patch.  This way everyone has a fair shot at the key mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cant say I find it unreasonable that SoE tries to have downtime on their systems in a timeslot when most of their players are not online.  I do find it a bit annoying that they have downtime in the first place and even more so that they overrun their estimates every damn time.<br />
<br />
What would probably be a better solution is to make no mobs have even-24 hour spawncycles.  Make the 7 day spawn be 7 day 6 hours etc - then spawns are split along the timezones.   Yea, euro still get first shot at patchdays, but after that its more an open game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bohooo, why is the world so bad to you .... bohooo.<br />
<br />
And now for real:<br />
1. Whenever SoE shuts down server for either maintenance or patch, someone will be angry. In most cases they patch at 3 AM CET because US player base is offline at this time, so they don't miss their playing time.<br />
2. Euros get the shaft often enough. Not only are the patches in prime time (so we can't play at all), most often do the server stay down so long that .. gasp .. not the euros get the spawns, but the US east time guilds. Thats because not every damn mob spawns at server up, but hours later.<br />
3. For australian based guilds to get more spawns would mean to shut down server in US prime time .. and you well forget this cause the major player base is US.<br />
<br />
Didn't we had this discussion a few times before?<br />

Ok, had to get that out of my system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I finished my Vex Thal key in January, as did most of my guild.  Four months later, the only thing we have killed in VT is a goo.  Why haven't we killed anything else?  The 3 euro guilds in VT clear it every single patch.<br />
<br />
I understand that if there has to be downtime, it needs to be when most American's are asleep.  The majority of EQ's playerbase is American, and the majority of American EQ players do not give a rat's ass about vex thal spawns.<br />
<br />
Despite their correct reasoning for having patches when they do, it is still very very frustrating, especially when the euros get the good spawns after patch, for several patches in a row, as they have on Solusek Ro (at least for my level of the game).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What would probably be a better solution is to make no mobs have even-24 hour spawncycles.

<br />
Firstly, you're complaining on timed rare spawns and your answer is to make the spawns MORE rare?  If American guilds are upset with never getting the spawn cycle, why not petition SoE to make them LESS RARE!  If your guild spent the pain to make your Emp keys, get bane weaps and finish the VT key, then you DESERVE a shot at names in VT.  You shouldn't be petitioning SoE to take Just Content away from other players so you can get what you have EARNED.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the spawn times on the mobs tend to cause hellacious pain to the euroguilds.  How many American guilds would be able to keep names down when it means that every raid would end at 3 - 4AM.  Since I go to work at 6AM, I know that *I* would cancel my account before I would put up with that kind of BS.  Raids that end at 11PM EST are uncomfortably late for me, but I keep my mouth shut, because I know that many of my guildies are now at 4AM CET.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Since I started playing, I've wondered why SOE feels it necessary to take ALL of the servers down at the same time. More often than not, the log-on servers get locked up immediately after the servers are up due to the increased volume. Wouldn't staggering the servers make more sense and cause less log-jam? Possibly patch 1/3 of the servers over a 3 day period? Or are they afraid that it would cause overloads on the up servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can understand the desire to have all the servers up at the same time so that you can get the max amount of feedback all at once.  <br />
<br />
But changing spawns from 24 hours to something odd is such a good idea I could just spit.  Make it random, or some kind of set pattern of 6-12-24, I think that's a fantastic plan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ummmm many spawns did have a random timeframe component added to them.<br />
<br />
What did it do? Means sitting on your ass for hours on end in a room with a mob you know will pop sooner or later and if you want a shot at it you have to camp it.  Yah, that is loads of fun.<br />
<br />
Downtimes will always effect someone. Euro, Est,Pacific.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Patches take out Asian prime time.  They take out Euro early- to mid- prime time.  The game was envisioned as being an American playerbase, but that changed to an international playerbase before it got out of Beta.  Remember, UO put out the 'translator patch' before we went live.  It didn't work well, but showed that our games must have an international focus.<br />
<br />
If yer taking out some of the best playtimes for a timezone, then we shouldn't be talking about ways to further penalize those same timezones.<br />
<br />
Can't call EQ an American game, isn't Sony Japanese?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Diashan Malkier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Alot of the mobs worth killing are popping on server up or a couple of hours after, dont know why they cant stagger the spawns a little, still keep a general patern, so they can pop in any of the given prime play times, in a rotating order, to keep the trackable to a certain extent.<br />
<br />
No one who pays for this game should miss out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Funny thing is like alot of things verant put something in to address the issue and then just forgot about it. AKA random spawn timer. Back in SoL erra there was some major complaining about this type of thing including from high end guilds. Guilds unable to kill AoW because euro/asian guilds where killing statue/idol and letting aow despawn every time they spawned. Cursed, same story. Emp, same story. So verant finally got around to do something. They changed the triggers for the encounters to prevent killing the earlier spawns from blowing the later spawns and put in the random spawn timer so that the mobs didn't pop automatically on server up but with a random period and then respawned with a random period (7days + or - 12 hours etc). Making alot harder for anyone, euro, asian, american, what ever to lock down a single mob. Fast forward to PoP and what do you have but everything spawns at server up and easily blowable triggers, hello Bert, HoH trials etc. They've gone threw and improved some things in PoP but missed a number of things still.<br />
<br />
To an extent I have a hard time being mad at the euros, asians, what ever. They are just doing the exact same thing you and I want to do. Killing the stuff they are capable of killing. It's hard to draw a line between just killing what they can kill when they can kill it and intentionally blocking content. Some things it's fairly easy to call blocking.<br />
<br />
Triggering and failing an event like bert with out a force anywhere near capable of doing the event. Killing AD in PoV every time he spawns. Killing saryrn every time she spawns. Yeah I'd call those intentionally blocking.<br />
<br />
Killing vt every time it spawns? Killing Marr every time? Killing agnarr every time he spawns? They have nice drops and where farmed by most guilds for loot at one point or another. Does doing it before everyone else is able to do it make it intentional blocking, not really.<br />
<br />
On Cazic thule the euro asian presence hasn't been very big. We've never really had a major asian guild and the local euro guild has formed and reformed several times and hasn't been too bad for the most part. They've never made it past Vt/ssra level really and haven't made any real progress in PoP so they can't lock down the content they are doing due to the random spawn timer on most of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sony always seem to pull down the servers at 3AM PDT because lowest population at this time, just like a worker ususlly do road/motorway maintenance during midnight or morning rather than peak hour ?<br />
<br />
those blowable spawn suck, MM and other big mob shouldn't have few days re-try after if fail; should make it respawn again no more than few hours if fail</div></div><hr />

Thats a good start, I think that will do  :D<br />
<br />
And now for real: It's ok to vent some steam here if you have too much pressure, but there is nothing you can accomplish with this topic. We are all stuck with their patch times, there was a big discussion during SoL patch days (which were like every other day) about the times and SoE changed them around some. In the end they patch at the time when the less people are online.<br />
I don't envy the boys at SoE for patching at 3AM in the night, not the best working hours IMHO, and maybe one of the reason why mistakes happen.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Easy solution so nobody can argue they are getting the short end of the stick...<br />
<br />
Take a snapshot before patch of ALL mobs in EVERY zone that are up along with their spawn timers... when patch is finished just bring it back up so the spawns stay exactly the same as immediately prior to the patch...<br />
<br />
Randomising plus non integer spawn times also good so that all time zones see the mobs at some stage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They need to offset the respawns on the mobs in EQ so all timezones have a equal shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off - dont destill the gist of a whole thread into the opinion of the last poster, it just looks bad for yourself.  Where did I ever complain about the spawn rate of mobs?<br />
<br />
Usually I would just leave a post like yours instead of donning the asbesto underwear, but heck - I am bored today.<br />
<br />
I guess I will draw this out with big simple words to you since you doesnt seem to have grasped the concept of what I said.<br />
<br />
Problem:  Spawns happen after systems come up which quite often is around 1200 PST.  Euro/EST guilds run to the zones, clears it all and wins their trinkets.  Then the boss-mobs are on a timed n*24 hour cycle so next time it is up the same guilds can stroll into the big bad mobs strongshold and get their alts some nice trinkets too.<br />
<br />
My proposal was to make sure big nasty mobs do not come on even 24 hours spawns.  If they are on 7 day spawn now, they can be on 7 day, 6 hours (or 6 day 15 hour or anything else that is not an even 24 hour).  The purpose of this is to change what timezone gets the next spawn, and the next, and the next  and so on.  It does not change anything about who gets the first spawn.<br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry to bother those of you that are able to grasp written language and abstract concepts.  I will return to my cave now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Disclaimer - this post is to do with downtime, not Uber Mobs<br />
<br />
As a casual Euro timezone player, whenever there's a long patch (read most of them), it basically means I can't play (which does suck if it's the only night that week I was going to be able to play).<br />
<br />
One thing that occurs to me, which is that Sony does it's patches at 3am Pacific Time to minimize the amount of people effected by them. Fair enough ...<br />
<br />
But wouldn't it be fairer to have it so that it was based on percentages? I.e. if 80% of your player base is in Pacific Time, do 80% or your patches to suit that player base.<br />
<br />
Ok, so I know it doesn't matter much, and it's not going to happen for practiacal reasons, and really, I'm just writing this because I'm bored ...<br />
<br />
Ho hum.<br />
