<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I learned to canni dance as soon as I got cannibalize one and I’ve been doing so every since.  So I’ve had a lot of practice.  This method worked well until I got canni four.  With canni one through three I could stand, cast and sit down between manna ticks, but the casting time for canni four is too long for that.  By the time the spell goes off and I sit back down again I’ve missed the manna tick.  Obviously I catch the tick from time to time, but its not consistent like it was with the previous spells.  So I just say to hell with it and chain cast it.  Is this standard for everyone without a spell haste item?  I’m very close to canni five so it won’t mater as much in three more AAs, but I found it strange that I’ve never read even one post about this before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">By the time you get canni 4 you should have stocism and be real close to Torpor. Just chain cast canni4 and stocism/torpor back up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Chain it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find myself able to cannidance consistently (and catch the med tick) with Canni 4. There's not a lot of extra time, but I can do it. Maybe it's connection speed, if you're on a dialup? Not much you can do about it if it is, though. <br />
<br />
But, I do often just chain-canni anyway. Canni4 is so much more mana a tick than meditation that you're still benefiting hugely from the canni, even if you miss med ticks. If I'm the least bit in danger of getting hit, I don't bother to dance. If I have lots of time to med up, it's not worth the hassle. So the only time I canni dance now is when I REALLY need mana fast, and I'm safe while I do it. Then I'll do the cannidance to real low hp and use Kragg's mending to heal (L 58 at present). Other than that I don't dance much now anyway, even though I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cool, thanks for the replies.  I did use Stoicism to heal back up (I’m so very glad I did that quest) and I now use Torpor, so it’s not really been a problem.  I was just wondering if I was doing something wrong.  I was so used to canni dancing that to cast canni without dancing just seemed wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just chain it down to about 20% health heal back up rinse and repeat, once you get quin you'll be able to regen mana like a mofo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">2.5 seconds to cast canni4....a tick is 6 seconds, that is plenty of time to catch your meditative mana.  Just start canni4 as soon as you see a new tick begin, sit and watch your mana go up then canni4 again...simple.<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast X<br />
/pause 30<br />
/sit on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, I think canni 4 is perfect timing for canni dancing.  I canni, sit down, wait until a tick goes by, then immediately stand up and canni and sit down (tick goes by right away), immediately stand up and canni and sit down (tick goes by right away), repeat.<br />
<br />
But I haven't danced in a long time.  Outdoors it's horsey, indoors most of the time I don't cannidance to avoid sit agro-- canni dancing isn't necessary at all at 65.  Only when the situation is really scary (i.e. I have to tnargs a lot and my mana's in trouble) and I'm able to sit without agro, do I cannidance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just chain cast it. I can dance, but never liked doin it cuz its a pain in the arse. I usually chain down and then stoic back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Canni4 gives me roughly 3% mana.  The med tick gives me almost 1%.  If I dance, I can usually skip a few canni casts, so I can save 30 seconds or so by timing it right.  So basically - when time is critical (usually when soloing and a spawn is coming), I dance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just sit between chain casts.  You'll catch quite a few med ticks and not lose time or your eyesight. ;)<br />
<br />
This is why I love bearform more than any other reason.  I hate my screen shifting as I stand and sit.  Of course, outdoors we have the horse and no need to dance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yep, when I need mana back fast I just sit while the gem is refreshing, stand up right before it refreshes, and recast.  Sometimes you get lucky and catch the med tick sitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grumbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With the release of LDON, things have changed somewhat for a Shaman. LDON has actually been a good training ground for playing the shaman and allows you to learn new tactics.  Being non-stop, there isn't any time for a Shaman to sit and med.  However, if you play it right, you will have plenty of mana and be able to be an active melee fighter also.<br />
<br />
First is to get yourself the Soulstripper, a must for many Shamans.  Lifetaps 75 hps.  Then you need to Augument this with 340 LDON points for Vampire Talon 50 hp Lifetap weapons process. (Potential 125pt Lifetap based on number of processes).  With low delay and haste, you can do some DPS and heal up as you use Canni 4 between swings.  I tend to get lots of processes due to high dex, so it works for me.<br />
<br />
With using Regen, you will have plenty of mana and Hitpoints to canni and never need to sit.  Also, you will get much praise from your group as being an awesome Shamy, both as a melee master and spell caster.<br />
<br />
Be aware there are times you will have to step away and do re-buffs, slows, etc.. but most often you will do well (Make sure ya have KEI also).  Keep in mind though, if there are multiple mobs due to a bad pull, your going to be real busy doing slows, etc.. thus expending a heck of alot of mana.  This may require you to canni up a bit before jumping into the fight again.<br />
<br />
Never, Ever, Canni past 60% when using this tactic as you may find yourself dead quick if agroed due to failed slow, etc..<br />
<br />
Now to the point of the issue. If you can handle LDON's fast pace and continue to keep mana, then doing regular grouping in the planes, etc.. will be childs play.  Suggest practice the fast pace of LDON to learn the skill for making mana.<br />
<br />
Now this is only my suggestion and it works for me.  I quite often get complements for being a pretty good Shaman and many comment that they rarely grouped with a Shaman that never had to sit and med.<br />
Different strategies work for different people based on how the play their Shaman.  I just had to develop one that worked for me.<br />
<br />
I suggest getting the Soulstripper and augumenting it with a Lifetap process. In addition to the standard process that comes with the weapon and the Augmentation, you can't lose.  It sells for roughly 4500 pp and has been the best PP I never had a problem giving away.<br />
<br />
Anyway, hehe, Can't wait till I get Canni 5.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">since canni3 I've been chain casting it mostly. In most exp groups Its too dangerous to be sitting when you are chain pulling in tier 2 (and higher i assume). bearform and chain away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thus far I’ve managed well in LDoN.  I don’t do any fighting but I never sit and med either.  I’m always too busy casting canni 4 to do either.  *grins*   The only time I have manna problems is when my group pulls four or five mobs several pulls in a row.  Such pulls have never been a problem, but because of all the slows, and resists, and having little time to canni between pulls my manna tends to get dangerously low.  And of course that’s the time all the melee’s lose their haste and regen decides to drop as well. *sigh*  But overall its been a blast.  I’m kept so busy I never notice the passage of time and my XP bar seems to jump up a bubble or more each time I look up.  I’m just glad I learned to dace long before LDoN came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sethrel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I usually chain it indoors and out (thought on my drogmor when out).<br />
<br />
I have the marcro created as well (the /sit off, cast, pause 30, sit on one) and I find about 80% of the time I can get it timed and going well. It does run close and I do miss a step at times but my guess is that it is more of a lag issue.</div></div><hr />

Acutally, once you get Cann 5, Torpor and Tear of Saryn, Velium Strike, etc, your doing far more DPS and far more mana production with the Cann5/Cann4 between reloads...in LDON I can often ToS, Anathema, BoN or chain nuke with Velium Strike or Spear of Torment....it typically goes like Malo/Slow/DoT or Nuke then ready for the next mob......I do this with every pull and have 0 downtime.<br />
Now conversly, I made great use of my Soulstripper when I was helping a druid friend kill Geonids for her shawl quest...I was, in essence, useless there simply cause they are darn near immune to disease/poison and cold, so I simply tanked and meleed them to death with my pet while she dotted, so I can see where your coming from; but this was way before I had the tools I have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Canni4= Never med again<br />
<br />
I know I havent since i got the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shinreineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If I have my drogmar available I'm pretty sure its darn near impossable to run out of mana with CanIV and KEI lol. I get a bit over 2% mana per cast of CanIV, even indoors I find it hard with kei to get below say 70% mana, I believe my mana pool to be around 3600-3700 with kei on. I don't bother to canni dance, I just chain cast it.</div></div><hr />

Whoa... that was completely weird.  This is an old thread, and I thought I've seen it before.  I reread the original post and was about to reply, but then I went down and saw this reply, and thought, darn.. someone beat me to the punch.  A few minutes later I realize it was me who wrote this.</div></div><hr />
