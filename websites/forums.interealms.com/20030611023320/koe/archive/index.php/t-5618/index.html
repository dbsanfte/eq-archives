<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As anyone who was stuck waiting on me last night knows, I was have a better than usual round of connectivity issues. Different times and in different zone lines. I'd crash to desktop when I tried to zone. Also crashed once while switching spells in my spellbook. <br />
<br />
My favorite though was having 1 comp sitting and medding, other comp I try to gate to GD. When I tried to gate, it disconnected BOTH comps, even the one that wasn't zoning.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experiencing stuff like this? I also had a nice bout of lag, but I assume that's nothing that can be remedied.<br />
<br />
Grr.<br />

<br />
I have a SBLive sound card as well. Wonder if it's causing the problems I have been having with getting kicked to desktop when tracking. Will try that this evening.<br />
<br />
On another note I tried talking with Tech support last evening and hung up VERY frustrated. If anyone has any insight as to what I can do please let me know.<br />
<br />
Here in a nutshell is what happened. Got home tried calling tech support and for an hour to an hour and a half got busy signals trying every 5 or 10 min. Finally I got thru and was on hold for 30 min until I got a tech. Now mind you I had spent 2 or 3 hours two nights before on call with tech support and this is a LONG DISTANCE number to me. <br />
<br />
Well I got this bone head min. wage tech who would not listen to what I had tried before and just said &quot;get a new driver&quot; try to track in multiple zones etc. <br />
<br />
I said I'll try anything you want but just walk me thru what you need to do and I'll tell you the results that way if it should not work I will not have to spend another 2 hours to try and talk to someone. <br />
<br />
His response<br />
&quot;Sir I can not do that&quot;<br />
<br />
He tried to explain that I was the &quot;only one&quot; having this problem so it was not Varnet's fault. <br />
<br />
I explained that all of my equipment was within their recommended group and that if I found a bug that I should not be penalized for it. I asked if I could get reimbursed for the cost of the calls and the time off line. Guess the answer<br />
&quot;Sir I can not do that&quot;<br />
<br />
We then progress in that he wanted me to send him some files to review. I didn't have a problem with this but he just wanted to tell me the names and get me off the phone. I asked him if he would walk me thru gathering the info since he was asking me to take my time to troubleshoot their problem.<br />
<br />
Guess what the response was<br />
&quot;Sir I can not do that&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point I asked to speak to a supervisor. He placed me on hold and a few min later he came back and said his supervisor asked him to give me his email address and talk to him thru email. At this point I was livid and said no I would speak to him<br />
now. After humbling this CSR I finally got the supervisor on the line. I told him everything that had transpired up to this point. He got defensive when I said this started happening after the patch, as he felt the patch had nothing to do with any of this.  <br />
<br />
I then asked if I could be reimbursed for my long distance charges since I had not gotten ANY response from emails I sent to tech support on Monday and this was now Thursday. He told me <br />
&quot;We do not give refunds for ANY reason. Even if a person stopped playing a year ago and never played their account&quot; <br />
<br />
He then asked if I had played since I had this issue I told him I had not. He then said &quot;So you have not logged on since you have had this&quot; I said sure I've logged on to test all of the suggestions your techs gave me but no I have not PLAYED. He then told me that they could only see that I had logged in so could not tell if I was lying or not. <br />
<br />
I asked if there were an email or someone I could appeal this decision to and he I may be able to go to their web site and find and address but he was not allowed to give any out. <br />
<br />
I'm open for suggestions guys. I'm emotionally involved so not sure what action I should take now. Here is what I have in mind but not sure any is the best answer.<br />
<br />
1) Ask everyone I know for a contact name of someone inside Sony who I can appeal this to<br />
<br />
2) Write out the above info and post it on EVERY flame board I can find to see if it gets any Sony attention.<br />
<br />
3) Find another online game and drop eq all together (anyone have any suggestions?)<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think and sorry am not meaning to hijack this post we can start a new one for this if you wish<br />

<br />
I have made a lot of excuses for VI in the past.  Let's face it, MMORPGs are the most challenging programming around.<br />
<br />
However, this is not a programming issue.  This is a customer service issue.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Keep it up, VI.  You are going to stumble into a lawsuit this way, sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I sat down and figured out a fix to my problem so I'm up and running. Its a STRANGE fix but hey it works. So give it a try. For some reason after I tried EVERYTHING I could think of I opened up my box and noticed heat buildup in the case so I left it open and added a cooling fan. That's all it took. Don't ask why it only kicked me off while tracking because I have no idea. Hope this helps others<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If your P3-600 is a Socket 370, here's a mega-cooling fan for the CPU (make sure you got enough clearance above it, this thing is huge)<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If your P3-600 is a Slot-1, here's a cooler for that:<br />
<br />
http://www.axiontech.com/cgi-local/prdtinfo.asp?prdt=ACAVOLGR<br />
<br />
(This cooler has 2 power connections, one to your mainboard, one to a regular power connection like your hard driver or CD-Rom uses (I'm using this one on my P3-850 with no problems))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You might consider adding more case-fans... some cases have locations in them for adding extra fans - usually one in the front of the case below the hard drive/floppy drive and one in the back below the power supply.   I have all fans in my pc and it NEVER gets hot in there.<br />
EDIT: If you do this, you want the front fan pulling air in to the case, and the back (under power supply) fan blowing air out of the case.   Air flow comes in the front of the case, and out the back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a generic fan:<br />
<br />
http://www.axiontech.com/cgi-local/prdtinfo.asp?prdt=ACGNCASEFANB<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been using this vendor for a couple years now, they're for real.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit 2: Years ago, my first pentium developed a 'thermal intermittant' problem like you describe, and one of the chips on the mainboard would overheat, causing lockups - I ran open-case with a fan blowing on the mainboard for a month or so, lessening lockups but in that case replacement was the only option.   Haven't seen one that bad in the 7 years or so since, but it was worth a mention.   I imagine in your case the fans will do the trick.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for that link. I'm not as hardware strong as I would like to be so I'm not sure what slot my cpu is in but the cooling fan resembles the 2nd one you have listed. You are right that first fan is HUGE. I don't have enough head room to run that one. I added a fan out of the back but did't even think of adding an in take fan on the front. I'll have to look at the computer when I get home and see if I can rig that. Having the case open is freaking out my cat to where she will not even come into the room. Its either that or I have finally enabled the sounds and she does not like to hear me beating up on the cats in OT. Shrug anyway thanks for the links those are GREAT prices!!<br />

Socket 370 is a square chip that sits in a white square socket on the mainboard, secured with a small lever.<br />
<br />
Slot-1 processors resemble a video-game cartridge.<br />

oops- forgot I left tea on to brew - just boiled tea all over the stove - gotta go...</div></div><hr />
