<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have 2 accounts. My main is a lvl 65 Rogue and have a level 50 Cleric on the second account. I was able for quite some time to 2 box for xp until slow became a de facto requirement. 2 boxing is *not* my preferred playstyle but does help during periods of down time. I have started an ogre shaman and am pleased with him so far duoing with an ogre SK on my main account. My main fear is the rarity and cost of spells at higher levels. I also have on my main account a level 57 enchanter and am considering making either a wizard or mage on the second account to duo in the downtime rather than face an incomplete spellbook with a shaman.<br />
<br />
I guess my questions are:<br />
<br />
Are the high end spells (ie Torpor) really that hard to get?<br />
Given that SoE has stated that they are going to open up the level requirements for what will be a blue mob, do you feel that a shaman / rogue combo is viable?<br />
<br />
I have had friends that played the shaman sk duo and had incredible success with it. It also makes sense that an enchanter and wiz/mage duo would be viable against any mob that can be mezzed.<br />
I am not trying to start a flamewar, and I am aware that this is probably not the most popular topic. Please be gentle.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help!</div></div><hr />

Yes, however, they may become easier to attain with the new research system in place.<br />

I don't know about the opening up of the level requirments for a blue mob, I don know however that a friend of mine and I did levels 40-50 as a rogue/shammy duo.  Slow mob, add dots, send in dog, you should't have any trouble holding agro.  Heal yourself and watch the rogue dps fly.  It's fun.  It can be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman/rogue combo will struggle a bit with Pop unless:<br />
<br />
a) shaman is well equipped with gear/spells/aa<br />
b) you get a plate tank to trio with</div></div><hr />
