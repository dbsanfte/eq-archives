If you need any maps because you aren't familiar with those areas, you can find pretty much any maps you will need at <br />

Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did all the totemic quests just so I could have a full set of it.  Still wearing pieces at 51.  Trying to finish swapping them out for better stuff though.<br />
The totemic quests are pretty easy, actually.  The glacier bear was the biggest pain because of the long spawn time.  I was lucky enough to grab Grizzleknot Bark on a run through SK with guildmates.  Good luck on it!</div></div><hr />

You were SO lucky, I camped Grizzleknot for three weeks, everynight, before my wife saw him one day, and looted the Bark for me.<br />
<br />
On the plus side, my kitty looks the DB's in full Totemic :)<br />
