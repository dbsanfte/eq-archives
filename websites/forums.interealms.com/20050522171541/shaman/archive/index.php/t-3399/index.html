&quot;Shammiebuffsplz!&quot; - How to get Shaman-Buffs at raids <br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
Observations about efficient buffing by Doedel Sding. <br />
Spiritual advices by Landragoran Heronwing, Seredith, Asta Khaan, Jing, Kilher, Zorlac <br />
Second Edition <br />
<br />
<br />
*** Send tells with your request *** <br />
<br />
Ever wonder why none of the three Shamans react to you /shout /say /ooc &quot;Shammie bufs plz&quot; ? <br />
Maybe because every one of them thinks the other will buff you? <br />
Maybe because they are sick of wasting mana by casting that Focus at the same time at you as the other two Shamans? <br />
Shouts, oocs, says tend to get buried in all that other zone-spam. A tell-text not. <br />
<br />
<br />
*** Be selective *** <br />
<br />
It wont help you much sending tells for the same buff requests to each and every Shaman in the raid. They will detect this waste of mana soon and hunt you down. And sick their puppies at you. <br />
<br />
<br />
*** Be precise *** <br />
<br />
/tell Shaman &quot;Gimme al ur Shammie buffz&quot; <br />
Some Shamans have 30 pages in their spellbooks full of interesting buffs. Some Shamans will react to that request by starting at the bottom of their spell books and buff you things like Invis to Animals, Ultravision, Inner Fire, Enduring Breath. Some will serve the more precise requests of the other tank first. <br />
<br />
<br />
*** Keep the request short *** <br />
<br />
/tell Shaman &quot;Well it seems that the dust of the battle has settled down so please can you focus your attention bringing me up with riotous health buff but only if mana permits, if not then please take your time but remember me in 15 minutes if yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda......&quot; <br />
/tell Shaman &quot;Focus&quot; <br />
Two requests. Guess which one will be served first? <br />
People like to be polite. Shamans like politeness too. Shamans have also a lot to work to do at raids, and most of them like short precise requests over politeness. Hugs and kisses can be exchanged when that Dragon is dead. <br />
Note: I also like the short requests being written in capslock. Helps with recoginzing and reading them in all that other spam in the chat window. <br />
Note: I like to chat, but not at raids. Too busy. So i will reply rarely to a buff request other than by casting it on you. /bigogrehug <br />
<br />
<br />
*** Learn the buffs *** <br />
<br />
/tell Shaman &quot;Focus, Str, Dex&quot; <br />
Shaman sighs. <br />
<br />
/tell Shaman &quot;Dex&quot; <br />
Shaman gets message: &quot;That spell wont have hold on the target&quot; <br />
Shaman sighs <br />
Tank tells you &quot;What is that Focus buff i have?&quot; <br />
<br />
Great news to you: Some buffs stack, some not. Some buffs have several effects blocking other buffs being casted on you. Example: Focus of Spirit not only adds HP but also Str and Dex. <br />
Harnessing of Spirits is the lvl 49 version of this Focus buff. <br />
<br />
/tell Shaman &quot;Talisman&quot; <br />
Shaman opens his spellbook: Talisman of Tnarg, Talisman of Altuna, Talisman of Kragg, Talisman of the Serpent, Talisman of the Raptor, Talisman of thr Brute, Talisman of the Rhino, Talisman of the Cat, Talisman of Shadoo, Talisman of Jasinth <br />
Shaman has also Focus of Spirit in his spellbook, maybe the client wants this? <br />
<br />
<br />
*** Learn more of the buffs *** <br />
<br />
Did you know that Focus of Spirit is a L 60 spell? Ever wondered why that Luminary (L55-59 Shammie) wont talk with you anymore after you requested four times in a row a Focus from him? There are nice websites out there with spell lists. Or you even may *cough* ask a Shaman what level a certain spell is (please do this after the raid though). <br />
<br />
<br />
*** The Right-klick-check-mantra *** <br />
<br />
/tell Shaman &quot;STA&quot; <br />
Shaman gets message: &quot;That spell wont have hold on the target&quot; <br />
Tank tells you &quot;Oh i already have that buff from another Shaman&quot; <br />
<br />
Check your Buffs BEFORE sending a request to the Shaman. Its so easy. Right-klick your buffs and check them. <br />
Please all relax now, take a deeeeep breath and slowly repeat my mantra: <br />
&quot;Right-click-check!&quot;.&quot;Right-click-check!&quot;.&quot;Right-click-check!&quot; <br />
This can also be helpful in other situations and may prevent you one day from giving your Tranquil Staff to Ssolet Dnaas instead of the Burnished Wooden Staff. <br />
<br />
<br />
*** Request Buff-refreshs asap *** <br />
<br />
Raidleader shouts &quot;CHARGE&quot; <br />
SleepyTank_01 tells you &quot;can i have quick Focus and DR?&quot; <br />
SleepyTank_02 tells you &quot;Focus quick!&quot; <br />
SleepyTank_03 tells you &quot;I was rezzed 15 minutes ago and have no buffz&quot; <br />
Buff icons start blinking for 30 seconds before fading. Thats not to hypnotize you. Its a signal for you to wake up, check which buff fades and send tell to Shaman. Its your responsibility to be combat ready all the time; you never know what mob is around the corner or when the raid-leader calls charge. <br />
<br />
<br />
*** Sit down *** <br />
<br />
No joke. <br />
Spells have a certain range. If you are running around like a headless chicken you will probably out of range when the Shammie tries to buff you. Or you will miss that group buff. Or slip on a banana peel. <br />
Also asking for a buff and running away 10 seconds later to pull a mob wont help you much. Really. <br />
Note: I am aware that there are situation which forbid sitting down due to complicated aggro-thingies or such.Then try to reduce your movements to a minimum while the raid buffs up. You will help lots by NOT behaving like being intoxicated with 19 cups of coffee. <br />
<br />
<br />
*** The buff who wasnt there *** <br />
<br />
Hello Mr WW-Dragon! <br />
Good-bye Mr WW-Dragon! <br />
Doh! Where are all my buffs? <br />
/tell Shaman &quot;FOCUS, STA, ACUMEN&quot; <br />
Yes, dispell magic is a nice spell. We used it on that Iksar Necromancer to get rid of his damage shield. So some monsters decided to adapt our tactics. And the smart players decided to counteradapt. <br />
They noticed that monsters dispell one of their first 4 buffs. So its wise decision to bury the mana-expensive buffs deep deep deep. And then there are some instant-self-buff-casting items. They fill in nicely that just dispelled dummy buff and prevent nasty Mr. WW-Dragon from breathing deeper. <br />
So if you fight dispelling monsters, please take care of buff sequence. Grab some cheap buffs (see invis, Ultravision or such) first; THEN ask shammie for the big guns. And try to get hold of a shrunken goblin earring or another instant-casting item. <br />
<br />
<br />
*** The rogue who wasnt there *** <br />
<br />
I dont klick around to target players for buffin. Its too painful in small crowded places. I use /tar to get hold of a target. Invisible hidden sneaking people cannot be targeted either by klicking nor /tar command. Invisible hidden sneaking people wont get buffs until stopping their David Copperfield show. <br />
<br />
<br />
*** This aint the commons tunnel *** <br />
<br />
So please DONT ask me for SoW. You wont get it. I am busy with other things. See that guy over there? That fragile green man with the funny hat which looks like spaceship? Thats a ranger. He will help you gladly with SoW. And it helps him to get the feeling that he is needed. <br />
<br />
<br />
*** Be patient *** <br />
<br />
You learned all the basics. An Icon is blinking. You checked your buffs. You sit down. You sent the Shaman a short precise tell : &quot;FOCUS, STA, ACUMEN&quot;. But nothing happens. A whole 60 seconds no reaction. He must be asleep! You have to take measures and inform the reaidleader (who is just sitting around he whole time doing nothing) about this. <br />
<br />
Please dont get angry! Instead let me tell you a few things about my job so you understand the problems i face. <br />
<br />
- Mana pool <br />
The Shamans manapool is roughly around 2000-2500 mana. <br />
The best buffs eats lots of mana. <br />
Example: one casting of Focus of Spirit eats 500 mana (Harnessing of Spirits eats 425 mana). So after buffing 5 tanks with Foucs the mana pool is empty. <br />
Even with cannibalizing and high regrowth-rate it will take a bit time to regain some mana. <br />
<br />
- Spell-slots <br />
8 Spell-slots. Thats not much. My standard raid setup claims 6 slots: Cannibalize4, Torpor, Turgurs, Malo, Voice of the Berzerker, Immobilize. Thats 2 slots (maybe 3 if I kick Immoblize out) for memming buffs. There are far more Standard-raid-buffs: Focus, Riotous Health, Acumen, several group-stat/resist-buffs. Even more when the Shaman is not Focus-enabled. <br />
So the probability is high that I dont have that buff memmed you have requested and have to dememorize one buff and memorize your Focus. This takes time and klicking and rummaging my spellbook. And some buffs also have a certain time after being memmed during which they cant be casted. So sometimes i am not dreamily staring at you while scratching my butt. Instead I wait for that darn spell-Icon to be klickable. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Debuffing is also our job <br />
Shamans not only buff, they also debuff. Turgurs slows monsters down (250 mana). Malo debuffs resists (350 Mana). So during pulling many Shamans like to keep at least one blue bubble of mana for debuffing instead of going oom. A slowed Sebilite Protector is worth more than that one additional Focus on a tank. <br />
<br />
- Berserking makes silent <br />
There is that nice Berseker-line of self-only Shaman-buff spells. <br />
Example: Voice of the Berzerker (L 59) adds 84 Strength, 24 AC, 74 Dexterity, 74 Agility. <br />
I need theses additional stats because some monsters dont like being debuffed and beating the hell out of me and it helps me survive and channel through that Turgurs or Malo. <br />
The drawback: After going berserk the Shaman is silent for 30 seconds and cannot cast anything. Doh! Rumors are that the Shaman is not even able to send a tell or reply during this time. <br />
<br />
- The PE-Problem (Rant) <br />
Let me tell you about that nice toy from Veeshan Peak: Hammer of Dragonborne, SHM only. 2 HB, some stats. And it can cast a very nice Buff with high stackablity: Primal Essence. This adds 20 Str, Dex, Agi, Sta. Tanks love it. And request it often once the word has spread. <br />
Most Shammies love the hammer when they get it. <br />
And then they will get aware of the two major drawbacks: Casting time is insane 15 seconds. Hammer must be equipped for casting. <br />
So that what happens in that typical ToV-raid situation: Tanks tells you &quot;PE&quot;. <br />
Things i have to do now: <br />
- open inventory <br />
- open bag <br />
- de-equip Sarnak Battle Shield <br />
- de-equip Spear of Fate <br />
- equip Hammer <br />
- target tank <br />
- klick hammer <br />
- wait 15 seconds <br />
- deequip Hammer <br />
- equip Spear <br />
- equip Shield <br />
Yes i yould keep the hammer equipped all the time. But I will lose tons of stats, AC, HP and resists because of that. I need AC and resists when that incoming Elder Drake has to be slowed. Sometimes i am thinking of deleting that hammer. <br />
<br />
- We are not perfect and tend to get tired after 6 hours <br />
There are rarely more than two Shamans at one raid. Often only one. <br />
There are often more than two tanks at a raid. Often 15-20. <br />
There are often more than two mobs to slow/malo. <br />
There is rarely more than two minutes pause for a Shaman. <br />
So after the sixth hour our shiny perfection starts to crumble and shatter and a buff request might slip our attention. <br />
So if you dont get your buffs even after waiting a certain time (i suggest 2-3 minutes) just refresh yor request. Its simple as that. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope these ramblings help you all to understand a bit the role and work of a Shaman. And make you and your next raid a bit more efficient and rewarding. <br />

&quot;*** This aint the commons tunnel *** <br />
<br />
So please DONT ask me for SoW. You wont get it. I am busy with other things. See that guy over there? That fragile green man with the funny hat which looks like spaceship? Thats a ranger. He will help you gladly with SoW. And it helps him to get the feeling that he is needed. &quot;<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rikkardo Montalban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey now,<br />
<br />
I'm hard pressed to decide what to take with me now when duo'ing.  Me widdle ranger just got his FoN spell and when he's with me, Its like a bard, only more damage output....  The regen is frankly amazing.  Then again, going all regen seems to really be the way to go for me.  I cant leech a breeze some nights...<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly, last ToV raid I was on, a_cleric_01 randomly goes LD during multiple mobs.  a_cleric_02 announces OOM.  MA goes down, SA soon follows.  Raid leader announces camp-out.  Me the dumb-arsed troll decides to buy some time for cleric to camp out so he stays in.   Ranger with big brass ones the size of basketballs decides to do the same thing. Other shammy on raid (who is FM and with Torpor) camps out immediately.  I'm sitting there with a_druid_01 at 50m, me at 20m with a fresh mob beating on the ranger....<br />
<br />
Well, a tear rolls up in my eye.....  Back in 'ye old Ranger days, I remember the disposable ranger theory....<br />
<br />
a_druid_01 is sitting there chain-'blasting our default assist while I sit there and pray to cazic that Aego will hold another 15 mins while I canni-dance my way around the HoT.<br />
<br />
anyways, it looks grim, after all, &quot;its just a ranger.&quot;  So, /hotfunallnight (raid channel, we got some cyber-junkies on our first choice)   we hear every 30 seconds, raid leader is asking whether or not to IM the cleric to come back in for rezs... We dont respond.  A minute later its &quot;Naw not yet....&quot; Ranger is beating on mob....  Every 30 seconds &quot;Is he (ranger) dead yet?&quot;  Nope, still beating... After 4 mins it becomes &quot;Are you guys dead yet?&quot;  Nope, still beating, still canni-dancing, still healing, still slowing.  6 mins later &quot;Are you guys winning?&quot;  Yep.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Ranger effectively solo's a_ToV_Mob with a OOM shammy at 200hps and a druid hopelessly OOM.    Ranger sits there exhausted with full hps.  a_torpor_shammy_at_FM logs back in with a_sweaty_oom_LOH_shammy glaring at him for giving up.....<br />
<br />
The mob didnt drop jack..... Would've been poetic justice for a chain drop for the poor soul who everyone wrote off as wyvern-food.<br />
<br />
Dont write off the rangers... Geez, they have it hard enough as it is. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Perhaps if we asked Doedel nicely he'd update it for us. I used this to form the basis for a guide for my guild and have updated it as new spells have been added plus putting some of my own quirks in there, but I've definitely lost some of his humour in doing so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hahah, i had forgotten about that. The ranger description is by far the best.</div></div><hr />
