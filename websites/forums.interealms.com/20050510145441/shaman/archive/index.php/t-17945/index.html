<br />
Group2: Shammie 65, Wizard 65, Druid 65, SK 65, Monk 65, Enchanter 65<br />
<br />
<br />
Gear is comperable:  G2 wins by a nose though. (Example is the two Sk are only off by probably 200hp)<br />
AA Definately goes to G2 by about 50+AA avg higher on G2<br />
<br />
Neither group does PvP, we are a blue server.  Just kicking over the idea for giggles between friends as to who'd win :)<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?  Tactics?  If you had to put some PP down on one group which and why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How would you kill people in group 1 with 2 clerics and a bard?  400+ resists, unresistable manadrain and selos are tough to beat.

I'm no PVP expert though... /shrug</div></div><hr />

They don't need a tank per se, because any of them can tank against a PC easily with all that backup.<br />
<br />
You would have to concentrate on killing their clerics and bard, but while you were screwing around with that and getting nowhere, their dps would blow you out of the water :o</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok, lets look at the sequence of events :D<br />
<br />
you manaburn and HT the bard. He's dead. You rejoice. This would almost certainly work since either of them are likely to do their max of 75% damage on him, but both together would easily kill him as long as you didn't give the cleric a chance to get him above 75% again.<br />
<br />
Now, you have to kill 2 clerics, a SK, a BL, and a mage. <br />
<br />
So, you concentrate your firepower on a cleric, with maybe someone harassing the other cleric to try and interupt their heals. Perhaps you can mez the clerics now. Of course this all assumes that they didn't go after your chanter first, like I would - mage nukes, then SK HT perhaps.<br />
<br />
If you could get their clerics and bard, I would say you could win. If not, they can just chain rez and keep going - and once they have the bard up again, it would be virtually impossible to kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd take group 2 if I was heading into pvp.<br />
<br />
Two instakillers will take care of that bard(and drop him asap).Enchanter can mez people and strip buffs (starting with the clerics). Two Clerics aren't going to kill anyone in group 2 anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If not, they can just chain rez and keep going - and once they have the bard up again, it would be virtually impossible to kill him. <br />
<br />
I'm going under the assumption that once your dead you are out of the pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, the key is the dead bard.  With the bard down, the first group is toast.  <br />
<br />
The shaman from group two isn't going to be able to do jack really, but with a chanter there, he might be able to take on the BL or something.  <br />
<br />
After group one loses its selos, huge resists and unresistable mez and manadrain, it's just a matter of time before the melees will get some lucky shots/stuns on the clerics and drop the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Are you guys running to the big arena or fighting in the tiny bazaar one?  Is rez allowed?  You say gear is comparable, what level gear?  How high are resists?<br />
<br />
More info please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">G2 will win with the right strat in an arena, Rapture ganking is lame but deadly effective =)<br />
<br />
Rapture the bard, SK gets in range and HTs, Wizzy Manaburns.<br />
<br />
Enchanter rapture gimps the clerics<br />
<br />
Shaman malos' everyone, then focuses on keeping the pets rooted and keeping the ench up.  Maybe throw a few annuls around if your opponents don't have clickies.<br />
<br />
Wiz/sk/mnk go to down on the bst first (As that pet will be a pain to manage compared to the mage pet + vs good resists the bst will be the biggest damage dealer), then the mage (As he will likely die easy), then the SK last.<br />
<br />
Druid = keep everyone but the clerics dotted non stop, if they are in non uber gear spam snare like hell, if they have got sufficient resists to negate it, just heal between dots.<br />
<br />
I'd guess if G1 were smart they would go straight for your ench but be prepared to dump heals on whoever eats the opponent SK's HT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fateholder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">wheres the necro lol, life tap + lifeburn = teh win.  of course this is blue server so no manaburn or lifeburn so id say group 1 ill own.  <br />
<br />
only way u would stand chance is if enchanter has rapture=unresistable mez on bard and then u go pound the liven snot out of him. and even thats iffy if the bard has ancient mez=unresistable mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Looking at your gear I'm guessing you've all got ~ntov to low end pop raid gear / mid luclin (IE no VT stuff).<br />
<br />
So chances are the bard hasnt got the ancient mez and is somewhat unlikely to have ervaj's lame manadrain =)<br />
<br />
In that case I'd guess the group 1 could make or break the fight in the first minute, presuming group 2 goes straight for the bard at the start with manaburn/HT....<br />
<br />
The bard + 1 cleric run directly away from the enchanter, everyone else charges him, the bst or second cleric should watch for anyone getting raptured and break it, the second that ench drops below 75% = HT away.  The second anyone gets Manaburned or HT'd, bard sets off group DA, the first cleric that backed off clicks it and hits Divarb as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
At that stage, hopefully G2 will have a dead ench, an nearly oom wizard and an SK with no HT, then its purely a case of killing of the shaman/druid before the second groups melees kill them, if the bard hasnt got ancient mez/mana drain he can't really do a lot except slowly annoy them until those healers die.<br />
<br />
If the melees have sufficiently low MR, the clerics should get MoR on them, a MoR'd monk = useless beyond hassling people with a tstaff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Group1: Bard 65, Beast Lord 65, Mage 65, SK 65, Cleric 65, Cleric 65.<br />
<br />
Group2: Shammie 65, Wizard 65, Druid 65, SK 65, Monk 65, Enchanter 65<br />
<br />
Depends on your server, group one will win regardless.  Any bard with a brain will just DA song as soon as the MB particles are in sight, as well as this neat thing called crimson potions &gt; rapture.  <br />
<br />
Your bard will selos the group, and slam your druid first, your shaman second, now group 2 cannot heal.  Mage sends in earth pet on the wizard during this and chain pells wizard.  Chanter can pell buffs but bard can easily dot the chanter up and bypass the runeshields.  <br />
<br />
If you think your harmtouch is going to get off at the same time as a manaburn w/rapture on a bard, and you do manage to somehow land a rapture and blow MB, the bard will ghost away (modem plugging) and heal up from a cleric.  <br />
<br />
The bard in the group wins.  Forget robes, robes fall to easy.  Replace the mage with a rogue, replace the BST with a paladin that way your real dps gets the selos and pets are not just rootable/stagnate.  I rather have a rouge/paladin seloed on someone then a mage/bst with selos.  <br />
<br />
Assuming all characters are +130 resists or lower, group 1 wins, if all resists are +400 or higher, group 1 still wins because a melee character with 500 to all resists with selos/haste is a pain in the tail to remove.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Group 2 could win if they are smart.  Manaburn/HT the bard, then mezz the clerics.  Slow the pets of the survivors and clean up.  The only problem is that SK HT is only slightly larger than the range of their melee, so if the bard is smart he will stay the hell away from the SK.  You can easily stop him from running away by having the ench cast rapture, which is unresistable.  Mezz the bard, surround him, 1-2-3 deathtouch.<br />
<br />
If the deathtouch AA tactic fails, tell the wizard and druid to load their AE rain spells.  These spells have wierd resists, in that they land easily  for a decent amount of damage even on a bard with 500 resists (this is true for our rains at least, I am just assuming wizard and druid ones work).  Mezz the clerics and kill the bard, then you win easily.<br />
<br />
The bard is the most powerful member of the first group, but he can't kill all of group2 by himself.  They can only manadrain once every 18 seconds, so draining your entire group of mana isn't going to happen. Also, even if they are stacking all 4 dots, you can heal it with just quiesence.  Them dot kiting and killing an entire group is not really feasible unless you are all tards.  Their melee will hurt them more than it does you if your druid casts a DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fateholder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">u can use mana burn on blue servers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">in an arena yes.  even if they kill the bard you can just rez him, and if he hits selos as soon as he lands he'll probably live, maybe even a bestow DA</div></div><hr />

<br />
Malo + Tash = Mez<br />
<br />
While the Wizzie and SK take out the Bard, The Shaman and Chanter Malo and Tash the clerics, then Mez them.  The druid starts snares, Shaman and druid will VP after Disease Debuff.  After getting them all separated and keeping the clerics mez, its just a matter of taking the rest down one by one.<br />
<br />
But in reality, its all about who's better at PvP.  If the other team takes out the Shaman before the bard goes down, its anyones fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I hate to say it, but group 2 will get roasted.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, anyone on the side of a bard is invincible. Mana burn and HT were nerfed in PVP. With two clerics, they will easily spam supernal remedy and keep up with your intial attack. Once that has failed, the whole group will be immune to all nonmelee damage except for wizard lures, which do 1500 damage in PvP if you get a lucky crit. On top of that, every melee shot you do take will be returned with a ~40 DS. Their haste cannot be dispelled, yours will. All this while the group prances around at selos speed.<br />
<br />
I would predict about a 1% chance of G2 winning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Mez won't do ****.  Someone on your team gets raptured, you hit them and break it.<br />
<br />
Group1: Bard 65, Beast Lord 65, Mage 65, SK 65, Cleric 65, Cleric 65.<br />
Group2: Shammie 65, Wizard 65, Druid 65, SK 65, Monk 65, Enchanter 65<br />
<br />
Assuming everyone's skilled group one wins hands down.  <br />
<br />
*If* you manage to take out the bard with dt/ht (i.e. he doesn't DA it, or one of 2 clerics doesn't target DA it) then you still have to deal with 2 clerics.   <br />
<br />
While group 2 focusses firepower on ping-ponged heals, group one pets the shaman and goes after the druid.  Beastlord pet is a monster in PvP and will cause problems for the shaman - eventually the druid will go down.  As stated above, if you must then just harm touch the druid (dont HT unless he's below 75).  With the druid down it's over.<br />
<br />
Mana burn and HT were nerfed in PVP. <br />
<br />
Sort of - a manaburn or HT can only do 75 percent of someone's current maximum hps (i.e. buffs do come into play).  2 simultaneous DTs or manaburns = instant death for anyone.  Neither does more than 75 percent, but together it's an instakill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If group2 has to burn their DT+MB to kill the bard they've lost already.<br />
<br />
Group2 will be stuck with an oom wizard. The group1 beastlord can sic his pet on that wizard, who won't get time to med for the duration of the fight.<br />
<br />
The group1 shadowknight still has his DT. Combining that with mage pet+mala+nukes and you got your first kill on group2. I would probably choose to kill the chanter. Once he is out your buffs are safe and the malo+tash combo is a nonissue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course with pvp there are so many variables that could change the fight. <br />
<br />
Some random thoughts:<br />
-If the bard has a shiny brass idol and group2's sk+wizard get off on their timing just a half second the bard will live.<br />
<br />
-How many AA's does each person have? Are the sk's both maxed out in the HT department? If not their HT's wont be DT's.<br />
<br />
-How are resists and spells? If the bard doesn't have sufficient magic resist and lacks DA song it will be easy to kill him using rapture (just to mess up his song twists and hopefully drop the resist song),tash,malo and add snare.<br />
<br />
-Are group2's shaman, chanter and druid good at tag teaming? If they are they can quickly neutralize many targets as long as everyone doesn't have too high mr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I would go with group two. Group one may have two clericsa, but once you take out your melee's in group one, its curtains for em. The wiz, sk and enchanter combo in group two makes for some nice blam pow, while the shaman can do wonders in the support role for that group. Just my two cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The one note that could completely sway everyone's opinion the bard cant keep more than 2 songs running.  People are assuming the bard is keeping Selos running along with MR and firing off DA while keeping haste up...  We are going to assume she will keep up MR and try working in melee.  Disease debuff/slow the tanks is first.<br />
<br />
Isnt rooting/snaring pets easy since they wont get the bard's resists?<br />
<br />
There is no rezzing after a death... though when people say that you can rez in the middle of a fight, arent you forgetting the person is rezzed in naked?  *** is a naked person going to do while bending down and looting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hard to Kite when your slowed and rooted and nuked = dead bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hard to Kite when your slowed and rooted and nuked = dead bard.<br />
<br />
Unless the bard sucks or you are extremely lucky, you won't slow or root a bard. You probably won't be able to nuke them either, but if you manage to catch them swapping songs you might be able to slip one in (particularly a poison or disease based Spear).<br />
<br />
Hell, if people have PVP gear, you'll be lucky to land any kind of spell without a significant innate resist mdifier on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The scenario really depends on assumptions.  Arena fight where both parties start fully buffed standing next to each other waiting for the &quot;go&quot;?  2 parties out adventuring and one notices the other first?  Who notices who first?<br />
<br />
If it's an arena fight, Group 1 wins.  They have all the tools to deflect the initial blows they know are coming, while the Group 2 has no choice but to attempt them or die.<br />
<br />
If Group 2 gets the first strike, they have a chance, but it's still a slim one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">There is no rezzing after a death... though when people say that you can rez in the middle of a fight, arent you forgetting the person is rezzed in naked? *** is a naked person going to do while bending down and looting? <br />
A bard doesn't need his gear to still be a pain in the ass, nor mana. He can run around naked and still have higher resists then anyone on team 2 and still be almost 100% effective.<br />
<br />
If anyone truely thinks they are going to be landing spells on another person in PVP just because of Malos/tash...you need to go play around some more in an arena.  BTW assuming the clerics have the AA they can just cure the whole group of any negative debuffs with radiant cures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">You are assuming that you can automatically kill the bard?<br />
<br />
What happens if the bard does group DA and blows one of your 2 insta-killers? Cleric has time to heal bard and group 2 is really screwed. I'd still put my money on group 1 assuming well equipped 65's. Average or Below average 65's might give group 2 a chance.<br />
<br />
Obviously, Group 2 needs to concentrate on bard. Group 1 should concentrate harder on killing shaman first, IMO. Key is to prevent shaman from getting off any Malos's. Chanter Tash can be more easily cured. Once group 1 kills shaman and chanter and removes malos/tash, then game over for sure regardless if bard is dead or not.<br />
<br />
If Group 2 MB bard and it bounces off DA, then wizard is out of commision and it's 6 on 5. 3 pets (5 if you count cleric hammers) endlessly chasing the shaman around will keep him interrupted and you will wear down the druid healing. All efforts to mez, charm, snare, root Pets or PCs will bounce with any kind of reasonable MR.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'd pay plat to see you MB a bard with ~450 in all resists at once. Not going to happen. Harm touch maybe, but that's ONLY if the bard somehow FORGETS he has a DA song. BTW, HT's can be resisted as well...<br />
<br />
Bards don't win in PvP because they are good at winning, they win because they are so good at NOT LOSING. That's a huge difference. They can outrun, out regen, out debuff and eventually just outLAST you. <br />
<br />
Mark my words, even if that Bard is only *mediocre*, he can take all of group 2 Solo.<br />
<br />
Hard to Kite when your slowed and rooted and nuked = dead bard.<br />
<br />
Slow is irrelevant, Bards don't melee in PvP. Root can be dispelled. You DO remember Bards get a dispell song at like...lvl 14 or something, right? Nuke? See the part about resists and regen. ANYTHING you do to a Bard, the Bard will have a countermeasure for. About the only thing the Bard can't defend against is a Chanter's tash, but that, by itself, won't win the fight. In fact, in a world where 500 MR is relatively achievable, I doubt it will make any difference at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">100% sure the bard cant get their resists up that high.  Remember to look at my Gear and like I said group 1 is lower than me... We are all as it was so observantly stated, Low PoP gear.  BoT Towers / LDoN Gear / Ornate and such.  <br />
<br />
When we were on a raid with the bard she commented that she doesnt have the ability to get our groups resists to 500+ (like the bard that was in our group could, before we moved bards around).  When I was with the one Bard my MR was over 500 for the AD raid... swapped to this chick and our resists were 350.  Malos &amp; Tash stack right?  <br />
<br />
Mana burn is unresistable... <br />
<br />
The one thing I dont understand is how everyone keeps saying the stuff a Bard can do.  <br />
<br />
Dispell, Haste their group, Mana/HP Regen, Selos, MR, PR, DR, FR, CR, DA, Charm, DS...... Unless I'm mistaken they can only hold 3 up at a time (a good bard can get 4... with a small break inbetween songs) but my point is that If they are keeping up their MR they dont get rooted, if they keep up their FR, then the sham/druid ice nuke, the wiz lures, the SK poison nukes.... how is one bard going to beat this group?<br />
<br />
I understand you are saying a bard is good but I'm convinced that no matter how good a single bard would die to a group casting Ice/ Fire/ Poison/ Magic damage.  The bard cant keep everything up at once.<br />
<br />
I realize the biggest asset the bard brings is that they can do so much and are such a pain in the arse so that it gives the other group time to deal damage while group 2 works the bard.  Still I think it's funny when someone says &quot;try this tactic&quot; and there is a response of &quot;DUH a bard can counter that with THIS&quot;  well... that's true but 6 people bringing their load to bear on a bard it's goign to go down.  And like I said... they wont be keeping 6 songs up, not even 4, not even 3, they'd be lucky to keep 2 up.  So pick your favorite one song and run with putting that in the equation.  But listing 3 dozen things a bard can do is kinda silly, they cant do it all at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Going to have to disagree with you on several points there Coccyx.<br />
<br />
1) Manaburn is unresistable, thus making the bards resists irrelevant. Likewise, since the resist changes I have never ever resisted a PvP harmtouch.<br />
<br />
2) Bard dispell is mostly random in its effect. Unless the bard is running about with no buffs whatsoever (except long duration selos, which he btw doesn't need to twist) then a malo has a pretty good chance of staying on. Especially if you combine that malo with a ro's fiery sundering and other magic based debuffs/dots. The other approach is to simply focus dispelling on the bard, rapture him and debuff him before one of his team has a chance to break the rapture.<br />
<br />
3) Nukes work fine vs a bard because nukes are not all or nothing ordeals, like our crappy dots. <br />
<br />
4) The bard does not have a countermeasure for rapture, unless he is going to commit one full song to twisting a dot on himself, which btw will conflict heavily with his 450 resists. Using crimson potions will not work against someone who has counteract disease up or a properly equipped chanter (shield of the immaculate).<br />
<br />
5) Bards get aria of asceticism, which will remove tash in 3 seconds. Without fail. As a shaman I know all to well about this song.<br />
<br />
One well played enchanter can more than well keep the bard busy the entire fight AND have spare mana/time to dispell and tash other targets as well. Obviously this all comes down to personal skill/experience in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If you take the fight to the level of concentrating all 6 people on the bard, who will be defending the chanter and shaman?  While the entirety of group 2 is after the bard - the mage pet, beastlord pet, sk pet, and 2 cleric hammer pets take the enchanter while the BL, Mage, SK, and 2 clerics take the shaman.  With all that interrupting goodness and no defense or healing (since group 2 is all out offense on the bard) - shaman, chanter, and wizzy (self-spent) are gone from group 2.<br />
<br />
That's the problem here - if you don't take out the bard fast, he makes the encounter very difficult.  If you concentrate on the bard to take him out early, you have to worry about the rest of the party.  The pets of both groups are relatively easy to deal with using a nice root.  Unfortunately, that root takes a few seconds for the caster to target and actually cast the spell.  If that isn't done first, group 1 has a pretty fair numbers advantage, on top of the spell casting neutralization ability of the bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Going to have to disagree with you on several points there Coccyx.<br />
<br />
1) Manaburn is unresistable, thus making the bards resists irrelevant. Likewise, since the resist changes I have never ever resisted a PvP harmtouch.<br />
<br />
2) Bard dispell is mostly random in its effect. Unless the bard is running about with no buffs whatsoever (except long duration selos, which he btw doesn't need to twist) then a malo has a pretty good chance of staying on. Especially if you combine that malo with a ro's fiery sundering and other magic based debuffs/dots. The other approach is to simply focus dispelling on the bard, rapture him and debuff him before one of his team has a chance to break the rapture.<br />
<br />
3) Nukes work fine vs a bard because nukes are not all or nothing ordeals, like our crappy dots. <br />
<br />
4) The bard does not have a countermeasure for rapture, unless he is going to commit one full song to twisting a dot on himself, which btw will conflict heavily with his 450 resists. Using crimson potions will not work against someone who has counteract disease up or a properly equipped chanter (shield of the immaculate).<br />
<br />
5) Bards get aria of asceticism, which will remove tash in 3 seconds. Without fail. As a shaman I know all to well about this song.<br />
<br />
One well played enchanter can more than well keep the bard busy the entire fight AND have spare mana/time to dispell and tash other targets as well. Obviously this all comes down to personal skill/experience in pvp.<br />
<br />
1) If manaburn is indeed unresistable, then it's up to the DA song, or just running out of range. Same thing for HT. No sane Bard is going to get close enough to an SK to get HT'd.<br />
<br />
2) Fair enough, but by the same token, anyone who's serious about PvP will know about crystalized pumice...<br />
<br />
3)Again, there's nothing stopping the Bard from running out of range before the spell lands, or letting the spell land and running OOR to regen the hp back<br />
<br />
4)Rapture is good, but it's long recast works against you when you are grouped. Too many people looking to nuke/dot that poor little Bard. Again, the Bard could just run away.<br />
<br />
5)Tash-Aria fights are pretty much pointless. The Bard can remove it indeffinately, but the Chanter can just reapply it indeffinately as well. And as I said, it probably won't make a big enough difference either way.<br />
<br />
Bards don't have to do it all at once. The only thing they really need to be able to do is keep running away, coming back and wearing you down. Like I said, it's not that they are so good at winning, it's that they are so good at NOT losing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Yeah I agree that Bards can Just run away and regen and such... when they do that they are now out of range for heals from the clerics, and keeping resists (only real reason to have the bard in there) on the rest of the group.  Also there is no DA when the bard is licking it's wounds in the corner.  Taking a person out of the fight for a few minutes is the same as killing them if you ask me.  The idea is the same we take the bard out of the equation instantly.<br />
<br />
Thinking to be honest you dont have to MB the Bard.  Some rules we were kicking over were only group self buffed.  so each group goes into the Arena and buffs at the gate with only their group's buffs.  That means that if the bard leaves G1 has no haste/MR.  True G1 has Aego while instead G2 has PotN &amp; Focus/Stam/MR/FR/CR/VoQ.<br />
<br />
Chanters cant charm at all in PvP any more can they?  Even pets?  <br />
<br />
I'd dissagree that the bard doesnt have to worry about things like tash because in 3 seconds they can get rid of it.  All it takes is another 3 seconds to keep throwing it back on and while they are getting rid of Tash they are letting their resists drop.  I think G2 just has such a range of Fire /Cold /Magic /Poison nukes that by changing it up the nukes it would really screw them up.  <br />
<br />
HT is instant also... the second the Bard is below 75% they die. Sk Life taps while wiz lures that gets the bard down to below 75% a couple times and the clerics are worried spending mana to over heal right away.<br />
<br />
Still havent heard, Bard buffs dont land on pets right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Sajem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">ok...the bard running isn't a problem...not if u can just get MR (think so) or DR low enuff to VP or Root. or just Snare. problem with bard leaving gone.

<br />
i myself played a Bard only to 15, but i got good enough to twist 4 songs at a time. course the cast time on those weren't high either. everyone is making it sound like the ENTIRE match rests upon the Bard. i agree that Bards ARE awsome, but not invincible.<br />
<br />
i don't know a whole lot about other classes at high lvls, tho i've played a Beasty (11 atm...neglect my alts) and their pets are killer. but really they're just a weaker version of a Shaman.<br />
<br />
i've also never done PvP, (unless u count a lvl 5 newb challenging u at lvl 38 as anything... :p ) so i can't comment on this factor much.<br />

Any input is good input.  Some things to remember though... BL are much more than just a weaker version of a Sham.  Their DPS is 80% of a Monk and they can slow almost as well as a sham.  They do have an insanely fast/good DD too if I remember correctly.  Then their pet is a pain in the arse if only that we have to take the time to root it to the side and they can put a stun proc on him for if he does get close enough to attack.<br />
<br />
Bards have HUGE versatility they can kinda do a little of everything.  The biggest problem is that G2 doesnt know how G1 is going to play the bard.  Are they going to go all offense (Attack Haste/ Damage Shield/ DD/ Dots/ MR)   Or are they going to go all defensive (MR, PR, FR, CR, HP/Mana regen).</div></div><hr />

<br />
with song mod AAs, items, puretone etc, you can get like 250+ to all resists plus a hefty damage shield of out just this one spell.  even after malo/tash if they keep regular resists magic up they'll still have insane resists.  <br />
<br />
I'm still voting on the bard.  Just fight them a few times and let us know how it goes</div></div><hr />

A good beastlord wont let his pet be rooted for long.  And given the effort it takes to root it in the first place more often than not the pet will end up wreaking havoc.</div></div><hr />

Pets in PVP are Garbage.  And Pet classes know that.  But, necros don't really need their pet to rot you to death.  <br />
<br />
You don't like a pet in PVP you either pop it or worse make it go rogue on the owner.  Chain instant Dispell on pet.  Or worse cast charm on a pet (this will not charm the pet) wait until the duration is over and get a % chance the pet goes rogue on the master.   Then bye bye Beastie.<br />
<br />
If the Enchanter changes into the race of the person they are fighting and AE mesmerization... (targeting the owner's &quot;pet&quot; a Perma mez effect can occur if the master is in range of the Mesmerization.)  Where spells still don't brake the mez nor melee.  Did this on Vallon Zek yesterday.<br />
<br />
BSTs and Mages had some issues with their pets in PVP some have been fixed.  But not all.  I still Gank with my enchanter for fun on Vallon Zek.</div></div><hr />

I'd agree for any class except beastlord.<br />
<br />
MR on the highest beastlord pet is a serious pain in the ass.  With malos they'll still resist petrifying root which has an additional mr debuffer on it.<br />
<br />
Couple that with a beastlord's ability to both annul AND cure disease their pet, and talking about a group pvp situation where there are teammates to break rapture then you're talking about one hell of a time slowing that pet down.<br />

If you take a well equiped, properly aa'ed and skilled bard they could probably kill both groups solo as long as they avoided the 3 insta kills.<br />
<br />
Things like insane resists, hugely fast run speed, DA song, unresistable mez and mana drain (huge amounts of mana) make them major pains to kill.<br />
<br />
Their potency is highly dependant on thier gear and aa's tho since it's all based on mods. If you hit a bard site like eqdiva you can download a spread sheet that will let you calculate the effect of songs based on all the variables. I think over all you can tripple the effectiveness of songs compair to base with appropriate setup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Group1: Bard 65, Beast Lord 65, Mage 65, SK 65, Cleric 65, Cleric 65.<br />
<br />
Group2: Shammie 65, Wizard 65, Druid 65, SK 65, Monk 65, Enchanter 65<br />
<br />
<br />
Not big on pvp but here is my suggestion for g2 victory.<br />
Bard will be self dotted no doubt so Mezz will be worthless.<br />
<br />
To start:<br />
Ench2 use Rap and Ancient Ramp on BL1 (strip buffs and debuff pet) If BL is self Dotted with Stinging Wart. it will be debuffed soon enough and if its self dot'ed with disease, then have SK2 get on him after HT until Shaman can land a Abolish Disease on him so he can be Raptured.  If not, then keep mezzed while debuffing G1 with Recant and Pillage (from VT bracer). Put Ench pet on one Cleric.  Once all are hit a few times with debuff.  Suck mana while keeping BL and pet mezzed.  Eldr Rune and Arcane will help.  SK1 should be working over Enchanter with HT and melee so watch Enchater health.<br />
<br />
Monk2 on Mage asap.<br />
<br />
SK2 should HT and Wiz should MB Bard asap, Shaman can use Malicious Decay, then VP3 to root interupt Selo's long enough for HT and MB to kill bard.<br />
<br />
Druid must have all DS'ed, same with Enchanter's DS.  Heal Wizard asap and Druid debuff Fire/cold asap and patch heal Monk and Enchanter.  Once Fire/Cold debuffs in, Druid can Nuke at will on Clerics.<br />
<br />
Shaman must put pet on Second Cleric asap along with SC to hold Clerics at bay until Bard is delt with.  This should cause Cleric to Burn DA to limit Damage from SC.  Then VP3 (VP3 is key here) after casting Malicious Decay on Bard.  Then Debuff and slow SK1 while keeping Q on pets (who should be on both Clerics)<br />
<br />
At this point the only melee free is the G1 SK who, if he's smart is trying to kill the Enchanter.<br />
<br />
Bard now should be dead, Mage should be just about dead and pet should be close to half life if not dead from Monk DS. SK2 should be on SK 1 after Bard dies or if Enchanter is ok, should get on Mage pet. Enchater is now free to continue Recant Magic on whats left of G1 while Keeping BL and Warder Mezzed.<br />
<br />
Wizard needs to gather mana and nuke Clerics. Debuff if he has the Pillage Enchantment bracer from VT.<br />
<br />
BL and Warder should be mezzed still and debuffed and slowed.<br />
<br />
Shaman VP3 should be up again and can VP root SK1.  If successful, then SK2 can work over BL Warder first.  If not then SK2 stays on SK1 until dead or until Rooted out of fight.<br />
<br />
At this point, if all goes as planed, Bard is dead, Mage is dead, Sk1 is dead and BL shild be engaged by Monk and SK (easy kill at this point) Enchanter has Clerics Raptured to prevent healing and Shaman, wizard, And Druid are nuking BL and Warder.  Then once all G1 Melee is dead you kill Clerics one at a time.<br />
<br />
The biginning is the most critical part.  Bard will have the whole group selo'ed and even if interupted by shaman's VP3, it will continue on the other group members for a few seconds before it drops so you have to get to your first targets fast once Selo's drops.<br />
<br />
Ok, that strat is based of limited knowledge of PvP and other class AA so for all those who know better, feel free to rip it apart.  I just put it out there as a suggestion.  Take from it what you will. :)<br />
<br />
IMO, everything in G1 has, rests on the Bard.  But remember, the Bard will have to do Drive-by stripping so group resists might be hard for the Bard to keep up if running oor.  Since G1 depends on Bard debuffs (Mage just has Mala), the Bard is key to the victory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Ench2 use Rap and Ancient Ramp on BL1 (strip buffs and debuff pet) keep mezzed while debuffing G1 with Recant and Pillage (from VT bracer).

SK1 should be working over Enchanter with HT and melee so watch Enchater health.<br />
<br />
In team PVP you can't keep someone raptured.  One melee hit breaks mez/rapture, and if you have a team, then they can break it for you.  1 on 1 yes mezzing works.<br />
<br />
SK2 should HT and Wiz should MB Bard asap, Shaman can use Malicious Decay, then VP3 to root interupt Selo's long enough for HT and MB to kill bard.<br />
<br />
I agree they need to take out the bard.  But it won't be that easy.  Landing VP on a bard playing resists = not going to happen.  Even if it does land, the bard can cure, and you also have 2 radiant curers in the group.<br />
<br />
I still maintain that group 2 is fuked.  Put interrupts on shaman while you take out druid.  Take out chanter.  Take out shaman.  Kill the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Doesnt VP interupt Bard songs even if it doesnt land?  Havent used it on a Bard yet but have used it on an Enchanter during a PvP and it did interupt the casting even though it didnt land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">What's the innate resist adjustment on Venomous Paralysis? Malicious Decay is only -53 resist, according to Lucy. That's not much to rely on if you want to root a PvP-expecting bard. <br />
<br />
I am not remotely an expert on PvP, but I'd expect a 65 bard to add at least 75*(1.8+0.2+0.6) = 195 to all resists with Psalm of Veeshan, and it could easily be as high as 3.6*75 = 260 to all resists. A really well AA'd bard could make it even a bit higher than that. This doesn't require anything uber, either. Just bard epic, an item from Ssra (that you can get solo, if stubborn and post 60, or easily duo), easily available songs, and a few AA's. Any L63+ bard that wants to could do it. <br />
<br />
If you add that to base resists on a bard with decent gear, VP would have to have at LEAST an innate -100 resist mob to hope to stick it to him, and probably more, wouldn't it? <br />
<br />
I'm not expert on PvP, as I've said, but you're likely looking at trying to stick spells to someone with at LEAST 300 in all resists, and possibly a lot more. My bard with just psalm of veeshan and maximum use of available bonuses can make all his resists break 400 - in standard gear and with no outside resist buffs. And he isn't even elemental geared (although I do have lots of VT gear). Can you stick VP to that? <br />
<br />
I'm not saying you can't - I don't know how resistable VP is. But I'd be surprised if it's a -300 resist check or something like it. <br />
<br />
All of this is just an illustration of what a bad PvP game EQ is, since it's balanced for PvE first. <br />
<br />
Also, the L 49 bard selo's lasts 2.5 minutes, so if he gets one pulse of it off near the rest of his group, you'll have to deal with them moving fast for quite a while. <br />
<br />
The resist song, however, only has a 12-18 second duration, so it might be difficult for him to keep it up continuously on everyone, if he's trying to dodge around out of spell range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I just had one more thought on those group compositions. <br />
<br />
Assuming both clerics have decent AA's, and have bestow divine aura and divine arbitration, that group is gonna be very hard to kill. <br />
<br />
All in all, I'd bet on Group 1, because Group 2's entire hope is to drop the bard extremely fast in an all-or nothing shot. And even if they do, the wizard is oom and it's almost a 5-on-5 fight at that point anyway. <br />
<br />
Heck, people have mentioned spirit call. What if the mage uses the magician equivalent on one of group 2's casters? Is manaburn interruptible?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">if your bard has comparable gear resists to your own, with tash and malo, snare will still land, despite his songs.  gear resists &gt; song resists.  if you've pvp'd long enough, you should know that.<br />
<br />
as far as who wins, you're all assuming that those people actually understand what they're doing.  pvp in groups is completely unlike pvp solo, and completely unlike bluebi grouping.  considering you all are blue, have never played pvp for any length of time, am guessing this fight will look like the special olympics of pvp.<br />
<br />
you people talking about manaburn are assuming that the wiz would even bother wasting it on the bard.  quite frankly, with ntov gear, at 65, a wizard hardly needs to use mb to kill a bard with that type of gear.<br />

<br />
I guess they didnt read that <br />
A) My gear is about the highest of the group. <br />
B) I have the same or higher AA than anyone in Group1.<br />
C) The bard can MAYBE twist 3 songs under ideal conditions yet will probably just pick the same 3 songs and keep those running w/o adapting so much.<br />

 okay you all talk like its bard vs g2 hehe.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2751&amp;source=Live &lt;- manaburn = 6secs casting time... if you are going to let a wizzard cast that, and letting the sk HT in the same time, you have a real stupid crew aka g1 :p. if you have a sk chaseing the wiz all around he wont have a sec to stand still and cast, and bard can easy run oor from wizzard if he pays alittle attention to what he is casting.<br />
<br />
 ofcourse considering SK aa's if he uses disc or no, bards resist and such there would be decent chance for a resist on the HT.<br />
<br />
 no chance g2 could win...<br />
<br />
 2 clerics alone is allmost impossible to kill... add a bard to that and you have fort knox :P go selo and no melee can catch them... <br />
<br />
 considering a shiny brass idol, target DA, DA song... you are pretty well secure.<br />
<br />
i would say stick g1 sk on g2 wizzard, and bard, mage and BL on the enc... the clerics should just mind sticking the bard alive...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>laxen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">bard here, /wave asta<br />
<br />
<br />
HT/mt is the killer for the bard... barring crits, there is not much the other group can do...tash gets dispelled, dots get dispelled, vp gets dispelled and mezz gets broken (either own dots, crimson, other members or, most frequently, by the other team..P)..<br />
<br />
however, &quot;gear&quot; makes alot of diffrence, as the best pvp songs for us is either runes or ancient spells... do the bard have ancient mezz, manadrain, cure song and pop dots/psalm? Also bellow is a 50/50 shot of interupting spells<br />
---<br />
<br />
If you are low on pvpexperience however, the chanter would be a winning factor with rapture and ancient rapture. Mez/tash/malo/flux and kill<br />
<br />
----<br />
luck is a factor... crits cant be resisted... however, if group 1 can keep the druid/shammy from heals (easier than to keep the clerics from it) the bard'll prolly drop the chanter fast with dots from maxrange doding spells.. <br />

anyhow, pvp is uber fun.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Jaffo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Just my 2cents worth, but a couple of things that hasnt been taken into consideration yet. I am a 65 Cleric and they have a few skills other than healing when it comes to this type of encouter. 1. Almost everyone here has came up with these elaborate secnarios all based on getting X-Y-or Z spell cast on the bard with in the first few seconds of the match. You havent taken into consideration what G1 is doing those first few seconds. 2. You are assuming that G1 is going to go all defense and no offense at that point. 3. You stated that each group was selfbuffed, well to add to that resist check dont forget that clerics also have resists buff, yea they are only 40 but they can add 40 to all resists, also virtue, spell haste, Bulwark of vie which absorbs 10% of all melee damage. 4. And as for the shaman DoT while i do agree they are very powerful vs NPC's they still (correct me if i am wrong) only add at the most 9-10 disease or poision counter's which is very easy for either cleric to remove via spell's along, then take into consideration RC3 and purify soul (removes all effects minus rezz, fear). 5. Also you are assuming that either cleric is going to allow that wizzard to start casting much less MB which takes 6 seconds to cast. <br />
<br />
<br />
    So in this match i would have to go with G1 due to simple fact that G2 will attempt to kill the bard first thus devoting all thier power to that goal. If G1 was half ass worth anything they would begin with Celestial regen as soon as the fight started instant cast 250 Hp's a tick for 8 ticks and this is assuming they dont have any of the AA's to increase it power. Also you can forget about the idea of the G2 DS 1 cleric would MoR and cleric 2 would MoK G2 which in case you didnt know MoR and MoK overright any present DS on the target so that druid DS is now gone. Also G1 still has mage DS up so G2 is going to take 79 points of damage everytime they hit a member of G1, added to the fact G1 is going to get a 8 point heal everytime they hit a member of G2. Also even if the bard is OOR for songs the BST still can haste, and buff G1 and i am sure you all already they get almost the same line of buffs shaman's get they arent as good but they are still efective. And the mage can hatse the pets via just simple summoned pet packs i am sure you have all seen (50% haste). Added into that is the fact the mage DS addeds 45 to fire resists so G1 is upto 85 fire resists without bard song so those druid Nukes you where counting on most likely wont land even without the bard song, so the druid is left with a cold based nuke which in PvP can only do 750 Dmg for 400mana and it is 6.5 second cast time which i doubt anyone would allow him that much time to cast any spell. Those 2 clerics if they are at all competent are going to stun the wizzard, chanter, druid anytime they try to cast couple that with the fact that the wizzard most likely has a mage pet on him and the chanter has a Bst pet on him. And i would guess that the 2 clerics would send thier hammers after the shaman for nothing more than harrasment and would go after the druid and melee him. The procs from their summoned hammers and yaulp can be deadly considering the fact they are unresistable 75-150 HP DD and as you all know between 2 clerics you are most likely catching at least 1 proc every round of melee. Now the rest of G2 have to decide wether to continue chasing the bard for that kill or try to assist thier team if they chose to help the druid then the chanter and wizzard are toast and even if they do help the druid they arent going to kill either cleric while they still have mana. And if they help the wizzard then they lose thier chanter and main healer and if they help the chanter then thier main DPS and main healer die also if they help any then that gives the bard freedom and eliminated any chance of landing any sort of spell on G1. And i havent even mentioned the G1 mage or Bst in that senirio, and for all those that thing they are going to drop either cleric i would say highly doubtful until both clerics are OOM, and with 2 Celestial Regen's and 1 Parogon of Spirt to help heal and mana regen it is going to take a long time. I will agree that outside of them gettig within melee range of the druid and killing him that way they arent going to contribute alot to the overall DPS of G1 but they will allow G1 to continue fighting long after G2 has went OOM trying to heal and cast DoTs and nukes. As for the G1 SK i would have him save his HT until the first time that shaman trys to canni then as soon as he does i would have the mage nuke him and the Sk HT to elimate him. So overall thier are many different situations and secniors you can play.<br />
<br />
  But in all truth the buffs you can forget about, both  groups if they are smart are going to be using Pumice stones to canel all those mana free. What it comes down to is simple duration if things dont go absoultly perfect for G2. If they try to kill the bard and dedicate all their man power and resourses to that goal they will leave them selves way to open for G1 to elimate the wizzard. druid, and chanter. Even if G1 dosent elimate all 3 they will manage to kill at least 1 and prevent the other 2 from casting. If G2  dosent elimate the bard quickly then they are fighting with only reists form gear and no form of haste or SoW, while G1 is fighting with bard resist song, haste and selo's. Which is only 3 songs he isnt doing anything complex at all jsut twisting 3 songs and FYI selo's last 2.5 minutes so for 2.5 minutes he is only twisting 2 songs and hiting selo's when he see's if flash not alot of work. And in those 3 songs along he will add 75 to all resists, 30 p DS 60% haste and + to str and ATK. And if G2 hasnt canceled magic on them selves yet (assuming they have done so to G1) then they are still taking 64HP's of DMG everytime they hit a member of G1 and if they didnt debuff G1 then they are going to be taking 109 HP's of damage everytime they hit a member of G1 and if they have allowed all those DS to stay up then both the shaman and druid will go OOM very fast and even if the have the druid and shaman can not compete with 2 clerics in how long they can continue to heal, and as i said above as soon as the shaman trys to canni i would have the mage and SK hit him hard no matter the timing if mage nukes him then a couple of seconds later the SK HT he will still die due to the fact the druid cant heal him fast enough and Q can't heal him enough fast enough to withstand both assaults. So in the end it comes down to G1 with pets has to many tools avaiable and G2 cant go after both pet's the bard and both clerics and kill them fast enough to overcome that much. And the second downfall of G2 would be if the fight went long then with the 2 clerics G1 could just outlast them.  And your not going to kill those 2 clerics very fast with DA /DB and if they have the AA's then a total of 3 DA type spells plus you are not going to be able to interupt both clerics constantly on a 1.8 second cast of remedy, not to mention group heals so if even 1 cleric manages to cast your back at square 1 with G! full health, and then throw in divine arb it would take along time to kill both of them. And i could almost guarentee that the enchanter for G2 will be the first tgt to die, followed by the druid. And as for your wizard if he uses MB then he is usless but even if he dosent unless he crit's every cast (can only do half dmg in PvP anyway even with crits) thier is noway for him to do dmg faster than 2 clerics can heal it. And with at least one pet on him it would be hard for him to get to many casts off. If G2 wanted to stand a chance then they need to replace that wizzard or chanter with a necro.<br />
<br />
    I appoligize for the long winded reply, feel free to disagree, but thier are way to many what IF's and the perfect senario that need to happen in the G2 winning logic, given both sides are equal on exsperience with PvP and gear/ AA's. Then i dont believe that G2 would realistically be able to win.<br />
