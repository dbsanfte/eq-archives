<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been hanging about in Sirens solo lately since the sept '02 xp-change. I gain between 15-25% aa xp an hour with lower-average Oracle gear (see Magelo), depending on camp/buffs/workrate.<br />
<br />
Spells: Torpor, Malo, Bane, no Pox.<br />
AA: run/regen3, mc3, canni5, hg1, scr1<br />
No focus items as yet (faliken hat,CM wrist in pipeline..) <br />
<br />
OK, This is a guide for 'out-of-water hunting'. First off, 3 camp areas, each has 2 mob types: <br />
'Walrus'-Servant Manatee, Servant Sea Elephant, Servant Walrus<br />
'WalrusMan'-Enthralled Molkors, Bulthars and Ulthorks.<br />
More on Mobs later, first my camps:<br />
<br />
1/Lower Waterfall (~15%aa/hour): As you come in from CS, there is a spawn by zone (walrusman-type), then it opens out into a cavern with a large waterfall at the back. Two platforms flank the waterfall, each has a static walrus, and a roaming walrusman. Not enough for me with canni5, but a good casual camp if my other spots taken (have time to chat), safe and train proof. Pull everything to zone in, hover in water a few 'strokes' from CS zone-in room to maintain aggro on pulls from waterfall platforms.<br />
<br />
2/WW zoneline(~20% aa/hour working it self buffed, 20-25% with aego/kei.) Safespot right by zone line, though roaming Molkors will CH your mob without aggroing. Can pull lots of Mobs to here. Mainly killing Walrus, the roamer is always Walrusman type, so the trick is to kill the roamer, kill 2 walrus by succor spot, loop round the left wall kill next two. Then pull the static walrus further round hugging left wall, then the static walrusman to left of that before roamer repops. Biggest problem with this spot is High HP melees training through on route to WW/TOV, but this is counterbalanced by buffs and assitance from travellers (no monk can resist bashing ya walrus etc) <br />
<br />
3/ Central area near 'Walrusman' hut, above waterfall. Setup by rock ( to the left of where you pop out from seahorse pipe),or opposite lakeside from Moktor hut. I wouldnt recommend this solo unless you have a good feel for the zone/pathing and mob capabilities, as well as reliable splitting knowledge. Good Mix of Mobs, more than you can kill solo, but you have to be fairly on ya toes with spawns and roamers if going for max xp ;) short run to each zone if you screw up<br />
<br />
With self buffs I get 6, sometimes 7 mobs before repop (about 13-15mobs per hour), with aego/kei I can push 17-20 mobs an hour fairly consistently, lot of this depends on mob types and Molkors.<br />
<br />
'Walrus' Type Mobs: mantee(white), servant sea elephant (dark brown) servant walrus (brown). All melee mobs, none hit over mid/high 100's, low MR/PR/DR, high CR (pull with slow). at a guess I'd say 10-15k hp. When splitting, Pull mantees over elephants (this is close, they overlap), walrus always lowest. Can fight 2 at once or rootpark if adds fairly easily, but this dents efficiency a bit I find with my gimp gear.<br />
<br />
'Walrusman' Enthralled Mobs: Molkors (white), bulthars (dark brown), ulthorks (light brown). <br />
-Bulthars and Ulthorks are melee mobs, hit a bit faster and harder than the animal types, but a bit less hp overall. Fairly easy kills.<br />
-Molkors are what really makes SG fun. Cleric Mobs, 2 versions. Small Molkors are easy, don't Cheal or nuke much, easy to interrupt, not many hp (8k or so)<br />
Big Molkors these guys are fun. Can CH twice, gate, dispell themselves/you, chain nuke for 5-600's and hit like a truck. They have good MR so I always use Malo to pull.<br />
<br />
Buffs and tactics:<br />
acumen, MR, sta, focus. I use minimal buffs solo, rather use mana as Damage/hour than mitigation. Acumen/MR are junks to help with dispells(rare) so buff first. Keep MR&gt;100 for molkor fights, lot of partial resists. Pup gets celery, torpor as needed.<br />
<br />
Most Mobs are high CR, even after Malo (only use on Molkors). JBB fairly useless here. I fight with Iksar Tactics, keep Mob in constant state of Bane/epic/pup (60-70dps I'd guess), with ebolt or plague added on whim, while keeping mana constant with canni4/torpor. Each fight lasts about 3mins-4mins on the top stuff, I try to time it so torpor puts me in canni5 range as mob dies, bam canni5, bam torpor, walk to next pull spot, pull as torpor goes. I usually back myself to a wall/corner to minimise interrupts, except on molkors.<br />
<br />
Both sorts of molkor I use 'manaburn' tactics, pull with Malo, catch it on pet, slow molkor (usually stays on pet with taunt on), epic, torpor pet, bane, ebolt,attack on. Then I keep bane/ebolt refreshed while canni/torpor/bashing. Code Alpha pet is good for interrupts here. They start Cheal at 30%, position mob so pet is always pushing him (ie not into wall), moving mob z-axis helps interrupts. Another approach is start killing them slowly, making them go offensive nukage and mitgate with torpor. When they have landed 6-7 big nukes then dot-burn em ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I find SG good fun; yes I can probably reel in as much xp/hour in FG, but it's so damn repetitive killing shrooms even two/three at a time ;) The great thing with SG is aaxp moves every kill, 3 'good' kills can get me 5% aa movement in 12-13mins, but this is variable as mobs types are random.<br />
<br />
Loot is so-so. No coin, but plenty of trash gems, quest gems, merchant gems, netted kelp. I have trawled about 2 full suits so far for friends in all, plus it sells fast at my prices keke (I undercut the 'Merchants' by 50%ish, either they buy me out or someone gets lucky heh) ~2-3 hours solo gets me 1k+ of sellables.<br />
<br />
Oh and finally, a little excerpt to make ya giggle (I was self buffed, focus had just dropped, and torpor took on about 1100 hp)...<br />

<br />
Nice post. :)<br />
I soloed entrance at 56 w/ fungi+ epic.  It was very exciting.  Netted Kelp Pantaloons sales (got 2 in one day) helped fund some minor upgrades for me. :)  Couldn't handle more than that, and always had mobs up to kill.<br />
<br />
I haven't had a chance to get back there, but once I ding 58 with the new Kragg's Mending, I think I'm going to live there for awhile.  That place rocks! :)<br />
<br />
But shhhh, stay away. :p  <br />
It is Very dangerous. ;) Waiting for a ToV group cleric to come through is a big gamble, and pulling a guild cleric all the way over there is really asking alot.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hey.. This really seems interesting and i want to give it a go. 60 shaman..all my spells..run3/regen 3/ mc1  -- have a 60epic rogue too if it would help? still good exp ya think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I always run out of mobs to kill in there duo with 60 melee (around molkor hut, 12 statics 2 roamers) unless you take some of the harder stuff out the water as well ;)<br />
<br />
Fish are easyish, seahorses can be pita to split and some CH, I only usually do them with a FD puller -although hopping in/out of water can sometime wipe aggro on them (if undamaged), going to try this for splitting them solo sometime..<br />
<br />
Havent worked up the balls to go down the pipe to try sirens solo. They don't hit hard but are enchanters (mez/charm sucks, CR would be rough). Thinsk 150-200MR would be required for playing down here with the ladies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Demanocus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice Post. SG is one place I have not Solo'd yet. Been focused in ME, Akheva, and Seru. I think I'll take a spin at it.</div></div><hr />
