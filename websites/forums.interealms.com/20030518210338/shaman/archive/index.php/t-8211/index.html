<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rico</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently made a shaman and am making an account change soon so I can play with my brother's rogue and his friend's warrior.  I am making a shammy because I know from experience with my monk that they are the best class for a small group, and that is what i will mainly be doing.  I would just like to know what my role in a group like this (rog, war) would be, slower, healer and so on.  Also, I made an ogre because they are fun to play I feel and was wondering what kind of equipment I should try to get...my brother is in a pretty uber guild on his server so it shouldnt be too hard to obtain good equipment.  In advance thanks for any help.<br />

your duties will pretty much be as you have said. Healing, slowing, haste when you get it. As soon as a druid or cleric comes along, you should become back-up healer. You'll also be primay stat buffer. Sta Str Dex Agi. Get ready to be bugged ;) heh<br />
<br />
You can get some decent cheap Wis gear to get you started. Lower lvls are all about the Wisdom. Then as you progress towards 200+ WIS, you'll want to start looking into gear with more AC and MANA.<br />

Take a look at some of the Magelo profiles floating around, they should give you a good idea of what to shoot for in the long run.</div></div><hr />
