<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not asking what abilities I should buy I am asking where to find the window or whatever it is for leadership experience and skills.<br />
<br />
I am not at home now so I can not log on and check myself.<br />
<br />
I was the leader of my group last night and I was getting the message that I had earned leadership exp but I have no idea how to check how much I have or how to spend it.<br />
<br />
I have GoD installed btw.<br />
<br />
And yes, I did search before asking.<br />
<br />
(I'll be anything it is something very obvious right in front of me that I am overlooking).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Codlugarthia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I recall that correctly (at work now, too) You just gotta press 'L'.<br />
If that doesn't work, try 'Alt L'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dont need the alt, just press the letter L</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BTW, don't forget to look at the screen closely after you hit 'L'.  There are two tabs, one for raid leader pts and one for group leader points.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe it requires 3 people to get leadership exp.  That's hearsay, btw!  I haven't tested it myself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You definitely do NOT get leadership experience for two-boxing.  That would make it too easy to gain, I guess. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kraaga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You have to have at least 3 people in your group before you start gaining leadership XP. The amount you gain does not seem to be increased as you add people either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you need 3 people to get the experience do they all have to be in the same zone as you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">No they do not.  Much like how you can get 6 people together, solo in different zones, and still get the group exp bonus, you can get 3 people together, solo in different zones, and get the leadership exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail,  Much like how you can get 6 people together, solo in different zones, and still get the group exp bonus, you can get 3 people together, solo in different zones, and get the leadership exp.<br />
Doh!  I never knew you could do the 6 soloers grouped in different zones trick.  That's awesome.  I'll be doing this more often for both group and group leader exp. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">One little note also, you only gain leadership experience for mobs that are dark blue or higher. Light blues do not give leadership exp message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Also, I am not sure if this is true definatively, but I was noticing that I wasn't getting leadership exp off some mobs last night that were conning Dk Blue to me.  I was a leader in a raid, and I Know the mobs were conning light blue to some of our group members, so that might be why.  The mobs were just in my dk blue range, and out of the range of say our 59 pally (I'm 54) so it's possible that you only get leadership exp for mobs that con dk blue to the party.<br />
<br />
This would preclude you from having a 65 farm a bunch of light blues or greenies with you in tow raking up leadership exp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if I remember correctly for leadership  xp in raids youneed at least 3 FULL groups in your raid to get leadership points for raids.  Atleast that was what our Raidleader when we raided the Factory In PoI last night was saying</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well, i wasn't referring to raid leadership, but that is very good to know (we don't have 3 groups very often hehe).  I meant group leadership while on a raid.  I was a group leader and still didn't get leadership exp on some dk blue kills, but I'm pretty sure I recieved it on others (don't quote me on this... gonna check it again tonight) so I'm not sure if the 3 group standard applies to a group leader getting regular leadership exp.<br />
<br />
Might be that our group has to do the most damage, but I can't fathom the other group was outdamaging us, as we had the MT, the only Wizzy, a Rogue, and the only 65 (necro).  If they were our damaging us I'm just going to smack our group, as we should have been double/trippling their dps on every mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I dont think you can get GROUP leadership xp while IN a raid.<br />
<br />
i was getting leadership XP while in a group in Acrylia Caverns.  Most of the beginning mobs were green to our highest leveled group members, and i didn't get xp then.<br />
<br />
But when we got into the stronghold, I started to.  Had 5 people in the group at the time.<br />
<br />
To check on the skills, and buy them, press &quot;L&quot;.  You MIGHT have to switch to the default UI to do this -- I have a UI that does not support the leadership window and does nothing, but when I switch back to default, I can open it up.<br />
<br />
Some of the abilities i can't see using, but there are some that would DEFINENTLY be worth purchasing.<br />

<br />
You can get it just fine. And it doesn't suffer from the penalty either, it goes up fairly decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ya a raid is a good place to get it.  I have a question tho, what's the best skill to get first?  I was thinking of the Mark mob skill, just to be able to direct group movements a bit more.  But then I started thinking group dynamics/psychology and thought it may be more advantageous to get Increased HPs skill so that when I was leader, everyone gets more hps.  Which would make me be leader more often, no?  Anyone know how many hps extra this adds per tier?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Delegate Main Assist, NPC Health, and Mark NPC are my top priorities.<br />
<br />
Health is only 150ish for a LARGE cost considering leader is somewhat slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have Health 1 and it adds 30HP per person.  Not major HP but not too bad either....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I for one am getting the increased attack and the hitpoints.  It's not much, but it's a noticeable ingame difference.  As for the raid exp, the /findpc skill will be priceless for us.  We are a family guild with a rather large alliance, so we can take down middle sized targets, but most of the people in the raid are not familiar with eachother, and don't raid all that often.  I can't tell you how many times we loose people.</div></div><hr />
