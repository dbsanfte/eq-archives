<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tserin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After reading all these posts, i was wondering why nobody has mentioned Torgiran mines?  I just recently discovered this place on my server, FV, and i like it.  On my server it is usually desolate and doable solo IMHO.  Seems to be better suited for at least a duo or a small grp to be efficient.  I am currently soloing the entrance near the zoneline with little difficulty and a moderate amount of downtime.  Has anyone else spent signifigant time there and if so what was your experience?  Is it a realistic possibility to level in for a few levels?  If so, what range?  Input greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you're in dulak, you climb up the ladder to zone in here right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tserin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, up the ladder from the armory.  I think there is also another entrance from Nadox.  Haven't gone that way personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Torgiran mines are fun. From about 53 you can make excellent xp here. I solo'd from the dulak entrance all the way through to the huge room (no idea if it has a name) and all around the tunnels to the boss mob (didn't agro for obvious reasons). The mobs get harder as you progress, just note the different miners names and when they change expect a little harder battle. I had no problem slowing them but they often come in pairs. This is a fun zone, and usually empty. You can also get xp from handing in the keys that drop to the resistance miners who then poof.<br />
Enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tserin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Definitely fun and excellent exp for me so far at 52.  I too have never yet had a slow resisted and singles pulls are easy as long as i watch for the roamers.  In regards to the miners that you turn the keys into, i had mistakenly killed a few before i found out about the quest and never paid any attention to any faction hits when doing so.  If i kill too many does it ever get to the point where i can't turn in the keys?  Anyone know?</div></div><hr />
