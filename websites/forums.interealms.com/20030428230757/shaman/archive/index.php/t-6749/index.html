<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, now that we have PoP coming out in 4 days or so, our alchemy maximum will be rising to 205 skill.  I'm failing Potions of Greater Concentration at about 50%, so it must have a skill of about 200ish?  230ish?  Who knows, maybe we can make mana potions for 1300pp for 10 now instead of 1800pp! :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If PoP doesn't overhaul Alchemy considerably... no offense intended, but why would you bother?  Gate potions will have crap for a market with Talisman of Return hitting the game... melees will bind in Plane of Knowledge (click-port instantly anywhere) and bum/buy cheap ToR's from mages to gate back there.  Is it the 1% fewer failures on Stinging Wort?  Or is it just a matter of pride and saying you have max Alchemy? :)<br />

Again, not a flame... just curious as to why you would want to pursue it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Fair enough question.  Our guild has been using a fair number of mana potions.  We had been doing some bigger encounters with low cleric turn out--things like AoW with 7 clerics, or Aary with 3 or 4 clerics (even before shaman and druid CH).  Now, absent additional mana regen for the clerics, we can't do that kind of encounter without a much better cleric turn out.  Hence the mana potions.  I'm hitting about 50% on the mana potions currently.  I'd like to get to 75 or 95% on them.  They're frigging expensive, even if it is out of guild funds!  On some fights, a mana potion = 1 or 2 cheals just by itself.<br />
<br />
(I know, with the 'retuning' of mobs, a few of the encounters have been severely gimped--ie AoW--so they don't really even need 7 clerics with mana potions anymore.  I swear, they just turned him into another farm) :(<br />
