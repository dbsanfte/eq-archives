<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bolthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My shaman is level 41 and I am having a little difficulty deciding which to use for my ranged slot. Either the Bronze Statue of Bathezid or a Gronga Idol. The Staute gives me more mana and hitpoints but doesn't have any ac like the Idol. <br />
<br />
In your opinion which is better?<br />
<br />
I have searched around and couldn't really find an answer to this question, so I figured I would ask you all.<br />
<br />
Please take a look see at my profile and make any suggestions you think would help out.  BTW, the Dragon Tunic is on loan and I can't sell it for cash, :p I use it to boost CHA and resists if I need them.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance and sorry for yet another equipment question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Goranga<br />
<br />
Cause that sarnak head is too ugly to have in your inventory</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i also vote goranga.<br />
<br />
and gear wise, forget about anything else but saving for a JBB.  its the difference between doing several blues an hour and doing several hours a blue post 45. once you have it, you will solo so amazingly well that before you know it youll have buckets of cash to spend on the rest of your gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bolthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the replies !<br />
<br />
JBB is on my list of things to buy...just have to find one for sale.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You already have several items in there that are WAAAAY above your level (such as the battle shield and Coldain Skin Gloves).  Your AC/HP's look good and if you're happy with your current WIS, then I wouldn't worry about equip at this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">how did you get the emerald dragon scale tunic ?  nice stats , i think i want it.<br />
<br />
that or a suggestion on a nice HIGH ac chest piece with wis stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are the deity-specific player-crafted Golden Idols. For Barbarians, the Golden Idol of the Tribunal (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=13335) is AC 5, Wis 5, HP 10, Mana 40.<br />
<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield is so low-priced nowadays due to supply, it's not above his level at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd say goranga idol. The statue is going to be only 3 more sta which is going to be less than 10 hps. The resists and mana on the statue might swing it back that way but you seemed more interested in the ac and hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bolthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I played a necromancer and cleric for around 2.5 years, but a shaman is a very unique class to play. There are so many things to keep you busy in a group and so many things that cause you to get beat up on. hehe :p<br />
<br />
I've gotten lots of equipment ideas from reading through different threads on this board and I greatly appreciate the replies, I switched to the Goranga Idol. <br />
 <br />
Although, I hadn't thought of the Golden Idol of the Tribunal.   hmmm<br />
<br />
As for the the stuff above my level, Bazaar is great...you can find lots of stuff cheaply priced if ya hold out and look around.  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks again !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
PS, the tunic was loaned to me by a friend. It is the result of a quest from killing Woushi (sp?) in Wakeing Lands.</div></div><hr />
