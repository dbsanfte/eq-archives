<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, the other day I went to PoN and did an /ooc for a group. I got a reply from a druid to join him at Stalkers. So I went over there and we tore the place up and worked very well togather for sweet exp.So heres the deal find yourself a druid partner lvl 57+. Have him run out and snare a blood raven, you Malo---- him(the bird not the druid) to lower his resist. You cast cha on the druid and he charms the raven. Now have the druid park the bird  away from you guys , in case charm breaks. <br />
<br />
1 shaman pulls with slow and runs to druid<br />
2 druid snares and sends pet<br />
3 if needed one of you root ,so the snared pet can catch him<br />
4 if you have an add just kite until druid roots it or gets agro and you root it.(even 2-3 adds)<br />
<br />
The only real precaution is to ensure the bird is resnared every time charm breaks and dont sit next to it. Dont worry about a dog it will get eaten very fast and ends up being a waste of mana. IMO in PoN this is the best duo, more DPS than any pet class/melee and better utility spells than a chanter. With a KEI our down time was very minimal and we got quite a few BD's. Good exping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had a similar experience with a druid that had dire charm.  He could only grab a young bat do to level limit, but it was more than enough to tank for us.  I did bring up dogdog, but I only sent him in when he wouldn't draw agro.  Worked great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mintyfresh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tried this too, works with any druid 51+ actualy. Best if you got you're mini CH or he(she) does. It's decent xp and can be very fun, but defently not the greatest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Today I got 2 blues in 1-1/2 hrs in PoN @ lvl 59. We didnt do stalkers we went to the rock by GY and killed YT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Liley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My husband is a lvl 62 Druid and we do this a lot ~ I get lotsa exp and he says he enjoys the slow immensely  ;)</div></div><hr />
