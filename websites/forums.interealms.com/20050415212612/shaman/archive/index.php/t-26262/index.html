<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ledas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok not sure what all information I'll need to post but here goes...<br />
<br />
I've been playing on one computer for a while now and this past weekend decided to pick up another PC so the wife and I can play together for the first time in 5+ years.  Unfortunately we live in the country and do not have access to DSL or cable modems.  Dealing with dial up is a pain but we have really good phone lines and have not had nearly the amount of trouble with it that we have had living in other places.  So we decided to set them up as a home network to share the dial up on one phone line and leave the other line open for calls.<br />
<br />
1st comp - Pent. 4 processor with Windows XP Home, store bought ethernet card bought and installed(working correctly)<br />
2nd comp - Athlon 2400+ processor with Windows XP Professional, ethernet connection built into the motherboard.<br />
<br />
Connected my cable that the local computer store gave me when I bought the computer from them(they say it is the correct one but I have no clue, it's the only store for hours around), connected the two computers and ran through the networking wizard as told to on both computers.  I now get the connection icon but am not sending anything from the client computer.  I ping the host computer and am getting 100% packet loss.  I have tried it both ways and each time I am getting this.  Now I have set up two computers this way before but did not have any problems.  I know squat about networking and the computer store isn't open til Monday night!  Would love any advice/instructions on how to fix this?  Thanks all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ergra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some possibilties to look at<br />
<br />
1) i assume 2nd comp (athlon 2400) is client computer? If so check your netwrok card is enabled in the bios. Had this happen first time i set mine up.<br />
<br />
2)If connection is ok maybe access privileges not allowing the connection?<br />
<br />
3) Is winxp/other  firewall turned on for host computer and is sharing set for host and client comps?<br />
<br />
Sorry i cant give you more technical advise but these are problems ive had setting up my own comps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ledas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I checked the bios and the onboard LAN is enabled.  As I may have said both computers are sending but neither is receiving.  I checked the cable at the same store again but the guy is still saying that the cable is ok.  Really confusing to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oogg2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You say it has a connection?  So you have a link light on both ends? (green led should light up near the socket)<br />
Check the firewall as mentioned above.<br />
Make sure both computers are members of the same workgroup.<br />
Turn sharing on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds like you're plugging the ethernet port of one PC directly into the ethernet port of the second.  You need a crossover cable to do this (it swaps the transmit and receive pairs).<br />
<br />
Chances are, the guy at the store sold you a standard ethernet cable. <br />
<br />
The 'technically correct' setup would be to plug both PC's into a hub or a switch using normal cables.  Using a crossover between two PC's is kinda a hack; i.e. not guaranteed to work but usually does.<br />
<br />
--Edit--<br />
<br />
You're also going to need to assign IP addresses to the cards.  I *think* when you set the adapter on the main PC to share the internet, Windows gives it the address 192.168.0.1.  So set the second PC to 192.168.0.100 with a netmask of 255.255.255.0 and a gateway of 192.168.0.1 and the DNS servers your ISP gave you.</div></div><hr />
