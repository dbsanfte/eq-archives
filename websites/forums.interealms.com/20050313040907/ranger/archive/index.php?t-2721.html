<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lludar</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I logg on tonight planing on hitting 45 when i see icefang walk up to Korrigan and sits there for a few seconds then he runs away so i chase him down start to attack him and he dissapears. I try about 10 times to even get him before he goes to Korrigan and he still dissapears as i fight him. so i petition it and the guide didnt give me a straight answer as to whether or not it is here permanently or just a bug. so sad now i dunno where to go to lvl tongiht :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daadwen</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might be a bug associated with Korrigan.  Try training him to the Kael gaurds, they'll despawn him for sure =).  Then try again.  I killed Icefand couple times last night while helping a friend collect some griff eggs.</div></div><hr />

I can't remember the details but at this points it's best not to attack him as you might screw up the quest for someone. <br />
<br />
Just sit tight or fight a Walrus and he'll be back soon enough :)</div></div><hr />

He spawns, whimpers over to Korrigan, despawns then spawns again into his stronger self (as per the ring quest) then runs off and despawns.  He does this over and over again.  Has to be a bug methinks.<br />

AFTER that ANOTHER ONE spawned but after that one died they stoped spawning from other reavers corpses oh gezz it was Great :) i thought we found a UBAH bug there and could get a bazillion reavers but too bad they stoped spawning =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rykar</div><div class="date">05-10-2002, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm Black Reavers always had a chance to respawn a new black reaver to replace the old till a ghost or max number respawns occur.</div></div><hr />
