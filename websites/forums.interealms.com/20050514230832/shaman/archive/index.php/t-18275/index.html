<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking at back threads and I saw the one saying EQShamans.com sucks... i agree.<br />
<br />
The Shaman's Crucible is a decent site but also seems a bit Bare-bones.<br />
<br />
If there is enough Demand I will gladly put effort into a full time Shaman website. Or even take up working Someone else's Website (don't even dare approaching me if you own www.eqshaman.com.) I won't be investing any money tho, so it would be sitting on my ISP's provided 10 meg webspace. (no big files there lol)<br />
<br />
Given if this happens it takes time for the design process aswell as gathering up content. I wouldn't dream of starting another Forum because they is the best forum we shamans got.<br />
<br />
Anyhow... tossing around the idea. let me know what you all think.<br />
<br />
NOTE: I use to work on websites alot when i was a teen. Worked for the second biggest Tiberian Sun (C&amp;C2) website (was www.cnc2.com but don't go there now... is a porn site or something last i recall) for awhile. First Website I worked on for someone else was a Jedi Knight 1 website. i forget it's name now. wasn't that big. Eventually I then worked on www.forcecommander.com (domain for sale site now) which was the Star Wars RTS game... Did a short stint on a EQ portait page for a friend but not even in that guild anymore. Only one i can possibly show a copy of is the Portait page. I can show some work i did for my Real Life friend's Recording Studio but it is pretty much content free. Also did a lets just post a bunch of crap we think of and come across on the web site with some of my friends from the C&amp;C2 website Called Colorless Green Thoughts (www.colorlessgreenthoughts.com... can't be found anymore... /sigh is like my past just disappeared all together!)... designed most of their layouts aswell. Prolly wouldn't be a really fancy website if it was one of my own creation.<br />
<br />
Anyhow... again give me your thoughts. look forward to your replies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't get it. What is this site missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I for one would love it if someone took alot of the great info in the forums and converted it into guides.  I know this forum has just about everything a shaman needs, but some of the older topics (that most shaman know by now) are a pain in the butt to find.<br />
<br />
Brand new shaman have a very difficult time figuring out their class in any sort of order when they go to this site (I just started a shaman about a month ago, and it took me a while to really understand my class.  I had to piece together my role/abilities/tactics from tons of threads that came sparadically over time).<br />
<br />
I use to be a druid (I know, I know...  But I have seen the light, grown a brain, and moved on) and I was addicted to eqdruids.com because every good piece of necissary information was converted into a guide and posted on the general site.  This is fantastic for the beginner of a class, and as they get more use to the classes lingo/slang terms they can upgrade to the forums for specific questions.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think the crucible is a fantastic site, but for someone who is visiting a shaman website for the first time, it is kind of difficult to locate things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Medicine Cabinet rocks for that type of info</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, I used to have a way to easily add guides. Unfortunately, it requires me to have Cold Fusion and SQL installed and I simply can't do that with my current server specs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">no, it doesn't.  The only guide on there that is even slightly applicable to a newer player is how to pull as a shaman.  Even then, a good amount of the thread discusses VP, and other AA abilities that a new player will not get for quite a while.  Even the pulling techniques using dogdog have to wait till 34.<br />
<br />
But I digress.  at eqdruids.com there are guides for kiting, root/roting, extensive grouping guides depending on group makeup/quad-kiting/charm-kiting/raiding/etc.  These are just the guides on fighting techniques.  They then have a guide for just about every quest a druid would consider doing (including full walkthroughs of all the newbie armor quests) and most importantly a beginners guide to starting your druid.  It discusses the race advantages/disadvantages, starting stats, where to hunt when you begin, what spells are most important to buy first (in case your on a budget and can't get them all) where to hunt that for each type of fighting (root/rot or kiting or grouping) and how to best go about equiping yourself.<br />
<br />
This type of info is found only in the forums, and only by someone with a relative knowledge of the class in the first place, which is needed in order to use the search to any degree of precision.<br />
<br />
I love the shamans crucible, and as the origional poster already mentioned, the forums can not be beat... so much so that he isn't even going to bother trying.  But having another website that has all of the supposed &quot;common knowledge&quot; neatly laid out, along with some more complicated topics (much like the medicine cabinet) would only help people in their searches to become better shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you have guides you would like hosted on the website, write them up and PM me.<br />
<br />
Guides don't create themselves and without the help of volunteers we would have even less on the site.  Standing around wishing and wanting for them to appear is much less effective than actually writing them.  :)<br />
<br />
I invite anyone that would like to contribute to do so.  <br />
<br />
We are in need of a new writeup for the shaman epic.  If you are a good writer and have (recently) completed the shaman epic, consider donating your time to write up the guide.<br />
<br />
Newbie guides like:<br />
-What race should I choose<br />
-What should I put my starting stats into<br />
-Hunting partners (or dual box partners)<br />
<br />
-Newbie Quests for all the races (hammer, fear and snare necklaces as well as all the newbie armor)<br />
-Vah Shir Cloak Quest writeup<br />
<br />
-A good detailed explanation of how specialization works and what shaman should specialize in<br />
<br />
and many more are possible topics to cover.  Let me know if you want to help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Henora makes a good point (hehe).  Maybe instead of wasting any time programing, the original poster could just write up the guides they planned to use and send them to the crucible.  would be nice to keep everything together.<br />
<br />
As for myself, I am relatively new, and don't have much experince yet as a shaman, but I certainly would be happy to write a race/starting stats guide.  Would give me something to do at work :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meddow Spiritwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I said I was more then happy to put my efforts toward helping an already established website. Just trying to help out the community that has done so much for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't suppose I'd like everything laid out letter-by-letter for me. There is something to be said for venturing into the unknown. Personally speaking, the most I've ever used a guide is when I created my character, and I used the guide at EQ Caster's Realm to do that. For information I need, I talk to other players and exchange information with them as much as I can, and I also do searches on the web (as I'm sure many of us do). <br />
<br />
I do agree, though, that perhaps a repository of some sort for shaman guides would be a great idea. Aye, we've got the Crucible's medicine cabinet, and I will say (as many have said so far in this thread) that Crucible remains THE BEST shaman site on the web. SC's medicine cabinet is great, and the search function allows you to pull up pretty much any thread you want.<br />
<br />
I am by no means an expert on anything. In some areas I still consider myself a noob. But I am willing to contribute. I would hope there are other posters in Crucible's world who would do the same. <br />
<br />
That said ... I see Henora has posted a short list of desired guide topics a couple posts above this one ... While this project is a great one, it seems to run the risk of being redundant. Many of these topics are already covered on sites like EQ Caster's Realm and in various threads posted here on the Crucible. Perhaps it's time to clean up the Crucible's forums and compile the knowledge into a few guides that could be put into the Medicine Cabinet or set up for download?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sherah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think a GOOD shaman information webpage would be good to have.<br />
<br />
I never could stand the crucibles webpage.  I do not know why they haven't asked some ppl who put up some nice stuff to add it to their webpage too.<br />
<br />
For a long time it had terrible information I'd get pretty frustrated.  It's so-so now.  The forums here are fairly good but it's not the same type of info nor is it laid out in as nice a fashion that you can do on a webpage.<br />

My first thought is that that you may be underestimating the amount of traffic eq class related sites see.<br />
<br />
Ask Sunmoon for information on the amount of traffic that the crucible sees, and then ask your ISP if that level of traffic is covered by your monthly fees.</div></div><hr />
