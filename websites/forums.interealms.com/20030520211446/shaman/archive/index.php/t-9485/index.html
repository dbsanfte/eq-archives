<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RrumofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got lucky, and pulled one of these out of PoS 6 hours before the server went down for the nerf in PoS.  The luck was compounded by being the only toon present with a spell resembling a cold nuke.  The focus effect turns our 975 spell into 1183 max.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, the quetion ... Our guild wizzies and droods would really like one of these.  Can anyone confirm that these are still in the PoS bee's drop table, and been made extremely rare, or have they been removed completly?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Afaik it still drops, but only of the named bees, its probably easier for them to just collect the pieces required for the BoT pottery item, exactly the same focus effect, just sadly not nearly as nice stats wise.<br />
<br />
Oh I'll add, I'm not sure if it drops of the elder/chiefs or the lord, I'd presume it drops of the first set but knowing how completely wacko PoS is for rvr, who knows =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes, that cloak owns</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not aware of what nerf you are talking about but that cloak has dropped off the water giant lord many times for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jaradis, it used to drop off plain old bees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lol its off the giant lords now?  Sorry, but as nice a cloak as it is, thats completely skewed RvR =)<br />
<br />
Agreed, it was a bit too good to be true dropping of regular bees (In comparison to the rest of pop loot of regular mobs, fungus clump anyone?), bit still, Lords are harsh as hell mobs and only really worth killing if your desperate to get a lot of people bot flagged as fast as possible =/<br />
<br />
And yeah, my cloak dropped of a bee, was there with my regular xp group trying to get our necro the FT hat, so the cloak was a fantastic suprise =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The regular old bees used to drop tons of incredibly good stuff.  While I was there over the course of a few days, I saw multiple drops of a 41% melee haste belt, the FT hat, a ring with vengeance on it, the raintraveller's overcloak, and I think maybe an earring or something too.  Anyway that's what comes to mind at this moment.  A ranger friend I was with was addicted to the spot because there were at least three fantastic items he could get -- the cloak, the belt, and the ring.  I think there's nothing there for us but the cloak.<br />
<br />
After the nerf, I was there again and surprised to see somethings were still dropping, apparently, off regular bees.  A tradeable monk shoulder with 80 HP on it dropped; pretty darn nice.  No idea if any other things drop now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">nah its not 80hp.  It's 40hp.<br />

Me and my guild also did the turkeywasps for a while.  We got one ring and one belt before nerf.   Then they nerfed the drops, made the elders and chieftans, and ston`ruak unslowable.   Now those mobs stay up for days and days because the Risk VS Reward on them is completely bogus and no one kills them.<br />
<br />
As far as we have been able to tell, that mantle is their only loot now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I belive they drop the regular stormrider lance now as well.</div></div><hr />
