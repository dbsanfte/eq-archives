<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a quick question/comment.<br />
<br />
I see all these posts about how we should get more ATK buffs and such, but really, how much ATK would FA give if the stat caps were listed.<br />
<br />
With our buffs, it would be fairly easy to max a player's strenth at 500+?<br />
<br />
I mean really, what is the max potential atk added with our buffs with no stat cap.  I think I added it up to like 300+ str with all of our buffs.  That + the raw ATK from FA..wouldn't it be like 250 to ATK?  That isn't bad.  Our spells have potential, but are being hindered by the stat cap.<br />
<br />
Right now it is all about pure atk and pure hp's, but if our buffs were actually allowed to effect HP's and ATK more by changing stats, we would be more wanted without changing our spellset..<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its just a never ending cycle.  Better gear released, means our stat related buffs become more worthless.<br />
<br />
The point of people asking for strikethrough, dodge, attack, chance to hit, chance to riptose, etc.. instead of stat buff changes, is to break the tie between our ability to contribute to a group, and that groups ability to replace us with a piece of gear.<br />
<br />
Just think how enc's would feel if every piece of gear had KEI on it:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No.<br />
<br />
Think how Enchanters would feel if every piece of gear had VQ or Mez on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman stat buffs shouldn't be limited by stat caps at all - period.<br />
<br />
Last i checked, KEI isn't limited by the FT cap either ...<br />
<br />
And why is a stat buff (like STA for example) from 150 up to 200 more effective than the same buff from 250 to 300? Another ****ty SOE idea(tm) and a direct hit of shaman abilities at the high-end.<br />
<br />
But as screwed as the stat system is actually, i would prefer direct buffs on attack and defense abilities as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Excellent point...<br />
<br />
I can't think of any other buffs that are capped...? <br />
<br />
KEI?  Nope..<br />
<br />
HP buffs?  I can see it now, a 1k hp buff gets lopped off at 50hps because the tank already has 10k hp's?????<br />
<br />
ATK buffs?  Same same, you already have 1800atk, this one won't stack.  <br />
<br />
***.  They only cap STAT buffs and who does the most stat buffs...Shaman.<br />
<br />
Cap gear all you want, but why cap our buffs?</div></div><hr />

I think a lot of this has to do with the fact that when EQ was released they had no idea it'd be so successful and that it'd end up with so many expansions.  The game has expanded beyond the original design and a side-effect of that is that some stat buffs have become less meaningful.  I'm sure that SOE considers the ineffectiveness of some buffs to be a minor tradeoff compared to retaining customers over time with ever increasingly buff zones, gear,AAs, level caps, etc.  A huge part of EQ's success is content, particularly gear, and to keep players interested they have to continually increase the power of gear which can have the side-effect of affecting game mechanics, like buffing.<br />
<br />
When EQ released it really only had UO to look at to gage success and EQ has expanded much more than UO.  MMOs designed after EQ have the luxury of seeing how a successful MMO can grow (not that they'll necessarily design anything but crap, but I digress).  As EQ has grown (somewhat out of control and beyond design) the devs have to attempt to keep the majority of people happy, which means that sometimes some folks are gonna get screwed over, like shaman and their stat buffs.<br />
<br />
You could postulate that they could increase stat buff caps or at least throw shaman a bone and make shaman stat buffs able to break the caps.  There must be some good reason why this isn't done other than SOE being shaman haters.<br />

<br />
Haste is capped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Haste is capped. <br />
<br />
Yep, and somehow Bards and only Bards are allowed to break the cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Haste is capped.<br />
Haste is capped in a way that works well.  Ignoring V3 haste, the haste cap for the combined total of item haste and spell haste is 100%.  The maximum item haste is 45%, with 36-41% being the common level of item haste.  The other 55-64% of the haste cap is given to your local enchanter or shaman to make up.  Haste also does not get to the point of diminishing returns - 10% extra haste is as valuable if you are starting from no haste or 90% haste.<br />
<br />
If stats were capped in a similar way, there might actually be a point to casting a lot of these spells.  If item bonuses could only get to 45% of the total stat cap, and spells had to make up the other 55% of the cap, there would be incentive to bring a Shaman along.  The incentive would be bigger if the bonus for stats was consistent throughout it's range, rather than diminishing at higher levels (e.g. STA giving less HP per point).</div></div><hr />

Thats the best argument for decreasing the stat cap that I've ever heard.  Wonderful argument.  Would be terrible to implement and everyone ele+ would blow a fuse, but hey....its fun to think about right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">They could lift the stat cap and it would do exactly jack and squat for our class.  STR does jack for damage, and ATK is a composite figure, just like AC is.  +STR raises only the max hit and not the modal hit, so it does very little for DPS over time.  This was tested a lot back in the day when everyone figured out that attributes mean squat in Everquest.  <br />
<br />
Right now, today, shamans are better buffers than they have ever been.  <br />
Right now, today, shamans are a weaker class than they have ever been.<br />
Conclusion: buffs aren't the problem, and probably aren't the solution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The original spell &quot;Avatar&quot; was meant to be the most awesome 6 minutes of a melee's life. So much so it was worth buying emeralds to cast a spell with a 3 minute load and refresh time.<br />
<br />
FA does not cut the grade of a 6 minute spell. I play a Rogue main and the increase in DPS is nice but it's not up to the calibre of the design of the spell. The STR and DEX is useless as I have 280+ STR and 230+ DEX unbuffed so they are maxed with Focus. This puts me at about 1300ATK before any attack buffs. <br />
<br />
My first tell are to Enchanters for VQ (68% haste and 41ATK, 42 minute duration)<br />
My second tell is always to the rangers for SoP (70 raw ATK, 80 minute duration) and SoT (60 ATK, 125 HP and 60 minute duration). SoP is MGB'd on our raids. SoT is cast on request for those not wanting Brells.<br />
<br />
Ferocity next with 150 ATK, 40STA (160hp odd HP on a Rogue) and 65 to all resists is much better overall to FA.<br />
<br />
Now my worn attack is under 250 and I have a Prismatic dagger which I offhand so FA is optional. The 40 ATK does not make much of a difference as Rogues are usually in group with Bards/SKs and with full ATK buffs on we exceed 1900ATK raid buffed in pre-elemental gear.<br />
<br />
The primary melee offensive buffers are Enchanters, Rangers, Beastlord and Shaman in that order. Wasn't the Shaman supposed to be the king of melee buffs ? The Shaman should be the first person a melee looks to for ATK. Not the last.<br />
<br />
My request as a Rogue (ex-Shaman) is save the Shaman from excessive buffing and combine the FA ATK into Focus. Make it the ATK buff of choice and put the Shaman back on top of the melee buffers. I get an extra buff slot and I get happy Shaman.<br />
