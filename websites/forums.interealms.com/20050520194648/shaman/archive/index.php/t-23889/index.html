<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings fellow Shaman,<br />
<br />
I have what may seem to be a bit of a newb question, but here goes anyway:<br />
<br />
I have been away from EQ for about 12 months and OoW has inspired me to play again.  I am a level 56 Barb Shaman, who was primarily a soloer.<br />
<br />
What is a Shaman's role in a group these days?<br />
<br />
IS it Slower still or have we developed into a new function?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In easy-medium zones, shaman role is main healer (via slows + heals). <br />
<br />
In difficult zones where a cleric or druid is main healer, I typically regard my role as &quot;reducing risk and increasing efficiency&quot;.  It's comprised of:<br />
<br />
- malo on all mobs if there are casters in group<br />
- slow on all slowable mobs<br />
- pet attack on all mobs<br />
- cripple on mobs where it matters (rare)<br />
- haste all melees if no chanter in the group<br />
- other buffs as needed / asked for (ferine avatar for example)<br />
- patch healing non-MA people<br />
- tossing Q on the MA to make cleric CH less risky<br />
- fast healing MA if it looks like CH won't hit in time<br />
- DoT/Nuke mobs as mana / time permits<br />
- crowd control of adds (malo + slow + root park)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Depending on the situation, I will tell the druid to nuke and I will heal. <br />
<br />
The best time to be a shaman is when something goes wrong. Playing the shaman correctly usually means the difference between a wipe or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Look.  A tank hits.  A Cleric heals.  A Ranger plinks.  A monk screams and faints.....   it's what they do...<br />
<br />
<br />
You and I are Shammy's.  We are the great Jack-of-all-trades.  Because of that, our roles aren't as cut and dried as everyone else's.  Sure, we'll always slow and buff.  However, healing, hasting, pulling, crippling, Nuking, OT'ing and kiting are all other roles that we can take up, as the situation comes up.  Always start with your primary roles and then see what the group and situation require.  Those other classes are stuck in niches and can only support their group in a set way.  We get to be more intelligent about how we help out.</div></div><hr />
