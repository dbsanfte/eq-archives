 An Israeli doctor says &quot;Medicine in my country is so advanced that we can take a kidney out of one man, put it in another, and have him looking for work in six weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
A German doctor says &quot;That is nothing, we can take a lung out of one person, put it in another, and have him looking for work in four weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
A Russian doctor says &quot;In my country, medicine is so advanced that we can take half a heart out of one person, put it in another, and have them both ooking for work in two weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Texas doctor, not to be outdone, says &quot;You guys are way behind, we recently took a man with no brain out of Texas, put him in the White House for 2 years, and now half the country is looking for work.&quot;<br />
