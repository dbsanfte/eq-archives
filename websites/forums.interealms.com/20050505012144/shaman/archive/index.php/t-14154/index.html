<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was dou'ing in dulak tonight and noticed a rather annoying trend on about 20% of the mobs. After I cast turgur's I failed to get a mob yawns message and the mob wouldn't be slowed, it would keep hitting like normal. If I saw the mob yawn's message they acted like they were slowed and the dps went down accordingly. Was just wondering if anyone else has seen this. I had some resists, and got the message, but what I'm talking about the mob didn't have a resist message but obviously the spell had no effect on it.<br />
 Made for a few hairy fights until I realized what was going on, then I would just keep casting until it stuck. I never had this happen on consecutive casts on the same mob, but did have a few cases where i got up to 2 resist's afterwards on the same mob. Not once did I get more than 1 resist on a mob that didn't display this peculiarity first. Was wondering if anyone else has had this problem.</div></div><hr />

Are you using /assist to target the mob? I had a slow hit the puller a few days ago even with the mob on my target. As we group a lot I of course got the &quot;quit trying to slow me you dumb...&quot; from the puller. Our packet loss was spotty that day so it may have been that or I may have been too quick with my cast (ie prior to hitting assist). Ask your puller if he/she received &quot;Stolastorv tried to cast a spell on you but you are protected&quot;. <br />
<br />
The other possibility, though it seems remote, is if you were far enough away from the mob to miss the emote. I'm fairly certain you'll see the resist emote no matter what the distance, but I believe the &quot;so_and_so has been yawned&quot; can be missed...?<br />
<br />
Hope this makes sense... 5 am and the coffee's still brewing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've noticed a similar thing in Maiden's Eye soloing gorangas.  I would sometimes not get the cripple message even though the mob was well within range.  And yes, you CAN be too far away to see the emote of the effect.  Good pulls start from that distance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The range for the emote (&quot;soandso yawns&quot;) isnt that large.<br />
<br />
I /assist the puller on incoming and let fly with slow usually as soon as I can, while standing near the tank to allow him to pull it off me.  Even without a range 3 item, I will sometimes not see the emote.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about it, however; resist messages have unlimited range, so if you don't get &quot;has resisted your turgur's&quot; then you can be sure you've landed.<br />
<br />
I've never noticed your experiences in Dulak (and I have been there a fair bit for regen and coral rings), although mobs are fairly resistant to slow.  At 55-56, I was getting resisted about 1 in 4 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was dual comping, and the spell wasn't hitting the puller. It wasn't a case of not being in range of the emote, if the emote didn't go off the spell had no effect even though i got no resist message. I'll be back there again tonight hopefully and I'll play around with how I cast etc to seee if i did something wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've PLed enough in dulak . . . never saw a mitigating mob.  I would ask this question: where exactly were you hunting?  Was it around water or other strange geometry?  A mob standing in water won't be hit by your spell, you won't even get a message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was on the dandolak, maybe thats what the problem is, even though the boats not water maybe it happens every so often? Didn't notice if there were any puddles or anything (don't think there are). Was very annpying the first few times, as my ranger got as low as 8 percent health the first time I realized what was happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've failed to get the &quot;yawn&quot; emote from numerous mobs in almost every zone I've fought in. I thought it was just some sort of bug. Nearly every time the emote hasn't shown the mob was still slowed, but there have been a couple of times where the mob wasn't slowed and I didn't receive either the emote or the resist message.<br />
<br />
I never really thought much about it, but it makes sense that if you're too far away you won't be able to &quot;see&quot; the effects of the spell, much the same as you can't hear the effects. My usual fighting technique is to send in dogdog (I nearly always solo), cast slow, then cast dots. Often I don't see the yawn message, but I always see the dot effects message. Kind of curious... but as long as the mob is slowed it doesn't matter much to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>HarpuaKB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with Landragoran, if you are in the water, and the mob is on land, or vice versa, your spells won't stick.  <br />
<br />
I was bored and exping in OOT yesterday and I would pull the giants into the water, and sometimes I would accidentally root them on land and then go into the water and my spells wouldn't stick.  I would still dish out the mana, but get no return.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This IS  a bug and YOU WILL NOT   get a resist message or yawn message if it happens!<br />
<br />
I most usually have this problem when I am at a different Z level   than the mob.  The Guardians in PoN when on the hillside comes to mind.<br />
<br />
When fighting on uneven terrain, I just warn my group that this bug CAN HAPPEN and that I may or may not get a message and that they should let me know if they think they mobs resisted without being jerks about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you're on a different z axis the spell DOES take effect, you just don't see the emote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm one that's had mobs not give the resist message and still not be slowed.  Every now and then, you can &quot;lose&quot; a spell cast, much like when you hotshot a 10-dose of Stinging Wort potions you can get 9 of the 10 doses and lose one into the aether.</div></div><hr />

<br />
YOU WILL NOT get a resist message or yawn message  Sionnach<br />
<br />
Dont' these two statement mean basically the same thing?  I did not say that the spell does not stick, just that you don't get a resist or slow message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You always get a resist message.  the success message is an emote, which you may or may not get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I went back last night and was very careful about my positioning and didn't have any problems at all. I think I had maybe 1-2 in a 4 hour period, where as the night before I had 50-60 in about the same time period. I was set up between the cannons to the right of where you come up the gangplank, and think I might have been half on half off of them the night before. Made sure I wasn't last night nad didn't have nearly the problems with mobs not getting slowed fast. Went from being able to do maybe 6-7 mobs per cycle to doing the entire boat with the same buff line up and the same 2 toons. <br />
Thanks all for the input.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm pretty sure it was a bug - Much like sometimes the game will assume you're casting a heal on a mob, or a damage spell on a player - We've all had the problem of heals simply not hitting once or twice, right? My suggestion would be to simply log all the way to the server screen and try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I've had the same thing happen in numerous zones.  I was told you don't always get the &quot;yawn&quot; messages and mobs would still be slowed.  This isn't true either.  Case in point.  Gaoler in PoJ.  I get the cast message, but no yawn. Gaoler get's to me and commences to wear my little fuzzy but out.  Finally aroud the 30% health mark I figure I might want to try to slow again.  Slow, drop a topor on myself and continue to march.  It varies though, cause other times I've not had them yawn but they were still slowed.  Go figure, another fine sony product</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I must say I've never seen this, and I used to hunt on the Dandolak a fair bit. I've had mobs where I didn't get the message because they were out of range, but they all appeared to be slowed when they actually got to me.<br />
<br />
One other possibility is, might you have had your pet targetted when you cast it? You would get no message then. I tended to pull with slow, so if I didn't have the mob targetted, it wouldn't come - this would explain why I didn't experience this. Or it could just be a bug. :)<br />
<br />
But, something I found on the Dandolak: the furthest point at the bow is quite safe - you can invis up there, and then get up Dogdog, buff up, etc, without getting any agro, and it's a good spot to pull to.</div></div><hr />

I have had that happen many times as well but when I look back up through my log I noticed I got a standing interupt.  Usually happens when I am on a horse or leving but anytime some bumps you it seems there is a chance for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There have been quite a few cases in Dulak where I've thought the same thing playing my enchanter.  I didn't get a resist message, I pulled from extended range (thanks supple scale armband!) so I didn't get a yawn.  Mob arrives and starts beating the snot out of my pet and my partner asks me if I'm sure I slowed the mob as she's burning mana healing my pet (this is on my enchanter by the way).  I reslow and then things return to normal.<br />
<br />
I've tried scrolling back to make sure I didn't miss the resist message and occasionally I do miss the resist message but sometimes its just not there.<br />
<br />
I wasn't on a boat when this happened most of the time.  I was pulling mobs from the big open area right past the zoneline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It has been my experience that if your slow gets mitigated, you get a message to the effect that &quot;your slow was partially effective&quot; or &quot;your slow was mostly effective&quot; etc, so it seems unlikely that the mobs are mitigating your slow.</div></div><hr />

I've noticed that, too, and thought it was just me not paying attention to resists.<br />
<br />
Yep, several times now I've slowed him, not seen a resist, only to see him still wailing away at full speed. Yep, a second cast usually does the trick. Bug, maybe?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've been noticing for a couple weeks now that if I change targets quickly right before I slow I have a chance of not actually slowing the most current target.  Not sure where the slow is landing though, not on the puller or tank, so who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">That could be it.  I often target several mobs to con them while deciding which one to pull, clear my target, retarget what I want and then cast.</div></div><hr />
