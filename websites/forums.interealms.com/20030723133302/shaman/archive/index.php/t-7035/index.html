<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just dinged 53 and I want to try a new place. Previoulsy mainly done solo work on the moon, dinged in SD.<br />
<br />
Can I get ok XP in CoM at 53? Is there a guide that will help me, never been there before, so when people say U-turn, pyramid and gazebo, I'm clueless. Figured it is time to start my Epic, so if I can get ok XP in CoM it sounds like a good idea to me.<br />
<br />
If not, is Jaggedpine good? Or is perma camped? I need a place where I can be fairly sure that I will get my own private spot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The U-turn is where you make, well a U turn...there are 2 of em, left and right side...in the middle there are gazebos..<br />
<br />
U-g--|--g-U<br />
        |<br />
    castle <br />
<br />
horrible illustration  i know, but bear with me.  The U's are the uturns on either side, and a small path to the gazebo's)the g's) are on the inner half of the U turns...inbetween the 2 gazebos is a bridge area(--|-- thing) and the middle goes to the castle.  <br />
<br />
thats the best place at 53...I suggest HHK though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Merry, you have just hit my two favorite zones post 50. CoM is great exp at 53-55 (and I did the last coulple of blues there at 56). HHK may be better but I did not want to ruin my faction. After ZI, you will follow the corridor to a gate (there are 2 spawns behing a wall before the gate so bring up dog before you head in). Kill the two close to the ZI and the three behind the gate ( you should be able to single pull the gate). Now you are basically going to keep going back, you will have to turn at different spots to get to/go through the doors but it is in same general direction. Once past the large courtyard, you will come to 4 spawns, that is the u-turn and this is where you want to be. Start pulling and have fun. Gazebos are around the u-turn and you may not be able to solo pull them yet. I know it is kinda confusing but best thing is to get a map at eqatlas or other places. There is another u-turn on the other side (one on the north wall, one on the south wall) that you can di but it is tough getting the dog to follow you in there. If you get in trouble, run to the courtyard back wall and camp out, pathing in there is terrible and I always got camped before they found me. SoW does work there as well.<br />
<br />
 JP is great exp once you get your epic or hit lvl 56-57. I am there now at 57 and pull about a blue every 45 minutes. <br />
 <br />
 Hope this was not too confusing and good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HHK has two things that makes it a no no for me though.<br />
<br />
- From what I can tell they are on a 'good' faction. I don't want to kill 'good' guards. <br />
- From reading the boards, they are always camped.<br />
<br />
Great posts, but I'm still slightly confused. Looking at the map at eqatlas, are the U-turns the two turns at the far end of the zone, just before getting to the castle? When looking at the maps earlier I always thought that the turns were close to ZI/ZO, but couldn't figure out where.<br />
<br />
/Merry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes the u-turns are right next to the castle in the map. You go on the u-turn across the bridge and to the castle. It is opposite side as ZI/ZO. You can use ivu to get there as long as no golems are between you and the u-turn (almost never happens but I have seen it once or twice).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can also try the Goo house and the goos from 'above' you in the goo house courtyard.  I got nice exp there in 56 as I remember.<br />
<br />
The center goo in the goo house is always blue at 56, then pull the goos that roam the invisible walkways above you (and in the hallways to the walkways).  If you get bored you can pull the other goos which are light blue, and plow through the houses nearby.<br />
<br />
Nice exp..some pp, but I didn't see a single drop...sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SkegBlackwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">At 54 is it possible to solo pull the U turns?<br />
<br />
I love CoM but basically it is usually deserted unless a Reaver raid is on:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tried the U turns last night.<br />
<br />
My experience:<br />
<br />
The zone looks small on the maps I have seen, but it is even smaller in reality. Was really surpised when I discovered that the mobs in front of me was at the U turn. About 75% of the mobs were light blue. Could have been just my bad luck, but that is a conservative number. I got about 1% xp for clearing each U turn. Repop was 25 minutes, so I got 2% every 25 minutes. Not really good, but since I need the epic parts, it is acceptable. All mobs vere single pull except the second duo at the north U turn. Could have been just unlucky, but I got both. Easy split and from then I never had to fight two until I got a strange add at the south turn. Never more than 6 players in zone, but the others were at the gazebos, so I never got to try if I could single pull or split them.<br />
<br />
/Merry<br />
<br />
PS got lucky in that a group had just killed Giohsk(sp?) when I entered the zone, and ooc'd his books. Books and three of the papers now in my posession.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If the U-turn mobs are light blue..continue around to the Gazebos.  They are usually Blue.  If memory serves. I could usually pull Uturn and gazebo before repops.  If you clear faster then pull second Goo house.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">NO ooofence BUT who need HHK GUARDS faction ????????<br />
<br />
ok i realise that some may NOT want to kill the bards, BUT this is not really a problem: just go clear all of mistmore to restore most of the bard faction.<br />
<br />
now that we have POP and luclin i DO NOT need to go to fp bank ever again with my vashiir, what does it natter i am kos there?<br />
<br />
duh u girlies need to get some testosternoe  muhahahah<br />
<br />
COM is a fab zone, and most shamsn are VERY familiar but i have to admit when it took me 30 hours to get my couriers log in the stables i got a tad sick of the place :( (i was unlucky)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm, when I was 53 the u-turns were usually DB to me i think. As said, do the gazebos. at %&amp; I still get a DB there sometimes so the should be DB to you. Also go the the building in the middle of the courtyard and pull the goos. They should ne DB to you also,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">U-turns are mainly light blue at 54, but the gazebos were still dark blue. Still, I think CoM looses its appeal at 53 or 54, at which point its time to look at Chardok, the Hole and JP for soloing (HHK and Katta if you don't mind killing guards) for xp, or Seb and Velks if you want to group and get some nice loot whilst keeping reasonable xp.<br />
<br />
Personally I won't kill the guards, same as I won't pull that poor barbarian in Qeynos Hills with the fishbone earring. Faction might not be a big deal but it just don't feel right! I don't even like killing the barbarian mercenaries in Kael but sometimes I have to, they just don't respect their brethren anymore :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I found the gazabos to be great exp at 53.  Using a JBB and horse and doggie, was able to keep both gazebos clear (all DB) and pull some of the U-turn mobs on both sides while waiting for repop.  Non-stop pulling if you can get to camp both gazebos.<br />
<br />
Breaking the 3 spawns in each gazebo can be tricky.  I usually cleared the right side U turn and park dog there.  Go stand on the wall/railing to target one of the 3 right gazebo mobs that is facing you; pull with immobilize; if the other two both come, go to corner lampost to your left and park one far from the pooch, then run the other down to the pooch.  I seemed to be able to single pull the left gazebo just with slow from a distance, but the same techniques would apply.<br />
<br />
If you bind at the entrance, you can gate and zone to clear agro then run back.  This sometimes was needed when I botched the spawn break and couldn't handle the 3 pull.<br />
<br />
One you have the spawns spaced out, move to the central bridge going into the reaver house and pull to there.  That spot helps make it clear you are camping both gazebos.<br />
<br />
Never any good loot, but lots of experience and epic parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got a Wu Stick, Green Jade sword, and about 600pp in coin from the gazebos during 53. :)  I'd say CoM rocks for 53 soloers.</div></div><hr />
