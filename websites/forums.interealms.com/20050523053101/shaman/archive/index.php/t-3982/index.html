<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Awesome, thanks for sharing.  A guild shaman is going to do this fight soon and I was wondering how it would go :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shakr4d</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Lord Rak is really easy now.  Fire pets were needed a few years ago, but with current equipment, he's doable with 1 tank and 1 cleric.<br />
The tank and cleric must have good gear though, obviously :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bakuba Poxxwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He was doable with no fire pets when Kunark 1st came out.<br />
They sure made it easier, but are by no means required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1 melee, 1 cleric 1 patch healer (which just happens to qualify a shaman for the role) is more than enough, just did it a couple weeks back with just such a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aye for sure tank gotta have high resist..not so much for cleric etc,cause they can stand outside his ae....we had a 60 tank charge at 50%..he got aggro was was the only one that needed to be healed..was easy as ya say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nah, the AE is a lure, it's FlameSongofRo if you wanna look it up on Lucy.  It doesn't get resisted no matter what your FR is, so just go HP gear and CH like normal, just start the CH a lot earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So it would do me no good to dress up in +FIRE gear for handing in the tear to Rak?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Aye Vaaz is correct..hand in tear and be prepared to die,.seen a 60 tank..54 cleric..60 mage..51 shammy and druid wack him..get mage to drop mod rods if cleric mana is going to be a problem,druid heals cleric as he mods..or shaman if ya live(torp good for this)..Also seen a shaman hand in tear and try get away from lord rek only to train his group killing the cleric..guess what happened next</div></div><hr />
