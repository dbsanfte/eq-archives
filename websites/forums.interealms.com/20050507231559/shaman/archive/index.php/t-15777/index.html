<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">umm, i was just thinking about the new curse dots we are going to be getting.<br />
<br />
if these become standard &quot;shaman&quot; line dots. (without violating any NDA's etc), does anyone know if these are going to be used by the mobs in general now too?<br />
<br />
in other words, do we need to start meming the curse cure's because mobs are using them now?<br />
<br />
just an idle thought i had.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would think so.  Radiant cure is, as always, your friend.  Something like this would make me seriously consider getting the next two level sof radiant cure, actually.  I have the first level, and like it, but have never really seen a huge benefit in upgrading.  This might change that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sigh.<br />
<br />
I suppose that means that I'm actually going to have to go to the trouble and expense of procuring the cure curse line....<br />
Good thing greater remove is only 25K right now /sarcasm off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't go that far Thorizon, unless you play on a red server.<br />
<br />
How many shaman mobs do you really fight?  And when you do, there is always radiant cure to fall back on.  If radiant cure fails, it should only leave enough curse counters on that you can remove it with regular remove curse.  <br />
<br />
Or, if worse comes to worse, just quiessence the damage away and ignore the dot.  In fact, that might be preferable to casting remove curse in terms of mana usage.</div></div><hr />

Man that's a good deal imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Someone was selling RGC for 200k last week and got it on solro :)  25k is a bargain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">greater remove curse is 250k on terris and the research components sell for upwards of 50k.<br />
<br />
if I seen it at that price (25), i'd snap it right up for one of my guildies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Only time I saw GRC for sale on CT they where asking 100k for it. At 25k the spell would have been bought as fast as I could get the pp out of the bank.<br />
<br />
As far as mobs casting the dot? It should definitely be possible. Then again the spells are already in the live spell database even if there is no way for players to obtain them yet. This should mean npcs already have the ability to cast them. NPC's are kinda funny and don't ever cast alot of spells in thier spell book so they might never bother with these new ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Take some guildies.  Grind a while in Cazic, 4c area is good.<br />
<br />
I've gotten GRC and PE (both use 73r) from spell research, and the components aren't THAT rare if you go to the right place.<br />
<br />
It also helps if you set up a guild research component mule and tell people to save every &quot;0.0&quot; wt research item.  People can remember &quot;0.0 = good&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
If these go live I would expect that they would be added to shaman mobs as well.  Thats the problem.<br />
<br />
As for RC AA's and quiessence, Ive got Stoicism at 60.  Thats as good as it gets, so I could counteract the level 30ish mob curse at the 160hp/tic that Stoi gives.<br />

I believe he was saying 4c in CT...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please tell me you're kidding. I saw someone selling it for 100k and thought he was out of his mind. Who in the hell has 200k to spend on one spell anyway? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It has sold multiple times on Emarr for over 150 K each time.  highest so far is 270 K.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Still searching for a words of apparition.. I hunted 73R, and the only words of App I saw was selling at 50K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It just blows me away how people can amass that much plat.</div></div><hr />

Did anyone else see the title of this thread and think &quot;what, he found out some fundamental truth of life?&quot; or something like that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You used 73r on PE?!<br />
/cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">PE is common drop of a common mob ... Go spend an afternoon in Ssra and your group will see 3-4 PE and 1-2 group acumen drop. 73r is not as common as primal essence  ;)<br />

-edit- topic has derailed  :D</div></div><hr />
