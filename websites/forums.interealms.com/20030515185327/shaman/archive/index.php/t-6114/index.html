<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, i Finally got my tear and did the CoM fights. Had 3 groups of 55+ and it was cake. The journey to Neh was realy fun! I loved the skywalk. Lots of adds but with 3 full groups they were cake. I can see how a smaller force might take awhile but we marched right up. Killed her reaver and handed in my ring. She went down in like 5 seconds! I was actually kind of dissapointed. I got my diary then gated to EJ to turn it in. Gated back after turn in and got a coth back to reaver area. Only had 2 mage pets and Rak was so easy! I never got passed 1/4 life the whole fight! I just backed into the corner slowly, pets gained aggro really fast. 2 clerics even made their hammer pets after fire pets had aggro. Maybe because I was in the corner I wasnt getting hit by his AE, but I hardly got a scratch. Was this fight always this easy? I was blown away at how easy these 2 fights were. I got my spear finally and am very happy.</div></div><hr />

BTW, you cant gate somewhere then gate back, so im assuming you meant ran back to CoM, hehe.</div></div><hr />
