<br />
Anyway, i was looking into getting a horse (cheapest one), and i had a few questions.<br />
<br />
I mainly group, rarely solo, and when i group i am with a 54 paladin and a 53 mage, and i am usually standing next to the paladin, poking the mob with my REIF.<br />
<br />
Is there much point in getting a horse in this situation, or should i look into upgrading my gear?<br />
<br />
Cheers for any sugestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, what I've heard the cheapest horse is about sow speed( i think) and its really only useful with a JBB. This is because when you click the JBB, and are not moving, you will be medding, making it easy to get mana back with right click items. So, i would spend the 8k on something else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">On a horse, you med any time you are not attacking, which means casting, running, JBB, etc.  It is VERY worth the 8k, my next big purchase will be a horse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm a huge horse fan, but the biggest bang for your buck isn't a horse... it's a JBB.   Once you have that, THEN get the horse.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The cheapest is no where near sow speed...its slower than run 3.  Sow speed is around 30k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You don't med on a horse while you are running or autoattacking. You do med while you are casting.<br />
<br />
I don't have a JBB, but I still find my horse very useful for grouping. I don't find it so useful for soloing. YMMV.<br />
<br />
A cheap horse is the best if you turn off the horse models - then you can SoW yourself as normal but you still get the meditation benefits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMHO the horse I purchased is almost as useful as my JBB.  Almost.  I find in groups it is also handy from the amuont I canabalize.  Getting the full med ticks, and cana mana, without having to get CTS from all those clicks?  Almost priceless to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I do feel sorry for people who bought a 30k horse when you can just turn the horse models off. When the horse model is turned off you can... sit, if you're desperate, and get hp back even faster, and bash, and you run at sow speed without the bobbing head or slow start a horse has, and you can jump. Its also easier to fit into places, but you still get in the way of others :).  I also use my horse to log out quicker by getting disconnected. The safe fall thing is the only thing I am unsure of. Didn't notice that much while horse models were on, but I still fell for damage occasionally, and when the model is off I fall for damage like I do without a horse. Tell me if I missed anything. Always make sure to carry plenty of food and water as the horse eats like one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you have a horse with the models off, you CAN sit, but it diesn't do you any good. You always regenerate HP at the standing rate on a horse, no matter what.<br />
<br />
You are correct in that you can bash, SoW yourself, and jump. Safe fall doesn't work if models are off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My only major problem with buying a horse is the inability to interrupt my casting by crouching while on the horse.  If I want to interrupt one of my spells, dammit I want it interrupted RIGHT DAMN NOW!!!  Is there any other quick and easy way to interrupt spell casting while on horseback???<br />
