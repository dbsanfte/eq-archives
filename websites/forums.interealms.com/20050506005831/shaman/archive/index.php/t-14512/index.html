<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a level 42 shaman. My cousin has a 52 warrior.  We want to hunt together at the same level.  What or where is the best way for us to hunt together? His suggestion is to turn all his experience into AA's while we hunt so I can catch up to his level. He suggested we partner in DL or SolB as the best place to hunt.  We hunted together in Mons Letilus and I went from 40 to 42 as we gathered superior hides for my tailoring skill.<br />
<br />
Does he suck up all the experience being so much of a higher level?  How long would it take to get from 42 to 52 as a soloist?  I am not really interested in soloing for 10 levels if I can avoid it.  I thought his suggestion of making all his experience into AA a good idea but I wanted to get your thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have you tried Dulak?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to dulak, its good loot, decent xp and fairly safe if you have a clue as to what your doing. I've just got done spending the last 2 weeks there and enjoyed it alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, his idea to put all of his points into AA is a good one. While he is stuck at 52 and gathering AA, he can also go on naggy runs for epic drops and maybe some really bitchin haste.<br />
<br />
Lots of places to hunt, but I haven't been sub-60 since before luclin came out, so I'm not much of an authority on the good places these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can't believe I'm adding to the people already there, but yes, Dulak. Hands down the best zone I've been in. Great loot, XP and lots of spawns.<br />
<br />
Watch for the trains.</div></div><hr />
