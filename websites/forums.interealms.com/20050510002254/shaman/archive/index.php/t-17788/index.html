<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Someone told me the other night that after 29 successfull missions you can spend points earned at one camp at another????<br />
<br />
This is news to me.<br />
<br />
They way it was described is as follows. (for example)<br />
<br />
I earn 1500points at EF<br />
I earn 1500points at Tak<br />
I have 3000points total<br />
I can spend 1500at EF<br />
I can spend 1500at Tak<br />
I spend 1500 points at EF<br />
PROVIDING I have 29 successfull misions to my name I can NOW......<br />
Spend another 1500 (previously only available to me at Tak) at EF.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The way I understood it was that you can spend points that you have earned at any camp, but you have to have earned enough points at a specific camp to be able to see the items before you can purchase them.  So if you earn 1500 points at EF and 1500 points Tak, you can spend 1500 points twice at Tak, or 1500 points twice at EF, or 1500 at each.  Maybe I am wrong, but I thought that is how it worked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is correct.<br />
<br />
To restate another way...the points you earn at any give camp unlock items you can buy at that camp but you can spend any of your points to buy stuff that's unlocked.<br />
<br />
Just check out the adventure merchants at the camps and you can see the limits in action, your point totals, and a few items you can buy in the near future once you've unlocked them by earning more points at that camp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the original poster is focusing more on the rumor he was told last night:  29 missions unlock other camps.<br />
<br />
This is false, AFAIK.  <br />
<br />
Check the LDON FAQ in the medicine cabinet for some good info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have 1492 at Tek and 1492 at EF,<br />
then you can buy two 1492 items at EF or two 1492 items at Tek.<br />
But you cannot buy anthing from any other camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">After rereading the original post, the given scenario is correct.<br />
<br />
A small addition:<br />
<br />
This behaviour has nothing to do with '29' missions, it applies for every number of missions, as long as you have successful missions in several camps. F.e. the same would be true, when you got 500 points in EF and 500 points in TaK (you could buy only up to 500 point items then obviously, but two of them in one camp (EF or TaK) or one in each camp).<br />
<br />
For some people it is more clear to split the effect of those points into favor points and trade points.<br />
<br />
So every successful 65 mission gives you 51 favor and 51 trader points (summarized in one value):<br />
<br />
1. Your gained 51 favor points automatically raise the limit of items, you can buy only at the SPECIFIC camp, the mission belongs to (similar to 'faction').<br />
2. You can spend the 51 trade points to buy items at ANY camp, where you have collected a sufficient amount of favor points already in the past.<br />
<br />
But it still confuses me too at times, as it is a rather new, uncommon system in EQ  :) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not much of a brotherhood are they.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, i see you have killed thousands of monsters at our everfrost camp. Sorry no, cant sell you that&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Maybe it will help if I repost what I put on on my guild's boards:<br />
<br />
1. You earn points in each theme. <br />
2. You have a total current points pool. <br />
3. The game records your 'high water mark', or total ever earned, in each theme. <br />
4. You can spend points anywhere, but you can't spend more on any one item than your total earned in that theme. <br />
<br />
Example. <br />
<br />
Theme One, you have won 1, earned 51 points. <br />
Theme Two, you have won 2, earned 102 points. <br />
Theme Three, you have won 3, earned 153 points. <br />
Theme Four, you have won 4, earned 204 points. <br />
Them Five, you guessed it, 5 for 255 points. <br />
You never spent any, so you have 765 points. <br />
<br />
You want an item that costs 150 points: you could get up to five of them, actually, but not from camp 1 or 2, only from 3, 4 or 5, the camps where you have earned 150+ already. <br />
<br />
You want an item that costs 200 points: you could get up to three of them, actually, but only from camp 4 or 5, the camps where you have earned 200+ already. <br />
<br />
You want an itme that costs 75 points, but only comes from camp 1: go adventure there some more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">How it works:<br />
<br />
Each camp has its own points.  You can only buy items at a camp if you've earned points there, UNTIL you get 30 wins in a single camp.<br />
<br />
Once you accumulate 30 wins in a single camp, you can use all the points you've earned  in any camp to buy items from THAT camp.<br />
<br />
So, for example, since our uber armor is in Everfrost, you go and win 30 times in Miragul, and get 1492 points, enough for the sweeeeeeet armor.<br />
<br />
Now, since you have 30 wins at Everfrost, you can take the points you've earned getting Bane from Ruj and Spirit of Shrew from Mistmoore, and points gotten from helping your caster friends in Tak and Guk, and use them to buy the other uber armor pieces.<br />
<br />
I have a shiznit-load of points from Tak and Ruj.  Tak because 5 guildies had great items there and Ruj because I'm working towards Bane.  I have 900 points total from various camps.  But now I'm focused on Miragul and getting 30 wins, and when I do, I can take those 900 points and use them to get a major hand-up on the second uber armor piece once I get my 30 wins and 1492 points.<br />
<br />
I can't wait.  That armor is like a poor little guy stumbling across a Elemental plane-level mob that everyone forgot to loot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't think the number of wins has anything to do with it...I think it's strictly based on the number of points you have earned in a particular camp.  (i.e.;  I earn 900 points in Ruj I can now buy any item in Ruj up to 900 points - even using points I've earned in other camps)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bintner, I don't believe that you need 30 wins to be able to do that.  <br />
<br />
I got a little over 800 points at Tak so I could buy Remove Greater Curse.  Along the way I picked up a few points in Ruj, MM, Guk, and (whatever the the BB camp is called).  After spending 800 points on RGC, I could still buy items in that camp (Tak) up to my total points available, even though I only had 23 &quot;Tak points&quot; unused.  That is - I could spend points earned in Ruj or Guk as long as I did not exceed the price ceiling set by the total I had earned in Tak.  As described by numerous posters above.<br />
<br />
The 30 missions rumor I heard was about increasing the power/stats of the stone in my charm.  I have no idea if that is true.<br />
<br />
There is no need to do 30 missions to be able to spend points at different camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bintner, I don't believe that you need 30 wins to be able to do that.<br />
<br />
Odd.  I've built up 986 points total from various camps, but have spent 600, leaving me with 386 points.  I've bought the 600 point item from Tak, and yet when I look at the Tak merchant, it grays out anything more than my current Tak points of 57, instead of my current total of 386, but allows me to see all items up to 370 points.<br />
<br />
Weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sarelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are items that are Specific to each camps THEME. For those items, you must have earned sufficient points IN THAT CAMP to spend. There are also items which are not specific to a theme (i.e. the shaman REEBO line of spells, etc...) which you can purchase with points earned from any camp. When you click on the merchant and see what he has, notice the SECOND column which denotes the theme (GUK, RUJ, etc..). If there is nothing in that column you can spend any points you have available on that item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your description is wrong. As other people said you can spend your points anywhere but you can only buy items up to the number of points you've earned at that particular camp. You can always spend points in any camp you want your just limited to the buying power of the points you've earned in that camp. There is no number of point or adventures required. <br />
<br />
Personally I worked up ruj first and bought bane and then kept working it and bought a 40hps augment to stick in my helm. I bought the 40hp 1 adventure after i unlocked using a large portion of points got else where with out ever getting past 30 adventures in any camp. At that point I had spent ~1700 points in ruj but only gotten like 1200 points at that camp and no camps past 30 wins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Etric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">People are saying 30 wins because they assume everyone is lv 65.  51 points per success * 30 = 1530 points in a camp, which makes all the items able to be purchased.

<br />
OK, that's odd.<br />
<br />
But what i observed on various occasions is, that the list of selectable items has a small bug, so you sometimes can't buy items, even when they 'should' be in your points range.<br />
<br />
Try the following:<br />
- Select/unselect the 'only items you can use'-checkbox a few times<br />
- make sure, it is activated  ;) <br />
- click on the item, you want to buy<br />
- if it's still locked, click on lowish items, that are listed as buyable, scroll around a bit (forcing the listing to refresh, i assume).<br />
- click on the item, you want to buy.<br />
<br />
I have maxxed EF and got like 80 wins, so i don't make things up here. Hope that helps.<br />
<br />
Reread my or Samannas post by the way. There is no such thing as a 'hard' number of 30 missions to unlock other camps. These 30 missions ONLY mean as far as we know, that you got the maximum of 'useful' favor points for this camp, as there seems to be no item higher than 1492 points.<br />
<br />
Binters post is wrong in that it focusses on '30 wins'. You can buy item from camp A with points from camp B regardless of your number of wins. You have to meet 2 conditions:<br />
1. You have to earn enough points in campA to gain enough<br />
'favor' there to buy the item you want.<br />
2. You need to have enough actual 'available points' to buy the item, it does NOT matter, where this points come from, as long as condition 1. has been fulfilled as well.<br />
<br />
Bah, i don't know, how to explain this more clearly  :(</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a bug...if you haven't already, it's probably worth sending a bug report in game.  (so it's fixed before I run into it too  :p )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should read '.... which makes all the items in that specific camp able to be purchased, assuming you have not gained max points in another camp yet' = 'unlocking' 1 camp. I think Etric was referring to 1 camp anyway.<br />
<br />
To be able to select from all possible LDoN-items, you need minimum 1.492 points in each single camp = minimum 7.460 points = 'unlocking' all camps.<br />
<br />
You got better in camping a thread (74)  ;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I regularly group with a ranger, cleric and bard.  The ranger and I want the same type of armor from the Everfrost camp, which costs 1492 adventure points per piece.  Our group did adventures from the Everfrost camp until the ranger and I both had at least 1492 points earned from that camp.  Now that we have both done so we can take adventures from any of the camps to earn points.  And once I save up another 1492 points I can spend them at the Everfrost camp for another piece of armor. <br />
<br />
We have since moved to the North Ro camp to earn enough points from that camp for the bard to “unlock” the armor that she wants.  Once we’ve done that it’ll be the cleric’s turn to pick a camp.</div></div><hr />
