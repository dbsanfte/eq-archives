<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I have one account and therefore am unable to 2 box. I know some folks have a second account to play two characters, and others use a second account as a mule. While I would like to leave a character up in the bazaar at all times I am left with logging off my main and logging on the mule before heading to bed. This works fine and I am not complaining. My thought however was that with the new Shared Bank slots it appears that they are trying to enable swapping of equipment from toon to toon simple and useful.<br />
<br />
My (hardly thought out and probably stupid) thought is why can't they enable another character that can be played online at the same time as your main? It could be flagged as a type &quot;mule&quot; and they can set it so you can only have 1 per account. If it was set that it could only reside in the bazaar and be unable to zone wouldn't it be helpful? I would love to be able to just pop into the bank and drop items in the shared slot, and then switch over to the mule and pick them up before switching back to my main and play. I know logistically it wouldn't be easy to be able to create an interface swapping mechanism but I would love to be able to switch out to a mule and run a check of items up in the bazaar while I am playing my main.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Believe it or not, that is exactly what i thought, SoE was going to implement, when they first talked about this great new bazaar feature. Silly me even thought, it would be possible to log off and leave the bazaar vendor active.<br />
<br />
I like the bazaar feature as it is, but it's a bit annoying to 'waste' a real character or mule and the connection time to sell at bazaar.<br />
<br />
My guess is, the bazaar is lagging as hell because of all the player models in it. But for selling  I don't really need this models. The list of sellable items would be enough, maybe linked to some standard vendor models, which don't use so many graphic ressources.<br />
<br />
And for the 10-20 items per month i sell, i do not buy a second account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Think of the implications.....the bazaar can only have 500 &lt;?&gt; traders at one time. if what you were thinking actually happened, it would almost be impossible for most people to try and set up a trader. So people would probally hang around until a spot opened up. hmmm 500 traders then 100-200 other people shopping and  or waiting for a spot to open.......CRASH ! Now maybe to solve that problem you can only log the mule in as a trader. if their are no spots open, u cant log in. but that in itself would cause other problems, like not being able to get something from your inventory. Its an interesting idea but one I hope never happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">woon, I didn't know that you can only have 500 traders up at one time. Also, I don't see why the bazaar necessarily needs to be a functional zone like the rest of the game. Putting folks in a centralized place to buy and sell was a step forward from /ooc spamming, but is there really a need to have to run around the bazaar right clicking to aim at the person? While not difficult it is certainly not necessary. Why not keep it text based, instead of character models? When you zone in why not just have a black screen, so that if you backup, or move more than 10 feet you zone back out to nexus? From that screen you should be able to pull up /trader or /bazaar windows and make your selection. If you select an item you should be able to just purchase it. This would also work for having the vendors be available in the same manner. <br />
<br />
I would like to see this change regardless of my wishes to see a second mule online at all times.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should just stop thinking about it. heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's one thing that you're not taking into account:  THE BOTTOM LINE<br />
<br />
Whenever Sony makes a decision about the game, if there's a side about making more money an one that doesn't, Cony ALWAYS decides on the side of money.  <br />
<br />
You got a main who makes ph4t dr0ppables and you wanna sell the l00tz.  However, you don't want to stand in the bazaar all the time, whatcha gonna do?  Get another account, buy another set of software and pay Sony another $13 a month!  If you only go into merchant mode when you go to bed and are a power gamer, then who's up to buy yer stuff?  Nobody.<br />
<br />
BTW, on 7th Hammer, we get over 400 traders within a half hour of the servers coming back up....  the 500 limit is stressing traders on most servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Final, you always seem to hit the nail on the head.....<br />
<br />
Fortunately, or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it I am not a power gamer.... work gets in the way, so I can leave my mule online all night and all day until the precious 2-3 hours I can actually play.... now, if I could only get some stuff worth selling I would be golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Matten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;now, if I could only get some stuff worth selling I would be golden.&quot; <br />
<br />
lolz, thats classic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Justice.  Sony isn’t about to cut their financial throats by allowing what you suggest.  I think the best we can hope for is that they will open up a second bazaar zone so more people can set up vendors.  And though I’d love to be able to sell items while I’m also playing, the bazaar and now the shared bank space makes buying and selling so much easier than they used to be that I’m perfectly happy just selling while I’m asleep or at work.<br />
<br />
Just as a basis of comparison, UO handles vendors in a very different way.  Or at least they did a couple of years ago before I quit.  If you owned a house, or were friended to a house, you could buy a vendor deed.  This cost you X amount of money.  You then stood in the spot in your house you wanted your vendor to stand and activate the deed.  This included the porch and steps if you wanted your vendor to be visible from the outside.  Once activated, an NPC vendor would appear with a backpack you could fill with items to sell.  Since this wasn’t one of your characters it would remain up at all times.  However, you also had to pay your vendor or he would go poof and drop any remaining items on the ground.  As long as he was holding money for you he would take it out of that fund.  But if you didn’t lave any money on him it could be a problem.  I can honestly say I never had this happen to me or knew of anyone it happened to, as the payment was rather small.  <br />
<br />
From a buyer’s perspective you had to run all over the planet looking for what you wanted to buy.  You’d run up to a player house and click on a vendor to see what he was carrying.  If he didn’t have what you wanted you continued your search.  I kept a list of where I bought my items and hoped I’d find more when I went back the next time.  From a seller’s perspective you just crossed your fingers and hoped that people interested in buying your product could find your small cottage hidden in the middle of nowhere behind thirty other houses filled with vendors.  <br />
<br />
Shopping in UO was a lot more exciting than EQ.  It was very much like a treasure hunt.  And you could keep you items up for sale at all times, even when playing your character.  But EQ’s system is a hundred times more efficient for both buyers and sellers.  Just think of what it would be like if you had to search through every vendor’s inventory, one by one, looking for that specific weapon you wanted.  And then think of what it would be like if these same vendors were scattered haphazardly across Norrath instead of all being located in one room.  Of the two systems, I prefer EQ for its efficiency, even if it does cost us a bit of the excitement of UO’s system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bah, they don't need a bazaar anyway.  They should have made the bazaar a website and allow trades via web page.  Give something to the &quot;sales factor&quot; with a price and the factor sells it for you on consignment whether you are online or offline and deposits the money directly into your bank account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By this same logic we don’t need monster graphics either.  We could just go to a web page and type in our character name and what monster we want to fight and look at the text result.  Okay, that’s rather silly.  But the point I’m trying to make is that this is a role-playing game.  As such the atmosphere is a big part of what makes it fun.  Granted, some of the atmosphere is sacrificed for efficiency, such as using the search feature.  But our characters are still traveling to the bazaar, a gathering of merchants, and buying from one of these vendors.  It may not be a perfect system, but at least it still has a certain fantasy air to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Calabar,<br />
<br />
bazaar has a certain fantasy? Come on.<br />
<br />
Let's see, how a shopping tour goes:<br />
- zoning into bazaar<br />
- digging through the 3-4 standard morons <br />
   (always ogres or trolls for some reason) blocking the zoneline<br />
- desperately turning down all graphics to prevent crashing<br />
- looking for some things to buy (granted here you can get lucky once in a while)<br />
- trying to ignore spammers/casinos/scammers/buff beggars ...<br />
- digging through the 3-4 standard morons <br />
   (always ogres or trolls for some reason) blocking the zoneline<br />
  with a little luck still the same people as above<br />
- zoning out of bazaar<br />
- 2 or 3 zones later sighing because you again forgot to reset graphics  :D <br />
<br />
Nope, no fantasy of any type (maybe on FV? /shrug) here. It's a nice useful tool with not enough ressources and the need of a bit improvement, that's all.<br />
<br />
Seriously, for the fantasy touch i liked WC tunnels 100 times more.<br />
