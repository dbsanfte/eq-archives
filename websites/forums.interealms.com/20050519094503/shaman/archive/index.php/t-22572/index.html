<br />
Everquest has caused me to upgrade my PC 3 times since I started playing in 2000.  2 new PC's and one major overhaul.  I forgot to copy screenshots.  This thread has inspired me and Im gonna go root around the basement for one of my old PC's.  If the HD is corrupted I might be able to get a few :)<br />
<br />
And yes Faern, I think that I was happier back then than I am today.  Back then it was all new and all exciting.  Now Im jaded.  Its sad that every expasion now has me thinking &quot;what have they done to my class this time&quot; instead of &quot;COOL!  New stuff!&quot;  /shrug  I can still find happiness, but its harder now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">it may be sad.. but when their ratio of new class imbalances to new class upgrades is usually about 10:1 its certainly a realistic statement :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
That Ebon War Spear you're wielding in the 1st shot the first decent spear we got (Bone Spear kinda lacked stats).  It was sooo nice to finally lose the 1h blunt look and replace my Screaming Mace with the spear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, thems were the days.  I always got mad at that one annoying warrior who spammed my SK group with &quot;Looking to loot Avo Charms, paying # plat&quot; to farm their crafted for exp.  <br />
<br />
I also remember laughing at a RL druid friend who didn't get armor quests, I was like go wear your leather pants noob.  I was just messin with him but he was angry, but he eventually got his full generic set of BCL BCP RMB GEB etc.<br />
<br />
Thought it was sweet that every good item had an acronym, due to the low number of items that were worth something.<br />
<br />
As for me, this is my third computer since I started EQ in beta, and goodness knows if I hadn't upgrade, my computer would go into a nuclear meltdown when I try to zone into PoK on a friday.  So I don't have any of my old classic era pics :(<br />
<br />
Anybody remember that patch that stopped the ability for EQ to be run on 486's?  I thought that one was funny as heck, especially looking back on it now.</div></div><hr />

Remeber how I learnt sewing and made leather armor by hunting bears in Nektulos Forest and running back to Troll town to sell it. Back then they sold easily. I remeber thinking store bought armor had to be the best armor possible to get. Why else would they sell it?<br />
The game was alot less complicated back then... :)</div></div><hr />

He's ~ level 20 and wearing full Jarsath Scale armour (except the spanking new Scaled Mystic legs I'd just quested), I think the spear was a beetle stinger.<br />

Dig that funky &quot;I'm wearing a Jamaican flag&quot; look!<br />

Same guy, at level 26 and on the day I finally recieved my copy of SoL (getting expansions in the UK is a pain in the arse), in omg so cool spangle-o-vision PoP armour.<br />

Makes me sad to think how utterly cool he looked in that second shot and how long it's been since Scarus wore Iksar plate graphics.  God knows it's been at least a year since I had a helm graphic. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Took me forever to FINALLY ditch my Totemic helm and BP.  I was so in love with them that I had to get another BP for nostalgia (I got lucky while running to a PoF raid and lvl 60).  Was my 3rd TBp (I have loads of druid friends ;)).  When I finally dropped my BP it was for a Wicked Mail and my helm for a Rune Etched helm from Thurg that an uberguild ranger friend MQed with me.  I tried to keep the full plate look for as long as possible, well minus the kilt ... sadly, jar jar stats on that piece were just THAT much better than the totemic legs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ringmail and banded have different graphics. I think this is the banded one. Ringmail is also a chain-graphic, but it looks more like the hood of a cape. I remember shunning banded for for ringmail because banded made me look uncute.</div></div><hr />
