:confused:  <br />

what level should i start working on my epic weapon? cuz im only lvl 10 but should i wait till im like lvl 50+?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No point in doing anything until you've got a group capable of killing black dire.  Would probably take a full group of mid 40's.  You can buy the components for the shield of falsehood part, but the shield kind of sucks and I wouldn't bother with it.  The boots, though, are useful at any level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I started working on my epic at level 29 when I got my spell invisibility.  :)<br />
<br />
You should be able to solo for the shield of falsehood at level 34 with your trusty pet.   Unless you are a twink, the shield of falsehood is pretty decent.  I used mine until I got a sarnak battleshield.   Then again, SBS used to be much more expensive.<br />
<br />
You can do black dire for your boots with a 40s/low 50s group.<br />
<br />
You can gather reports in City of Mist during your 40s as well.<br />
Fear at 46+.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I waited til I was 60 - wish I woulda done it sooner - boots are really nice and spear is VERY nice - both would have been a big help in all my previous levels.  Oh well - live and learn!  Not sure how low is record for getting epic - I would think you could do it pretty early in level if you had help and MQ tear possibly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/em is working on it now, at lvl 24. Too bad my SHM is KoS in NFP ( IKS SHM ).<br />
<br />
I'm working on finding ways to get him from point A to point B though. Research, and you'll see when you can start your epic. :p<br />
<br />
And yes, I have groups/etc capable of takin on the Dire wolf. The boots are one of the main reasons I'm really looking at getting that part done asap for my shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>txMaddog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I started at 15, had gem in bank til level 30 (invis) then went to NFP.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest creating a char in Freeport and find where the shaman and the spirit are before going to Freeport.  If your KoS (Like my Iksar is :) ) I'd suggest finding places you can invis if it starts to drop and have gate memed.<br />
<br />
Did Test of Patiance at 30 with me, Monk, Bard and a 50ish Druid (for portage).  Bard is very nice to have for the water breathing song, invis to animals seemed to keep the sharks off us.<br />
<br />
Did Test of Wisdom at 35ish with basicly the same group (almost the same people too, differant Druid! :) ) and it was over kill.<br />
<br />
Got lucky while helping another Guild in MM with some Epic piece. Black Dire was up so me (45 Shaman), a 50+ SK, 45+ Ranger and 45+ Druid took him out.  Resisted all my spells so I just healed the SK while Black Dire chased him around while the ranger and druid killed him.  Took a good 10-15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Now came the hard part, turning in the Pelt in EJ.  After two (yes 2!) TPW's (Total Party Wipeouts) I finally turned it in and got my Black Fur Boots.<br />
<br />
Got my Tear during a Fear Raid so now I'm sitting in the Hole trying to get the firepower together to do High Scale Kirn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did the turn in for the Black Dire pelt alone. I just buffed up put invis to animals and ran to spot. You just have to avoid the undead and should get there with no probs. The one thing I did was read the spoiler and hot-keyed all the responces to the spirit. That way I was not stuck typeing out all the responces to it.</div></div><hr />
