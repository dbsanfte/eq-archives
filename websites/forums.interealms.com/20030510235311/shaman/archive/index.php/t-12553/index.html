<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well my friend is letting me use his 45 druid to PL my frog shaman on his server ( my third shaman ). Ive already got him to 22 since yesterday, the question is , where can i PL him from 22-30. Yea i know PL is kinda lame , but all i wanna do is play with them on their server ( the one ill group with are 30ish ) and its not like i need to learn to play a shaman :p.<br />
<br />
So any clues ? The druid only have up to kunark and a place where mobs dont run would be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm. I think south karana would be okay experience if you were PLing yourself. :)<br />
<br />
Lol wish I was lucky enough to do that. I restarted my shaman as a froglok so hes all twinked up but I'm finding it hard as hell to level. I'm so used to fighting as a high level shaman that fighting at low level without a group sucks. And I really dont like to group either so I'm sorta stuck myself.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What level is your frog now ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glazjaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If the druid can handle the heals and park the adds, I'd try to take the Lookout Room in Highkeep. 3 spawns, plus the Guard Room if available.  You'll get about 1-3 blues per kill there until 25.  Then take the Warrior Room if it's not camped till lvl 30.<br />
<br />
I took my SK there, and he was lvl 30 in 3 nights.  Late at night, you can usually find this place empty now.</div></div><hr />

My frog is level 20 at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Friend of mine uses Mistmoore alot. Think in the 20's he would pull to the graveyard area. I do think last one at least will run though so not quite what your looking for but an option. How about paw? though think they might run also its good exp and might be worth the hassle.</div></div><hr />

With the DS and druid healing you, you will absolutely tear through them.</div></div><hr />

Well i been doing split paw and its not bad XP. Zone modifier and a under untilized zone make it a great place. Most everything is red with a few blues oddly , so im hoping itll last him from 23 to 30. After that it doesnt matter cause ill be caught up and can just enjoy playing the froggy with my friends. Thanks for your input all.<br />
<br />
Oh and i i figured out how to eal with the run issue, just snared them and then have the shaman nuke to finish off or root to get back on the DS. It really doing his defense and melee skills some good , the casting skills can always be brought up fast with a lil KEI so no big.<br />
<br />
Are the gobs in Sol A weaker or tougher then gnolls, cause the gnolls are hitting a lil hard at times and if i can cut the damage shaman takes , i can move faster. I think SolA has a XP modifier too even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Skitzoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't think sol a goblins hit as hard as gnolls.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How I got my frog shaman to 55:  Powerleveling with a 45-55 Druid<br />
The 2 Box Perspective.<br />
<br />
Befallen    5-19  ~This is probably the easiest and fastest place i can think of. This took several hours<br />
<br />
Sol A       19-35 ~I powerlevel all tank types here, my frog started out slow, but after several levels it became very easy, only a few deaths overall. This took several days<br />
<br />
Jagged Pine Forest (poachers)  35-51 ~ This is not my recommendation, exp was very slow, but controlled and very safe. This took several weeks<br />
<br />
Dulak Harbor  51-55  ~I've been here for several weeks now. Exp is god awful slow for my frog, compared to my druid. The loot is great, sometime I'm able to pull in 1500p a KEI session after selling gems. <br />
<br />
Befallen is almost always empty, enjoy your time here.. you wont be here for long. You even get a free 1 charge summon horse!<br />
<br />
Sol A takes some getting used to, but after you've been there for awhile you'll come to realize this is the fastest place to level for 19-35. I find the best place to camp is the fireplace room in the northern part of zone. (25-35) Loot here should pay for KEI and you'll beable to get some (ok) items that will sell for 50+plat in the Bazaar.<br />
I would strongly advise NOT to use a pet in this zone. <br />
Druid should pull until later levels, unless you your equipment is really good. I'm poor, I went with the highest AC gear i could find for the cheapest price. I didn't bother with spells until level 30 or so.<br />
<br />
Jagged Pine Forrest poachers camp is where I got my AA exp for my druid. I know the zone very well. I couldn't think of another place to go. Loot here is decent, but exp was just too slow. If I had to do it all over again, I'd have choose another place. 51+ must pull here. anything less you'll get aggro.<br />
<br />
I would head for Dulak harbor about level 45, mobs hit hard and fast here. Shamans are wanted heavily in groups. This is where poor people (myself) start to get decent equipment<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<br />
You think a level 20 shaman could solo here? Or would I have to get a group? I have about 600 ac, 164 mana with KEI, and about 800 hp without outside buffs. I havent created a magelo for my froglok but basically hes using all the equipment in my current magelo except for the req. level ones and no drop ones. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And besides, you wont have to compete with ANYONE for spawns.<br />
<br />
Get a regen and a DS, then wade right in.  Most rooms only have 2-3 mobs, so you shouldn't be ganged up too bad.  This also means you wont need any mid-fight healing which would create aggro on the druid.</div></div><hr />

You were right. I was getting 4% exp per kill there at level 21. There was only one problem. I was doing it solo so I couldn't go in to far. Even with KEI I had troubly handling two so I only fought the ones near the zoneline. The wizards are the worst so far. They seem to have more hp than the melee goblins and constantly nuke me for 80-100+ damage each time. :( Unfortunatly I don't know many people my level to group with, and the zone is empty most of the time it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Get a level or two and you could solo Tizmak's in GD for great xp (just keep druid in old world at a PoK book and run shaman back when you need HP buffs again).  With HP buffs and KEI you should easily be able to solo Tizmak  (range from level 24-32 I believe).  Tons of them and its a great spot to group for massive xp too.  I think Tizmak give 2-3% per kill at level 22?   I PL'd my wizard on them recently and I was getting 50-60% xp per pull (pulling with Jaradis using DS potions to do most of the damage and then wizard just PB AE'd once).  I could kill 10-12 per pull that way.  Towards the end when I was around level 37 it was going down towards 10% per pull.  From 37-39 I had a level 65 Enchanter friend AE stun a massive 35-40 tizmak pull while my Wiz burned them down, getting about 20% per pull that way :)<br />
<br />
Tizmak are a lot of fun too with a group, you can crawl through the caves going from group to group of them,  6 min respawn and TONS of them (at least 150 spawn points) and no one is ever there.  Even with 2 groups inside and me pulling 35-40 at a time we never ran into each other.</div></div><hr />

With KEI you should be soloing in PC or echo. I would suggest coming back to SolA around 24/25 if you wanna solo. You will have more HP , higher AC and more mana. All three zones will rock for your level.</div></div><hr />

I would solo bandits but they are camped 24/7, and the fiends seem to be more trouble than they're worth with that dot.  :rolleyes: I can't do much melee damage with my Slime Coated Harpoon so I nuke until they're dead. Although when I get some levels I should be able to make decent money and maybe buy that 12 dmg 19 dly spear. Forgot the name of it.  :p  I've never been to echo so I'll have to check that out. What exactly should I kill in echo?</div></div><hr />

Number 6 is the needlite camp which is accessed from the side by the souldbinder. There is  Boglings on the way to the camp which will be ok for you, just watch that back room where the chief spawns , they are all higher range. The needlite camp is camped often , its something you need to reserve, ask them when they will be done and check back once in a while. THough often you get lucky and no one will be there if your early. At late night &quot; peak&quot; times it will be camped for sure.<br />
<br />
Needlite camp is perfect , its on a good time so you can rest up before they all respawn and if you want to pull a few boglings from where ever then you can do that if the mana is runing good. the only hard part can be breaking the spawns, but once you offset the spawn timing your good to go. Now there is one thing with this place and that is the neelite queen , she can be a bish and a half , she is low hitpoints , but unless your good with your timing she will come with add/adds. if you get her single and have aego on im sure you will outlast here ( she will DoT you and melee you ). She will pop randomly, no real set pattern , so if you can take her ( she is level 27 i think ) then your good , if not im sure someone will come help you if you /ooc , they always did with me on all my characters. I would suggest sicking to PC till 24, bandit groups are great XP still , then move to Echo where you can handle it a lil better at that level , 20 is a lil low still.<br />
<br />
Oh and 30/31ish , head to cystal caverns. The XP is incredible there and the cash you can make is outstanding for that level. You will get upgrades galore from selling off the velium blocks and velium weapons in the bazaar. That place will hold you for a quite a while and has a very good feeling to it, a classic dungeon.<br />
<br />
anyway , hope that help a lil , good luck<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kyot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Upper Guk is one of the single best spots to power level, I know I have used it to power level quite a few characters, including my froggy shaman.<br />
<br />
Upper Guk has a phenomal experience bonus to it, and you can easily level to 35 from your low 20's in a good day of fighting.  Just head in and venture up to the ancient croc spawn.  The croc spawn is a great place to fight; it is easy to control runners due to the long tunnel, it has several shins spawn to pull (3 frogs on either side at end of tunnel, and the three, two and three spawns near zone to lower guk), well fighting at the croc you are bound to see the ancient (whose arm drop still sells for about 250, legs 350 easily on Tarew Marr anyways), and if somehow something goes wrong there are two zones right beside you.<br />
<br />
Things will start turning blue around level 29, but trust me on this, you will not care, just keep fighting to level 35 here.  The exp bonus is that good.  And the money is really decent, you have the ancient drops, and the frogs drop quite a bit of fs.<br />
<br />
You can easily keep KEI up here, because there is a book to POK right outside guk.<br />
<br />
If the ancient croc is camped, most people will not mind if you ask to just pull frogs there.  And when they leave the crocs are all yours.<br />
<br />
Give it a try, I gurantee you will not regret it.<br />
<br />
p.s In case you were not aware, guk is not on the same faction as gukta, I have killed thousands of frogs and they still love me in Gukta<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Nice  tip on guk. So for its about as good as XP as SolA has been but im also higher level then when i started in solA so maybe that says somethign for the place. So far that spot you directed me to is real nice. I go there and the zone was empty so i parked on the side of the water before AC room. By the time i pulled the 2 spawns of 3 and the croc room , i had enough time for 1 or 2 from the path on the way in before they all started spawning again. Very nice and less train possabilites. Plus oddly enough it was a comfortable place. Had a nice dungeon feeling to it. As far as faction, i dont care , im sure ill be hunting alot in the dead side too so itll all even out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway , thnx again for the good tip , i camped there so i could continue there tomarrow i liked it so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kyot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Glad you enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
Just in case you didn&quot;t know, the crocs in the ac room don&quot;t agro unless you get fairly close to them, and even then rarely do.  So you can fight right in the room on the first two platforms and not worry about agro from the crocs when they spawn(not sure if that is what your doing from your description).  <br />
<br />
Be sure to pull the spawns near the zone to live side lower guk (from the croc room, head straight out and either swim right, or run right on the platform).  They are usually all shins spawns, with alot more higher level spawns like knights.  They also seem to drop alot more fs, then the ones on the platform straight out from the croc room.<br />
<br />
I should warn you about one thing however, there is a wandering tonne knight spawn on the platform straight out from the croc room. He wanders from the zone to live side lower guk, to the small platfrom near the water entrance to dead side of lower guk.  I would recommend not pulling this one, and just killing it with your higher level.  This spawns is really buggy, and seems to like to run through walls for no reason, aggroing everything around the area to you.  <br />
<br />
As I  mentioned, I found the exp really really good until 35.  In fact at around 30 31 I headed down to live side of lower guk, because everything was blue or even to me in this spot.  Was fighting dars and minos downstairs (reds and yellows) and the exp was so much slower that I went back upstairs and finished to 35. <br />
