<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Grats to Wyrdlan for noticing this... This comes from Ratt, the head developer of ShowEQ.<br />
<br />
I'm making a definitive post on the matter... Whoeve the brainiac at Verant was that said &quot;Hey, what a good idea, lets make it so SEQ has to use the EQ machine to get the key!&quot; was just signed their own termination papers... or if that persons boss is smart, that's what would happen. <br />
<br />
The fact is, with the lid blown off of the Linux version, forcing us to use a leech on the Windows machine, there is absolutely, positively no reason not to have a WinSEQ... and it is now inevitable anyway. If we don't do it, someone else will... because the port really is trivial. <br />
<br />
The social contract that we've enjoyed for so long has been broken by some idiot brain (hows that for an oxymoron?) and the corporate suit who agreed with it (who obviously had absolutely no concept of the implications of his or her actions)... and since it's been broken... as I say on the main page... Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war! <br />
<br />
I hope Verant is prepared to ban $100,000's in revenue... because the download staticsics on the new libEQ.a were startling, even to me. I had no idea so many *UNIQUE* people were using libEQ.a. <br />
<br />
In one way, it's sad... it's the end of an era. In another way, it's funny... the absolute hell and damnation they have just brought down upon themselves is staggering. Prepare for an onslaught of thounds upon thousands of users using SEQ ... prepare for mass bannings. Prepare for chaos and stupdity... but in the end, SEQ will still exist and Verant will be out HUGE monetary sums from the bannings. <br />
<br />
Welcome to your own little corner of Hell, SOE... you have no one to blame but yourselves for this. I hope the millions of dollars per year of lost revenue will make up for banning the *mostly* responsible SEQ users out there. <br />
<br />
SOE can't stop SEQ... that's what at the root of the humor. It will always be there, in one form or another. They had a nice little deal going here, keep it contained and as responsible as reasonably possibe, for ZERO development and operational costs. Now, not only are they going to have to expend resources to find and detect SEQ users, but they will ALSO lose revenue with the banned accounts. This is a NO WIN situation for Verant. There is no possible financial benefit to this move, ALL POSSIBLE outcomes are detrimental to the profitablity of EQ as a commercial entity. <br />
<br />
Instead, they've chosen the path of chaos, and not even Sony can tame chaos in any meaningful and lasting way. So let them reap the chaos whirlwind they have sown. I will not hold it in check any longer. Let the Windows versions flow! Let the commercial products SELL. LET THEM RUIN THEIR OWN GAME with the thoundsands of moronic idiots using SEQ. <br />
<br />
The bar has been broken, there will be NO barrier to entry now, and there WILL be a bannings aplenty, make no mistake. I expects hundreds, if not THOUSANDS of bannings. I expect utter horror and chaos, ridiculous actions by SOE and othe opposition. But in the end, this will only harm us, the players, because the game will be ruined in new and imaginitive ways... because Verant can't stop them all... and they will keep coming, and coming... and coming. But by harming us, they harm themselves, because they slowly erode their player base. <br />
<br />
I wish good luck to the Verant programmers, because I know their life just turned into a living hell... most just don't know it yet. <br />
<br />
I liken the new order to Echo Star hacking. The smartcards DTV and Echostar use for encryption are INFINITELY more secure than the joke crap that Verant could use (because the smart cards are ASICs designed SPECIFICALLY AND SOLEY TO do FAST, SECURE decryption)... but Dish and DTV can't stop the signal theft? Why? Because you CAN'T STOP the dedicated hordes of people that work for free. You CAN'T thrown enough money at a problem to overcome thoundands of people, working together and seperately for a common goal... all for free. <br />
<br />
If Huges Networks, and Echostar can't defeat the problem with sophisticated smart cards and tens of millions of dollars spent per year to prevent people from intercepting HEAVILY encrypted signals, do you think the piddly little budget of EQ can even get close? Haha, not a chance. <br />
<br />
Anyway... it was a good show the whole time and very enjoyable. I'm sad that it has come to this. The rushing flood waters are already speeding towards the little EQ village... what will remain standing after the wave crashes over the town limits is anyones guess. I feel I played fair and did my part in the whole EQ deal and there was nothing more I could have done, so I am comfortable. Now it's SOE's job to pick up the pieces in the aftermath. I don't envy anyone that job, and I feel bad for some of you that are going to get washed away (banned) by the flood. The only advice I can offer you is DON'T BE STUPID. Think about what you are doing before you do it. If you don't feel comfortable with your conclusions, ASK... and then weigh the risks. I also suggest you pick up a good C++ or VB book and figure out how to write your own key sniffer. <br />
<br />
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a war to fight. Oh wait... no I don't... I can just let the waves of inevitibility wash over our opponents and crush them far quicker and easier than I could ever manage with my meager resources. Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war indeed... <br />
<br />

Verant apparently finally put in secure pgp keys in their data packets. Good.<br />
<br />
But now showeq is threatrening to become a memory reader, something Verant will have a much much harder time breaking. Bad. Which means any idiot who runs windows can now cheat. Extremely bad.<br />
<br />
I don't know about you, but this sort of thing just makes me sad.... it's going to be impossible to find rare spawns anymore, with people without track checking zone maps to see who's up and where and when.</div></div><hr />

But, if anything, the programmers who make it point out EQ's most obvious flaws. There shouldnt be such random, named spawns dropping specific loot. If somone with showEQ didn't gank it, your friendly druid would anyway.<br />
<br />
If they want to defeat crap like this, Verant needs to simply get rid of the stupid ass rare spawn crap, and make it a rare random drop off any similar level critter. I have always thought that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I personally think it was a bad move on Sony's part.  I suppose I might be surprised at the number of people that use ShowEQ, but at least it had a fairly high threshold of entry (neded a spare system with linyx, and some linux know-how to get it downloaded, compiled, and installed).  If it's moved to windows, any Everquest user easily becomes a potential ShowEQ user.<br />
<br />
I really don't see what Sony gains by doing this, other than potentially they're testing encryption schemes for EQ2.  But still, with the client in the hackers hands, it's extremely difficult (if not impossible) to prevent it from being exploited.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I'm kind of a hacker at heart, so I follow this stuff...  Here's what's happening to the best of my knowledge.  It may not be 100% accurate, but at least close.  ;)<br />
<br />
It's really not necessarily a PGP key - that's a specific type of encryption.   EQ has always used a very secure method of transferring the decryption key it uses to the client - it's essentially uncrackable.  It's also too processor intensive to use for the regular packets, which is why it's not done.<br />
<br />
The old decryption key was 32 bits - 4 billion combinations.  With PoP, they upgraded it to 64 bits - 4billion times 4billion combinations.  It would be essentially impossible to brute-force a 64-bit key (well, not impossible, but we're talking longer than human lifetimes on one machine).  But the ShowEQ programmers were apparently able to look at the encrypted EQ packets and figue out clues as to what the decryption key might be, so they have to check far fewer possibilities.<br />
<br />
With the Oct 31st patch, Sony started compressing the data before encrypting it, thus eliminating any way to glean info about the key from the EQ packets.<br />
<br />
Basically, this leaves one option - pull it out from the EQ client, where it's just sitting there plain as day.  There's a poll as to what people want the developers to do...  One option is full-blown ShowEQ for windows - god help us.  Another is to make a snooper that pulls the key and sends it to a linux showeq program.  That would essentially make it runnable by the same subset of eq users as before...  Hopefully that's the way it goes.<br />
<br />
With either of these options, there will at least be greater risk for a ShowEQ user.  Because something is running on the same computer as Everquest, Sony could conceivably detect it and ban the user.  There are probably legal issues with Sony doing this, but I really don't know much about that.</div></div><hr />

He downplays one thing:  ShowEQ on Linux is 100% undetectable from a technology standpoint, you have to detect it's probable use by observing someone's behavior.  ShowEQ on Windows will be 100% detectable by Verant, if they decide to reverse their previous pledge not to scan your machine or memory.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, he does say he expects hundreds or thousands of bannings - not sure that's downplaying it too much.</div></div><hr />

&quot;it's going to be impossible to find rare spawns anymore, with people without track checking zone maps to see who's up and where and when.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think I wrote this oddly :) Sometimes my grammar sucks.<br />
<br />
What I am complaining about is that showeq for windows will have a LOT more users. So with all the cheaters looking at the map, it's going to be impossible for us normal trackless people to find things like Grizzleknot or Quillmane, not because of the trackers, but because of the cheaters who play rogues or warriors, running EXACTLY to where Quillmane is, without a tracker. While we're either running around randomly or hiring a tracking friend.<br />
<br />
I don't run SEQ. I never have, I never will. I don't believe in cheating. Sorry to anyone who thought I did or was condoning SEQ. But I am very pissed off that they are going to make it Windows based, where any kid can just download it and cheat away.<br />
<br />
Glorianna, let me see if I can explain it better. :)<br />
<br />
I'm not an expert on SEQ, I only just started reading about it to discover why they're going all wild all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
The way SEQ worked:<br />
<br />
It ran on a secondary linux box (which is another operating system, one that is a bit of a PITA to use, I used to run linux myself for many years).<br />
<br />
That linux box would sniff all inbound packets sent to your EQ client when you zoned. Then it would decrypt - or unscramble them, to get the data. Inside these packets would be a zone map, your location, and the spawn location for all the monsters, the amount of xp they give, the types of stuff they drop, etc etc. Lots of goodies we are not supposed to see.<br />
<br />
Now Verant could have made these packets uncrackable before. But that would've made a lot more work for the client machine, as it would have had to crack it itself before it could use the data. So for a long time, Verant chose not to fix this, because it would make it very hard to run EQ on slower machines.<br />
<br />
Someone called &quot;Patrick&quot; at Verant has made a good pgp key system (that's a type of encryption) which EQ clients can decrypt without a significant slowdown. It's a 64 base key, which means it would take hours, or days, to brute force try every key in the sequence against a single packet. And the key changes every time you zone. Yay for Patrick, he single handedly stopped the packet sniffers in SEQ.<br />
<br />
But Ratt, who runs SEQ, is now threatening war. Instead of SEQ running only on Linux machines, which do take a lot to set up, etc, he's going to make it run on windows, where it will just read the memory rather than reading the data packets. In memory, everything is uncrypted, because the machine has no reason to suspect tampering from a process on itself. Also decrypting every time you read your own memory is impractical.<br />
<br />
SEQ for windows could be run on any windows machine, by any untrained idiot.... what kept SEQ from being widespread was Linux users generally don't help idiots, and idiots were the ones who usually overabused cheating programs such as this. So you had to have a certain amount of knowledge to run SEQ. Now with SEQ for windows, anyone can.<br />
<br />
Which is very, very bad.<br />
<br />
I hope this makes sense. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sheylock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">*beep* seems like others were faster on explaining the PGP thingy :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If they decide to reverse their previous pledge not to scan your machine or memory.  <br />
<br />
That pledge is called staying above the law :) It would be illegal for Verant to scan our machines / memory and send any info back to Verant, they could probably detect them running and stop EQ from starting legally (ie. without making any note on your account or anything) but that would be easily crackable. <br />
<br />
The fact is, on machines which do any calculation to do with the input/output hacking is always possbile. And they aren't going to start streaming video to and fro with no latency anytime in the next 1000years <br />
<br />
There are several very easy ways to reduce the power of ShowEQ type tools but they require a bit of programming on Verants side to do. <br />
<br />
Verant can PM me and I'll tell you for a pre-nerf DE mask ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Glori:<br />
<br />
Within the EQ Client it now makes up an encryption key and then encrypts all the data sent to the game servers.  ShowEQ used to just read the incoming and outgoing data and present that on a second computer so you could see it.   Now, with that data encrypted, you need a small program on the EQ machine itself to read the key so you can unlock the data.  ShowEQ was technically legal because it never interferred or changed the data being sent or recieved, it just read it and displayed data that was not being shown by your client.  It was never running on the machine running EQ itself, never touched or altered the data.<br />
<br />
ShowEQ always had refused to develop the software for windows machines because it then gets too easy for J. Random User to install and use it.  They purposefully kept it hard to use to prevent the &quot;unwashed masses&quot; from hurting themselves by using it.  By using the key ShowEQ must have at least some part running on the Windows box and since they have to do, they're going to just port the software for Windows.<br />
<br />
Once it's released, everyone and their cousin is welcome to download the program and run it without requiring a second box, some working knowledge of linux or anything.  Imagine if anyone without the slightest bit of self-restraint all a sudden had 100% perfect tracking?   Watch groups of people go running for the named right as it spawns.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Slow typer and forgot that it was already encrypted, just much harder now.   The end point is if they make it too easy to use, everyone will use it and that'll cause lots of problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, it was always encrypted...  They just upped the encryption, which was broken again, but the addition of compression before encryption yesterday is what now makes it very unlikely that they'll be able to do it withough getting they key from the client now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ack, this is starting to sound like Phantasy Star Online. That was the first online game I played a year ago, and the cheaters absolutely RUINED the game.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Harvyst,<br />
<br />
I totally understand, SEQ users from my standpoint so far are quite responsible with using SEQ. Now with a Windows version, eveyone including thier grandma can use it.<br />
<br />
I guess EQ might become the 'Diablo' cheating game that it wasn't meant to be.<br />
<br />
I know cheating is bad but esentially everyone cheats if you use a map or spoiler site. I bet you alot of the information out there, maps and stuff are a direct result from SEQ users posting thier findings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other comment I have to make is, just because it may prove out in the long run that they cannot stop showeq, does that mean they shouldn't try at all? <br />
<br />
If you have to cheat to win, did you really win?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Eh, yeah, they were cheating but at least they had the restraint to make it too easy -  a point &amp; click tool for just anyone.<br />
<br />
I work for &quot;a nationwide cable modem internet service provider&quot; (cough NDA cough) and it was always possible to uncap the speed on the modems, it just took some work.   Someone made a point &amp; click tool that anyone could use and we disconnected hundreds of people for rampant abuse within 48 hours.  People were dumb enough to remove all speed caps on their modem &amp; then share stuff via kazaa &amp; the like.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I used to live with a friend who ran SEQ, so I had it for a while.  It was nice.  I never used it to farm named, since my time has always been limited (ie. I can very rarely sit on for like 10 hours).  What was nice was like say I zone into Gfay.  I could watch the showeq screen and run straight to the pod lift, as opposed to following the trail, and saving myself like 3 minutes of run time.  I also used it when pulling fear for the first time for my old guild (when it took us like 16 hours to clear to yellow tower).  It helped me learn mob pathing without spending months in fear, and it helped me locate people's corpses so we didn't have to clear to a point to get people back into the raid.  Other than that I didn't find a need for it.  I only had it for like 2 months, and i've gone probly 16 months without it now, and I have no reason to go back to using it =)<br />
<br />
For those of you that think it's this big cheating tool, and we're all screwed if it goes to windows, I say:  Don't worry, for most people it'll be more effort than it's worth.  I doesn't really make the game any easier.  You still have to log the time and what not to make named spawn, or to wait countless hours.  I've read there's ways with showeq to leave a char in a zone, and setup seq to like page you or something when a named that you want spawns, but I've never actually seen that done.  I'm telling you this really won't change the game much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was the single most funny post I have ever read.  Seriously, it had everything.  Let's go for the rundown.<br />
<br />
- Evil Genius Guy (EGG) is mad because Verant made it harder for him to use his little cheat program.<br />
<br />
-  Said EGG has somehow convinced himself that Verant &quot;needs&quot; him and that the sheer volume of people who cheat alongside him will, once banned, create economic disaster for EverQuest.<br />
<br />
- Then he gets crazy, starts calling for the dogs of war, havoc, you name it.  Something tells me he's doing this out loud too.  But something also tells me his mother yelled down the basement at him and then he stopped.<br />
<br />
- If the dogs of war don't maul him in the midst of their HAVOC!, then he obliges Verant to immediately fire the SOB who did this.  SOB!  Stop making it harder for me to cheat, or I'll call for your job!<br />
<br />
-  Did I mention that he called forth the dogs of war?  Because they wouldn't let him cheat as easily?  That still makes me laugh.  Because he did it TWICE.<br />
<br />
- Then he backs off.  He doesn't need to do anything.  He has HORDES.  And they will WASH OVER Verant like waves!!!!  The imagery!  The horror!  The lonely college kids who won't be able to get a power trip by cheating in a video game!  Eep!<br />

The old decryption key was 32 bits - 4 billion combinations.  With PoP, they upgraded it to 64 bits - 4billion times 4billion combinations.  It would be essentially impossible to brute-force a 64-bit key (well, not impossible, but we're talking longer than human lifetimes on one machine).<br />
<br />
The original EQ encryption was either 8 or 16 bit, I forget which. But either way trivial. But you're spewing total garbage out of your mouth about 64-bit keys and brute forcing them. Rfer to page 153 of your handy Applied Cryptography book (you don't have it?) and you'll see the time estimates for 64-bit keys back in 1995 was about a year for the amount of money major universities spend on their unix servers. Take into account that each client doesn't have to crack the key, SEQ has always distributed the key in their lib and that processing power in 2002 is much greater you have the fact that the cracking time on a 64-bit key is absolutely trivial.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't proclaim to know what EQ uses for their encryption now. PGP seems unlikely because it takes a lot of prcessing time. I would guess AES or Twofish because those were designed to be _fast_. If they aren't using AES and aat least 128-bit encryption, shame on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, there's always been a fair amount of cheats for EQ. Anything from z-axis to speedhack to duping items and coin. I recently read an article on plat duping in EQ. And it's a fact that the vast majority of cash sitting in players hands are from dupes. Each server has a current estimated 3 million duped pp in circulation.<br />
<br />
It all starts like this: someone dupes a ton of cash, buys an item for an insane amount (thereby setting the worth of the item around this absurd figure), then the person who obtained the plat with trading recirculates this back through trading with players.<br />
<br />
There is no way the amount of cash being used to buy items from players came about in a legit fashion. Most of it started out from dupes.<br />
<br />
That is what we have to thank for 50k+ shaman spells. Without the initial dupe, almost no one would have been able to gather this sum originally, and there would be a lot less plat changing hands.<br />
<br />
Ever tried playing the game without making plat through player auctions?<br />
<br />
You can't get 50,000pp, but something, then get another 50,000pp to buy something else. It's impossible with the game mechanics. The money comes from trading with players, and that started out as plat dupes and trade skill macros (yes they exist in EQ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why, no, I don't have that book, but care to explain why this is the case in cracking RC5-64 (64 bit encryption)<br />
<br />
http://www.distributed.net/pressroom/news-20020926.html<br />
Ignoring artificially high numbers resulting from network difficulties, we completed 86,950,894 workunits on our best day. This is 0.12% of the total keyspace meaning that at our peak rate we could expect to exhaust the keyspace in 790 days. Our peak rate of 270,147,024 kkeys/sec is equivalent to 32,504 800MHz Apple PowerBook G4 laptops or 45,998 2GHz AMD Athlon XP machines or (to use some rc5-56 numbers) nearly a half million Pentium Pro 200s.<br />
<br />
So if someone had 46,000 2GHz machines running SEQ, they could decode a zone in 2 years.  Woot!<br />
<br />
I don't claim to be a cryptology expert - far from it, but the people who created ShowEQ said that the old one was 32 bit, and the new one was 64 bit, and the new one would take about 9 billion years to crack via brute-force.  I suppose you know more about it than the people who actually did it?  Uh-huh.<br />
<br />
http://seq.sourceforge.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2191<br />
You have the initial 4 billion (32 bit key), tacking on an addition 4 billion (32 bit key) combinations. <br />
<br />
I think this would yield 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 different key combinations (18 quintillion possible keys). Correct me if my math is off... tough to work with such large numbers  <br />
<br />
18,446,744,073,709,551,616 - 64 bit <br />
4,294,967,296 - 32 bit <br />
<br />
To put this in perspective... <br />
<br />
Lets say you had a system capable of trying 3 million keys per second. It's not infeasable some of you could have a multi processor system capable of that. It would take you about 24 minutes to try every single possible key... but given the mathematical probability of finding the key, it would take you 12 minutes per key on average. This is assuming you have the fastest CPUs available today running in an SMP configuration (and SEQ supported multi threaded key finding)... 99.9% of you (including myself) do not run on P4 3.06GHZ SMP machines for you SEQ box, I'm sure. More than likely, you have a 1 or 2GHZ machines, possibly even much slower. So your time would increase dramatically... but lets assume you have the best. <br />
<br />
Now to crack a 64 bit key with brute force, it would take the same super SMP system 5,124,095,576,030,431 minutes or 3,558,399,705,576 days, or 9,742,367,434 ... yes, 9 billion years. Basically, the sun would grow old and die before your brand new P4 3.06 GHZ 2 CPU system would brute force a 64 bit key.<br />
<br />
Now, care to back up your claim that I'm spewing garbage and a 64-bit key is trivial?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'm just disappointed I guess.<br />
<br />
I used to play Starcraft all the time. Against random people too. I wasn't the best player but I was pretty good - my strategy was Protoss, defend against zerg rushes and then sweep the skies. And usually I did ok.<br />
<br />
But I could tell when I entered a game with a cheater. Those cheaters did something similar to Starcraft - it enabled them to see the whole map, rather than the &quot;fog of war&quot; that enabled them to get accurate data only on what's around them. So basically they saw right away where I was, and what I was building. Not good. Not fair.<br />
<br />
That's why I quit playing SC, in the end, because it's one thing if you sneak an overlord/spy ship into my territory, that's skill. But if you use god mode to make that skill into a 100% guaranteed advantage, that's cheating. I can't stop you, I can't even see where you are without having to build up my own spy forces. So by the time I'm finished getting reports from my scout on your location, your forces are at my door and you know exactly where my weakness is.<br />
<br />
It wears on you over time. The joy of playing a good game - and loosing to a good player - is ruined after dealing with 1 or 3 cheaters. Then it just becomes an excersize in futility, because I refuse to cheat.</div></div><hr />

You can't get 50,000pp, but something, then get another 50,000pp to buy something else. It's impossible with the game mechanics. The money comes from trading with players, and that started out as plat dupes and trade skill macros (yes they exist in EQ).<br />
<br />
I have. 50k is a LOT to earn, but it is doable.<br />
<br />
My favourite farming place - but gods, it's boring - is flawless and superb hides. I sell superb for 250 and flawless for 200, I can get about 4 of each every 3 hours or so. That's 1800 plat for about 3 hours of work. (There is a random element to it, someimes I get streaks and streaks of nothing, sometimes I get 6 of each). <br />
<br />
But gods, it's boring. You do it for 16 hours over a weekend, you can make 10k. Boring boring boring, and they're all green to me. I'm currently doing a lot of this right now to earn money for Torpor. Whenever I have a spare hour or two, mons letalis here I come. But it's sickeningly boring.<br />
<br />
As for trade macros... I know about MacroQuest, which enables players to make 1k an hour using a fletching macro. Ever see two level 1 characters standing around a fletching vendor? Chances are they're using macroquest, and the real character makes 48k a day off of them. Unfair? Totally. Here I am blowing my weekends for five weeks to make what they make in one day.<br />

You go, Verant, change the encryption/compression every patch and put these guys out of business.  ANY security setup can be cracked, in time... but EQ's can be CHANGED, thanks to the mandatory patch download process.  All they have to do is change it faster than the hackers can crack it.<br />
<br />
As for the viability of cracking a 64-bit key - yeah, it can be done fairly easily today, but it's not going to happen often.  When it is done it's with a whole university full of idle PCs on people's desks, and it still takes days.

No, I don't claim to be an expert in encryption. That's why I keep reference books written by people who do by my desk. And I'll trust the head stud from Counterpane (http://www.counterpane.com) over the folks of SEQ and Verant any day of the week.<br />
<br />
64-bit keys are NOT considered secure and IIRC (I may be off by a couple bits) are thus ok for export by the U.S. government. I went through this review not very long ago for our technology at my company when we were applying for permission to export. 64-bit keys are considered trivial to crack and are pretty much laughed at by the good people at the NSA and FBI.<br />
<br />
Also, the key was not cracked on each individual box. SEQ cracked the key and re-distributed an updated lib file that everyone who used SEQ used to rebuild their SEQ app.</div></div><hr />

Don't you ever wonder how many rare spawns you *haven't* seen because some cheater is running Show EQ and gets there first?<br />
<br />
How many wizards are 'safely' quadding with SEQ because they know where the open areas are, and 'can see over the hill' and know in advance if a mob is waiting for them?<br />
<br />
Or how about that 60 shaman soloing in Umbral that 'somehow' only manages to pull the 55+ mobs, leaving you the mobs that give 1/2 as much XP for 90% of the work?<br />
<br />
Sure the folks at SEQ can probably weasel their way around this problem one undetectable way or another.  Scan memory, etc, I don't know.<br />
<br />
But VI can make it hard for them every patch.  How many times per month do you get a new eqgame.exe?  Sure the SEQ folks can hack the new one 'within hours' every time, but distributing the hack, etc, means that if Sony wants to make life hard on SEQ, they can do it.<br />
<br />
And I'd bet 95% of the SEQ users don't want to bother redownloading the latest SEQ hack every few days.<br />
<br />
I think SEQ and Macro programs are blatant cheating, and I'd heartily cheer a focused initiative to disable them every patch.</div></div><hr />

Second off. I dont use showeq but I read about it and read thier site for when to call bs on what VI is up to.<br />
<br />
ShowEQ only reads what is sent to the client.  There is only so much that is sent to the client as VI has stripped it down over the years from this program.  <br />
<br />
First big misconception: ShowEQ only allows you to see what the mob is holding.  The server sends the remaining loot when you loot the mob.<br />
<br />
Second miconception: yes it lets you see the mobs in the zone but the client is dumb when it comes to spawn times.  There are alarms and such you can set that allow you to track spawn times of certain mobs but hey people do this without showeq.  Hey I have a ranger twink I can bring around with me if I want to hunt rares.  I just have to beat that druid nuker to it by 20 min ;).<br />
<br />
Third misconception: ShowEQ last time I looked doesnt allow you to dupe/gainxp faster than other skilled players(55+mobs in umbral huh? that /con might have helped... how would you know otherwise?)/run faster blah blah... these were things the show eq people were against because it was moving past the realm of just looking at the data sent to your computer to altering the gamestate which would give VI reason enough to pursue other matters to stop them.<br />
<br />
I doubt any showeq user has hurt your play in the past... in fact more damage is done by the people these guys are against (ie the d00d players and FD monks from racing guilds to said spawned uber mob).  Visit thier forums sometimes they have no patience for idiots.<br />
<br />
Edit: I would be afraid of VI doing mass bannings.  I know we have this new and better team in comparison to the old one but I would be very careful of what I have installed on my system when and if they try to implement something to detect a WinShowEq.</div></div><hr />

Read chapter 7, which is top to bottom about exactly this type of thing.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I assume this discussion is based on us talking about symetric keys. Asymectric keys (PGP) are even easier to crack (not, brute force, but using factoring). And if what people above are saying is true, a 64-bit PGP type key is not a good scenario for security. The same book states that a 56-bit symetric key is roughly equivelent in resistance to a 384-bit asymetric key. If a 56-bit symetric key would take &quot;35 hours&quot; to crack back in 1995, I would be more than a little worried that a 64-bit asymetric key might be cracked on-the-fly.<br />

Showeq shows the level of the mob.<br />
<br />
To me at 60 the level 53,54,55,56,57 mobs were indistinguishable until I pulled them.<br />
<br />
To a showeq user, the 55, 56 and 57 mobs are shown as such.  The SEQ user can skip the lower ones.<br />
<br />
The ability to have instant zonewide tracking all the time without needing to 2-box *IS CHEATING*.<br />
<br />
The ability to see a mobs level explicitly rather than as a range would be really handy, but *IT IS CHEATING*.<br />
<br />
I don't see how anyone can argue the other side of this ... SEQ gives you the ability to cheat.  Even if you don't use the information in an aggressive or abusive manner, it is STILL cheating.  I sort of doubt the innocent intentions of the people using this utility.<br />

After Luclin it only decoded the zones 80% of the time and sometimes left a lot of unlabled mobs.

also, if verant puts something in the EULA saying &quot;Hey we're going to scan your memory&quot;, that would make it legal for them to do it every time we clicked on agree. I didn't use SEQ but if Sony gets to the point of scanning memory, I'm done. That is a little too far to go just to stop people from what most people call 'cheating'. Go read up on what SEQ actually did, unless you were willing to spend the time to get it working right, it really didn't add much to the game except what was mentioned before.

Put edittable maps in with a radar showing your location.  It's not like the feature isn't a builtin part of several competing products already.

SEQ makes travelling so much easier, not to dodge mobs, but just so you don't have to spend 10 minutes spamming /loc trying to find the zone.  That's not my idea of fun.  There's been plenty of people who use SEQ in just that way without libeq.a decoding anything, just as a pure map.  <br />

How do calendars prevent SEQ from being usefull? Besides maybe the fact that planes never got a chance for full spawn unless the server went down or you managed to talk the GM into repoping it for ya.

Aye, and that's what changed...  Now that the packet is compressed before encryption, they can't glean any information from it, so brute force is required.<br />
<br />
While it's true that there are varying complexities, my hypothetical situation above assumes 1 cpu cycle per attempt on a 3GHz machine, and it still comes out 194 years.  Even the most trivial encryption in the world would be well above one cpu cycle per attempt to crack.  Basically, unless there's something goofy with the compression they're using, where it's still possible to know something about the packets before they're decrypted, brute force is likely the only option for SEQ as it exists today, and sadly, it's not really much of an option.</div></div><hr />

So, people in AC1 (plugins are there too I think) were writing plugins that would show you in-game.. what loot was dropping, where creatures were, etc (where they were wasn't that big a deal since AC hosts a compass that shows creatures anyway).<br />
<br />
Turbine didn't like that, so in AC2, the loot for a creature is calculated AFTER it dies, and BEFORE you loot.. so hacks like that won't work. But you can get nice things like Winamp plugins (i mean a full interface, not just punching CTRL+LEFT ARROW).<br />

As far as ShowEQ is concerned, I liken it to being much like &quot;exploits&quot;. It's just another flaw in Sony's software, and they love to blame the customer for it, instead of fixing it.

That's pretty shortsighted. Late June, Ssra was crashing repeatedly on many servers. ShowEQ can see what weapons mobs wield so until HP popped with a Bloodbath Sssra kept crashing. <br />
<br />
Hypothetical situation. 2 guilds know HP/XTC up. Both want one of it. One has ShowEQ and sees that XTC has a Glowing Mithril Ulak and/or Hategiver and HP wields nothing. What do you think is going to be the target for the guild that has ShowEQ?<br />
<br />
Do you have to walk up close to Arena to track if Statue is up? No, just log in a twink parked at EW zoneline and use ShowEQ to track. Tracking has a range.<br />
<br />
How about the wakeup call when Lodizal/Stormfeather popped? You just put a FD monk/necro/sk twink there and go watch TV. Or walk into ST (pre-revamp) and see if golems wield anything good. If yeah, send in the crew to kill it, if not, well don't waste time.</div></div><hr />

It is easy to say to VI &quot;this just LOOKS odd&quot; just to have them say &quot;working as intended&quot; while saying &quot;Look, the modifier is 1.7, not 1.2&quot; puts them in a corner.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I don't think this move was made to keep &quot;cheaters&quot; from using SEQ, more like hiding the internal issues with EQ so that they cannot be called on the carpet with hard evidence (i.e. the new slow quasi-nerf).<br />
<br />
The SEQ community is small and I am sure that for every spawn a SEQ user beat me to there are 20 rangers/druids that did the same thing.<br />

And people were using ShowEQ, threats of banning or not. Now, verant has made it so that to be able to use it, you have to have showeq on the same machine as EQ. This means a windows version will be required to use it. And, since everyone is using windows to run EQ, and can use EQWindows, this means that Verant's ill placed shot at stopping ShowEQ has in fact just guaranteed that they will have the number of people using it shoot up probably to 5 times as many people or more. And the guy is right. Verant will either have to put up or shut up. They will have to either ban all of those people or they will not. If they do, they hurt themselves a lot. It will be interesteing to watch hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think if they release windows version it woudl be better. WHy u ask? Well let's see:<br />
<br />
1. Instead of JUST thet uber warrior with no track ability all of us will be able to use it. At this point it is no longer a wether one shoudl cheat issue because many do already and i think that it is unfair that soem can and soem can't since it is gonan happen ANYWAY. <br />
<br />
2. We can all see when somethign is changed i.e xp nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guys i hate to be the one to tell u this but this is very similar to what happend to napster.<br />
<br />
Ok so here is a progrm that can do something many want to do. Then it gets shut down. 3 months later there are over 10 clones that do the EXACT same thing and even BETTER. The author of the program was right when he said this cannot be avoided. Even if he fails to make a new program someone else with better programming ability will do it.<br />
<br />
It is truly sad that this cannot be prevented altogether. But since it is here and it wll continue to be here under this name of SEQ or other then might as well accept it.<br />
<br />
I would also liek to remind ppl that there are programs that do things MUCH worse than seq by readign the memory. They can make u fall for no damage EVER regardless of height. click any buff off good or bad or run at speeds that will make bards look slow. All the prog does is work with the info from the memory. Personally i find this much much worse than seq. No i dunno how to use linux although i have the cd's and no i do not cheat. But i do find it unfair when some can cheat and some cannot. Either we all play the fair way or we all cheat.<br />
<br />
IF and IF the readign of the moemory is illegal then ppl can make programs to read and translate what is in the memory.<br />
So if a warrior can use seq to track and find rare mobs like pegasus in SK then all will be able to do it which will put us all on the same level.<br />
No more showing up with a knife to a gunfight.<br />

So they're crying and screaming because they can't cheat anymore?<br />
 <br />
No sympathy. <br />
<br />
Except for the fact that about 24 hours after the changes by Verant were made people had working copies of ShowEQ working again.<br />
<br />
The 64 bit key used to encode the packets is sitting right there in the memory of your windows machine, at a known, static offset. It's not fudged or encoded in any way and takes maybe 20 lines of code to extract(code which is now publicly available).<br />
<br />
It seems odd that so many people have completely missed out why Ratt et al are so pissed off. It's not because they can't cheat anymore. It's rather that Verant have forced ShowEQ to stop being a completely passive tool and to take a more active approach to getting the keys. <br />
<br />
ShowEQ, in it's previous form, could *only* be run from and compiled under Linux. It provided a barrier of entry that largely limited how many people could use it. It was kept this way due to a mutual &quot;gentlemens&quot; agreement that no Windows version of ShowEQ would be developed as long as Verant didn't change the encrytion in any major fashion and/or cycle the encrytion method with every patch.<br />
<br />
With the change to ShowEQ that forces it to be active(as opposed to pure passive) there is absolutely no reason why they shouldn't port it to Windows. After all, if you have to run a keysniffer on the host machine you may as well run the entire program. No barrier anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Deacis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">First off, ShowEQ had nothing to do with the crashes...<br />
<br />
That was an EQW exploit, but... ;)<br />
<br />
ShowEQ in its current state, doesnt allow for checking loot, as said by someone else, it just shows the graphic model... I.e. Tunare with essence of Tunare shows up as wielding a mana stone... Since its the same model.<br />
<br />
And checking for mob spawns and rares... if you know where to look, any class with bind sight type spells, shamans included can usually do the same thing. Just takes a wee bit longer time, but take Ancient burrower... It can be checked from zoneline in the Deep, in 10 minutes by a shaman casting assidious vision through the dungeon. Take VT as an example. Leave a corpse near named you want to check, have person zone in, cast locate corpse on person, target corpse, use bind sight, see if mob is up... And that can be done in any zone, anywhere, by people of any levelover 14 or so. And isnt a violation.<br />
<br />
ShowEQ is an ok tool to use imho. With the amount of time people invest in this game, esp. in the high end game, then spending an hour and a half checking for spawns, is just about an hour too much, given that most guilds only have a 4 or 5 hour window everyday to coordinate and do their seperate things.<br />
<br />
And make no mistake, every single high end guild out there, has someone in it which use ShowEQ, might be a few ho doesnt, but the definite majority does.<br />
<br />
ShowEQ doesnt allow duping or anything of the sort. It doesnt manipulate with the game, like for instance the macro programs do. It does allow for 80 people to recieve plans fast and efficiently, and in general be able to maximise their enjoyment of the game.<br />
<br />
I am not sad that they changed it, but as the ShowEQ programmer thingie says, they ought to consider their options again.<br />
<br />
And there is nothing ShowEQ can do, that you cant already do in the game yourself...<br />
<br />
It just automates the process...<br />
<br />
to call it cheating is a bit too much. macro programs are cheating... showEQ is an app, not a cheat. And it is rarely used to cheat. I havent seen one case of it anyhoot, nor ever read about one.<br />
<br />
And no, I dont use ShowEQ, I have no idea about linux, but I do know when something works well, and makes administrating an 80 people guild a bit easier. And I cant afford having a huge pile of note paper and a copying machine to update spawn spots, copy maps and such constantly... Nor do I have the time in my day, to check 10 zones for spawns because of rotation obligations every day, spending several hours doing so... I have a job, a bunch of friends, and a belly which tends to enjoy beer and I need to have room for that as well. I play enough as it is already...<br />
<br />
And this isnt going to kill anyone, but the prospect of having a lot of lEEt people using this, is somehow like getting beat in the head with an UO hardcover box multipile times, while screaming Mag des Piot or what ever :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">First off, ShowEQ had nothing to do with the crashes... <br />
- ShowEQ had nothing to do with crashes, that is absolutely correct. However it was used to see if it's worth crashing a zone. There were a few summon corpse bugs that allowed zones to be crashed. And ShowEQ was just the motivation, the tool to see if it's worth it.<br />
<br />
And there is nothing ShowEQ can do, that you cant already do in the game yourself... <br />
- I didn't realize shamans have a zonewide track skill. My bad. Is this an AA skill?</div></div><hr />

No, SEQ could not help you with that...could tell if it had a fetish, but you can walk up to one and tell that. Loot info is not sent untill you loot the corpse itself.

Four quick points:<br />
<br />
1) You have to know what the key looks like unless you're going to just try each sequence of 8 bytes traversing by a byte offset through the memory. Which doesn't appear to be your goal in the code snippet. You make the assumption that the key is at 0x00773b90 on everyones machine?<br />
<br />
2) You don't have any way to exit your &quot;while(1)&quot; -- yuck.<br />
<br />
3) Please use [ code ] [ /code ]. notation to post code :p.<br />
<br />
4) Why the heck are you sleeping for 15 seconds? Twice - one in a tight loop and on before you return.<br />
<br />
You could have just conveyed your point in english so that the other 99% of the board would get your point :).</div></div><hr />

Outside of Sullon Zek I doubt many if any abused that bug to anything like the extent that was possible.  Being a high elf shaman is hardly going to affect much now is it? =)<br />

You'll probably find thats because the majority of us here don't want melees asking for str ontop of everything else, I draw the line at agi, and unless the tank has incredibly sucky base stats, I'm NOT doing more stat buffs after that.<br />
<br />

Looks like it's first checking for the eqgame process every 15 seconds, and once that's found, it's looking for the key to change every 15 seconds... so that way when you zone, the keyfile is automatically updated for you.<br />
You make the assumption that the key is at 0x00773b90 on everyones machine? <br />
That's because it is in that location for everyone...  That's the offset within the eqgame memory space, not an absolute one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using a real time map to keep yourself from getting killed while travelling, or lost, is hardly going to affect much now is it?<br />
<br />
Sure, you *could* use it to spot the AC a few seconds faster than you would otherwise, but you *could* have used the item slot bug to fill yourself with breastplates and double your AC, too.<br />
<br />
And even if verant does know about project alpha, people on this forum were still acting as if they didn't, and protecting it. Bumping old threads to push back any mention of it, for example.<br />
<br />
And any stacking of buffs you KNOW aren't supposed to stack at all is taking advantage of a bug, and exploiting. No matter how small the benefit, it's still cheating.<br />
<br />
If verant had half a mind, they would quit sending the location of every single monster in the zone to every single player, all the time. How hard is it to check the player's location, and just send the positions within a certain distance? Tracking could just be a list, and selecting a mob to track would send you it's position, so tracking could still be client side.<br />
<br />
Would probably save bandwidth, too. But, really, I don't think they are willing to put that much work into a product that probably isn't going to be around *that* much longer.</div></div><hr />

Ah, never used the call before. I read the API doc on it and it just states memory address, not an offset. Not what you would call a rare item for MS docs to not be clear - so I'll take your word on it.<br />
<br />
And if this is the case, that it's always located in the same position in memory, look for that to be changed very quickly - and easily. It really doesn't take much to distribute a key into a large array of randomly generated numbers and write a wrapper call in assembly to defeat the compilers tendency to group the data together for efficiency.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">Define cheat according to Sony.  It's kinda difficult, because it changes so often, and most of the rules are unwritten.  <br />
<br />
For example, using a key-pinger to raise skills was not cheating in original EQ.  Then it became cheating with a statement from Abashi, but was qualified because disabled people were using programmable joysticks to help them play.  Now it's not cheating if you're sitting at the keyboard, but is if you're afk.<br />
<br />
Read the EULA - the EULA states that you can't use 3rd party software that modifies the EQ software to change gameplay.  ShowEQ doesn't modify EQ.  EULA says nothing about bugs, either.<br />
<br />
The Terms of Service, however, mention both.  <br />
&quot;You will not attempt to interfere with, hack into, or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running EverQuest.  <br />
You will not exploit any bug in EverQuest and you will not communicate the existence of any such exploitable bug (bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended benefits in game), either directly or through public posting, to any other user of EverQuest. You will promptly report any such bug via the in-game &quot;/bug&quot; command or via the eqtesting@soe.sony.com email address.&quot;<br />
<br />
ShowEQ decifers transmissions.  We have discussed bugs on this board.  Both are against the TOS.  Looks like anyone that ever posted about a bug on any board is as bad as a ShowEQ user.<br />
<br />
Question - is Project Alpha a bug or feature?  Without it being submitted to Sony and getting a confirmation one way or another - we're exploiting by using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u132"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p132">He downplays one thing: ShowEQ on Linux is 100% undetectable from a technology standpoint, you have to detect it's probable use by observing someone's behavior. ShowEQ on Windows will be 100% detectable by Verant, if they decide to reverse their previous pledge not to scan your machine or memory.<br />
<br />
There's just one problem that Sony has to deal with there, the information privacy act!  It is completely illegal for them to obtain any information from your computer without your express permission to do so.  They would have to either modify their EULA to allow them to access whatever information they wanted on your machine (any idiot that pressed agree should be shot dragged and beaten at that point) or Sony would be facing HUGE lawsuits and long prison sentences.<br />
<br />
*edit: I don't use ShowEQ and I'm not an advocate of any sort of cheating software, in my opinion they ruin gameplay for everyone not just those using the software.  The reason this issue inflames me is the fact that it means Sony WILL probably be modifying their EULA to allow them to scan your computer for whatever info they want and that is 100% unacceptable to me, I would quit EQ if that were the case, they have no business knowing whats on my computer*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which means, in order to keep the status quo, we'll all have to start cheating... or leave the game.<br />

Any rational showeq player would never bline towards rares heh... it would be a tell-tale sign of usage.  They wont reconsider as they know they can they just have to do it now.  It might be at the expense of a few other peoples accounts but they will figure out a way to make it undetectable and passive again and this time it might cause a Windows port.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately Verant have opened the proverbial Pandora's box. There is no way they can shut this down anymore.<br />
<br />
My position on ShowEQ is pretty neutral. While it's definately cheating and very much against the ToS/EULA, I think it's impact on gameplay has been minimal, in a negative sense, and it has had some benefits(pets don't take exp, hybrid penalties, et al).<br />
<br />
To be honest, making ShowEQ available on Windows doesn't bother me, however I do think it was shortsighted of Verant to make this change. They have declared all out war on ShowEQ and it's a war that they cannot win. At least while ShowEQ was restricted to the Linux platform that had an iota of control over it.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand how you think I'm being narrow-minded. I said above that it would have to be a local app (or a remote debugging session), but that it would do what you say: snoop the data out of memory. Just not the stream encryption key if they do a good job of hiding it - it's not practical to hide all data in the manner I described. <br />
<br />
The key is used by Everquests own exe, in code. All that code is in memory. It is very easy to spot a decryption routine, all you do is put a hook around that function and you have the key again :/<br />
<br />
As I said, they are never gonna stop people getting to this information as it's impossible to do. The best solution is to make sure less information is available on the client machine</div></div><hr />

You were breaking the law and you know it.  It doesn't matter if you were breaking it a little or a lot.  Breaking the law is breaking the law (and yes, even going against a legal contract which is what you agree to each time you sign on is breaking the law).<br />

I'll never understand attitudes like this.  I don't have anything to hide either, but do I want sony to potentially have access to any personal or work-related documents I've had open before EQ was launched?  F*ck no.  It's not like closing the program instantly removes that stuff from memory.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a SEQ user either and I'd love to see them all banned myself.  Hoever I'm a contract programmer and I am under NDA frequently, information on my machine IS private and for me to expose that to Sony would violate my NDA!  I would have to buy a second comp just because some jack@ss decides to use SEQ!  That in my opinion is completely unacceptable.

Well, unless you reboot every time before playing EQ, anything you've had open during that computing session is still most likely sitting around in memory in some form.  Perhaps you don't have a job or any financial information or personal matters on your computer that you wouldn't mind the whole world seeing, but some of us do.<br />
<br />
And if they start scanning memory, they might as well start scanning your HD too, I guess...  Perhaps sending in a sony rep to rummage through your house as well.<br />
<br />
I'd prefer not to quit, because I do like the game, but if Sony starts scanning my computer, that'll be the end of EQ for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">Uh, you can tweak XP to actually remove everything from memory after closing out a program.  Not that difficult.</div></div><hr />

As far as stealing info/money/findingj00rpr0n. Large corporations have a lot more trouble getting away with that kind of thing since John Q Public tends to get very large punative damages (which lawyers foam at the mouth for) for having their rights violated by big, cash rich corporations.<br />

Don't assume that I &quot;have no life&quot; as compared to you... You leave sensitive documents open on your pc while playing an online game? That's pretty stupid if you do, imho. In fact, if you were smart, while working on sensitive data, unless you have to transmit it, the only safe computer is one that is NOT connected to the internet, period, so you should disconnect entirely from the 'net. If it's THAT sensitive, you should not be connected while working on it. Anything connected to the net is inherently insecure, as SOMEONE will find a way to it, if it's important enough to them. Period.<br />
<br />
I have a life outside of EQ too. And yes, I reboot every time, before and after, I play EQ...for one simple reason. Sure, I have 1gb of memory, but EQ is a memory hog...so are other apps on my system. EQ also leaves ended processes in memory instead of dumping them. So I reboot. I like having as much cpu processes and memory addresses as free as possible. I do graphics work from home. I love the extra ram that doing a 30 second reboot affords.<br />
<br />
Also, as was stated, they were talking about MEMORY checks to ensure that you are not running an ILLEGAL program, not scanning your hdd... I've signed multiple NDA's myself for my work. Guess what? When I go into an online game, I do what I can to ensure that the proprietary property I'm working with is safe. Yes, surprisingly, even safe enough that they COULD do a hdd scan and come up clean.<br />
<br />
I just disconnect the drive that has sensitive materials... I'm a parzanoid at heart. I run a firewall. I'm a paranoid at heart. One of these days, I'm just gonna install a hotswap drive bay and have, basically, 2 separate computers.<br />
<br />

Few points.  Despite what anyone's 'opinion' or 'viewpoint' may be, the word &quot;cheating&quot; has a specific and objective meaning.  SEQ is cheating, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
Neither Sony nor Verant is going to be scanning anyone's computers.  Unlikely to the point of absurdity.<br />
<br />
If a Windows version of SEQ comes out there won't be a sudden horde of cheaters.  Redhat Linux and SEQ are trivial to install and use.  If a horde of potential cheaters exists, their numbers won't swell much from a Windows version.<br />
<br />
Corollary to that, being a Linux user doesn't make you big, bad, and special.  It's just another OS.  Linux geeks are simply vain.  <br />
<br />
The idea that Linux makes SEQ the province of a responsible elite, and that a Windows version unleashes the heathen unwashed has me rolling on the floor laughing my arse off!  Oh please, get a grip.<br />

As someone who does tech support for a living i have to disagree with you on some of what you said. While redhat maybe be relatively easy to install it's still beyond that of most computer users IMO and probably beyond that of most players of eq.<br />
<br />
Second for the uninformed linux = complicated to the point where they may not even look into it further to see if they might actually be able to do it. Don't over estimate the fud factor. After all ms spends billions every year to convince people that ms windows is the best os out there.<br />
<br />
Third the hardware barrier is a big one. I know lots of people who play who don't have extra systems to threw seq on but could easily run eqw and seq on the same box. I would say actually having 2 boxes setup would be the more convinent way to use it but alot less people able to do it.<br />
<br />
While I'm sure there where people who used and badly abused seq i also know that it being linux only on another box does add a barrier for alot of people which is a good thing.<br />
<br />
I will agree that in the past i have found alot of linux users to be rather vain and not very helpful alot of times but i can understand the reaction. Lots of people asking the same question over and over again definitely gets old and you start to wonder why people can't find what's right in front of thier face.

FYI illegal searches and seizures only apply to GOVERNMENT. Although the actions of a private citizen or organization may constitute a violation of criminal or civil law, the 4th Amendment protection to which you are presumably referring does not apply to them.<br />
<br />
Don't even get me started on the &quot;Information Privacy Act&quot; that someone mentioned earlier.  We don't have such an act in the U.S.  If you are referring to the &quot;Consumer Internet Privacy Protection Act of 1999,&quot; the bill has yet to make it out of the House of Representatives, and doesn't even come CLOSE to prohibiting Verant from scanning your memory.<br />
