<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was brought up on another thread, and I thought it might be a good topic of discussion, to see how others orginize their hot-key banks, etc, maybe we can get some tips from how others use theirs.<br />
<br />
Here is mine:<br />
Bank 1<br />
1. VP, no message, just the hot-key<br />
2. Trushar cast macro w/message<br />
3. Canni 5 cast macro w/message (soon to be gone, Canni 5 just doesnt make a big dent in my hps anymore, so I dont need to warn people too much. Moving this to bank 2)<br />
4. Fast heal cast macro w/message (mostly for raids only)<br />
5. Ancestral Aid (used to be slam, but I find I dont slam much anymore)<br />
6. Stand/sit<br />
7. Working spell set-macro, /mem 1 (I have a spell set named &quot;a&quot;. Each event or group, I decide what my &quot;base&quot; set will be, mem it, and save it as &quot;a&quot;. Keeps me from having to swap back to the spell-set bank all the time, and &quot;a&quot; insures it will always be spellset 1)<br />
8. /assist. Just plain assist, so I can assist-heal, although thats not as necessary with HoTT anymore. With the addition of HoTT, I usually edit this now to /assist XXXX (whoever I want to assist, MA, or off-tank if I am his slower). I have also found this invaluable when grouping. It seems a TON of the OoW models are a total PITA to loot. So I hit F1, F1 (targets pet), 8 (assist pet, targets the corpse), and type /loot. I may macro this soon. It saves a lot of lame click-click-move-click crap. <br />
9. Canni 5 hotkey. So I can see it pop, and I can just use without the macro if needed. <br />
10. Slow message. Once I got Nihil, I stuck the cast right into it, since it almost ALWAYS lands first cast now. If I have any trouble at all, I malos inc, then hit this key.<br />
Bank 2<br />
1. SOW boots<br />
2. Shrink orb<br />
3. mem FoS spell-set (changes one spell to FoS)<br />
4-10. Utility pet, Summon Drogmar, AA and Leader hot keys, like HoTT, Spirit call, pet Attack, Slam (can get there easy if a healer is a problem) etc.<br />
Bank 3<br />
Spell set mem hotkeys, /corpsedrag, <br />
Bank 4<br />
/assist keys pre-set for most of the guilds tanks and off-tanks<br />
Bank 5<br />
/tar keys pre-set for most of the guilds tanks and off-tanks, couple chanters.<br />
<br />
I use the Keypad for 90% of my spell casting. Its VERY annoying that the new spell slot is not assigned to 9 on the keypad, but I will admit I have not checked my settings, I should do that. I used to use more macros for re-peating functions like Canni 4, /stand - /cast slow- /sit, etc, but I stopped and most of these now ocupy banks 6-10 somewhere. <br />
<br />
Thats about it. How do you set yours up? It should be noted that I do not use a UI that has my inventory in a small window for clickies. If I need a clicky, I drag the slot over and move stuff some. Only 2 real clickies I use are SOW and Shrink anyway.</div></div><hr />

5: dmg spells<br />
6: FA (cast it on all who need, then switch out for dmg)<br />
10: dmg spells<br />
(have to use alt 9 for 9th spell gem, but this is usualy either gate or dmg depending)<br />
<br />
Group: (when malos is needed)<br />
5: malos<br />
6: FA (make rounds and switch for dmg)<br />
10: dmg spells<br />

6: %t is slowed in debuff chan<br />
7: canni<br />
8: %t is NOT SLOWED in debuff chan<br />

Page 9: MGB, RC, SC, ASC, HoTT, DeleMA, TargetNPC (ick), and any other triggerable abilities; I only page here to click, then page back to 1 or 2.<br />
<br />
- sounds kind of unimaginative when I look at it that way... but it's got a short learning curve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">TIt seems a TON of the OoW models are a total PITA to loot. So I hit F1, F1 (targets pet), 8 (assist pet, targets the corpse), and type /loot. I may macro this soon. It saves a lot of lame click-click-move-click crap.<br />
Just found out a new trick today for looting mobs in walls and corpses that are hard to find the &quot;click spot&quot;. Its pretty simple really:<br />
<br />
/tar a (since 95% of all basic XP mobs are named a_XXXXX_ZZZZZZZZ)<br />
/loot<br />
<br />
heh, works like a charm. Some of these OoW models are a HUGE pain. Might have to squeeze this into my first bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Couple of things:<br />
<br />
1. Blazz: try <br />
/tar a<br />
/loot<br />
/hidecorpse looted <br />
for your hotkey.<br />
<br />
2. As requested in PM, here are instructions for making a clicky hotkey:<br />
<br />
A. Open inventory to show the slot containing the item to be hotkeyed, and have a hotkey with a blank slot (or one to be replaced).<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://samanna.net/1pix/clicky1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;<br />
<br />
B. Left-click-and-hold until a copy of the item (not the original item) attaches to your cursor.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://samanna.net/1pix/clicky2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;<br />
<br />
C. Left-click to drop the copy onto your hotkey.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://samanna.net/1pix/clicky3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;</div></div><hr />
