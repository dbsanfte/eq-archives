 Rant on<br />
You bet eq has stolen many of WoW ideas. Only reason some people don't know it is because Blizzard has a good habbit of NOT releasing things until they are ready. So SoE throws them together after stealing them from WoW, bugs EQ more and tries to make people believe they came up with it.  BE GONE EQ.<br />
<br />
Once Verant stepped out from the game it fell flat on its face. It is about time someone like Blizzard who cares enough about gamers stepped up to the plate and did us right for our time and MONEY!<br />

Being unhappy in EQ will likely carry over into WoW eventually, since in most cases, you're probably playing a class that isn't everything you want it to be or your vision of the class doesn't coincide with what the developers envisioned.  If you want, just take all the complaint threads for EQ, replace all occurrences of &quot;EQ&quot; and &quot;Everquest&quot; with &quot;WoW&quot; and replace all the devs' character names with the WoW devs' character names and save yourselves the time of retyping the whiny posts. ;)  You have to learn to take the bad with the good.</div></div><hr />

Ok anyway, my peace is said, i dont wanna be like &quot; na na na, WoW is better then EQ, you all suck cause you still like EQ&quot; so ill shut up here, cause thats not my intention in this thread. Ill save that sentiment for the WoW forum here ;)<br />

I doubt this will happen.<br />
<br />
You see, WoW has less classes so the balancing is a lot easier.<br />
Combine this with Dev's who do have a clue (instead of the SoE crew) and the fact that ALL classes are able to solo and you will have a lot less issues then in EQ.</div></div><hr />

Give em a couple years.  After the business is going well, and they start to feel comfortable with A) how many customers they have and B) how much time you've invested being a big detraction to you leaving....<br />
<br />
then they'll be like any other mmorpg team.<br />
<br />
You remember how long bnet performed horribly?  Or how many game hacks game came out in diablo?  Blizzard isn't perfect. They just appear better now because they want a good customer base.<br />
<br />
SOE moves slower because all its customers are entrenched in the game, the games making money still, and they don't want to ever rock the boat too hard.  Slight changes over time is all you'll ever see from SOE.  Of course, there are always huge nerfs like Bards and Enchanters are getting, but they let them run for year(s), analyze ever angle, blah blah, and then make a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">citing *any* of that junk from b.net or diablo is not comparable to WoW.  they provided FREE online support and services for those.  you get what you pay for.  it simply does not relate to a monthly subscription MMORPG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Poor jzak.  You really do believe that people just suddenly *became* unhappy with EQ.  That a little light bulb flicked in their heads and they arbitrarily decided to hate it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has already stated that they plan to keep their concept of &quot;raid&quot; to a low number - I can't remember specifically - 2 dozen?  And at least as far as I'm concerned, the fact that the majority of EQ content started to consist of nothing that you could do with less than 50 players (15-20 of whom are clerics!) was really what killed it for me.<br />
<br />
I had a lot of fun in EQ, and I'm glad some people still are.  But it gives me a little giggle to see people post that Blizzard will do exactly what SoE did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>xanier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Laughing<br />
<br />
Blizzard, as you have stated, did say they are keeping raid content to a lower number but you left out one very important thing they said they are trying to do and something SoE has never been too concerned about doing and that is making each class valuable at all times to the raid. Where with EQ you need goodness 70plus these days, people get lost and feel as though they play an umimportant role. Blizzard is striving to keep everyone feel as though they are important to the process of raids.  <br />
<br />
Just what I saw from what I have read<br />
<br />
xan out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">eq 2 is keeping raid small too with abiut 24 i belive.<br />
<br />
as for wow becoming a whine feast like eq? i doubt that too for 2 reasons, 1 most poeple working at blizzard will likely still be working there in 5 years (unlike eq which has next to none) 2, as said blizzard listen to customers, they put out patches to fix bugs, and generally improved on games as they went along. More importantly they usually explain with some detail why something was done or why it wasnt, rather than &quot;we are looking at it&quot; or &quot;what you been asking this for 6 months? oh well still dont know&quot; attitude SOE has.<br />
<br />
as for hacks , well its alot easier to hack games that have most the info needed on your computer (or your own server ) than on one that is run by the company itself (or actively police) and as said the support was free before (which meant just making sure they worked not policed), i sure blizzard will change for paying support. <br />
<br />
also the lack of content is a silly idea anyway, if wow is as popular as it seems it will be poeple will reach the &quot;end&quot; but like eq , they bring out expansion to add to its life span as eq did before it. do you not remember when eq had hardly any quest? only 2 continents? level 50? etc etc<br />
<br />
CoH already has its expansion being done, i sure it will continue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Amen, xanier.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, I have to agree with the initial poster here.  Blizzard has shown two things in their long and storied history.  #1 is that they put out a quality product with fewer bugs than anyone.  #2 is that they will continue to try to improve the game after it is released and not offend their customers.<br />
<br />
Although I like EQ, I have high expectations for WOW and will jump ship as soon as it is evident that it is working well.  For those peeps who can do both my hat is off to them, it's hard enough to find time for one game.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Make no mistakes, WoW will probably, by comparison to EQ, be an &quot;easier&quot; game.  Is that a bad thing?  For many definitely not.  Frankly I'm tired of the ENORMOUS time sink that EQ requires for progression.  From my time in the WoW stress test I clearly saw that this is a game that I can play, have fun, and progress without the *gross* time commitments required by EQ.<br />
<br />
I've also been sick of the gross zergfest so much EQ raid content requires for some time.  Screw raiding with 70 people, where 20-30 are afk slacking or effing off anyway half the time...  EQ raiding has generally been at it's best with lower numbers imo.  WoW raids running with lower #s is very appealing to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Man, you WoW fanbois really are in a pipe dream.<br />
So that makes all of you EQ Fanbois what? Masochist's? :)<br />
<br />
Hey, I LOVED EQ for many years. It helped me get through a really dark period in my life right after my father passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. I developed an emotional attachment to the game based on deeper psychological reasons than just &quot;it's a game I like to play&quot;.<br />
<br />
I also echo LaughingWoman's sentiments in that I hope those of you who are still having fun with EQ continue to do so. To each his own. If you ever find yourself growing weary of the grind in EQ, there's always a spot for ya on my server and/or in my guild. Come on over! Love to have ya! The door will always be open.<br />
<br />
WoW just fits my playstyle better than EQ. A lot of people will find the same thing. For many years we played EQ because there just simply weren't any other choices out there (that compared to the depth of EQ). Now there will be.<br />
<br />
Yeh, we've all seen the &quot;this game will be the death of EQ&quot; posts/claims for just about every fantasy MMO that's been released since EQ came out. I never believed it back then, but after playing the stress test and following WoW's development for the past three years, I'm afraid my beliefs have changed. While I don't think it will literally &quot;kill&quot; EQ (UO is still alive and kicking after all, and EQ is FAAAR better than UO :)), it will most definitely take the largest bite out of SOE's profits of any game released to date.<br />
<br />
Why? Because in many ways it's very similar to EQ, only with many of the bugs and/or player concerns and issues fixed. It's much more friendly, the environments are far more elaborate and immersive than anything I've ever experienced in EQ, and Blizzard has maintained since day one that everyone will be able to solo when they want and not be forced into one 'blindered' &quot;Vision(TM)&quot; of how the game should be played.<br />
<br />
Options. Always a good thing!<br />
<br />
For the record, I've tried numerous MMORPG's since EQ. AO, DAoC, AC1, Horizons, CoH. Honestly, none of them were able to elicit that feeling of awe and majesty that EQ did during the first several months I played. Guess what? WoW did! That feeling is definitely influencing my opinion of the game. It brought back that 'magic' I felt when I first started playing EQ where all others failed to. Believe it or not, EQ is the measuring stick by which I judge all other games. EQ was (and is) far better than any of those other games I listed, except for WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">After years of playing most of the players will know what they want out of a game, some will prefer EQ for its hack and slash grinding (tho  they will also use the quest system in EQ 2) other people just want to play Wow for the diversity its classes has. (or other reasons)<br />
<br />
To each his own and the only thing you can do is try both and make a choice.  Some have done this and voice their opinions but don't critisize them for it.  Instead try it and then you can come here to defend EQ with arguments and then the Wow fans can call you an EQ fanboy :p (or have a decent discussion with pro's and con's)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I can hardly blame those who come to the WoW threads to call us fanboys and tools.  When they read posts about how miserable and wrecked we feel EQ to be, they probably get the same rage that I feel when someone says something derogatory about WoW.  This game is so well done, I can't *believe* that someone could find anything significantly negative to say about it.<br />
<br />
But Valgoth is 100% right.  The FEELING is back.  When I first got it, it was because my man had *finally* convinced me to pick up EQ - and since Kunark was just about to come out, I never ran out of content (till PoP).  Now I've had 10 days of WoW and yes... I probably DO sound like some kind of slavering lunatic.  *grin*  Imagine if someone had pulled the plug on EQ for you after your first 10 days....</div></div><hr />
