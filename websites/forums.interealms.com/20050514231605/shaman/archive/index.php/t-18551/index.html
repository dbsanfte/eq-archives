<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if anyone ever throws out thumbs ups or downs on posts? I know I do especially if it is really good or if it is really bad. Maybe it's the hope that if I dole it out then karma will bring it back to me and then I can become as famous as Gloriana. That is the only thing that keeps me going through the day. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have never really bothered to check what my rep is.  I do make use of the reputation feature though.  Trolls (the bad message board type, not the green guys) and spammers get negative reputation.  Posts that I find helpfull or informative get good marks from me.  <br />
<br />
The reputation feature was activated here about 6 months ago because there were questions as to why it wasnt working.  And as to being as popular as Glorianna, good luck.  Shes got red hair and big...umm...eyes, and you are a lizard.  Remember, reputation is 50% appearance (or at least how others percieve you to appear)...</div></div><hr />

Really doesn't matter to me.  I know my opinions on things will not be liked by some.  I'm not the type to worry about having everyone like me.  I just say what I feel and try to be as honest as possible.  If some one does like my opinion I'm not going to worry about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.  From my years of experience following internet boards there are a handful of ways to become one of the regulars that everyone knows on a board.  Surprisingly posting a lot is among the least effective ways, but still helps.<br />
<br />
-Have a personal icon that is easily recognized and stick with it.  Preferably an attractive woman.<br />
<br />
-Have a female name. <br />
<br />
-Be a female or play one convincingly<br />
<br />
-Be everyone's friend.  Compliment people a lot.<br />
<br />
Alternative approach:<br />
<br />
-Be an arrogant loudmouth or dumbass.  Talk about how good you are.  Insult people either blatantly and stupidly (dumbass) or subtlely (arrogant intellectual).<br />
<br />
-Still need that personal icon<br />
<br />
Those are the two MOST effective ways to make a name for yourself on an internet community.  Note that both of them are stereotypes people don't really take seriously, but allow them to feel good about themselves.<br />
<br />
I've never been popular on an internet community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If someone makes a good point or makes me laugh I'll add to it.  Likewise, if someone behaves like an ass, then I subtract from it.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't really care about my own reputation.  Never have in real life, why bother online?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Do you start with 30 reputation points ?<br />
<br />
The problem with reputation is always how you present your points. I do think that some people dislike my way of posting or express opinions on this board and thus my points don't go through(not rep points) as I'd like. <br />
Your points can be very valid and your posts very informative, but if people dislike you(or your attitude) the point often will not go through, let alone accepted.<br />
<br />
You definitely start building your own opinion on each poster on this board(I know I have), but whenever I read a post I try to look at the content and I make use of the feature in rare cases(only to add reputation points though, never to subtract).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My entire sense of self-worth is entirely based on my two green squares.  I think I was almost at three green squares once, but I had to go and flame some jackass.  I need an eye-catching, brandable avatar to get the holy third green square I guess =/<br />
<br />
As for others,  I pretty much take the same approach as Klemydia does.  Though there is always ignore.  I have only ever put one person on ignore for a long while.  The place has been 100% more enjoyable seeing &quot;This person is on your Ignore List&quot; instead of his clueless spam all the time!<br />
<br />
It would be interesting to see how many people had each poster on ignore.  That would probably do better than negative feedback at showing new people which posts to take with a few grains of salt.</div></div><hr />

I've posted many times, mostly queries, sometimes helping, other times chiding the intolerable fools I stumble accross.<br />
<br />
Check out my rep, it was static for about 3 years then some intolerable fool received a short sharp educational from my keyboard and wiped out my rep in a couple of seconds.<br />
<br />
Not that I really care but it does concern me that status can be bestwoed upon a person using such a fickle system.<br />
<br />
If I was so inclined and had the time/inclination) I could screw up every rep on the board, of course I would never do this, I'm Grey.</div></div><hr />

Glad to see all the people I look up to on this thread. I kind of like reputation. I like seeing where people think I am giving good info or if they think I am just talking out my butt.<br />
<br />
I might not care about what people think of me IRL, but I care here! /smooch butt lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Lol ok, read about it and found out its that yellow talking head I never even noticed before. As to the green things, that seems to basically just increase the more posts you do, so how a degree of quality is judged from it is particulary odd.<br />
<br />
So in answer to the question<br />
Reputation does anyone really care?<br />
&quot;no&quot; =p Although I going to check my other posts now out of curiousity now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Speaking of avatars and such, what ever happened to that custon sig that Glorianna had?  The red braids and green eyes on a yellow background was really eye catching.  I miss it sometimes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I bump rep points for hard data like parse studies.<br />
<br />
And dont knock Gloriana.  I can remember well her inspiring stories of an uber 60 shaman dispensing the uber spell torpor on raids, which motivated me to keep going as a shaman in this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I agree with Barbacus.  I have played since '99 and I guess it says I've been a member since Jan 2000. I don't always have something important to say so I havent posted as many times as others that have been on this board for 1/5 the time as me.<br />
<br />
I made ONE post on an Idea I had on something I wanted to see come from EQ AA progression and in 4 hours I got 5 people that lowered me :)<br />
<br />
What is the funniest part about this?  It was just a fluke opinion and then others agreed with me and didnt get slammed for agreeing with me :)<br />
<br />
Ah well it's a game but I do think that people give WAY too much credibility to some people because they have a big number of posts. That automatically makes you smarter and worth more than someone that doesnt want to keep spamming the same topic into the ground.<br />
<br />
*UH OH I feel a negative point coming to me! :) *</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Hey all,<br />
<br />
I've been offline all weekend, SO and I are finally painting over the godawful mural of Hawaii left on the walls of our home office by the previous owners. They weren't content to merely paint the sand brown, oh no, they actually had to texture it like sand. Hello, first purchase of a hand sander.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, about the rep system:<br />
<br />
When the reputation system was first implemented, Mojokyn (I think) artifically inflated the reps of all the mods. Alas, I am not a natural &quot;Glorious Beacon of Light.&quot;  If it bothers anyone, I'm happy to set it to its true level, I just kinda liked the designation &quot;Glorious Beacon of Light.&quot;  (in fact, I have received enough reputation to move up to a new rating, but I keep setting it down to remain at this level)<br />
<br />
I try not to use the rep system as a popularity contest, I try to only bump posts which I feel add to the community. <br />
<br />
Maybe we should start a poll. If enough people dislike the rep system, we can remove it.<br />
<br />
Thorizon I requested a new sig pic from the artist that created my first signature about a year ago. I felt my character had grown and wanted a new picture to reflect that. I still use my old picture (which I adore) on my Magelo (click on name in signature to see)<br />
<br />
Giac I believe you start with 10 reputation points.<br />
<br />
Happy holidays everyone!</div></div><hr />

I've gotten negative reputation points on helpful or non-flame posts too.  Like this (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?postid=192966#post192966) and this (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?postid=184053#post184053).  The second had the interesting comment of &quot;I came, golden manbabies to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I find it interesting that posters like Landragoran, Uggok, and myself have two green bubbles when we're often very...well, like Land said, &quot;always right, often helpful, and usually arrogant and abrasive.&quot;  Perhaps it's the flamboyance of the offensiveness that attracts people to the little face button?<br />
<br />
I usually just neg rep people who are natural jackasses, like spam posters, people who flame others who are trying to be helpful, etc.  I pos rep entertaining posts (like a really good, deserved flame), especially informing posts, etc.<br />
<br />
I usually leave a comment with the positive ones, citing why I repped them, and my name.  I don't leave much on the neg rep ones, other than seething hatred.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Oh, I did want to confirm, a &quot;grey&quot; reputation bump is from an individual who doesn't have enough personal reputation to affect your reputation, positively or negatively.<br />

This is to protect posters from individuals who might create accounts to bump someone down (or to protect us from those that would create accounts to positively bump their own account).<br />
<br />
I don't know the required reputation to actually start giving green or red bumps, but I can find out.<br />

<br />
what someone else has said about a poster in the past is no indication of the current poster's thoughts; line of reasoning; or logic.  it does not take into account disparities between server economies or things like the amount of euros that rotate the boss mobs.<br />
<br />
it is like calling someone a n00b, just because he has a low post count.  logically it makes little sense.</div></div><hr />
