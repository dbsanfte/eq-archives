<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i have heard many of friends, groupmates, and just plain ranters talking about having to hold keys in their extra backpack space. although i havent had firsthand experience with this, i have had an idea that i am thinking may help alot at higher levels...<br />
<br />
Here it goes...<br />
you know how at merchants you scroll down and up to see their inventory? i was thinking maybe next to your ammo slot in your equipment screen you had maybe a key pouch like that.  <br />
<br />
i know maybe someone else has prolly thought of similar if not identical ideas... but i just thought hey what the heck, maybe my idea will be brought up as a worthy topic of discussion<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think that's a great idea.  I hate having keys take up inventory space, and I only have the 3 basic ones. :)<br />
<br />
VI helped things out a bit with getting rid of the keys for the Velious rings, but that's only one key.<br />
<br />
Maybe send a copy of this off to the EQ boards too.  Ya never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">top left corner next to your earring slot is an empty space for an item.  a key ring/pouch would be perfect there.</div></div><hr />

A keyring is long overdue IMHO. At least they made the Velios tooths obsolete.<br />
