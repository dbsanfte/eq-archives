<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The guy at the bar is Crow.  This is his place -- yeah a real dive but about as good as it gets in Qeynos.  I appreciate you meeting me here.  This is a little awkward, but would you be mind covering the drinks?  I'm running a bit of a tab and they cut me off.  No, let's sit over here ... where we can see the door.  <br />
<br />
Look, I know my dues haven't been pefectly on time.  That's what I wanted to talk about.  Yeah, not like it's a lot of cash each month but things have been slow for me.  My trade is going through a recession.  There just isn't the demand and people don't care about quality anymore.  All they want is damage and they want it fast.  These beastlord kids -- they toss a cheap slow and wack, wack, wack. Done.  It's all about how fast they can crank it.<br />
<br />
What's that?  Mister, I'm 65.  That's too old to go back and learn a new skill. Besides, it's not like the old days when you could buy a set of tools and have at it.  Now, you have to have character flags and class titles out the wazoo before the guilds will even look at you.  <br />
<br />
In my day, things were different.  If you needed some good work, like those dungeons that took hours to crawl down, then you wanted a shaman.  The kind of work where screwups were expensive.  If you need something specific and were light on friends, then you definately wanted one of those friends to be me.  It was pretty lucrative.<br />
<br />
Today, it's all 'drag it to the wall and smack it'.  Hell, most of them are watching TV while they're at it.  Holy Tribunal!  Can you imagine that?  Watching TV!  Something seriously wrong there.  <br />
<br />
Take this new mitigation dealie for instance.  For years, I've advertised a 75% reduction.  That's how I did business --  but now do I get a 75% reduction?  No.  I get *mystery* reduction.  My clients aren't real keen on hiring me for *mystery* reduction.  How the grobb do I invoice that?  And, like salt on somethin' you don't want salt on, I'm still taxed based on a 75% reduction.  Now, I put to you is that even remotely fair?  Holy cats it isn't.  <br />
<br />
So, I need some favors -- strings pulled.   I don't know ... something ... anything.  Seriously, at this point I wouldn't care if they put me at a 50 or 60% reduction if it would let them repeal all this mitigation crap.  Give me 10 points on the chanters and 20 points of the beastlords and I can keep afloat.<br />
<br />
If things don't pick up, I'm not going to be able to make those payments and then I gotta skip town.  I'm hearing there just might be a job market for shaman someplace called Azeroth.  <br />
<br />
Really, I appreciate anything you can do and thanks for the beer.  Oh and don't skimp on the tip, eh.</div></div><hr />
