<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a dilemma, well its a good dilemma to have really =)<br />
<br />
I'm a level 40 shaman and have maxed out my defense, I'm usually soloing and am getting itchy to get up there in levels.  I have two accounts and two computers.  On my other account lies a level 54 enchanter and I was going to use him to help me level, you know like just casting clarity and stuff every so often.  On the same account as my shaman lies a level 52 druid, who in my opinion might be a better duo partner until about level 50 or so.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking about moving my shaman to my other account.<br />
<br />
So would you rather have a 54 enchanter to help you level or a 52 druid?  I don't care about the 50 dollar fee to move my shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if $ is not a problem just get a 3rd acount and put the druid on that. now you have more choses :) if thats dosent work put the druid on the account with the chanter that way you can play with eather one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hell, if you don't care about the $50 fee, you probably don't care about the $13 a third account would cost either, so just do that.  And get a third computer to run it on.<br />
<br />
Nah, realistically I wouldn't bother with it.  I'd start a monk on the same account as the enchanter and PL him up to 40, then duo with the monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok .. 50 bucks is not much. Spending over 2k on a new computer is.<br />
<br />
The idea is to get the shaman to 50+, not start all over with a monk /gag</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're running 2 pc's, there's a little special program out there to help you run more than 1 account per pc, provided your system can support it.  Druid+Enc=great partners for shaman, therefore the idea of moving the druid to another account is awesome.  <br />
<br />
Separately, I couldn't choose between druid and enc as partner.  I would say enc cuse of c2, but if druid was 54 for regrowth, it would be a toss-up.  Together think of the possibilities.  Constant C2 going, and your pet has AQ at all times, + thorns from druid.  You canni up as you need, and druid, with C2, can keep up regrowth, buffs, and heals on you to stay at fm/fhp.<br />
<br />
Also, a new pc won't cost your 2k.  Buy a kvm switch, use your keyboard/monitor/mouse with a new computer, that might cost you $500. <br />
<br />
If NONE of these is an option, i'd go for the enchanter, C2 on you, + AQ on the pet, and rune if needed is a great combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd move the druid to the ench account.  Duo with the chanter witting outside the group and you should be able to constantly KS him.  Of course you could do the same with the druid, logging the ench on every once in a while to C2 yer shammy.  The druid will be there to be your TP Biatch though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lumor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would transfer the druid to a third account also.  You dont have to 3 box it to have the third account.  But think of the possibilities, you now have the choice of a (shaman, druid combo), (shaman, enchanter), and (druid enchanter).  Now if you feel like playing any of them you can port with the druid. <br />
<br />
You can still get free account keys for that new account also.<br />
<br />
Here is the link.<br />

Click the little trial button on the bottom left and they will email you an account key that you can use your current cds for.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm I think I'm getting closer to just moving the druid over to the enchanter's account.  But then I can't do the druid/ench duo!<br />
<br />
Arg decisions .. I so can't make up my mind =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The druid is of more use to help you level, and has the added bonus of mobility.</div></div><hr />
