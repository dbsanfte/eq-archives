<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Forza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">:) Hello all. This is my first post. So I have my helmet on for all the bonks. Bonk away.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes: Just a little bit about me. I'm one of those really casual players. I've been playing for about a year and a half. I play for a month or two and then stop for a while. I've restarted characters a lot trying to find the one I like and it looks like the ranger won out. :D I've been able to make it to level 13. Not really a big deal, but I'm sticking with it.<br />
<br />
Now to the reason for this post. One of my quests (noob) calls for a celestial temper. What is it and how do I make it? Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
I just want to say this is a great site. I've learned a lot from this site and plan on learning a lot more. Keep up the good work. :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Celestial Tempers are made with 1 purified water (made from 2 water flasks plus a celestial essence) and 1 blue diamond powder (1 blue diamond + a jar of acid).  <br />
<br />
The water and the temper are made in a brew barrel, the diamond powder is made in a kiln.<br />

This (http://www.eqtraders.com/index.htm) is a link to a trade-skilling site with info about all the tradeskills and recipes and such, a great place for this kind of information. :)</div></div><hr />
