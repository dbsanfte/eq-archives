<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Newbie Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I was all ready to start my pvp vah shir shaman when I thought about how cool trolls were(this is on sullon keep in mind) with their regen, and with the bonus for PvP, trolls level normally. They have an awesome black bear form at 55, and innate regen, they can also use the Jaundiced Bone Bracelet, but I don't want that to be my decision. I was playing a good, but I'm goona play an evil. Troll or Iksar???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) regen doesn't mean **** at higher levels for us due to our regen spells and stocism/torpor/Q etc.<br />
2) Ikkies can't wear JBB<br />
3)Ikkies have lowest HP (low sta) but high wis, wis doesn't mean anything<br />
<br />
If you have to choose go with troll, they also can get a snare necklace but if you wan to be an evil race choose ogre (just my opinion.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This subject has been done to death, in short, pick what you enjoy playing, if you want more info, look around/search if its working yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trix N'Treats</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tough choice. :)  Both races make wonderful shamans... I would have to say Iskar though.  You get forage (which in itself is helpful) and you dont have to spend hours camping explorers or bone chips for the crudgel quest cause you automatically liked from the start! :D  Only down fall to the iksar is the fact that you dont get to use the JBB... but at higher lvls that really wont be a problem.  :) Although it is a nice little item to have :D <br />
<br />
Good luck on your choice hun! :D Hope to see you post one your final decision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Regen is very nice and it is not like you are going to be able to twink on SZ where you can only have one character.<br />
<br />
For much of your shaman life, regen will be the best racial ability you can have but both troll and iksar have it so it does little to help with your choice.<br />
<br />
Trolls have nice mele stats and can use JB armor.<br />
Iksars have high wisdome and an bonus to AC.<br />
<br />
Iksar is a much easear shaman to play untwinked then a troll but in the end I would much rather play a troll.  JBB is just a powerfull tool.<br />
<br />
I personaly could care less about the snare neck....  I never found it to be all that horibly usefull because the snare effect is very week and of short duration and the cast time is long.  I would rather just root runners and hammer them down.<br />
<br />
If you are interested in the Iksar Cudgel quests and play a troll... pick Cazic Thule as your god and you will have less trouble with faction in Cabalis.<br />
<br />
I played a iksar to 52 a troll to 36 (hated the new models) and now play an Ogre.<br />
<br />
Out of the 3,  the iksar was very easy to boot strap in comparison to either the troll or the Ogre.<br />
<br />
Iksars have good natural AC, a high starting wisdom, and regen.  All will help a lot at lower levels and HP are rather meaningless untill the end game.<br />
<br />
Trolls will be harder to get up in level but stronger in the long run.  Another thing to think about on SZ is that trolls have very low starting Fire Resist.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd think on a Pk server that Iksars would be the better choice due to a relatively remote and comprehensive newbie area, good quests, and the fact that we're sexy as hell.<br />
<br />
Trolls and ogres are pretty much neighbors with their 'good' enemies, are pale imitations of the obviously superior iksar race, and need to put mirrors on the floor to examine their privates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For Sullon, I would definitely go with the Iksar.  Just stay the heck away from the PoK book in FoB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think the Crucible consensus on shaman race is that in terms of power Troll typically wins becaues of regen+JBB+snare (and I think they can have fear instead of snare if they choose the right god).  However, Ogre's are immune to stuns from the front and can also use the JBB, while Iksar can swim well, have a little extra AC (though their armor limitations balance this) and can forage.<br />
<br />
If you change your mind and go with a good race you will trade power for faction mainly.  You can then go Barb (levels slightly faster), Vah Shir (safe fall but they eat more), or a froglok (they swim well and ...?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Newbie Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've decided on troll.... Iksar=less melee stats and on SZ meleeing can be very important. I decidxed against the ogre because the high lvl bear form is a grizzly, and I wanted a kodiac. Overall, I think troll makes the best one. Dunno where to put points though. Hmmm, just looked at the mid level quest armor(totemic vs scaled mystic) and the scaled mystic one is so much better, but seems harder to do. I am still thinking about my race, but so far the troll is in the lead...</div></div><hr />
