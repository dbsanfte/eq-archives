<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">YAY go shaman and all our super awesome aa's.<br />
<br />
just for ****s and giggles i made a level 1 BL, warrior, Pal, etc...<br />
<br />
all classes got the shaft, but we really got the shaft, BL on the other hand from what i can tell got a decent set, more damage off hand, increase your pet, turn into your pet etc...<br />
<br />
We get ummmm crit dots (i'll hold judgement till i see a parse of how effective this really is).  and that totem thing.  Spell casting subtley, is nice but there are times you want agro, and well being passive you cant turn it on and off.<br />
<br />
whats everyones take on our new UBAH powah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">haven't bought god yet and I'm still on the fence</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">nuzum... I guess you didn't happen to check out the mage aas or necro aas?<br />
<br />
mages get innate flurry on their pets now, innate crits also. they can share health with their pets, making them have some insane hp.<br />
<br />
necros get those cool archer pets that do insane dps if positioned correctly. They get crit dots(with their low-resist dots.. shudder...) and they get more crit nukes to lifetap with.<br />
<br />
These 2 classes got significant upgrades, I haven't looked at the others yet, but probably will soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like my monk's new AA's at least...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like my monk's new AA's at least...<br />
<br />
I purchased GoD thinking we were getting pet crits and some pet thing to make it do more damage...I was wrong.  Our AA's suck for the most part.  The only one that even looks good at all is the crits on DoT's.  I'll wait until I see how much that goes off....  We really did get the shaft.  I'm going to get more levels of casting fury because our DD's rule so much, ***?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">haven't bought god yet and I'm still on the fence<br />

<br />
Piece of advice:<br />
<br />
Unless you like the idea of playing a bare bones half assed new melee class..don't.<br />
<br />
I can't believe how poorly implemented berserkers are..and they're the best part of the expansion so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">some classes got a good set of spell and aa, some didnt, shaman got really bad aa, and only 1 spell good(and thats the hardest to get) for sure. some of the aa could be ok if they are tweek like spirit call and critical affliction which from what i heard is almost worthless.<br />
<br />
i say feedback to try get atleast the dot changed:) and spirit call fixed:)<br />
<br />
but i not buying GoD at moment, i waiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So far I like the new expansion.  I don't have a lot of AA's and wont be getting any of the new ones any time soon.  Not interested in the leadership abilities, I'll let the leaders do that.  The spells for shaman are very lackluster.<br />
<br />
So why do I like it you ask?<br />
<br />
I can turn on my spell effects and the ones from NPCs, and not see everyone elses.  The new tradeskill interface is another good one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can turn on my spell effects and the ones from NPCs, and not see everyone elses.  The new tradeskill interface is another good one.<br />
not sure about the spell effects, but everybody has the new tradeskill window now!<br />
<br />
I m playing around with a Berserker, looks like some fun, those axe effects are neat.<br />
<br />
(and just comment about shaman aa or spells /rude SOE)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">not getting this expansion, from the classes aa's i've looked at they all suck (ok just ranger and shammy but still), the new zones from what I've heard are hard as hell and I've got enough alts to play with, besides the fact I dislike pure melee's due to the lack of versatility anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I haven't bought the new expansion yet but my options (mostly graphical) are expanded, I get the new tradeskill UI, and I can see the new AA (dunno if I could get em as I'm far from even considering them).  The patch brought some goodies to everyone even if you didn't get the expansion.<br />
<br />
I also lost my tooltip/label text on stuff on my inventory as a side bonus...talked to a GM and nothing they suggested helped it, even deleting and repatching my UI (I just use the default UI).  Let me tell ya, not having labels in when you hover the mouse in your inventory gets old in a hurry.</div></div><hr />
