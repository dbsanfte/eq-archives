<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My epic story...<br />
<br />
I obtained my Spear of Fate at level 46. I happily wielded it for many levels until I aquired a Sharkspine Club.  after growing tired of seeing my spear rotting in my bank I decided to hand it to Giwin Mirikon in PoTactics. &quot;Thanks for the Spear of Fate Gwardenian&quot;.<br />
<br />
Well with the comming of Epic 2.0 I realized this was a big mistake. Yesterday I filed a petition and recieved a reply a few hours later. It went something like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, Our logs do not show you as having your epic&quot;.<br />
<br />
Well crap!<br />
<br />
I sent another petition with the original ticket number asking if they could look again, and to check back to level 46 logs. Tonight I recieved the reply. Not only did they tell me the same exact thing, but they didnt even take the time to type it out. It was an exact cut and paste of the first reply!  :mad: <br />
<br />
Now Im stuck trying to find some people willing to travel back into PoFear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gammink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It may just be in your best interest to just do the extra tasks instead of going for epic 1.0 again.  Getting 1.0 again will most likely consume much more time than to do the penance penalty.  If you have cash you may consider buying a tear MQ, but all in all its prolly not best to do again.<br />
<br />
I know space is limited in the bank, imagine if it hadn't doubled in size with LoY.  I tend to keep everything no drop that I can.  My bank is very full at the moment, but when that happens, I dish the droppable stuff onto other characters.  Very few of my other characters have a full bank, except my 'zaar mule.  That no drop item now may not seem useful, but if it will save you 8 hours of camping later, 30 hours of redoing a quest, why not keep it.  There are some no drop items I destroy, but its only those that drop commonly and are used for low level quests and such.  <br />
<br />
Not sure if Im alone here, but who still has their broken arrow and the epic shield?  /raises hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/raise<br />
<br />
Might turn into a good thing...if you do the &quot;pre-1.5&quot; stuff, you can post it for the other non-epic having shaman!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lol the broken arrow wasnt ever used for anything...is it now part of the 2.0 quest?<br />
if so thats just insulting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gammink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No its not for epic 1.5 or 2.0 that I know of, just talkin about how I save everything heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When I was reading that Epic 1.5 and 2.0 wouldn't require but would run smoother if you already had Epic 1.0 I couldn't help but think of all the folks who had turned in their Epics and took screen shots. (Of course there were often a lot of people around for shock effect)<br />
<br />
And now you want Sony to GIVE you your Epic?<br />
<br />
Well with the comming (sic) of Epic 2.0 I realized this was a big mistake<br />
<br />
Epics, while nice, weren't just a great piece of gear.  They were an indication that you had enough friends (or could pay people to help / MQ I suppose) to accomplish a drawn out task. In 2000 they WERE a status symbol because back then people wiped to Trak, Black Reavers, 7th isle of Sky.<br />
<br />
I'm curious, in your race to clean out your bank - just what DID you replace your Epic with?  Quest_item_01? <br />
<br />
I mean, just how bad-A55 are you that you couldn't save a spot for your Epic as a reminder of days gone by and all the people who went to CoM and the Hole to help YOU?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hostile much Faern?<br />
<br />
Im not upset about having to do extra for 1.5 or the possibility of redoing 1.0. Im pissed that Sony claims I never did it in the first place.<br />
<br />
Now days the epic is just another piece of quested gear. I have a long enough memory to remember that I did it and who helped. I remember turning in Orc Shoulderpads at level 8. Do I keep one in my bank for sentimental value?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Epic 1.0 is not just another orc shoulderpads though. Hopefully, you spent a little more time on it than the pads.<br />
<br />
There are people who still value the epic 1.0 in and of itself, not as &quot;just another piece of quested gear.&quot; I guess you are not in their numbers. Sorry to hear you need to redo all/part of the 1.0 quest. I wish you luck with it. However, I think people might have assumed (incorrectly in your case) that something that took so long to quest might stick with you a bit longer than minor quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I still use my epic for resist gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I didnt post this to get into an argument about the importance of epics. Just that Sony has no record of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Filur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For Sony to keep a record of every toon in the game that has ever made the epic quest besides keeping track of the actual epic items would take a lot of data. They would have no reason to keep track of it untill now. So you could say that you yourself destroyed the only record there were.<br />
<br />
Filur</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tat,<br />
<br />
How long ago did you complete it?  How long ago did you turn it in?  Not sure how far back they go in server logs (do they have character logs?  I dunno).<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear that SOE claims you never did your epic.  But honestly - you gave it away.  <br />
<br />
If the new quests simply require that you be flagged as completing your first epic, then SOE should flag your shaman and go from there.<br />
<br />
If they require you to actually possess a Spear of Fate (a far more likely case) then you don't have much of a case.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - Technically, the answer from SOE is correct - They aren't saying you NEVER had a Spear of Fate, just that you CURRENTLY don't have a Spear of Fate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well obviously it wasn't very epic for him if he got it at 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Even today, having your Spear is no small feat.  I cannot conceive of &quot;giving&quot; it away.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, that's just stupid.<br />
<br />
I'm a firm believer in people living with the consequences of the decisions they make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm a firm believer in people living with the consequences of the decisions they make.<br />
So you can see into the future and derive all possible consequences? Wow, I could really use that ability, would have saved me alot of time and money.<br />
<br />
On topic, I would have thought that SOE has logs of the chars ranging back very far. <br />
<br />
Have you tried to talk to the Spirit in Freeport? And can you choose Heyoka as a title, Gwardenian?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nope, but I live with the consequences.  Sometimes we have to make choices without knowing the outcome.  If our decisions sucks, we learn from it.<br />
<br />
How bout you?</div></div><hr />

You can't even select Heyokah with the Spear on a corpse or in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have to agree with Sudedor.  The epic isnt like your old ToV BP and Hate gear.  I cant believe anyone doesnt have room for it somewhere.  So I cant say I feel that sorry for you.  <br />
<br />
I still carry mine in one one of my bags for when I feel nostalgic.  It wouldnt matter how many uber weapons I get in the future or since I had spear as my primary I would always have an inventory spot for it somewhere.  Ofcourse I got mine back when the Spear of Fate was the weapon to have for a shaman and when it took real raids to complete it.  And didnt get it at 46 heh. <br />
<br />
I could never concieve of destroying it or giving it away to some NPC.  When I see it, it reminds me of the effort it took to get it and the fun I had doing the quest.  Reminds me of my old guild, now long gone.  It reminds me of the friends I made in EQ who assisted me.  I also remember who excited and happy I was and the feeling of accomplishment it gave me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You guys are killing me.  If you need a few pixels to remind you of fun you had, it couldn't have been that much fun.  I have a ton of memories dating back to 1999 in EQ, and I don't need any item to make me remember them.<br />
<br />
Jeez the guy asked a question and all you guys can do is look down your nose at him.<br />

<br />
How bout you?<br />
<br />
Man, how sanctimonious do you have to be?  <br />
<br />
This guy has a reasonable beef, and certainly reason enough to just want to vent a little.  <br />
<br />
There should be a mechanism for those who reasonably thought there would be no updates to epics, because at one point SOE said there would be no updates to epics.  Epics are really old gear now.  <br />
<br />
If SOE has no meaningful ability to verify this information without huge personnel expenses, then this guy is likely screwed and that's that.  But that doesn't mean it's not unreasonable to vent a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Honestly, I'd rather the GM's spend time on problems that people didn't bring on themselves.  He got rid of a quest piece because it wasn't important to him, now he wants it back.  It wasn't even an accident.<br />
<br />
I don't think he's the antichrist or anything, but it's not like the game screwed him.  He screwed himself.  Venting isn't unreasonable, I suppose.  But harping on SoE like there aren't more justified petitions to spend time on, is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">He didn't ask a question. He just vented. Basically it wasn't epic to him because he got it at 46, so easy come, easy go and he deleted it. I guess if it was so easy to get it shouldn't take long to get another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Regardless of the importance of keeping your epic, there's a matter of data storage.  I work for a large software manufacturer in the storage industry as well as working in the IT industry, so I have some experience here.<br />
<br />
You never mentioned when you received your epic, but I would guess that it was some time ago, and it is not very realistic to expect SOE to keep backups tapes around for that long of a period.  I would guess that at one point, they DID have record of you having finished your EPIC quests, but tape catalogs get overwritten and tapes get recycled, so most likely, that data is long gone.  Therefore, what they're saying is most likely correct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kydaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">sorry to hear this :(<br />
<br />
I accidently deleted my small gem (one of them) but petitioned the same day and got it back thankfully.  I just got my tear last night along with another guildy<br />
<br />
I think you find a lot of shammys who did not have it before going and getting it now to avoid the extra tasks for 1.5.  Fear is not so bad as long as you do not spawn the imp OR you have a good raiding team. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I STILL use my epic when soling.  Free manaless dmg is always nice.  I have DoT pans, DoT Spear, Root Pants, DD Bracer, etc.  ANYTHING that gives you free dmg or some other spell you have for no mana is handy.  I would NEVER purposefully turn in any item with a clicky effect, unless it was to upgrade said item.</div></div><hr />
