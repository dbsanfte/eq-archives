<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lowi Bladeslinger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hopefully sean makes the bow soon, but while we wait lets all guess what the stats might be !.  btw i am thinking the reason they might have lowered the stats on the bow from vallon zek is because the stats on the  bow from plane of fire where simallir and much harded to obtain,especialy if its not  trival at 250 fleching.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
my guess is<br />

<br />
 come on take a guess nobody has a clue on what the bow will be like and posting a guess on sean's thread about making the bow/ will only clog up the thread so in all good fun take a guess.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taluvan Winterscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I really hate procs on bows other than buff. DD procs are really annoying to say the least. Everyone jump up and down when bow shots break root yet DD on bow will break root 90% of the time and everyone wants one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Falkmoon Elfwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">it s a bow from Plane of Fire, it kinda has to have a Fire DD heh;)<br />
<br />
aside from that no idea, might as well be 1/40 + 40 fire damage :p<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Taluven , Bow Procs kinda happen once in a year at night only when the planets are in the perfect constellation.... lol bow procs breaking root is (almost) a non-isisue, due to the frequency (or lack of rather) of the procs:)</div></div><hr />

If you want to be off service to your fellow Rangers, do not come here with speculation.<br />
<br />
I use the forums in an effort to educate myself and see no reason why I should have to deal with you wasting my time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Felixican Edger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">And to think my pappy got holes in his leg from some nip machine gun trying to save your rotten island.<br />
<br />
And yeah, thats a mean thing to say, but its equally mean to deride folks for speculation, which is harmless.<br />
I doubt anyone seriously uses the glade forums as an educational resource, i mean, its for a GAME. You know, a GAME where we have fun.  Oddly enough, to some of us, speculating about unknown/incomplete gear is fun. <br />
Way to bring down the glade Treece. As we say in Ohio, DINGUS.</div></div><hr />

This is a DISCUSSION board where we DISCUSS stuff.<br />
<br />
As we say in ENGLAND... nah I am not going there.<br />
<br />
Talk about the pot calling the kettle black, though.<br />
<br />
I think you should apologise for your profanity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Felixican Edger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well, if my language offends you, then I appologize, i was just poking fun at his out burst anyhow.  I mean, really, how many quests and fletching combines have been solved here thru &quot; speculation&quot; ?  <br />
Me? I figure the bow will probably be a couple points higher damage, with  +fire damage, than the nightmare bow, maybe mid 60's required level.  It'll prolly have a DD proc, but I'd like to see a stackable fire resistance buff that procs on the user. That'd be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Celestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Treece you wasted your own time by actually taking time to reply. Takes one glance at a topic to see if it interests you, if it doesn't, then use the &quot;Back&quot; button and let others enjoy the topic who are interested in a little speculation. It's not that hard really.<br />
<br />
I would like to see an effect on the bow, or proc. That would be cool =)</div></div><hr />

thats the nightmare bow, if VI holds true to the way they do trade skills (which almost in every single case in the game, a crafted item is inferior to the majority of droped items), it wont be much better, probably something like<br />

Then don't read here, my that was simple. I equate the above statement to you getting in a car accident where it was your fault, but you blame the other person because they were driving on the same road as you.</div></div><hr />

Who cares, don't respond then or even read the post. I read maybe 15 words before I decided I didn't care about it and went off to find another thread to read but I'm not about to sit here and call Lowi a idiot because I didn't like her post however I will call you an idiot because your so full of your self to think a post that took maybe less then 2min to read has &quot;wasted your time&quot; even though you chose to read it, guess that means your wasting your own time? dur</div></div><hr />

I see nothing wrong in this, i think its more like<br />

1 damage 50 delay<br />
plus 32 fire damage<br />
range 1<br />

you know it'll be bugged</div></div><hr />

Actually, it's Buddy Jesus- we're on a first name basis, as we go way back. But I understand how it could be misunderstood :D</div></div><hr />
