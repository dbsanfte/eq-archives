<br />
I am using the Luclin models and love the new Barbarians!<br />
<br />
I am currently in my 35th season and am looking for an upgrade to my leg slots.  Currently am using just Totemic.  Totemic looks sweet since it gives him the plate look but it also is my weakest area that needs an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Anything around 2k with decent stats that gives the plate look would be most appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Suggestions?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brown Chitin Leggings are about the only thing that fit that bill off the top of my head, not sure on the price tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Engraved royal velium also has a plate look, but it may be a little bit more than 2k a piece.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be purposeful there is Yellow (Kael) and Black (Vindi) that makes you look like a bee..<br />
<br />
Your right though there is a limited colour selection - either grey, drab green or drab brown available at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Crystal Chitin looks like white plate and has some decent stats for about 2k although they can be a little rare at times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">dragon pants (Dragonleg Breaches) are getting cheaper and cheaper all the time and they are pretty blue chain.  I guarantee they will satisfy the fashion conscious shaman.<br />
<br />
they come in several types.<br />
(least expensive)Worked, Reinforced, Heavy, Peerless, Matchless(most expensive)</div></div><hr />
