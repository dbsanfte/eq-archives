<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some may think these are stupid, but here goes nothing. <br />
<br />
Spiritual Oneness - When activated this AA gives you two minutes of negative one hundred resist check to all detrimental spells casted. (Resuse - 1 hour ) <br />
<br />
Gift of the Medicine Man- When activated this AA greatly increases the chance of performing critical heals on an ally.  (like 50% chance)  (Duration 5 minutes, Reuse- 25 minutes) <br />
<br />
Spirit Sacrafice -  When activated you sacrafice your spirit to transfer into others. ex.) You recieve 3500 damage, and give 700 mana to all other group members, while you receive no mana back. ( AKA mass group cann 5)<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule's Gift - passive ability that reduces aggro on all detrimental spells by 15 30 45% per level.  (hell i would even pay 30/30/30 for this one.) =-) <br />
<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts, what do you all think ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They look reasonable...... at first glance anyway.<br />
<br />
My problem is why should we pay in AAs to get fixes to our class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah yes, I agree with you 100% .. and if they fixed DoT aggro we wouldnt need the last one.  Alot of ways they can still salvage the shaman with the next expansion.  I for one hope that they actually put some thought into it for once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i dont want to buy an new explansion to fix my character either, they should do that anyways!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where have you been since ..............?<br />
<br />
I mean even a cursory glance at recent history tells you that Shaman both individually and ESPECIALLY in comparison with other classes (Priest and non-Priest), not only do NOT get &quot; fixed &quot; but get left further and further behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How about an AA called that we can target any other group member and canni FROM them, take 2k hp from them, and give 1k mana to us.  <br />
<br />
Can you imagine how fun that could be, targetting the druid in your group with it?  It'd be a new kind of canni death, and it ain't gonna be mine.<br />
<br />
The fun part would be coming up with a name for this AA.<br />
<br />

I'd call it Justifed Execution!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The funny part is that a druid said few days ago that shamans should get a canni-others-spell. I awnsered &quot;Taking YOUR hp to get MY mana? Sounds kewl ;)&quot; Hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've always thought a new good aa would be that where we would take damage and others got mana.  But then would extra shm on raids just be turned into mana batteries?  Hopefully not with a refresh time.<br />
<br />
I like the crit healing idea but the first one you suggested is just way too overpowering, no matter how long the refresh time is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">After we get our real issues fixed (not through expansions or AA). I would like to see more shaman spirits.<br />
<br />
I &lt;3 the Spirit call line of AA's. Being a medicine man who is one with the spirits, I think we should have more spirits to summon to our and the groups aid. I know I read a thread sugesting aa's exactly like that. The guy had spirits that provide the group with helth regen, group mana regen, group endurence regen etc.<br />
<br />
I would like some of these spirits to bears :)<br />
*A spirit that allowed us to have a DA or Cuncusion type effect to lose agro.<br />
or<br />
*A spirit that absorbed damage intended for us (kind of like a situational rune)<br />
<br />
*A spirit that does (insert spell effect here)</div></div><hr />
