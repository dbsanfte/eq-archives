<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eamonn1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya all <br />
<br />
           I am a member of a small guild that will attempt ToV soon.We will be probably 2 groups of 55 + people .I have two questions.<br />
<br />
    1.I dont have Malo yet and is that a sine qua non?<br />
     2.I'd very much appreciate any tips on how a 60 shammy (lacking malo) can help such a raid.<br />
<br />
    I have Epic,Torpor and Avatar and doing my best to get Malo but please reply on the basis that Malo is absent.<br />
<br />
<br />
      Thanks and best Wishes<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well if you mean Hall of testing or a west wing raid you should be ok as long as you have a mage with mala, a 55+ bard and an enchanter. Torpor is a very effective heal in there for casters and you'll still be slowing assuming you have a mage with mala coming. I would have to say if you don't have a mage with mala or a copy of malo for you before the raid don't bother going. 2 groups of people is pretty minimal for doing tov and you just can't afford to not be able to readily debuff the mobs.<br />
<br />
If you actually ment North tov. Don't even bother. Even the weakest mobs in there would require noticably more than 2 groups. Heck even the flurry drake yard trash would eat 2 groups alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eamonn1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">thanks Taraddar I did mean the regular guys apologies if subject post is misleading and thanks for the info.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have a mage with Mala then you should be ok. Always Mala/o a mob, then Tash and Occlusion of Sound then Malosini. Only then slow. If not you are going to have quite a few resists and possible aggro.<br />
<br />
Glimmer drakes are immune to magic, only disease slowable. White wurms, blue drakes and glimmer drakes gate. Stop them from gating or have a nasty CR.<br />
<br />
Use walls, corners and/or steps to your advantage to avoid AE of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just to clarify, you *don't* need malosini in to slow....obviously it helps with resists, but it's not a must.  Just don't want you getting the wrong idea and sit there casting malosini over and over when you coulda slowed =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You don't need Malosini, BUT it helps a ton. One thing you don't want as a shaman in a small raid, is to draw aggro. A 2 group gig in WToV or HoT has to be very efficient and error free. You can't draw aggro or you die, then the rest of the party follows. Having always Malosini before slow will help you land slow on first try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would have to agree.  On a 2 group raid you can really afford to be gun ho and get killed because you get resisted a few times. Spend some time to try at least 2 or 3 malosini's or stick it before you try slowing.<br />
<br />
As for the mobs themselves. For west wing. The blue wurms and drakes are both clerics and will CH and gate. The wurms have a mean cold based ae and the drakes have a really nasty proc. The drakes proc a dot/mana drain. You really don't wanna aggro one of those if your the only shaman ont he raid. Sitting there for 10 minutes while the dot wears off and you get mana back is no fun. As for the glimmers there are actually 2. Glimmers and glimmering. It's been a while but i beleive glimmers are druids and will gate. Glimmerings are rangers and wont gate. Both will have DS up tho and should be dispelled before debuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would have to agree with Zorlac and Taraddar.  Use malosini.  They are right on about agro.  On a 2 group raid you really can't afford to waste all the clerics mana healing you when your slow is resisted.  If you die and have to get rezzed it will slow things down even more.  If the cleric blows their mana on you and mob remains unslowed and you die, then its a wipeout.  We can usually last 2+ minutes without the mob being slowed before healing mana starts to get critical, when I encounter bad resists.<br />
<br />
It's very rare for me not to land slow in HoT with malosini in.  Work with your debuff team (bard, chanter, mage, shaman) to make sure things land in the right order.<br />
<br />
As for what else you can do to be useful.  We do HoT with 1 group and I am always in charge of keeping everyone but the Warrior alive and healthy from AE dmg.  I use torpor liberally, almost exclusively for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">*shrug* i like to live on the wild side =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did HoT other day with guild, and our 60 shaman who has malo could not make it till late.  i am lvl 58 and we had no mage for mala.  I found that landing malosini even with tash and occ  was very very hard.  But once malosini landed slow was no problem. <br />
<br />
One a side note our 60 enchanter was able to slow with just tash and occ, dunno if was lvls or different types of resist but just somehting to note.  Does anyone know if enchanter slow is on different resist tables than shaman slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They can be easily disease slowed after decay should you lack OoS and Mala that will have to be your choice. But if that is the case you will probably not get very far wit two 55+ groups unless 55+ means 11 lvl 60 and 1 lvl 56 or with near perfect coordination class balance, awesome skills and high DPS. PoI has a lot more aggro than Turgurs though so watch out.<br />
<br />
Honestly two grouping in even the easiest part of ToV isn't a good idea if everyone isn't 60 well equipped, highly skilled have the right classes and all their spells and such.</div></div><hr />

Enchanters slow is apparently less resisted than the Shaman slow from what I have been hearing lately. <br />
<br />
I will post this everytime I see this topic brought up. From personal experience playing a high lvl enchanter and shaman. I see absolutely no difference between the resists rates as a shaman and as an enchanter. It's all random and I'd be willing to be for every time that the enchanter landed a slow there where a dozen or more resists he didn't mention. You didn't say it but I'm gonna guess that the enchanter wasn't slowing every mob otherwise you wouldn't have bothered to continue with malosini and slow on the mobs. I'd bet if you asked the enchanter they didn't slow every mob because they where getting resisted just like you do not because they where lazy and just didn't want to cast it half the time.<br />
<br />
I've read just as many posts on enchanter boards saying why is shamans slow less resisted than an enchanters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The disease-based slow is very high aggro, as is the disease debuff.  Put them both together and you have an excellent chance of being summoned, and even killed -- it can be very hard to taunt off you, firstly, and secondly, the mob will be only 25% slowed when pounding on you.<br />
<br />
If you're the only shaman on the raid, I would only disease slow if it makes no difference whether you die every time you do it.  In other words, if it doesn't slow your pull rate down too much.  I'm not sure whether that applies to your situation or not, because that depends how well equipped the people you're going with are and what their levels are.  If you're new to ToV, though, they probably have neither very high levels nor very high level equipment, so I would be very careful about when to disease slow or not.  Definitely, if you have a disease slow resisted and then try it again, you can expect to die.<br />
<br />
If you're mid-50's and such, I would seriously consider bringing in some outside people to bring your total up to more than two groups.  That's a small number for people who aren't used to the place and don't have the levels or equipment yet either.</div></div><hr />
