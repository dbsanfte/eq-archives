<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah.  They fixed it.  Before you could just run to the dude and if you knew what to say could be in and out of the zone in 20 secs with the flag.  Now you can't do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Beat it last night.  They make it harder?</div></div><hr />

Last night we did it successfully and had two right next to each other.  The stonespiritis isn't up from the start now.  He's spawned.</div></div><hr />

&gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>JuyshinRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">completed vexd early this morning. can verify he spawns and its working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ugh apparently you have to kill 100 NPCs now to spawn him.   I guess the issue was people sos'ing/DA'ing/FD'ing to the end, hailing and finishing the event without touching a mob.<br />
<br />
But wouldn't like kill 10 mobs have prevented that?  Kill 20? 30? :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah was working ok on Saturday.  Its just a real pain in the ass.  No easy skipping of content now. =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They should have made it a rescue quest, where the magic rock is at the beginning of the zone and you have to go rescue the stonespiritist guy and bring him back to it.  That would have prevented people from exploiting it while at the same time saving legitimate players from having to kill 101 mobs to spawn the spiritist.  20 or 30 would have been fine, but 101?  That's brutal.  Thank god I did this before the change.</div></div><hr />
