<br />
Can anyone list me all the possible drops from the &quot;Golden Ticket&quot; at the casino.<br />
<br />
My other question is, Is there a way to sell back your lizard &quot;loy mount&quot; to a vendor much like the horse.<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't know about the golden tickets, but you can sell back the droghogs at the same place you bought them from (inside the lighthouse).  I believe certain gnomes correspond to certain colors for the buy back.</div></div><hr />

Down at the bottom are all the obtainable rewards from a golden ticket.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Reading over this, it only lists what you can get in general hehe.<br />
<br />
Guise of the Deceiver, Holgresh Elder Beads, Ton Po's Bow Stick of Understanding, Rubicite BP, Glowing Black/White Drums are all Golden Ticket items.</div></div><hr />

Yes you can, theres 4 gnomes in loy the lighhouse gulf of gunthak is the zone.  they take back depending on the color of the drogmar.</div></div><hr />

I think he was refferring to the drums you recieve as rewards for Gold Tickers, not the ones you purchase in LoY. Not entirely sure, though, but thats what I was thinking when I saw it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To clarify re: the Droghog.<br />
<br />
If you bought the beast from the LoY vendor, he'll buy it back.<br />
If you won the beast in the casino, it's not sellable.<br />
<br />
I guess the NPCs only buy droghogs if they know the pedigree of their breeding. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, with the drogmor from the casino, the thing is that the one you win is the same speed as an ornate chain bridle from emp/seru, and thus much faster than even the 100k horse/drogmors.<br />
<br />
You can't buy them, so there's no basis for a price to refund for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yea the one from the casino you can't trade in, I wasn't paying attention to that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lucy says the Ornate Chain Bridles and the Glowing Drums would have a value of 150K if they were vendor sold (50% more than the most expensive mount you can buy), but as was said the mount NPCs probably won't take those in return.</div></div><hr />
