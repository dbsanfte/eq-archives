<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cyid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for a place to hunt. I usually duo with a 40 warrior.<br />
<br />
I have hunted in EW.. but im looking for something quicker.  I mostly run into light blue there. <br />
<br />
I cant stand DSP anymore. And the no loot got to me quick since i spent all my money on fletching and wasnt getting any back.<br />
<br />
And I cant stand DL, or any zones like it (aka LOIO zones were ooc is nothing but whining, complaining and b*tching)<br />
<br />
oh, I am also looking for quests to do. The other night we finished our ice forged shackles quest. and now are looking for some others to work on. Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beeoz0r</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at 45 i brought my warrior to karnors, velks, and seb, mostly velks tohugh, easier to get to, but with pop moving is easy, so any of those are pretty good exp, if you're looking for groups that is =P</div></div><hr />

At 44, and especially with your warrior friend, go to Crystal caverns.  XP won't be so good for you unless you are able to get the geonids, but the xp will rock for the warrior.  When the warrior is 45, you should be a little hjigher still, go to KC.</div></div><hr />
