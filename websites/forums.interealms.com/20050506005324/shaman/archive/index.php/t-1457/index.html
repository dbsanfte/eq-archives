<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>a11e</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I normallly dual box with a monk.  We are both level 20.  Even though I try from time to time to increase defense I never seem to get any skill increases.  Are there any buffs that increase the chance of a defensive skill gain?  Does increased dexterity improve the likelihood of a skill gain? <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Happi the clumsy troll</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You probably reached the cap for your level, that's all.  I never once went out and specifically worked on my defense.  When I hit 50, my defense hit 200 within an hour of soloing /shrug.  I'm just lucky like that.  My swimming is at 176 and I've never practiced it, either.  I just swim whenever I need to swim :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As to your second question. Yes you should care. When you draw agro from your spells and get whacked you'll be glad your defence skill is up. Trust me there will be times when you will gain instant agro in a split second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its been said before here by shaman greater than me: Defense = Free AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You defense skill is level *5 and the max is 200.<br />
That means it maxes at level 40.<br />
<br />
At level 20, you should have 100 defense.<br />
<br />
Make sure your shaman maxes their defense or you will kick yourself violently and repeatedly at higher levels.  I take more beats in the high level game than most anyone besides a warrior.  :p    So you would be a madman to throw away free ac.<br />
<br />
Best way to raise it?  Get hit.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I found a high level chanter in the selling zone and had him/her conjure up a blue pet... /duel then went to town.  Buy tiny daggers to repay them but often enough I never had to because they were so amused that a shaman wanted to duel thier pet. heh.  Buff up and use mana for heals and to root if need be.  Then when your spent have chanter reclaim pet and med up for another round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Have someone cast a DS on you for twice the normal defense gain.  Buff agility.  Get an INT buff.  INT makes the most difference in my experience.  Much more difference than agility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Radiation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Check out the mist panther in WL located near the lake to the PoG building. Lots of melees use this for log parsing since it's decent level but hits very low for it's level. It's like a punching bag if you can't find a pet to duel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Dexterity increases your chances of a skill gain in your offensive skills, including weapons.<br />
<br />
Agility increases your chances of a skill gain in defense.<br />
<br />
You may not notice it too much much at lower levels, because low level slows aren't particularly aggrolicious, but poor defensive skills are bad news.  First, they rise very slowly -- much more slowly than weapons and offense does.  Second, your slow at 51 suddenly creates much more aggro than previous slows did, and monsters also hit for a lot, and double and triple attack and bash or slam all at once more, too.  So if you fall behind in your defense, it will be time-consuming to raise, and risky as you level higher, since mobs hit for more, and you really NEED that defense skill.<br />
<br />
Defense skill raises at 5 per level to a max of 200, and each point is more or less 2.5 AC free, or 12.5 AC per level.  That's like suddenly upgrading a piece of your equipment to uber status.  Adds up REAL fast, but so does not having it.  <br />
<br />
At 37, I was only a couple dozen points behind, but it took me 8 solid levels of strictly solo work, meleeing like mad, to finally max out to 200 at level 45.  Some rare people may get lucky and get quick increases, but sometimes you can get NO increases in a whole level.  Most people's experience are probably a lot more like mine -- slow and frustrating -- than like those of the lucky among us. <br />
<br />
If you're duoing, don't make the common mistake of letting the shaman just be a buff monkey for your monk.  He needs to develop fully as his own character, too, or he will be extremely weak when he gets older.  Let him fight a LOT, so he maxes defense and at least one weapon skill(preferably all of them).  If that means holding back on finishing a kill off with your monk sometimes, so be it.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest using your second highest slow sometimes, too, so mobs are slowed enough to be safe for you guys, but not so slow that you handicap your progress in gaining defense skills.</div></div><hr />
