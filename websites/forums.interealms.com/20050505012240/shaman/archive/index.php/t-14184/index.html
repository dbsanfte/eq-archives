<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I remeber a while ago there was talk that HP buffs gave no HP's to our pets. Well recently i was messing around in the desert area in POS Duo'ing with a Cleric (hehe i got to tank) After a few cactuses we decided to see if i could solo one. My Cleric Friend offered Virtue to DogDog and I though why not ? so off we went and we did two or three before we had to go. Alll i can say is Virtue defiantly Adds HPs. I firgure that most of the buffs we use only add 500 or so and its hard to notice the difference But Virtue is alot more and it was very noticable I'd heal the Dog when it was on 20 PCT and my 2k heal did not get it to 100pct.<br />
<br />
Later I tried again but this time had no Virtue for the dog, Guess what =<br />

I always FA and SoD my dog.   It must have been an illusion that he procs like a mad man and with FA hits for 60 almost every time.  Without FA he hits in the 20s way too much.  I have to get this parsed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Buffing DogDogs sta would give him 100 hp's at best thats just too few to notice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Parsing has proven that STR buffs do nothing for dogdog's melee capabilities and strongly suggests that STA buffs do nothing either (I haven't seen any parsing test with CHA, but I'm patiently waiting :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I always FA and SoD my dog.

<br />
As for FA that seems to make some difference. I have done some parsing with my wifes mage pet and it did proc considerably more with FA then without. When I have some time I'll have to parse some long play session and get some hard numbers. <br />
<br />
STA has no effect at all<br />
<br />
STR doesn't have a noticable effect.<br />
<br />
Virtue and Focus work nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, putting STA on somebody jus raises their max hp, which their regen then has to fill.<br />
<br />
Even on somebody with tons of hp, this will cause their hp % to show 99% instead of 100%, as their regen starts filling that larger hp pool.<br />
<br />
Put Sta on Goner, and his life % doesn't change.<br />
<br />
STR does change our pets' atk and damage -- there was a parse posted here ages and ages ago which indicated that.<br />
<br />
Have I missed somebody's parse that shows no effect from STR?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">AC and agi i believe help to, never parsed it , but it certainly feels like it, also, dex absolutly helps, again, no parse to back me up , but i notice alot more procs when he is buffed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">FA also adjusts Puppup's ATK rating. It may be the effects of that, which you are seeing.<br />
<br />
Stat buffs do seem to have a minimal effect on him. But rather than buff him to the gills constantly, it's just focus, haste and send him on his way.<br />
<br />
ok, and the occassional torpor ... malo ... turgur's...dot here and there.... sometimes a nuke... But he takes it all in stride :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hitpoint, Armor class, Dexterity and direct attack buffs all DEFINANTELY affect pets.  When you pop PA/FA on a pet you're seeing improvements from the +atk and +dex (with proc weapons).  Some people swear agility does as well but I've never looked into it.<br />
<br />
Stamina has no effect on pets at all.  There was a recent bug on test where using a pet heal would cause the pet to report its HPs plus the value of the heal combined.  Buffing stamina never changed the HPs on any pet.  Apparently, even SOE isn't aware of this since summoned mage belts actually have a +sta stat on them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Acutally the mages have tried to address the STA issue with SoE many times. They just refuse to fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gangrelh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If Str buffs do not work on our pet then why do we have a pet only buff that gives Str?   I think it is safe to say that it does have an effect.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shayne716</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just think of you pet as at the stamina/strength cap like most people these days</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gangrelh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmmm.... Most people have good items these days.  Pets of course do not.  Why would a pet who is lvl 58 come with full stats?  Try STR it works!</div></div><hr />

stat buffs have been proven to help. just stamina is the only one that doesn't.</div></div><hr />
