I just won this little beauty in VT last night.  I still can't believe how much it kicks some ass.  I can totally free up that spell slot that I've always reserved for some kind of root spell.  <br />
<br />
Anyway if you guys get a chance to roll on this item, it's really great for a shaman and you should definitely try to get it if you have VT access.  <br />
<br />
There's a lot of lewt in that zone to turn the head and dazzle the eye, but IMHO this is one of the better pieces for our class.  <br />
<br />
My friend Mathi clued me into it as she's had hers for a while now.  She says she can perma-mez stuff by clicking it over and over.  <br />
<br />
I just don't know what's better, the effect, or the obviously uber stats.</div></div><hr />

Very nice Lan! Congrats!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can just imagine how usefull that would be, congrats =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For those without VT access, but access to at least one of HoH/BoT/CoD/Tactics/Torment (including through the 1-man key quests) ... our Ornate Chain pants are 3.0 second Greater Immobalize.  The stats are only a slight upgrade from SS pants, but that's not bad in and of itself, and the effect is quite remarkable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have the Scaled Avatar's Leggings, the rt click of Greater Immobilize (3.0secs) is almost as good as the previous effect of our 55shaman pet spell.<br />
Ive been perma-rooting mobs in HoH with ease, cc has become very easy with non-summoning mobs and the pants really shine in encounters like AD in PoV.<br />
<br />
&lt;EDIT&gt;: This is the first time a post Ive submitted has ever gotten through, usually I just get logged off as soon as I tried to submit a post. I had given up on posting but would give it a shot every once in awhile. Ive gleaned some useful knowledge from these boards for quite awhile and Im glad I can post now. So, hi to all you shaman in here and Im looking forward to finally being able to offer some info back, I hope)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hmm, root effect ring, awsome slow effect tunic, dot effect epic and dd effect bracer... what was it we needed mana for again? :)<br />
<br />
edit: grats btw )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grats on ring ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway i tried it a few times, and u get more resists then greater immobilize, last shorter, and a tad longer to cast. Funny at the beginning but i just gave up to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Keep losing rolls on those damned pants; that effect would be so amazingly handy.<br />
<br />
Congrats Lan =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Coralie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">there is a shield with Immobilze effect too on the Plane of Air<br />
<br />
it drop on the Zone in Island after you clean it from a trigered mob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm..I always thought the effect on ornate chain legging is Spirit of the howler? Or am I wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It was originally Spirit of the Howler (and elemental was originally True Spirit) but verant decided that was overpowering so now ornate is Greater Immobilize and elemental pants effect is Pox of Bertoxx, which are still nice effects, imho.<br />
That ring, regardless, kicks ass and since I dont YET have access to VT...Im a little jealous, just a little)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mazirus Slaymaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hey land, which mob drops the ring hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">very nice</div></div><hr />

hmm, root effect ring, awsome slow effect tunic, dot effect epic and dd effect bracer... what was it we needed mana for again? :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Pendant of Malosini has free malosini (in VT too), and elemental legs have free Pox of Bertox on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">but the free Malosini was 5.0 seconds cast time.  I highly value the fast cast of the real spell at the times I need to use Malosini.  Plus I already have a decent neckpiece from Burrower, so I have declined to roll on that item twice now.</div></div><hr />
