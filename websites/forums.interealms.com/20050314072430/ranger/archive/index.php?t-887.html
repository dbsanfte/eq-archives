Heard an announcement that the Sleeper was going down in an hour or so and that he would rampage through a few zones, including Skyshrine.  Had never been to Skyshrine so decided to make the run to see the big creep in person.  <br />
<br />
Survived first trip through Kael and WL, got lost in Skyshrine while KOS, and spent the rest of the evening dying 6 times making the CR from GD over and over.  Never did see that @#$@#$ Sleeper and his legendary zonewide AOE in person.</div></div><hr />

probably won't ever die on some servers.. zeks, rp(firiona vie? i forget), ab.  any server with enough decency to leave him up this long will leave him up for quite a while, barring what happened on Fennin.  and of course he'll never be woken on Legends.  :rolleyes:<br />

Im not going to go into the ordeal cause I don't know all the details and don't want to piss anyone off.  However, Visions did let him out.  Also could someone please tell me the relavence(sp) of waking him?  It does nothing to further the quest and nothing really happens to better the game after he is released so whats the point?  Killing AoW is a much harder accomplishment then doing all 4 warders unless you were one of the first 1-3 servers to wake him.  Unless something comes out with Planes of Power to further the script there isn't any reason to wake him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Er, yes you can. 3 named golems every 2 days can drop primal. Hell, my first ever trip to st i recieved a primal bow off the master of the guard:) Second trip down a warrior recieved a primal warsword off the master of the guard. Rogue froma nother guild has recieved a primal spear from one of the three. All this in the span of about a week or less. It's no where near is loot friendly as it was before the realese of said dragon. But, it is alot easier and Farm friendly.<br />
<br />
 The sadest thing i see about ST now is the fact that only primal and priceless weapons drop anymore. What about the non-melee classes? Essence scales you say? Hah, you really think that these ultra rare scale make up for any amount of farming or luck it takes to gain one scale? Let's not forget that they would have to give up there key to gain any essence items.<br />
   Wish they would have given more than just melee, avatar hungry,  players a reason to go to sleepers tomb that didn't require them to give up there key for there only shot at loot here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pandemonium cleared warders 1 2 and 4<br />
<br />
Veneration came in and killed 3rd (Only warder they ever killed)<br />
<br />
At the time that sleeper was wakened, We (Pandemonium) had 2 monk robes. <br />
<br />
1 week after sleeper was released the warders spawned again, of course we went and killed them asap. Why they respawned is because the ST script is not designed to make the Warders stop spawning. Instead, a GM has to manualy &quot;flag&quot; the zone after the sleeper has been released. <br />
<br />
When we went back there and killed them, the sleeper never did respawn, the bubble was always empty. We killed them according to spawns, 1 2 4, then 3<br />
<br />
The GM's found out that they had respawned while we were doing 3rd warder. After we killed 3rd, we looted the droppables and then the GM destroyed the corpse and repopped the entire zone. Only FA popped on us but it was still wrong. <br />
<br />
And btw, we got 2 robes off 4th warder after sleeper was released ^_~</div></div><hr />

Sorry to ask this, but as a lvl 35 what would you know about any ST encounters that would be enough to make such a statement about any guild?<br />
<br />
We left ST a long time ago cause we had gotten what we needed. Only until recently when we went back in to equip new members, we get flammed by other guilds because they think we are going back to wake the sleeper when in fact that wasnt our intention at all.</div></div><hr />

Sounded pretty aimed at me.  <br />
<br />
Also I did not assume anything about your guild, I based that statement on the fact that never once have I heard anything about you killing the 4th warder and I have been on the server communicating with our big guilds for nearly 2 years.  Obviously it is just not a matter of great importance to many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhinaz</div><div class="date">04-15-2002, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You've been on Xev for nearly 2 years and you haven't heard of Harm killing Ventani or what they've been doing?? Did you know they killed AoW awhile ago? If you did, then you should know that they can kill Vent...somehow I find that kinda strange that you don't know whats going on since you've been communicating. :p<br />
<br />
I've been gone for nearly a year and I still pretty much know what's going on....the only reason why I can think of it wouldn't be a matter of great importance to many is because its old news now, everythings been killed countless times before on other servers so people aren't as excited about it.<br />
<br />
Don't intend to criticize you but...really, if you aren't sure, then don't post...besides, it isn't that hard to do a little research. :p</div></div><hr />

Are you guys really this upset over my opinion?  No, I did not hear anything about them taking AoW or Ventani and yes I am in communication with most guilds including Dominion, Altera Vita, The Hand, Soverigns Might etc.  <br />
<br />
I think people need to check their egos and move on, you guys have totally blown one persons experience out of proportion and it is getting tiresome.  I come here for helpful information and a little fun, not to get drawn into childish bickering. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not really the egos, its just we, well I anyway, didn't want you to misrepresent our server, although I must admit, both you and Val did a fine job of doing that. ;)<br />
<br />
And plus, you saying that this wasn't your only character or whatever should mean that you know whats been going on if you had a 50+ character...its hard to not know whats going on when you're that high...that's all I'm saying. :D</div></div><hr />

There are even logs of one of the officers saying that they awoke him only to spite one of the other guilds on Xegony.  It was cool that most of the uber guilds on Xegony had let him sleep so that some of the other up and coming guilds could get a shot at the warders.  Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelitan</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard that this morning.  Not that RoT was looking to be doing ST anytime soon, but that's really a stupid thing to do.  Thanks, IC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fufinski</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sadly for us we have our first couple of ST keys and were in the process of geting keys for us all.  Currentl I expect to be in the first 30 and was looking forward to trying out the warders.  <br />
<br />
I am surprised at IC doing this becuase my general dealings with them had been good, but it is clear from the log that this was done out of pure spite. IC were not the only guild capable of waking the sleeper and I see no kudos in having acomplished it, rather I have more respect for the guilds that did not do it when they could.  <br />
<br />
It was however inevitable that one guild or another would have decided that their moment of self gratification was more important then the fun of many others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pointie</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know how many guilds have talked about waking the sleeper in the last month?  It was bound to happen when SoDs are being farmed to sell as gfay loot you know it has been asleep to long.  Anyhow it was fun and it was bound to happen anyway.  It was funny watching us all get DT'd so imho im glad I had the opportunity to join in the fun before another guild decided to do it.  <br />
<br />
  And to be honest half the guild is feeding off the flames lol.  Anyhow see ya all in game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eowen</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pointie, please don't use the &quot;gay loot&quot; issue as the reason you woke the sleeper.  You know as well as everyone else on Xegony that it's a blatant lie and it only shows your true colors, as well as your guild's.  You woke the sleeper as a stupid-ass vindictive move against TMC.  And don't make it seem like an  accomplishment because you weren't the first guild capable of awakening him, just the only one that has no respect for anyone else but themselves.  TMC already has 90% of their melee outfitted with Primal and they had no plans whatsoever of awakening him.<br />
<br />
Take it for what it's worth, but all the other high level guilds on Xegony have let the Sleeper lie and probably would have continued to do so making your &quot;bound to happen&quot; argument a load of crap.<br />
<br />
Yeah, see ya in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pointie</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol who said it was an acomplishment :P it was fun :) lots of people can kill warder 1.  We had 26 poeple there because we all wanted to see him die and see the sleeper wake up.  It was pretty amusing to watch.  Whatever the reason people are giving ie bakk's vendetta against TMC, I gave my opinion on why I wanted to watch the sleeper awoken.  Everyone is entitled to thier own opinions and mine is that the loot was worth little more than a fungi tunic on xegony these days which I truly believe it should not be.  <br />
<br />
  Like I said this is my opinion and Im glad myself and three other rangers in our guild got to be part of it.  So flame if you want its not the first time Ive been flamed and it hasn't stopped me from playing.  I started in march of 99 and I don't plan to stop anytime soon.  Have fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eowen</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I posted wasn't a flame and isn't intended to be one.  Everyone that's seen the logs knows that it was a &quot;vendetta&quot; and even people in IC admit that.  My post was simply pointing out that using the &quot;decreased value of velium weapons&quot; argument is total crap, end of discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pointie</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have no vindettas as i could care less what other people do in a GAME.  So its not a load of crap :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That quote really says it all.  To get a kick out of being flamed for ruining others fun shows a tremendous amout of maturity.  You set out to have fun at the expense of others, but sadly for you and Bakk all but maybe 2 TMC members have Primals.  So we are not the one's you hurt.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with guilds waking the Sleeper as an accomplishment.  But the guild on Xegony was not the first guild capable of doing it.  IC's only accomplishment was taking out the first and easiest Warder.<br />
<br />
They had an agreement with the other guilds &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to do it then when behind the backs of everyone and killed the only Warder up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Invoir</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is just a thought...but if a guild didn't want another to wake the Sleeper, could they not just send in all of their casters to chain dispell the MT? And then chain dispell/pillage whoever else tries to step up to take charge? This would make it really hard to kill anything. No C3, no Aeg.... I think this would be really low, but if it was a matter of waking the Sleeper or not...would it be worth it?  Would it work?  Just an idea....<br />
