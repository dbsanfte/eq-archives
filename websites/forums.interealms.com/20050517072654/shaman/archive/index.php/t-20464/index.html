<br />
Can anyone tell me what that program is, I can not find it on search, kinda helps to know it's name..<br />

Thanks,<br />

EQPlaynice... I believe teqim.sourceforge.net</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's not accurate though.  There's no program that can keep EQ from taking up memory.  It will still take up a lot of memory whether you're running EQPlayNice or not.  EQPlayNice forces EQ to better share the CPU time, and is most noticable on single-processor systems without hyperthreading.<br />
<br />
If you want to reduce the memory EQ uses, turn off Luclin models and enable compression.</div></div><hr />

i currenly have a sysem that i built from part, but i am no very conversant with all he latest hardware; soi have some questions.<br />
<br />
atmo sys has-<br />
1.3 duron proc. 2x 256k 133 dram. 64mb agp card.<br />
asrock k7vt2 mboard wih 266FSB.<br />
<br />
mherboard has 2 sdram and 2 DDR slots.<br />
<br />
was thinking of upgrading o 2x 512k ddr memory.<br />
<br />
hmmm lets go for the killer question.........if i put in 2 ddr 256k  memroy sicks, would i notics any difference........is DDR memory much of an improvemen over he old ype sdram???/<br />
<br />
hinking of geting a AMD 2k athlon........presumable i would noice a big difference here.<br />
<br />
i have been running 2 lots of eq on his machine....loading imes are sor of slow LOL.<br />
Hence the idea of upgrading......oherwise eq runs prey smoohly on he sysem. (don need o get broadband again soon)<br />
<br />
btw i am currenly ou of work, so money is tight, or i just go ou and buy a 3k mhz system pre built.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">only thing eq play nice does is takes cpu processing away from eq (eq is a processer hog )  eq will still run the same</div></div><hr />

Personally I think you need a new keyboard the T is broken on your current one :D<br />
<br />
Seriously though I doubt that you will notice that much of an improvement upgrading the ram, because you're not planing to get any more just a slightly faster amount. As you've not put the speed of the DDR ram that you are planning to buy, I'm guessing from your motherboard that it wont support/make use of any ram faster than 2700. (I could be way of base here) and the difference between SDRam and low end DDR (2700) isn't that great.<br />
<br />
I'd do two things.<br />
<br />
1. Run EQPlayNice as it will lessen the load on the CPU and will help you run 2 copies of EQ smoothly. I now use it to help me 2 box on one PC and I've noticed an improvement using it.<br />
<br />
2. Wait until the new graphics engine goes live - or try 2 boxing on the test server. The new graphics engine is supposed to shorten things like load, and zone times. I did think that the zone times were quicker on test but I never timed it, so I may have been mistaken.</div></div><hr />
