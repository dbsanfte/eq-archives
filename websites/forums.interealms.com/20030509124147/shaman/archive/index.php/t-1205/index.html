<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question...on *several* magelo profiles of people here at the crucible I see both a Fungi Tunic and a Fungus Covered Staff...which both have the same effect, if I understand correctly.<br />
<br />
Since they have the same effect they shouldn't stack...but I can't see why people would want both otherwise.  Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They do stack if I remember right.  Working with a staff is tricky.  I played with one ages ago (not mine) and if I recall, several things had to be done right.<br />
<br />
Fungal Regrowth will overwrite the regen line.  However, it will also overwrite sow as it modifies speed (forgot the %, but it's snare-like).  The trick is to have sow above regrowth, and it overwrites the top one.  This will work wearing a tunic.<br />
<br />
So, if I recall corectly, Tunic+staff+regen line all stack, but not with sow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And fungi tunic + staff stack as well, without shenanigans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Fungi Tunic is perm, you just have to wear it to get the effect.  Fungi Staff is right-click.  It's a buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye fungi tunic and staff stack just fine since one is an innate effect (tunic) and the other is a spell effect (staff). What doesn't stack with out tricks is the staff and other regular regen spells. (regen, chloro, regrowth). To get the staff to stack with these you need to cast the regular spell first and then click your staff but have sow in a buff slot before the regen so that the staff overwrites the sow instead of the regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They are in fact different spells with the same name. The Fungal Regrowth effect on the tunic doesn't have a snare component; the effect on the staff does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tevek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So you:<br />
<br />
wear fungi, innate regen, no prob.<br />
<br />
Cast sow on self.<br />
<br />
Cast Regrowth on self.<br />
<br />
Click stick, it overwrites sow.<br />
<br />
So you now have innate (sit/stand) + Fungi tunic + Regrowth + Fungi Staff + possibly AA regen.<br />
<br />
Ouch.<br />
