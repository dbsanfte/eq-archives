just an fyi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've watched awhile back of health updateing on the tick, then waiting a half tick, going back down and other goofy stuff.  Got myself killed awhile back from that one.<br />
<br />
Best thing to do though, don't cut it too close, I mean, why cut it close anyway?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have noticed this on my Zerker Alt but have not been playing Sion much since expansion.  What is odd is that it is most noticable after I have started Focused Will (3 tick regen).  <br />
<br />
If I understand everything correctly with this skill I should have a 4hp regen at tick standing (in an area where I could get sitting agro).  Looking at my bar with very low hp I was at 16, next tick 14, next tick 16 then 21.  There was no reason like a dot for the hp to decrease.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I like to do is stand in front of a large group of players (preferably my guild), /y a few times, say &quot;HEY WATCH THIS!&quot;, and then knock myself unconscious with canni5.<br />
<br />
It's really embarrassing when you do the math wrong and kill yourself though :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LMAO Jinheim :) I was in HOH not too long ago with a guild group, canni-ing away innocently. I like to canni to zero when I can, just cleric-training (omg it's hard to get the ladies not to panic) and lagged into the Canni 4 button. Hit it twice and promptly hit the floor dead, lol. I still haven't lived it down.<br />

<br />
Yes, this is the cause of the HP update bug.  The casino causes a lot of lag on the server because people love plunking down thousands of plat for some crappy stat food.  I don't know if they took the casino down again or not, but whenever it's up, it slows everything down.</div></div><hr />
