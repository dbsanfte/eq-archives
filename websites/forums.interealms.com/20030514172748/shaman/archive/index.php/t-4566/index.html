<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elihu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, my first EQ character was a shaman, but since then I have spent more time playing other characters, in particular a cleric, a beastlord, and a ranger.  Anyhow, when I think about playing my shaman nowadays, it seems like he's not very useful except in a full group of mostly melee types where he can buff them and cast DoTs a bit in the background and perhaps slow debuffing the mobs.<br />
<br />
Or to put it another way, if I were to be out with only one partner who was a tank type, it seems like my cleric would be much more effective in that role, whereas the shaman would heal much less effectively while mainly sitting on his duff, or alternatively would be a second rate fighter for the duration of the battle, after which there would be a long down time.<br />
<br />
I could see kiting _with_ a druid partner, adding my DoTs to theirs, and the druid doing the snaring, but I couldn't see much effectiveness in using this method as a soloer.<br />
<br />
So I am wondering what effective ways if any, you have found to use your shaman in something besides a full-group situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarnil MacDuff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Um, perhaps slow or debuff the mobs?<br />
<br />
Ok, first off, what level are you, that may stop the taunting and tesing :)<br />
<br />
But as a Cleric is Heals, a Shaman is Slows.  A slow of 75 percent is much more efficient than the cleric having to heal the whole time.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, just to get that out. No offense intended to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman is weaker on healing but the tank will be taking less damage. Both from direct causes like slow but also because it will die faster due to the warrior being hasted and the foe DoT'd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elihu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I played my Shaman to level 24 or so (my cleric to 50 and my beastlord to 32 so far), but I am thinking of restarting, because I made some very bad choices with initial character creation including 5 points or so into charisma, lol.  (I was a total newbie at the time).<br />
<br />
OK, yes, in theory, if you are able to slow the mob 50 or 75 percent, yes you won't need to heal as much.  However, that is assuming that the slow doesn't get resisted, which is not necessarily the case, especially with yellow and red mobs.  Heals, on the other hand, never get resisted.<br />
<br />
Also, in theory, I should be able to Malaise, then slow.  In practice, however, I found that Malaise got resisted a lot, and actually began using the disease debuff instead, followed by the disease DoT.<br />
<br />
I suppose part of the confusion is having to confine myself to 8 spells, and I end up not using spells that maybe I should be.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, it's been a long time since I've played my shaman, and I'm just looking for a strategy, if there is one, for shaman.  Not *where* to hunt as the strategy guides on this site emphasize.  I can find good places to hunt.  My difficulty is more in finding an effective way to play this kind of character, where he will shine, or if there is no effective way, to not waste the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm still learning myself. There is no doubt a cleric (or even a druid) heal better than we do outside of Torpor. I figure in a melee group if I can buff the melee, slow the foe, and should I have excess mana (ha!) drop a DoT or two i'm earning my place.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, having placed mostly melee, I sometimes feel guilty for sitting down and watching while the fight is underway, but I guess that's just part of the job.<br />
<br />
Now if there's a cleric and a chanter, especially one that slows, I begin to doubt my value to that party.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">just ask any melee class if they would rather partner with a cleric, druid or shaman. (shaman)<br />
<br />
ask an experienced tank your grouped with what he would like you to do.  (buff, slow and heal a little)<br />
<br />
shamans could possably be the most divers classes in the game.  pritty much anyway you play your shaman, with a little practice and adjustment, will work well.<br />
<br />
btw i just made 60 a day ago and i to put 5 points in to charisma to start with. i don't really think it matters that much lol. by the time you get all the gear u wish for all your stats will be maxed or buffed to max anyway.  still is pritty funny considering i can remember what i was thinking during the point allocation prosses.<br />
<br />
-the charismatic shaman-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think I know what you thought. Charisma was one of the green stats on character generation. I didnt fall for it though, I chose dexterity :)<br />
<br />
Elihu, the actual perception of people (at least in high level groups) is the other way round. And fighting against red mobs distort your perception. Our higher slows usually stick quite fine, especially if the mobs are tashed already. <br />
<br />
The most effective way for me was always to adapt to the other classes. The higher you get, the easier it becomes. The breaking point is Cannibalize with regeneration and the practice of Cannidancing (if one uses this practice). Once you get comfortable with regaining your mana during fights, you can start spending it in different ways as the situation warants.<br />
<br />
Try to keep up regneration all the time, try to get an Iksar Ceremonial BP, and get comfortable with balancing your Mana- and HP-bars (cannibalizing enough to get the use out of your regeneration but not too much to endanger you if you get aggro).<br />
<br />
The rest comes with spending that excess mana, but the first step is to make that mana almost instinctively :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>touk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am a lvl54 shammy and i have found a few things that work well for me that i will share.First my stats:<br />
ac 835 buffed <br />
Hp 1500 buffed<br />
wis 200 no buff<br />
<br />
<br />
         --------SPELL SETUP--------  <br />
       (only 8 slots to work with SIGH)<br />
<br />
1-Canni (Which ever you have,I never canni past 2bubs down if you do you run the risk of aggro as soon as you sit!  I canni every time my life bub jumps  until mana is at 90 then randomly also make a hot key for canni<br />
* see bellow*<br />
Remember you can canni while standing if worried about aggro. HAHA lets see any other caster get mana while standing or even better in battle.)<br />
<br />
2-SLOW <br />
( OMG this is the shammys role definings spell once you hit 51 your slow spell is the best in the game hands down with slow on a mob less damage is dished out so less heals also i next to never get a resist and if i do i cast again if still no then dot and heal)<br />
<br />
3-Wild card slot -REGEN,haste,buffs<br />
debuff( malis-cripple) BLIND (great spell if low mana and group looks bad blind let it run you root or run other way).lower dot spell<br />
<br />
4- DD<br />
 ( I may never use but its there)<br />
<br />
5-Posion DOT <br />
( NICE and fast dam stacks with lower posion dots also, I didnt figure that out until i was soloing IGs in EF at LVL49.<br />
<br />
6-Desease dot<br />
( good for soloing and long fightsor to toss on adds.ALSO stackes with posion dots and lower lvl desease dots)<br />
<br />
7- ROOT<br />
 ( best spell saved my butt and my groups from bad pulls more than once.This spell is massive aggro getter, So it can be very useful  if your main Caster ,Healer or even your tank is getting WHACKED so bad heals or DDs arent getting off you can take a few hits you have some melee skill use them if neededAND you have regen on RIGHT! plus those few hits that you take may save the whole group if it helps healer get heals off or chanter get a mez away. I use Enstill more mana but holds longer)<br />
<br />
8- HEAL ( Granted we are not clerics but I have been main healer for a few groups and we can do the job thx to canni. but this isnt what we shine at, but hey!)<br />
<br />
In a group we are buffers, healers (main or back up), debuffers and add pealers.<br />
<br />
<br />
 *******HOT KEYS eg\********<br />
<br />
CANNI hot key<br />
line one            /sit off<br />
line two           /cast 1 ( slot canni is is)<br />
line three        /pause 20<br />
 (this is to keep you standing for just a few more seconds so you will catch you natural mana regen tick)<br />
<br />
line four          /sit on<br />
line 5              gsay  Yum canni3 myself (optional  lotta spam)<br />
<br />
It will take a bit to get used to but you will hit canni button once you see mana or health line jump(natural)<br />
I have a hot key  for Heal Root Assist and SLOW this lets group know what you are doing at alll times.<br />
<br />
            ------Typical fight------<br />
ranger ranger pally warrior druid SHAMMY (Me)<br />
Basic fight with a add druid as main healer<br />
<br />

druid: gsay&gt;70m<br />
TANk : gsay&gt; OOM ( LOL)<br />
Me : gsay&gt; WOOT 70m GTG<br />
 <br />
AS you can see shamans are very effetive in a group.we play a very imortant role slow means less heals and less down times.<br />
<br />
I have left out a few things such as JBB DD not everyone has a JBB( GET ONE nothing like a 236dd mana free clicky clicky.)<br />
Hope this helps someone this is just what i do everyone has a different way of playing Have fun:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">A shaman + a cleric == one hot grind group.<br />
<br />
A shaman can sub for a cleric. Prior to 51, make sure you KEI that shaman (I've had warriors pay Ench's to KEI me in DL, knowing that my mana == their hp, real sweet of them :)).<br />
<br />
After 51, sup heal helps greatly in taking up the slack.<br />
<br />
However, a shaman can slow, a shaman can dot, a shaman can heal, a shaman can buff, but a shaman cannot do everything without hideous amounts of downtime. So the best thing to do is to get a proper well balanced group, and let the shaman make the warriors take on massivly slowed mobs with their massively buffed stats/hp/stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nitsujlak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At that low of level you are still in the sucky years of the shaman. Shamans dont really start showing their true power till oh about level 50 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Elihu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks for the tips.  I tried out hunting mammoths with a warrior partner yesterday, and I found that I hardly needed to heal him at all, even when he got an add.  I was able to let regen do the work of healing between fights while I medded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Once you get the pet and the 39 slow spell you will see how a shaman is able to enhance any party. Also, you noticed that regen can heal quite a bit. Take advantage of it. If you're a bit lom after a fight, don't blow all your mana healing the warrior back to full. After all, he's a warrior. Once at full health, he's good to go. You may not be though, which leads to some melees getting impatient and pulling anyway. Let regen top them off and med/canni-dance a bit to get some mana. I've played healer/buffer/slower my entire career. It can get a bit hectic at times, but it can be done. Don't sell the shaman short. A shaman is EVERY bit as effective at keeping people alive as a cleric. In many cases, more effective as we bring more than healing to our groups. That being said, I like having clerics around. I don't _really_ like being primary healer. I do it, but I don't always like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I hate being the main group healer, but it's possible for our class if only because we can slow the mobs.  (Slow does make a LOAD of difference)<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman are well known for their diversity of groups they can complete..  I've had groups of me, and 5 rogues, me and 3 rangers and 2 pally's..  list goes on.   We're also known for one of the most famous duo's, Monk/Shaman, but we can group with most ANY class in the game.   One of the most fun duo's I did was with an enchanter.  May not have been the most productive, but god it was fun  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I spend quite a bit of time either partnered with my warrior hubby or in a group with him and 4 of our tank buddies.  With them buffed and hasted, group regrowth on, and me pulling with slow, we seldom have to sit down for a med break unless I have to go afk. LOL  Like I said, I pull with slow and when I get up to the group/hubby, I stand there until he takes agro (usually get hit 2-3 times).  This also agros the dog in for supplemental dmg.  If it is a particularly nasty mob, I'll toss a cripple and a dot in there so we can keep our pace up.  Canni while the mob is preparing to meet his/her maker and I'm headed out for the next one when it gets down to 20% health left.  I might have to throw a heal on hubby after every 3 mobs but that's about it.<br />
<br />
I was doing this even before hubby and I hit 50.  Honestly I didn't really ever have a cleric in the group until I started raiding regularly.  But it was a very good way for me to learn the most mana efficient way to be healer, slower, buffer, and crowd control. :)<br />
<br />
Oh and most chanters that I have grouped with will have me do the slows for 2 reasons: 1) our slows are usually better (unless they are a higher level); 2) that frees them up for mezzes, tash, and such.  It also gives them a chance to play around with some of their spells they may not get to use a whole lot when a shaman isn't around. <br />
<br />
Remember the key to everything is to have the good guys fast and the bad guys slow :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">24 is an awkward level.  It's like being a teenager.  You're not an adult (no doggie) but you're not a kid anymore.  Wait till you get to 34 you'll see why we rock so much :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Originally posted by galelor <br />
shamans could possably be the most diverse classes in the game.<br />
<br />
This always annoys me when I see it.  I'd say shaman are about equal to druids in diversity (which is still fairly high).  Bards take the cake.<br />
<br />
Slow, haste, cap-break haste, regen, snare, dot, mana sieve, half-melee (instead of 1/4 like shaman ;) ), charm, mez, damage shield, selos, resist, ac, and stat debuffs and buffs, runes, stuns, manasongs, etc, and I'm sure I missed a thing or two.<br />
<br />
I'm not knocking shamans, of course, I'm just saying that they're definitely not the most diversely skilled class in the game.  <br />
<br />
Just wanted to poke at something that may be contributing to our class stagnation.  I twobox a shaman and bard btw (or will, once the bard is up to raid level and I get a comp that can handle raids.  :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The shamans role...SLOW.  Yes, enchanters can also slow, but they die REAL quick if they get aggro'd.  I group quite frequently with an enchanter friend and other friends, she speeds the tanks up and I slow the mobs down, works rather well, and she stays alive a lot longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Easy way for a two box bard and shammy to solo..<br />
<br />
either fear or .. use the mob teleport to spawn point song..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">You should be getting, now or soon, your first of two charm animals spells.  Start learning how to manage a pet.  Woofie'll be your companion for the rest of your career, and you have to get a handle on how he works.  He is your tank and he won't steal your xp anymore either :)<br />
<br />
Level 24 is very low level for a shaman, and they tend to be quite delicate at that age.  What -will- change your life is the Invis spell at level 29.  It allows you freedom of movement you never suspected heh.<br />
<br />
I should point out that shamans can solo Lodizal.  How many other classes can do that?<br />
<br />
At level 60, the shaman slows mobs 75%.  That means for every four hits you had to deal with before, only one lands.  On top of that, the shaman has the torpor spell, which is something on the order of 1200hp healed over 40 or so seconds.  In a group situation, you probably just saved your warrior's behind.  In a raid situation, you might have just saved the cleric's, who in turn saved the MT.<br />
<br />
Btw, ask any druid or cleric if they'd want the ability to cann.  I doubt you'd get a no.<br />
<br />
Before I hit 60, I used to think that the shaman was pretty cool.  Try it after 60.  It's sublime :)</div></div><hr />
