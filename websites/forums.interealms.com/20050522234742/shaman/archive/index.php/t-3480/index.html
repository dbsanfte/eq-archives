/agree <br />
Stay away from the Tigers and Sarnak Knights tend to be quite nasty. Stonegazer chickens are pretty mean too, they hit hard and fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At 35, you will want to be grouped ( unless you try soloing some cactus).<br />
<br />
Groups (lv. 30-40) tend to form up in three places, at least on Torv. :<br />
<br />
1)   &quot;the ledge&quot;, which is the side of the zone near the FM zone ( I forget if it is north wall or south wall),<br />
<br />
2)  the &quot;NW/SW corner&quot; (again forget which direction is north, hehe, but it is the corner away from outpost and away from WW zone side), and<br />
<br />
3)  &quot;Skyfire Ramp area&quot;.<br />
<br />
You will not have to worry about the DE guards, being a evil type, but your group mates may.<br />
<br />
I always prefered grouping in the corner group or by Skyfire.  Pretty easy to get a group there, very popular zone.  Loot is so-so.  <br />
<br />
Save any braids/tails you get from sarnak Bezerkers because evil types turn them in 4 at a time to the Skelly felkow at the outpost drilling the undead marines.  Once you get your faction to amiable by doing this quest ( turn in about 75 braids?), then you give a jade (storebought) to the foreman fellow and get a hammer that procs a port to OT at lv. 50.<br />
<br />
When in OT groups, try not to be put into the position of being the main healer in a chain pulling group, will only frustrate you :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Have fun!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">there are different 'sets' of mobs that you should know:<br />
<br />
around lvl 30, 1200ish hp:<br />
<br />
stoneleer cocks<br />
sarnak berzerkers<br />
thorny succulents<br />
sabretooth tigresses<br />
<br />
around lvl 35, 1500ish hp:<br />
<br />
stonegazer cocks<br />
sarnak knights<br />
spiked succulents<br />
<br />
and then there are the lvl 40ish tigers, much too hard.<br />
<br />
pull with slow and put scourge+ebreath on them and melee them down....it's a little hard, but just keep it up until you're lvl 39 with a great new slow and dot (togor's and vos). then you can try the lvl 35ish mobs (solo at least)</div></div><hr />
