<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ugh!<br />
<br />
I wish VI would give us a new bear form like they did wolfies. Sometimes bear form gets buggy and my lip disappears, which is very nice! <br />
<br />
Anyone else fed up with our lip? Is it really so hard to make us still look somewhat cute n cuddly without that lip? When it rains or snow stuff gets stuck in it...<br />
<br />
/feedback still hasn't yielded in any results :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Syklopz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">for a temp fix to that, put on like a leather cap and then cast bearform.  you should have a closed mouth.  when you lose bearform, you'll either show with no helm or leather look if you had a different one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree a new bear form would be cool. <br />
<br />
New animation would also be cool, you can't tell when you're sitting or standing. <br />
I think if our bear form looked somewhat like the Kodiaks in Great Divide, that would be slick, just different colors for each race. <br />
<br />
I personally don't want to look cute n cuddly, I want to look vicious and filled with bloodlust ! <br />
I like the idea of snow sticking to the fur though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not having a sit/stand animation is one big reason why I like being in bearform.  I also don't like the lip and still carry my newbie bearhead to remedy this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How about when we attack we stand on our hind legs and fight!<br />
<br />
That would be sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&lt;------ puts on a leather hat before transforming to get the cute bear face<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I look like Bubba Gump who just arrived in Viet Nam and is about to trip over a land mine with that lower lip (in Bear Form).  Oddly enough if not mistaken its the uper lip on a bear that sticks out like that, not lower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't want to be cute and cuddly, i want to look like i am about to rip out the throat of the next newbie beggar that comes along :).<br />
<br />
Although for canna dancing, the no sit/stand animation is nice, it is hard to tell if you are sitting or standing, and sometimes i forget to med :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The lack of a sitting animation in bear form is the very reason I don't use it. I don't have a &quot;Sit&quot; button up so I can't just look at it to see if I'm sitting. Plus I don't look like every other Shaman on the face of the planet running about in that newbie Luclin Bearform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use bear form for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
1. Wis bonus<br />
2. Regen bonus<br />
3. Infravision bonus<br />
4. Size bonus (ie i can fit in the bank in kelethin, etc)<br />
<br />
Although the sit/stand thing is annoying, the above benefits outweigh this for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Great Bear Paw in The Warrens is my dream bear form.<br />
<br />
At least make it the graphic for Rabid Bear!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Try casting a spell that will tell you if you are standing or not :)<br />
when my druid was in wolf form and in 1st person view i had some trouble with that one to</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I stopped using bear form the day the luclin version became available and norrath became infested with bears. Way to cheapen a spell VI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Julean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">- I'll try the leather cap thing, since more than 1 posted!<br />
<br />
- When I get bored I go into lesser bearform and run around qeynos hills...looking like a rabid bear<br />
<br />
- *edit* I just try to move and see if I'm sitting or standing. No one can usually tell if you're looting since you stay in the same stance the entire time.<br />
<br />
- *edit* Bear ice skating! Remove sow, duck and move around. Your feet don't move so it looks like you're gliding! Seems to work with run speed 1...may work higher as well.<br />
<br />
- It'd be nice if all form of the great bears were white.<br />
<br />
- I'd give up a 'cute and cuddly' look if it meant losing my lip.<br />
<br />
Bottom line...no one can resist our free bear rides :)<br />
<br />
In the words of Stitch from Lilo and Stitch -- &quot;Don't forget FLUFFFFFY!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Dont wanna be no wussy white girly bear - us trolls are hulking great black bears and I like it like that :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I only use bear form when I want the extra wisdom to work on skills. I am a fighting Shaman and when I am in bear form and fighting it makes me sea sick. This is one of the stupidest graphics I have ever seen. Why do they have to use that crazy movement every time I swing a weapon?? I would love to use this form all the time in indoor zones but cant stand the movement. Don't know what kind of drugs the person was on when they designed this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There are actually 3 different bear faces you can get:<br />
<br />
1.  Lip bear - plate helm (JB, Totemic, Velious)<br />
2.  Narrow face bear - leather cap, including Spirit Talker's Helm from DN<br />
3.  Smiley bear - chain helm (banded works, also that thingy that drops in Permafrost, forgot the name).<br />
<br />
My personal favorite is Smiley bear.  All the woodelf chicks go wild over it.<br />
<br />
By the way, you can swap helms back after you cast and you get to keep the face.</div></div><hr />
