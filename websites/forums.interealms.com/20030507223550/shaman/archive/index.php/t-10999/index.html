<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so my college network has been very crappy for the past couple of days, and having not much to do, I was playing around with a magelo...<br />
<br />
So, I made this guy to be all he can be.  He doesn't have the max hp, which is somewhere at 5100 hp, but his gear is such that he's makes up for it in other ways.  Any of you have suggestions (lots of us screw around with these things, give me your inputs) on how to make him even more better than what he is now?  Assume he won't have buffs from other classes, ie he is self buffed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, you know how much time it would take to get all that?  starting from where you are?  Wow, heh.  Like 1 year of solid raiding in the elemental planes and VT.  And raiding like every day at that!  <br />
<br />
Hmm, I predict someone getting 5k hps unbuffed shortly.  It's been a while now that people have been in the elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The top 23 listed on our little shammy list all have over 5K unbuffed.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Quthack Frostrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Howler, I just have one question for you, are you a shaman or a ranger?  I have been working hard at finding the right balance for me at least between hp, ac, and wis.  With the equipment you have chosen, sure you have hp, but you will fight like a mid level character and cast like a low level shaman.  Of course this is my opinion and really doesn't relate to how you chose to play, but with what you have, I would consider my character useless.  Just my opinion though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hehe, my main is a ranger on Sullon Zek.  Play a shaman on E'ci for when I get cc'd or somethink like it.  The profile I posted was the long term one, not my main ;)  The stuff I just tossed in for my main was just junk I had left over on E'ci.<br />
<br />
As far as the gear I have on my main, Quth you're kind of mislead.  Took my shaman to 40 in about 2 days game play of soloing.  Which is where he sits at the moment.  If my shaman was a lvl 65, might agree with you, but he's just a lvl 40 twink atm.<br />
<br />
Anyways, bruin i chose the vah shir talisman over your neck wish list simply because of the comprehensive mana-hp regen, and resists.  I didn't think 20 hp and 5 mr|fr|cr was worth sacrificing 8 hp regen/ds and 20 dr|pr.  I tend to look at things with a greater emphasis on resists, so that might be why.<br />
<br />
Also, I chose the shawl over your moss mantle simple for the mana regen.  Tried to look at it as if I wouldn't be able to go out with tranquility|kei everytime.  The crown is for the extra tick of torpor and what not.<br />
<br />
Any more ideas?</div></div><hr />
