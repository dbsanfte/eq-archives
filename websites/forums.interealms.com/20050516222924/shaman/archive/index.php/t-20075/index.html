&lt;BR&gt;You are Strong.<br />
&lt;BR&gt;Though you can be stubborn at times, you stick to your guns when you feel<br />
&lt;br&gt;strongly about something.<br />
&lt;BR&gt;You are protective of those you love, and will defend them at all costs.<br />
&lt;BR&gt;You are cocky, but you do have peoples best interests in mind.<br />

Which is interesting, because originally Rathelon was a warrior before I rerolled as a shaman. And, I also have a 59 dwarf warrior.</div></div><hr />

&lt;BR&gt;It is not hard for you to convince others to agree with you. <br />
&lt;BR&gt;A politician at heart, you can be greedy for power at times. <br />

Life without you around would be boring.  <br />
&lt;BR&gt;You are fun to be around and usually happy to lend a helping hand.  <br />
&lt;br&gt;One word describes you.  <br />
&lt;BR&gt;Chipper.  <br />
&lt;BR&gt;When you are in a good mood, those around you usually are too.  <br />
&lt;BR&gt;Oh, did I mention that you like to dance?&lt;BR&gt;<br />

I can take orders, or I can give them. It all depends on the situation<br />

&lt;BR&gt;You are a good friend.  <br />
&lt;BR&gt;When you find somebody that you care about, you will do anything for them.<br />
&lt;br&gt;Your views tend to remain very traditional, and some may say that you have a hard time adapting to change.  <br />
&lt;BR&gt;You find comfort in spirituality and you love animals.  <br />

&lt;BR&gt;You are kind and gentle.  <br />
&lt;BR&gt;You love Nature and all of its inhabitants.  <br />
&lt;BR&gt;With the possible exception of Man. <br />
&lt;br&gt;You can be a little selfish at times towards natures enemy, Man.<br />
&lt;BR&gt;However, if there is an animal in need of help, you are the first to respond<br />
&lt;BR&gt;Join PETA, my friend. <br />

&lt;BR&gt;You are Strong.<br />
&lt;BR&gt;Though you can be stubborn at times, you stick to your guns when you feel<br />
&lt;br&gt;strongly about something.<br />
&lt;BR&gt;You are protective of those you love, and will defend them at all costs.<br />
&lt;BR&gt;You are cocky, but you do have peoples best interests in mind.<br />
