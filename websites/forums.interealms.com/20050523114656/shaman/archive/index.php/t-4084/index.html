<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A ****wit named kane.Zanasbusie has decided to make it his personal crusade to eliminate the crucible channel and get everyone to move to serverwide.shaman:shaman.<br />
<br />
He has obtained moderator status for serverwide.crucible and has blocked other people from sending messages to it. When you join, he sends you a message telling you to join serverwide.shaman instead.</div></div><hr />

Reminds me of IRC.  I almost forgot why I stay out of IRC.  Thank you, Zanasbusie, for reminding me.  /bird</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No idea if thats what he's doing or not, but he told me he wasn't able to unmoderate the channel...which I know he can as a mod.  Can we find out which shaman actually has the owner tag? all that guy has to do is log in and unmoderate it and kick him out.<br />
<br />
Apparently its in retaliation for someone changing the password on the serverwide.shaman channel.  Nice to see he has enough class to make a fool of himself. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh, I love the Crucible channel!<br />
<br />
I won't be on tonight (going to see a play for my boyfriend's birthday) but if we still don't have control, let's just join serverwide.crucible1 or some such.<br />
<br />
I will never join the serverwide.shaman channel, I'm protesting!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep, this pretty much guarantees that serverwide.shaman is going to die.  <br />
<br />
I wonder if this dumbass did this with his main character?  Paying plat on Ayonae for trains on Kane.Zanasbusie!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im with Gloriana.. I like serverwide.crucible because its crucible posters. I dont want to talk to joe shaman and have 5000 people in a serverwide.shaman channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He finally left and the channel is mostly back to normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hah -- was just in the channel listening to this person preach. It seems that he/she doesn't read the crucible but was upset about someone hijacking serverwide.shaman earlier. <br />
<br />
I had been autojoining both just because I think more shaman newbs tend to join the serverwide.shaman:shaman channel. I like to help newbs and because sometimes the spam of the larger channel was too much when in a difficult raid or xp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goodberry</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How do I join the crucible channel? I am kinda a n00b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">:)<br />
<br />
;join serverwide.crucible : crucible<br />
<br />
If you would like to send interserver tells, the command is:<br />
<br />
;tell firstpartofservername.person hiya<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
;tell terris.henora <br />
;tell luclin.arriana<br />
<br />
R doesn't work for reply, so it's almost easier just to create a channel to talk to a single person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just a small note, he may not be fully guilty.  Last night our raid channel became moderated and we couldn't get it unmoderated for a while, no one admitted to moderating it and very few even knew how.  I was able to talk in several of my private channels but messages to the raid channel were blocked.  My friends had some similar issues.<br />
<br />
Of course, I still won't join serverwide.shaman.  I like recognizing names off of here when I get to log into cruicible :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">kane.Zanasbusie actually sent me a tell in game asking me to join serverwide.shaman(s). I joined, was like 2 people there. I told him to rather join crucible. Guess he did :/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Zanasbusie was making a rather public statement of his annoyance that someone changed the password on serverwide.shamans to crucible, so he got ops on the severwide.crucible channel and started kicking, moderating and making a scene while occasionally stating that he would never have been there if nobody had changed the password on serverwide.shamans.<br />
<br />
The best way around any channel hijaaking, as I told him is having access to a good oplist and a channel owner that is frequently online. Use ;help to find out more about these commands if you haven't before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Gee, I created serverwide.finaljustice:isthegreatestshammyiwannabejustlikehim and for some reason it's not the most popular channel on EQ!<br />

<br />
Selective memory much? What was said was that non-shaman wouldn't attempt to get into these channels and fuxxor them up. The dispute that's detailed in this thread happened because someone from the crucible decided to be a dick to the people in serverwide.shaman. Then someone from serverwide.shaman decided to be a dick back to serverwide.crucible.<br />
<br />
It was all shaman, and it was stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&quot;someone from the crucible decided to be a dick to the people &quot;<br />
<br />
Either that or someone just decided to be a dick in general.  Could have easily been some dr00d who comes here decided to stir up some ****.<br />
<br />
That dip**** gimp on Kane fell for it quite handily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Proof that it was a serverwide.crucible individual who messed with the serverwide.shaman channel?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Final word is...<br />
<br />
crucible channel got bombed by an &quot;outsider.&quot;  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Gloriana, <br />
<br />
I was on both channels and saw people from the crucible dropping in on serverwide.shaman and spouting stuff like this: <br />
<br />
[Tue Jul 30 17:09:18 2002] karana.Galgor tells serverwide.shaman:1, 'Ditch this channel and come to serverwide.crucible:crucible    =)<br />
<br />
There's your &quot;motive&quot; for locking serverwide.shaman with a password of &quot;crucible.&quot; If you really believe that some druid haxxored the channel to turn the Shaman community against eachother you're being naiive. The motive for this stupidity is right here at home.<br />
<br />
Petty and inane acts by both parties.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">&quot;[Tue Jul 30 17:09:18 2002] karana.Galgor tells serverwide.shaman:1, 'Ditch this channel and come to serverwide.crucible:crucible =) &quot;<br />
<br />
That looks like good natured ribbing to me.<br />
<br />
Frankly soupy, you seem to have been taking the whole thing quite personally.  Might want to take a walk and get some perspective.<br />
<br />
I'm not basing that just on the posts here, when I chatted with you in game in the shaman channel you seemed pretty torqued about the crucible channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I like how we have a crucible channel instead of a &quot;shamans&quot; channel.  It means that the shmucks from other classes who want to join and ask stupid questions and generally annoy us cause they got something against shamans . . . can't.   Or at least find it much harder to do so.  &quot;crucible&quot; isn't such a known name outside the shaman community.  I'd rather chat with you people than with people i've never heard of and will never meet anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Same here,<br />
<br />
Joined up tonight on serverwide.crucible, great chat channel... just like the board :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Any way to autojoin serverwide.crucible? ...it's so long to type every time I log on, and I'm a lazy troll somedays ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">just create an hotbutton :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Nochnaya Zhara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">/autojoin serverwide.crucible:crucible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kossaxel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">anyway to Un-autojoin a channel?<br />
<br />
say like...if you were a dumbass and entered the wrong PW for crucible :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">redo the /autojoin correctly, it should replace the entry.<br />
<br />
[research]<br />
<br />
could also add this line (or edit it) in your eqclient.ini<br />
<br />
ChannelAutoJoin=serverwide.crucible:crucible<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kossaxel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">cool thanks Gorck,  that fixed it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Thanks, I went the eqclient.ini way and that worked fine... should've thought about that myself... heh<br />
<br />
;autojoin was not accepted as a command, and /autojoin didn't work for serverwide channels or something the like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Gorck Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">no prob, glad to help</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Amazing, 486,000 subscribers and it only takes one person to ruin it for everyone. This reminds me of why GM's can be cynical, consider the people like this person that they have to deal with.</div></div><hr />
