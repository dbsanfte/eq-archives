Current Number One Issue from each class board, in bullet form:<br />
<br />
BRD: More over all items with modifiers (weapons and instruments)<br />
BST: Raise all beastlord skill caps up to 250 just like HtH is currently.<br />
BER: WarCry is a mess… currently the haste component is broken, it blocks other classes’ discs, and it uses WAY too much endurance.<br />
CLR: please fix our broken and overpriced aa's - turn undead, divine avatar<br />
DRU: Improve our healing abilities<br />
ENC: Reduce npc immunity to spells such as mez, charm, stun and pacify<br />

WIZ: Manaburn: entire mana bar for 9k damage in 5 seconds vs Ancient Strike of Chaos, 8k, &lt; 1 bubble of mana, 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
Current FIXED Issues from each Class:<br />
<br />
BRD: None<br />
BST: None<br />
BER: Resists on all 3 of our abilities (snare/stun/de-aggro) are way too high, they are currently resisted around 70% of the time<br />

MAG: Improved Damage shield<br />
MNK: The Weight of Gates of Discord Monk armors is extremely high.<br />

Might as well, they have enough to do without swapping gear constantly. <br />
<br />
BST: Raise all beastlord skill caps up to 250 just like HtH is currently.<br />
<br />
So since they already better then shaman they want to be better then monks too? <br />
<br />
BER: WarCry is a mess… currently the haste component is broken, it blocks other classes’ discs, and it uses WAY too much endurance.<br />
Still not sure what a berserker is supposed to do. <br />
<br />
CLR (65): please fix our broken and overpriced aa's - turn undead, divine avatar<br />
Agree with that<br />
<br />
DRU (64): Improve our healing abilities<br />
Tied with shaman problems in keeping up with dps<br />
<br />
ENC (65): Reduce npc immunity to spells such as mez, charm, stun and pacify<br />
Too many mobs are immune to mez and stun, that is what I think enchanters primary jobs are. Charm is still overpowered and pacify has always been a cheap ability as it is. <br />
<br />
MAG (65): Improve pet damage output<br />
Definately<br />
<br />
MNK (65): Monk mitigation<br />
Way past due to be fixed<br />
<br />
NEC: Increase DoT crit percentage for necros to better balance against other classes nukes<br />
Shaman and necro should get minor innate dot crits just like wizzies get innate nuke crits<br />
<br />
PAL (60): Better Mitigation<br />
Would be nice, but if they want to tank better their spells need tweaking.  Balancing hybrids is a bitch. <br />
<br />
RGR: Increase DPS<br />
I've heard they several lose their dps edge post elementals, but this is one class I don't really know that much about personally. <br />
<br />
ROG: Add a better way to drag a corpse<br />
OMG please, I did some CR's using a guild rog a while ago and it sucked<br />
<br />
SHD: Knight tanking is too far behind Warriors and too close to non tanking classes.<br />
Could use improvements just like pally, but should come at a cost of spell versitility in omens<br />
<br />
SHM (65): Fix Shaman healing!<br />
Yah, or fix slow but do something <br />
<br />
WAR: balance bash damage to the weapon<br />
Another class I don't really know so no comment<br />
<br />
WIZ: Manaburn: entire mana bar for 9k damage in 5 seconds vs Ancient Strike of Chaos, 8k, &lt; 1 bubble of mana, 6 seconds.<br />
Manaburn was gimped and then run over by a mac truck. Put it back to its original damange but leave the 1 per min limitations in and leave it the way it is for PvP.</div></div><hr />

You lose at reading.  That's what the devs have done for monks.  Monks obviously want their mitigation back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll bet dollars to donuts less than 3 of the 15 classes # 1 requests get fixed.  And none seem THAT overpowering.<br />
<br />
Oh and look how many 'nones' are on the list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Slein Jinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Note that the order of the points on the list isn't significant, so just taking the first point isn't going to give you an accurate picture of the problem, not to mention that for many classes, there are related issues across multiple points.  <br />
<br />
Really, that list is too limited and shallow to be of any real use.  <br />
<br />
Shadowknights, for example, have two severe (closely related) tanking issues - one in relation to warriors, and one in relation to pallys.  Limiting our tanking defeciency to a comparison with warriors will really sell SK's short in the end, as we have nothing to compare with the power of stuns.  <br />
<br />
SK's need something to bring them up to par with stuns, and then both knights need something to bring them into line with warriors and create separation from the non-tanking classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shadowknights need a Short term Fear2 effect that generated aggro out the wazzoo to take the place of the terrors. (Easy add Fear 2 stun to the terror line. And add a couple More to the line itself. Same limitations and level effects as paladin.) Then nerf the hell out of Any Non effecting Low level aggro gen spells like cease Desist and fear on level55+ mobs. Holdig unshakable aggro should cost mana. To the expense of DPS. Burst aggro sure. Go for it But make mana cost be the limiting factor again. If you want unshakable mana free aggro then invest in a Aggro weapon. Like warriors have to as well.<br />
<br />
Then for both sets of knights a 12-18 second Disc of riposete added for the untankable oh **** factors. High Useage cost and Very high Upkeep cost for it. If burning the Rip disc then Leechcurse and or unholy touch should be pretty damn rare unless the best End Knights are around.<br />

<br />
aside from off tanking, pallies have stuns and heals, both of which are huge and obvious benefits. SKs can snare, nuke (ht), and pull.<br />
<br />
if they balanced SK tanking to wars, wars would be screwed. while their dps is better, they have none of the 'extras' (fd, summon corpse, snare, lifetaps, mana taps, harm touch/leech touch, etc) that make SKs unique and desirable.</div></div><hr />

Isn't that a bight narrowminded comment? The bst suffer (ok ok, suffer might be a too strong word ;) ) from a lack of choices in weapon selection since their h2h cap 25 points higher than their 1hb and 2hb so they are limited in their choices of weapon if they want to perform up to their best.</div></div><hr />

I agree the beast class is one thats on the more overpowered side atm. I however don't see how that makes them better than monks... Hand to Hand weapons usualy have a better damage to delay raito than 1hb, 2hb and piercing weapons. The only reason they (my beast included) want the cap raised on the other skills is so they have more selection for weapons. The other way to fix this would be to just add a lot more elemental level HtH weapons that beastlods / monks can use.</div></div><hr />

Maybe... but I don't get it. We were told to prioritize our list; were the other classes not given the same direction?</div></div><hr />

Some of the Correspondents were more &quot;proactive&quot; than others.  Some classes have lesser &quot;needs&quot; than others and therefore priorities aren't as important.<br />
<br />
Yes, everyone had the opportunity to prioritize their list.  No, not everyone did.</div></div><hr />

I personally would rather see them add more h2h weapons myself for monks and beast because it makes sense for the classes. <br />
<br />
However, since thats not all that likely to happen (or would be poorly implemented) I guess raising the stat caps would be the only other possibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It is sort of misleading to say that shm got no fixes when obviously the regen increase helped (at least a little) bit, and HoT's were increased a bit, although that isn't really what was needed for being able to burst heal 1k+ hitters after a slow resist.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should have a list of multiple class fixes that includes things such as the debuff limitation and the regen increase and even damage shield increase (dru/mag).<br />
<br />
How is removal of augments a warrior fix?  That really confuses me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Fixes and improvements are two different things.<br />
<br />
Sure, our HoT's and Regens were improved . . . but they weren't broken to begin with, therefore, not fixed.<br />
<br />
Do the regens and HoT's improvements help us heal in BoT?  You bet they do . . . but we could already do that.<br />
<br />
I'll still say that we haven't received any fixes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The lists were originally wholly done by the Sony CS folks (Ashlanne, Brenlo, Kytherea); the updates are being coordinated by the class reps.  Everything got ranked pretty close to the class polls, but not everything got written up in the best way.  Heck, most got written up poorly.  Necromancers, for example, wanted the Screaming Terror spell line extended beyond level 55.  What got written up?  &quot;Upgrade Screaming Terror to effect mobs above level 55.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Of course, now that it was written up as &quot;Upgrade Screaming Terror&quot; you have a bunch of folks who now say that's what they want instead of what they originally asked for, which was a high end mez.  Baaa Baaaa Baaaa.<br />
<br />
As another point in case, the &quot;leather armor&quot; thing got mangled by the Sony rep; the item as listed wasn't the item as requested.  Monks wanted more diversity in armors, or a turn-in guy they could use to change leather into robes into monk straps.  As it stands now we all look like human druids.  What takes it from annoying to abso-****ing-lutely ludicrious is that the devs didn't do anything on monk-usable items when they tagged it as &quot;done.&quot;  They added a robe turn in guy for the brain trust crowd, so enchanters and their ilk could get a leather graphic on some items that otherwise didn't show up.  From reading the boards, this was primarily for people when under an illusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think that a lot of what folks are asking for is kind of silly myself but I guess everyone has a &quot;Grass is Greener&quot; feel to their class.

<br />
if you want to tank end content mobs, play a warrior. <br />
<br />
Their problem isnt with &quot;end content mobs&quot;.  It's with the fact that even getting through Gates, SK are SO gimp compaired to warriors.  In Gates there are a few big mean named fights per trial and warriors have defensive discs to get them through where SK have no disc that would make a difference.<br />
<br />
PoP/EP Raid equipped SK get smoked through Gates trials while bazaar geared warriors can do it due to defensive.  The leechcurse and HT/Life tap AA just dont do enough to balance out the difference there.<br />
<br />
Is anyone that wants to do Gates supposed to wait and hope that there is a warrior and 2 clerics just sitting around doing nothing to head in?<br />
<br />
SKs and Pallys are the best off-tanks in the game, and play other roles beside just playing main tank. <br />
<br />
They are the only other Plate melee :) could you imagine the uproar if Rogues or Rangers could off tank better? :)<br />
<br />
if they balanced SK tanking to wars, wars would be screwed. while their dps is better, they have none of the 'extras' (fd, summon corpse, snare, lifetaps, mana taps, harm touch/leech touch, etc) that make SKs unique and desirable.<br />
<br />
SK arent asking to tank as well as warriors.... though they should.  Remember back in the day when Warriors vs. SK/Paly was a matter of Warriors took less damage but couldnt hold agro as well?  <br />
<br />
What a lot of people are forgetting is that there is no such thing as a pure melee any more... every class is a hybrid!  Warriors cast Enrage (warrior taunt or what ever) that  uses endurance (mana?) and actually works (unlike the way they nerfed SK agro spells).<br />
<br />
I agree that SK have a lot to offer to a group... but what is the point of taking one if the best equiped SK cant stand up to what isnt supposed to be end level content?<br />
<br />
I just hope each class gets to a point that they are happy and can play the game.  The thing that sucks is that right now Shaman arent needed for Gates because you have to have 2 clerics and a chanter.  SK/Paly arent needed because their &quot;utility&quot; isnt what's needed, the only utility neededis to not die and warriors are the only ones that can do it.</div></div><hr />

Yes this was semi true when the ikkiniz bosses were unslowable. However since the mid-june patches shaman are now a viable group member there. I beat ikkiniz 7-9 with war/rng/rog/clr/bard/shm all EP geared and solid aa. (edit: for 8 we did 2 cleric 2 war sham rogue)<br />

I'm sorry that just simply isn't true. Especially since the last round of changes verant made to the trials. If you missed it defensive, evasive and stone wall now act like DA spells and drop you to the bottom of the aggro list on the kyv heart striker, PA and DD which where really the only mobs where hybrids had tanking any way. Any bazaar geared warrior who uses defensive on those mobs just ensures they are going to wipe quickly rather than slowly because they don't have a viable tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I thought there was only one or two mobs that the defensive dropping you from the agro list happened.  If it's more I'm sorry I was mistaken.  I don't group with warriors much since my brother is a SK so I just kind of see things from his point of view :)<br />
<br />
I do know that even though with group buffs he's at 8700hp and 1900 to 2020AC (due to their AC tap spell) and he got ROLLED over by a named in Vxed.  And that was after landing slow...  Mob was charging in, I landed slow, snare was resisted, pummeled SK down to almost dead, he fires off his HT life tap (max AAs into it is a 2k life tap) cleric lands a quick heal and pulls agro (YAY SOE for fixing SK agro spells!) Cleric is beat down to 10% in one round, my heal lands on cleric (now up to 40% YAY SOE for shaman heals!), SK gets agro and promptly dies as cleric and shaman heal land on corpse, cleric gets a free trans to bind w/o his gear, then mob killed me in one round, mop then proceeds to kill the rest of the group.  Entire fight... maybe 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
SK do just fine on the trash mobs in there even.  We had zero problems with healing and mana the entire time in there... it was just on the named that he got bowled over.  SK really are just looking for some sort of 1 per hour even disc that will let them stand up almost as well as a warrior so we dont doink our entire run due to not having a warrior with us :/<br />
<br />
Grogbat:<br />
I still think that groups would rather have just about anyone other than shaman even with the change to being able to slow bosses.  That chanter or BL bring more to the table than we do other than slow :/  I just wish we seemed to bring something special right now that would make us really desireable on these Gates runs.</div></div><hr />
