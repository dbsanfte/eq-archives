<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Utherwayn Leafwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well right now I stand before a quandry.  Level 56 ranger, I can solo blues with reasonable effectivness.  This is really just a how can I improve my tactics thread.  here is what I do.<br />
<br />
With my current heal : Healing, I've found that I can cast it perfectly in between swings of my swarmcaller so I swing, heal swing heal and that gives me a large percentage more of HP.  The first thing that comes to mind with all the buffs I've been casting lately is that I need more wisdom gear and I can find that on my own *hugs his allakhazams premium membership*.  However here comes the problem, I hit 57 and I get a new more efficient heal but it takes longer to cast and more mana.  Until EndQ I dont really see bow kiting as plausible, I've thought about using DD's instead and I could see that happening with calefaction maybe but not with firestrike or call of flames.<br />
<br />
Currently self buffed I have:<br />
2100 HP<br />
988 AC<br />
1145 ATK<br />
I am a level 56 ranger.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions other than more wis gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Andruil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Soloing is all about conservation.  Given that it's expensive as it can be, I would suggest getting a fungi (or other regen item) and an Obulous Death Shroud (sp?).  As someone who does a lot of bow soloing now, I've also found that my horse is a blessing for the shoot while medding effect.  I suppose any item that adds to your healing or DoT damage would be a good thing as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Utherwayn Leafwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I actually dont ues dots heh, waste of mana =), regen item is something I was thinking about though that would be nice.</div></div><hr />
