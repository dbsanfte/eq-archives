<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, lvl 47 Shaman here.  I regularly duo with a buddy of mine who is a lvl 56 Druid.  We go to PoD and charm kill, using my buffs, slow and incapacitate to help the charmed pet survive against the mobs.  This has worked very well for us, perhaps too well.<br />
<br />
By that I mean that my Druid friend, and the Bards I see in the zone, are charm killing or kiting, usually multiple mobs, and most of the time at little risk to them and with very little mana expenditure.<br />
<br />
Sure, I realize that the charm does break, but with a snared mob and a sow+ speed character, the chance that you will take bodily harm is minimal, in the right location, using good tactics.  Seems like a very easy way to earn exp, I now know why Druids are such good solo'ers.  Don't even mention the dreaded quad-kite.  AE snare, DoTs and DDs seem are very efficient.<br />
<br />
My question is, how does a Shaman solo in PoD or any other low level plane with the tools and tactics we have at our disposal.  Granted, by the time I reach lvl 56 I'll have much better spells, and maybe even better equipment, however, root/rot with dog dog against a mob with 20k hp will take a while and require a lot of mana.<br />
<br />
How do you high level Shaman do it at a decent pace?  I have some ideas, but I really want to hear from the guys doing it.  Any advice/guidance is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I never found soloing to be all that effective of a leveling method.  I am not a big solo player anyway, basically its only something I do when I am really bored or just want to try something crazy.<br />
<br />
Anyway.. at level 47 I just dont see you being able to solo anything effectively in PoP.  You cant kill fast enough because you dont have the spells yet.  The mobs are going to be red cons or yellows in most cases at least and youll have problem sticking spells because of that.  I would suggest, if your set on soloing  going to other zones.  Scarlet Desert might not be bad lots of mobs for that level range.  <br />
<br />
Solo Tactics are pretty much the same, i stick a resist debuff, slow, root, send in doggy (buffed and hasted), dot, re-root as necessary, heal pet.  You could tank too depending on how hard the mob hits and how much hps you have and keep stoicsim up to heal yourself, but being snared and slowed might not make that worth it.<br />
<br />
I still recommend just finding a group though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pull with malos, then root it.  Slow it, then apply any other debuffs you need (malosinia, malicious decay).  Apply dots.  Sit there and wait.<br />
<br />
If you are soloing somewhere easier that pofire, pull a second mob and do to at once.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much all there is to shaman soloing.  We might not solo as fast as other classes, but we never have downtime, and we are very hard to kill in comparison to a wizard, druid, or chanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In the lower to upper 50's you're better off soloing someplace like katta where you can kill 4 or 5 mobs in the time it would take you to kill one in PoP. Once you hit 59 or so though PoP really is the only place to go imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only place you might be able to solo at 47 would be PoJ, rats and prisoners.  At 57 in PoD my record against rats was pretty dismal, I died or zoned almost half the time due to adds, trains, or spells that just wouldn't stick.  I still came out ahead on XP but the time spent just wasn't worth it compared to soloing outside of POP or grouping inside POP.<br />
<br />
Try Veksar, it should be excellent XP at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK, from the feedback so far, I guess my suspicions were correct.  We can solo effectively, with very little down-time, just not as quickly as a Druid (or other class that can kite/charm).<br />
<br />
Also, thank you for the advice on where to go at mid-high 50's, makes a lot of sense.  Just wondering how good the exp is someplace like Katta compared to exp in PoD?  Does the ease and number of kills make up for the difference in exp/kill?  I strongly suspect it does.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all the veterans who took time to help a noob 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Umm... You started this thread at level 47... and you are ending it at level 46?<br />
<br />
You going the wrong way man! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if your level 50-54, and you have good Skyshrine faction, go kill chickens in CS. if you dont have the faction head to kael, grind at the mobs in the zone in, mebbe tag along with a group headed in deeper untill you do have the faction, and then head to CS. if you want to solo stuff, chickens die easily, hell, even my warrior could solo them without much difficulty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good catch Bigmeeno.  Dinged 47 last night (duo in PoD as described).  Mental slip on my part on second post (was 46 for so long I thought it was going to be permanent).   I actually spent the last few days prior to last night leveling two alts, a Pally (30) and a Monk (22), so I can 2-box and team them up with my Shaman at the right time.  That may be my ultimate answer to my own solo question, just 2-box a melee with my Shaman in PoD.<br />
<br />
Thanks all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Without the 61 doggy soloing PoP zones is pretty painful and even then it's pretty slow. If you want to know what it's like to feel good about your soloing capabilities then hit CoM(City of Mist) from 47 to 55. The zone is perfect for shaman. Mobs have low resists and don't run and die fairly fast. The 49 dog helps a lot and your 51 slow makes it total cake there. Plus you get decent loot and the rare drop(which aren't worth much nowadays but still fun to see a wu stick drop).<br />
From 56 to 60 you can easily solo Chardok which is also a fun place. Seb is a blast also but it's hard to solo the entry mobs till 58, at 60/61 you can own the necro and gang camp by yourself.<br />
<br />
Ah those were the days of fun, easy and fast soloing. PoP zones are just a total pain. I could solo rats/goos in PoD at 61 but it was just too slow. I can solo ravens/treants/spiders in PoN but it's just plain boring as hell.</div></div><hr />
