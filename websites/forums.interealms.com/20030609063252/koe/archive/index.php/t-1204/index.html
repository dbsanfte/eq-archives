<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here (http://www.gameznet.com/eq/quest/corruptionoftheforest.html) you can find a description of the L Fay quest. I will definately be going for one of those earrings - not today though :(.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Funny that Fear animals works on tigerraptor :)  <br />
<br />
I picked up the earring a few nights ago.  Not too difficult, just a long wait and lots of pesky brownie outcast (multiple back to back spawns of them almost killed me)  Expect a lot of competition on this by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gallandro Strongbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The brownie outcast could pose a slight problem, but, last time i was there, they were indiff to me in wolf form...if this still holds true, it will help a lot.   As far as competition...not to worried about that.  If there are too many people there, ill just come back in  the weeee hours of the morning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the link Drolgin.<br />
<br />
I'm with you Gallandro, I'll hit this quest on one of my early morning (~5-7 AM) jaunts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Also the thing that drops the wing for the cloak is very rare, and it does not drop the wing everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Venti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just added info, as I read some conflicting stuff about this earring.  I was thinking based on what I read, that the Skull drops only from A Frightling Horror, so I kept clearing the Frightlings in the hopes that this would help spawn the Horrors.  Much to my surprise, I actually got the skull off of a regular Frightling, and not from the Horrors, so just thought I'd share the info here.<br />
<br />
This is a nice peice of resist gear, and way too easy to get, so I humbly recommend spending a bit of time in Lfay before VI gets out the Nerf stick and beats this thing down.  It just seems way to easy to get, kill level 15'ish mini-skele, and turn in head to NPC in same zone.  Had mine in about 30 minutes or so after entering LFay = ).<br />
<br />
Using the EQAtlas map of Lfay as reference, the Frightlings spawn at the Pixie Tower (#2 on map) and the NPC is located to the Druid Ring Ruins at the MM entrance, hope this helps.<br />
