<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One thing that really annoyed me with the new UI was that you couldnt remove the granite texture from some windows and especially your hotkeys. I have red, green, blue coloured text on my hotkeys, they're almost impossible to read against that granite.<br />
<br />
I hadnt noticed many people changing the graphics for their skins, so I made myself some new buttons. Im sure theres nicer out there, or will be, but if like me you really hate that granite and hadnt found a skin that removes it then I thought I'd share these.<br />
<br />
Feel free to grab any, preview the colour by viewing the jpgs, they dont include the buttons for the spell book but will replace just about every other button. Extract the file into your skin directory, you can always copy back the original version of the file from the default skin directory to put the granite back.<br />
<br />
If you want rid of the granite almost entirely including on windows that you can't remove the texture from via a menu then plain_dark_backgounds.zip contains, well exactly that.<br />

Edit: duh, helps to include the URL<br />

But you CAN remove the texture.  You can make the buttons a flat color by right-clicking on their parent window and selecting a texture of none.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've only ever managed to change the parent window texture, the only way I found to remove the texture on hotkeys themselves was to edit the graphics files.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I could be remembering wrong.  I'll have to try this when I get home - can't run EQ from behind my work firewall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm someone said todays patch included one of the files that makes up the buttons graphics, 02 as opposed to 03.<br />
<br />
I bet they put in alternative buttons before now,I simply havent copied them over into my skin folder, hence couldnt change them.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I like my medium grey buttons anyway!</div></div><hr />
