<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, I realize there is another post titled IcyBlue here but it is a recomendation post.  On this one I wanted to point out a problem so that if the creator has time he/she may fix it.  Or it may be something I am doing wrong.<br />
<br />
At any rate, the buff windown in the UI is stuck in the lower right corner and will not move at all (no the window is not set to lock) while all other window's move freely around.<br />
<br />
Next thing I was just wondering about, and once again I don't even know if it's possible to do with this UI, but was wondering if there was anyway to put a &quot;Invite (join) and Disband&quot; on the group window.  I am one of those players who like to have as little window's up as possible so without those two buttons I have to open the action window up every time to join or disband a group.<br />
<br />
Anyway, not trying to be a bother here.  I just wanted someone to know about the buff window and make a suggestion about the group window.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I'd check out eqinterface.com though. there is very good information on there about fixing UI's after patches.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Try taking a corner of the buff window and dragging it out that way (resizing it).  There is no way to move the entire buff window at once from what I can recall.</div></div><hr />

Send me a link to the files you are using and I can take a look at it. Doesn;t make sense that the buff window cannot be moved.</div></div><hr />
