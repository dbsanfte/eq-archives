<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Syncmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off I wanna say Hi! I have been reading these boards for awhile now to get my little 54 shammy into shape. One problem I had though is that my computer seemed to freeze every 30 minutes or so, and I also seemed to get data corruption in my files ( if I do a full file check it comes up with a plethora of files ).<br />
<br />
After getting severely pissed off last night and pondering the idea of buying a new system I decided to try and find the problem myself. So the first thing I decided to do was look for a way to check the validity of my memory. I went to http://www.memtest86.com/ and downloaded the tester... loaded it on a floppy and reboot my system.<br />
<br />
HOLY CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Lets just say my little pc2100 512m stick failed, and it failed ultra hard!<br />
<br />
The problem is in cheap memory ( which I admit I bought ) .. seems that when the computer is writing all those 1's and 0's the bank next to it can sometimes inherit the new data ( bad bad bad bad ). So I had another old stick of pc2100 256m laying around and I popped it in... tested it and got 0 errors. Played EQ and Star Wars Jedi Knight for hours last night and not a single crash! Bad part is I lost 256m of memory, but the good thing is im not freaking crashing anymore.<br />
<br />
Anyway just posting this because im a happy camper now, and im hoping I can help some other goofs like me who thought they could save an extra penny on their memory. Oh also I have read that the memory may not be bad in all systems, but I have an Athlon and they are notoriously bad about system noise... so dont throw it away or anything till you can try it in another system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That site for those that didnt wanna read all that is http://www.memtest86.com/ ... all you need is a floppy disk ( or cdrom ) and your good to go.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also does anyone know of any good moderately priced premium memory? I wanna buy Crucial, but a 512m stick of pc2100 is like $89... kinda steep for broke mofos like me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">moderately priced &lt;&gt; premium.  *grin*<br />
<br />
I make sure to hit pricewatch.com when I'm checking for parts - if nothing else, it'll give me a good price range, so I know what's high, low, and just right.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a nice little utility.</div></div><hr />

Funny you say that because the bad stick in question was bought using pricewatch. =)<br />
<br />
The bad thing about using pricewatch is that most of the companies are able to keep the prices lower by selling substandard equipment. You will notice that most of the items bought through pricewatch look nothing like the retail version of the product... this is because they took the nice components off of it and are selling it at a lower price as an OEM product.<br />
<br />
I really like using pricewatch for some things, but for the stuff thats gonna make or break your system I really dont like to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Berik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dear Lord how long does this Memtest take?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Syncmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Think I read that it would go on for about five hours for a full check, but I only ran it for like 5 minutes and had 15000 failures... so I made a wild guess that it wasnt gonna get much better. <br />
<br />
I can tell you that if I buy new memory im gonna let it go for the full test though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>zurxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i was having severe lock-up issues after buying my new e-machine.  It seems there is an issue w/ the 'jumper'/'bus'. All i know is it took me 10 seconds to fix it after i opened my comp up and no lock-ups for over 20 adv's now.  No techie here, so i'll try to link the address...http://www.fic.com.tw/support/download.aspx?dl=motherboard%2fmanual%2fsocketa%2fam37%2fam37_a0_eng.zip&amp;title=am37_a0_eng.zip&amp;info=manual<br />
       download the .pdf file, open it and go to pages 2-6 .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>zurxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">sorry but i may have left out the most important part...the jumper needs to be set at 100 rather than 133.</div></div><hr />

I've used samsung ram before for higher end applications and found it to be reliable in the past.</div></div><hr />
