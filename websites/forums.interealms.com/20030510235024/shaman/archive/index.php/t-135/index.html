<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">4 hours. But that assumes that last time he died, his pet was also killed. He won't respawn if his pet is still alive.<br />
<br />
My advice is to make a halfling rogue, and sneak your way to Kirn to check if he's up. If he isn't, but his pet is, petition for a GM to come kill the pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tamajin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last time we went to do Kirn his pet was still up. We killed him and hunted for a bit locally for exp. He repopped approx 2 hours after pet died.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Kirn is ~4 hour spawn. I think he will spawn even if his pet wasnt killed (at least on my server), because I've gone down there before and seen him and 3 High Scale Kirn pets in his room.</div></div><hr />
