<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goku999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, everyone always seems to be talking about how bad or worthless enstill is (ie. use root, not enstill...  root is the way to go, enstill is a joke... etc)<br />
<br />
I've never noticed anything wrong with it that much. So I'm wondering whats wrong with it? Does it break more easily? (If so i haven't really noticed) Resisted more often? What?<br />
<br />
Also, if there really is something wrong with enstill, what about immobilize?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Root is much less mana than the others. So little mana, I almost consider it to be free, and it usually holds long enough. If I could devote 2-3 slots to &quot;rooting&quot; spells, I might have a longer-lasting spell memorized for parking, but it doesn't seem worth wasting an extra slot on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe enstill breaks just as easily as root when damage is done.  Enstill is supposedly better for root-parking, but I always go back to plain old root because it seems to work just as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Root - Fast cast, Regular resist rate, small duration<br />
Enstill - Slow cast, Regular resist rate, long duration<br />
Immobilze - Fast cast, low resist rate, long duration<br />
Paralyzing Earth - Mid cast, low resist rate, longer duration.<br />
<br />
I think I remember this being how it worked, but don't quote me on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Basicly the extra time length for enstill does not out weigh the longer cast time and Mana usage.  You can get 2 roots cast for about the same mana little more.  Though if you get a resist on enstill you just multiplied the mana you would used on a root by 4 times.  With root you can med back the mana for it and then some in 3-4 ticks where enstill takes quite abit more time.  And last of all lower level spells are much harder to interupt and less likely to fizzle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm level 54 and still use level 14 root.  It has never failed me.  30 mana is practically free.  In the extremely rare case where I need to root something and dont have the mana for it, all it takes is one canni and I can cast.  Enstill and immobolize don't seem to work any better, and just take more mana to cast.  If something breaks root 5 times in a row, that's 150 mana.  That's not that much.  If something breaks immobolize 5 times in a row (which happens more often than you'd think), that's 400 mana (OUCH!).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Using enstill for the first time last night i found it to be better then plain old root, switched to it after having to root park a fair bit and root was just not holding out long enough to be effective. Moved the spell up from the back of the book because of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Munkee Bizness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">from how much ive used root or immobilize and enstill ive found that which ones break from damage easier tend to go in the order of paralyzing - enstill - root - immobilize i have never had immobilize ever last through even one dd spell where the others have to varying degrees of success, its all a matter of what you want the root for. if its just root parking go with root, but if you plan to toss a couple dots on too i would say go with enstill the extra hit you'll take while casting isnt a big deal, neither is the mana usage which is still pretty negligible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I am lvl 51 shaman and I use Enstill mainly. I used the Root too, for it's 30 mana only, but really, if I want to PARK something, I use Enstill. 60 mana isn't that much now anyway. I slap Enstill on, Turgur the mob, add 2 DoT's and if it hasn't broken so far, I can usually easily sit down and Envenomed Bolt can run out 2 times, before the Enstill will run out, and sometimes even longer. I don't actually even know how long Enstill is supposed to last, but I have used it to park the mob, then slapped Plague and Envenomed Bolt on, and after these ran out, the mob was still parked - that's a long of time, considering how long Plague takes. Casting time isn't that much longer anyway.<br />
<br />
Of course, at times there are moments, like with any &quot;parking&quot; spell, when it wears off almost as soon as you put it on.. I hate such moments.<br />
<br />
So I do suggest Enstill, works very well for me. Immobilize I don't use - 80 mana already for a root is tad too much, 60 is max I would use with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wolfen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I use Enstill a lot for parking, from what I remember it is easier to resist than root but lasts a lot longer.<br />
<br />
I think it's a case of using the right tool for the job, when using it in combat or against high resist mobs, use root. If parking adds or spear dot soloing then use enstill :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Veranon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Don't remember how much easier it is to regain on `root`</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I use immobilize because it's the fastest cast. It's easiest to get off when being pounded on and stops runners the quickest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">At level 60 I'm using root (went back to it several lvls back). For soloing root (IMHO) is the best choice given the DD component will break root more times than dot. The cast time difference between root and immobilize is insignificant.  If you are strickly on mob control one of the longer duration would make sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>baddwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I use enstill for 2 lev now and i really enjoy it.  30 more mana is not much and resist rate was not that much on my experience.  I have seen like 7 resist in a row, but was one time over 2 lev of exp.  I have seen my enstill stayed about 40-50 sec on a mob with 2 Warriors dual wieldings on it before it broke.  I don't know for the other root, but enstill is a pretty good root for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I always liked Enstill, even better than Immobilize. I use Paralyzing Earth now, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mwinda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've been using paralyzing earth... the durration on that is sick... and I've never had a dot break it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I use paralyzing earth.  When coupled with Malosi it usually lands for full duration which is simply sick.  Saved my bacon on a couple of bad pulls while soloing.  I like it for the duration and my AC (while not great) is good enough to hold me for the extra casting time.  If a mob is slowed (almost always) then the extra casting time is no big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Brok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Use root, because it virtually never gets interrupted.  The only times I need to root something is when I'm getting pounded on something that's not slowed, so you want to have a spell memmed that will give you those 10 seconds to get it slowed.<br />
<br />
If I'm main CC for a duo or trio group (monk, rogue, shaman) then I'll mem paralyzing earth in another slot and use that for parking.</div></div><hr />
