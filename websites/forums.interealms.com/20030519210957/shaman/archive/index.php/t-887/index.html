<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Took me a few days. I wanted to keep my good fction with Venril Sathir, so I just sat at the zone and asked in /ooc from time to time. The zone regulars got to know me after a couple of days :) I healed people after trains, and helped out generally, so I don't think anyone resented my presence. I was glad to get out of there though when someone finally let me loot the chips. And I've never been back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Welcome to KC major train station for Kunark. Your best bet is sit down at zone line, buff folks, and ooc that you are looking to loot grayish bone chips. I spent a few hours there before someone had finally killed the warlord in moat area. Ran over, looted, and scooted out.<br />
<br />
I know on our server there is an unwritten rule that trains go right. Ask when you zone in which way trains are supposed to go. Not that everyone follows this rule, but it does lower your zoning due to gimp formed trains.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caeric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As the above offered, I spent a few days there buffing/healing, etc.... then offered to &quot;pay&quot; with SoW potions for the loot rights, and that seemed to work wonders :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a flame for another day.  The fact Overthere faction gets ruined by at least 2 good Kunark dungeons where FV people have NO problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Yoshany</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ive fought in kc a zillion times and this drop in lcy off the skele warlord  easiest way is ask someone in lcy group if u can loot them im sure they will not have a problem with it.<br />
