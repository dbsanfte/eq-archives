<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Winterfury</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been taking friends through GoD sewer trials lately and I suddenly find that I have 5 leadership points and really no idea what to spend them on. Looking at each of the descriptions is interesting, but I'd like to get insights from Shamans that have actually used some of these skills.<br />
<br />
Enhanced HP sounds like a no-brainer, everyone wants more hp, right? Well I heard someone suggest that the amount of boost was laughable and not worth the cost. Thoughts?<br />
<br />
I can see the utility of some of the other utility skills, but again, it's hard to evaluate the relative values without having had the experience.<br />
<br />
Any insights on what are some of the more useful leadership skills in practice?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
Get it, you won't regret it. It allows you to assign a member of the group as the main assist, any mob they have targeted will get a very distinctive targeting ring around it, and the name above its head surrounded by angled brackets, e.g. &lt;&lt; Goldark &gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
Not a big deal, this is why we have /assist you may think. However, in practice I find it very useful for crowd control classes - they know which mob NOT to mezz. Also saves confusion when there are multiple mobs with same name, and helps you know the tank (who's usually MA in xp groups) is on the ball and has the mob engaged.<br />
<br />
Been playing my bard a lot and I just love this ability. As a shaman its not so useful but for your group as a whole I strongly recommend it, even if you are all skilled at using /assist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spell Awareness rocks.  You see all the spells that are cast in your area by both PCs and NPCs.  You can see people using AA abilities, like Divine Arbitration, or even Cannibalize.  Very nice for coordinating debuffs/buffs and seeing what spells mobs are casting around you.<br />
<br />
Inspect Buffs 2 rocks, having timers on buffs is helpful in both a raid and regular group setting.  Just tonight we were getting ready to engage a raid mob and someone in my group hit inspect buffs and said - hey hen only 5 mins left on focus, so I had time to MGB it real quick before we got started.<br />
<br />
I am getting Health of Target's Target next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Health of targets target rocks,<br />
Spell awareness rocks<br />
and extra hp never hurts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spell awareness to me is nothing but more garbage spam.  I don't even look at it.<br />
<br />
Target of Target is ok.   But its not really what it should be imo.   When you are targetted on the MT all you ever see is the mob on the ToT.  Well DUH of course the MT is on the mob.   Yeah, its useful when you have the mob targetted and can see who he's beating on, but as soon as you go to heal that person you can't tell if the mob is still on that person or has switched, and you are back to the same old assist healing.   They should have made it to where you can see what mob is beating on the cleric, or better yet... Target of Target's Target.  So if the MT is targetting the mob you can see who the mob is targetting.<br />
That way you know if the mob has decided to beat on someone other than the MT you are currently healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have the first level of health enhancement and offense enhancement so far. I'll probably get mana enhancement, health regen, spell awareness, and delegate main assist as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Health of Target's Target - Really useful for saying who has aggro more than anything else. I'd highly recommend using a custom UI for this window as well, as the stock one doesn't seem to have a health bar and % that works well at all.<br />
<br />
Delegate Main Assist - Pretty handy while in CC groups or when you have to deal with groups of mobs. You can always see where that person's target is and act accordingly.<br />
<br />
Find Path to PC - I was pretty jazzed about this one at first, but I find the range is rather short. I wouldn't put this as a high priority, but I do use it from time to time. Makes a yellow path show up directing someone to the person. Often times I'll move to a camp, tell people to get close, then use that.<br />
<br />
Spell Awareness - You able to parse a lot of spam? Then its good. If not, don't sweat it. Probably most useful to identify type of mobs being fought. Also to see unknown spell effects and identifying CHealers.<br />
<br />
NPC Health - This is actually useful again from a CC or healer standpoint. You aren't always in a position to move your target around, and assuming you have the ability to look around, you can always see graphically what the health of the target either you or your main assist has targetted. Its eye candy mostly, but I've found it useful from time to time.<br />
<br />
Inspect Buffs 2 - Nice ability, but rather spendy to get the full effectiveness. Current project for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I went with health enhancement - took a while but I have level 3 and it's 100 hps. More hps is always good. Working on inspect bufsf next, I have level 1 atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
I have Offense Enhancement 1 (for the melees) and Mark NPC.<br />
I wouldn't recommend Mark NPC unless you are impatient to spend points, though it is kind of nifty to see the health percentage above their head.  Having melee enhancement has garnered me a group leader spot on several pickup raids because the melees wanted more attack.  They chose the extra 9 attack from OE1 OVER someone who had health enhancement 3.  To them, the extra attack was worth more than a 100hp.<br />
<br />
I'm getting Health of Target's Target next I think, as I duo with an enchanter often.  HoTT is invaluable to someone using CoD, and useful in groups for the clerics (even if it isn't that amazing to me).<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Inspect Buffs 2 is well worth the 12 points - It tells you the time remaining on all your buffs, as well as on all your group member buffs.  Let's you know whether you need to scare up a fresh Virtue before going into an adventure, or whether you need to refresh before a nasty pull.  It also tells you time remaining on dots and debuffs.  <br />
<br />
Level 1 helps you know when to recast quiessence - you can track when it drops off of the tank.  <br />
<br />
Level 2 really helps me track who needs an FA refresher.<br />
<br />
Our bard is the group leader, and she got the mark target option straight out of the box.  She pulls using a combination of mez and lull, so this let's her mark which target she's mezzing.<br />
<br />
Other then that we've been slowly building up the hps.  You're right that it doesn't seem like a lot for the points spent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">IB 2 is 10 points not 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I initially got delegate main assist.  Definitely worth it -- especially for crowd control classes, since it makes their lives easier on overpulls because they can see what the MA is going to attack and compensate by controlling the rest.  It generally avoids confusion.<br />
<br />
I then got NPC Health.  I was initially thinking this wouldnt be very useful, but my cleric friend said he wanted me to get it so he could see the ehalth of the mob.  After I got it and discovered that it doesnt JUST show the health of the NPC that the MA is on, but ALSO shows the health of anything you or your group members click on, it suddenly got a whole lot more attractive.  I'm very pleased with this ability.<br />
<br />
After NPC health, I was torn between health of targets target and spell awareness.  Since I already have NPC health, and health of targets target doesnt seem alot more efficient than assist healing, I think I'll go with spell awareness.  Being able to tell what my fellow debuffers are casting and when they're casting it, seems useful to me. <br />
<br />
After that, I think I'll go for the attack bonuses to please my ranger friend and then the health bonuses.  We'll have to see.</div></div><hr />
