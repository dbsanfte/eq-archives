<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lladnarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what my mana pool was looking like the other day, and went to caster's realm, to use their mana calculator to find out. I am 65 shaman, had VoQ and in Great Bear form, just curious. Well, that calc would not go past 255 wis, and my wis was 274, so I didnt get an accurate reading. I have been looking for another site that has a mana calc and just cant find one. If anyone knows of one, could you please post a link or the url?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />
