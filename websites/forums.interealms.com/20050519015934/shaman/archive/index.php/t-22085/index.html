<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Having my bi-annual EQ rant again.  Still currently travelling around the world and so have not played EQ for 10 months now, but I did plan on picking up where I left off on my return.<br />
<br />
Here's the problem though, in the time I've been away Sony have churned out no less then TWO expansions, with another close behind, IN 10 MONTHS!  Every time I look at this forum I become more mystified by what everyone is talking about, and with another Expansion on the way and more levels, AA's, etc.  I'm thinking to myself, I really can't be botherd to relearn EQ and aquaint myself with the hundreds of new zones, new fighting styles, blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
I saw that Sony not so long ago tried to get people hooked again by reopening all closed accounts for free.  But how many people came back and stayed back?  I for one can't be botherd any more, I think Sony are rapidly becomming a victim of their own greed, and all these recent measures to get back in touch with the player base, looks like too little too late.<br />
<br />
Although, I do remember they did ask once whether people wanted 'More Expansions' or to 'Update and change the current content'.  It seems fairly obvious now which way people voted, so maybe it's your fault.  Does anyone have any statistics on how many obsolete zones there are now?  <br />
<br />
Are these disposable expansions Sony flogging a dying horse and sqeezing the players for as much cash as possible?  Or do they honestly believe they are advancing the game into new areas?<br />
<br />
I'd like to finish this jumbled half-drunk ramble with a quick poll.</div></div><hr />

Whichever one it is, old or new content, is not necessarily that important to most people, I think.  Just what they can do there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Me too.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Continue expansions, but make updating and fixing old content more of a priority.&quot;<br />
Expansions is only where they release the novel content. I do think though there needs to be a new type of emphasis with expansions, concentrating on more than one level range, concentrating on putting spirit back into everquest rather than it be totally occupied about loot and grinding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Me too.  I used to think further expansions were neither necessarily good nor bad, but now I think they're an actual negative turning the developers away from things that actually matter a lot to us.<br />
While I agree with this sentiment to a degree, I also feel that new content is the carrot. It has to keep coming. LDoN wasnt &quot;enough&quot; newness to really count. Honestly as I look at it I think more and more it should have been a free upgrade, or maybe a half-pricer (13 bucks, same as a months subscription). It just wasnt a &quot;true&quot; expansion. <br />
<br />
To me expansions mean travel, newness, new zones, new mobs, new strategies required. I know its hard for the Devs, they are running out of stuff that can be considered &quot;new&quot;, but Gates was a heckuva try, honestly, instancing, some loot farming areas, decent quests, new tradeskills, etc. Going to North Ro then running to Oasis to enter a dungeon that look exactly like every other dungeon from EC to EF isnt really &quot;newness&quot;. <br />
<br />
SOEs biggest problems right now, quite frankly, are the mentalities that people like this threads starter has. He is ANNOYED that he doesnt know everything about the game any more. It BOTHERS him to have to learn new zones and new gear and new abilities. The original design of this game WAS NOT for everyone to churn to 65 THEN start playing, you know. THe original design was the ROAD, not the destination. <br />
<br />
The most recent extended break I took was mid-Luclin til a week before LoY shipped. I came back, LoY shipped, PoP was sorta being worked through, but most was still untouchable, and I had a BLAST. I lived in LoY from 58 - 62. I dindt care that the XP was better in PoV, or that the gear was better in Veskar, I played in the LoY zones because they were FUN, exciting, NEW! <br />
<br />
Yeah, they were a long run, boo-f*ing-hoo. Went to Veskar a few time too, long run. But you know, spending the day in PoV because I can get 7.21346% more XP per hour than in LoY, and the mobs have 14.876% less hps than in Veskar, or not going to Droga because the gear in HoH has 3.6 more hps and 8.2 more mana is what has ruined this game. People dont want to &quot;settle&quot; anymore. The best, or they whine. <br />
<br />
I hate to say it, and negative rep bombs away, but in a way, the person who said that not every player should be able to get every single spell was right. I play at the point of the game I am in because I LIKE it. There is better gear, spells, etc higher up. Someday, I might get there, and get that stuff. But for now, my VT stuff is darn good, and my few EP items are prescious, and I just got my last EP God for Time, which is now the &quot;2nd&quot; highend area in the game (didnt hit VT til well after PoP came out) and I am happy. <br />
<br />
The Grass is Greener is what makes EQ bad. This attitude:<br />
Every time I look at this forum I become more mystified by what everyone is talking about, and with another Expansion on the way and more levels, AA's, etc. I'm thinking to myself, I really can't be botherd to relearn EQ and aquaint myself with the hundreds of new zones, new fighting styles, blah blah blah. is whats killing EQ, not new expansions. OK SOE dropped the ball with Gates. They are trying to make it right. They are actually listening. Everyone bitches and moans about new stuff all broken, etc etc etc, I even see people say &quot;Don't make a shaman, cause in TWO YEARS when you max him out he will suck&quot;. *** is the matter with some people, honestly! <br />
<br />
Give me the road anyday. I CRAVE newness sometimes.</div></div><hr />

If you don't, then not playing makes sense. If you do, then playing makes sense. You get to make that decision. I don't see anyone else stating their reasons for playing or not playing as &quot;your answer.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I'm afraid you couldn't be wronger.  I don't recall saying I'm annoyed, I believe I said I couldn't be botherd with it any more.  The rate expansions seem to be being pushed out is getting rediculous, pretty much as soon as one is released there's an announcement for the next expansion, the next 'carrot'.<br />
<br />
I used to enjoy new zones, new spells, new skills etc.  Velious was easily my favourate expansion for new content, and it was well thought out.  The progression wasn't easy but wasn't only possible by shear grinding, you could choose which race to ally yourself with, and there was a real storyline behind it that really came across in the quests.<br />
<br />
Now I just see new expansions as another mountain to climb.  All new spells and skills seem to be simply rehashed versions of what we've already got.  OK, they appear to be finally listening, but as I said I've been away too long and it's too little too late.  I'm not a power gamer, in about three years of playing I don't even have a level 65, that's because I hate sitting and 'grinding', never liked it never will.  But unfortunately it's all EQ seems to be about now.  Which is the crux of the matter, EXPANSIONS AREN'T ANYTHING NEW ANYMORE!  All they are is the last expansion with go faster stripes.<br />
<br />
So I'm sure you know where you can shove your ill-conceived conclusion about me.</div></div><hr />

Erm, no.  It would be pretty pointless and dumb to play something I had decided I didn't enjoy or deny myself of something I did enjoy, wouldn't it?  I can't see myself being happier by just adopting a sheep mentality to the whole thing, don't judge me by your own lack of standards.</div></div><hr />

Get a grip man, what the hell do you expect from a 5 year old game? You sound like someone looking for an excuse to quit, then trying to justify it to yourself. Just quit. Your burnt on the game. Its not fun. QUIT. But stop whining about &quot;new&quot; stuff and being &quot;bothered&quot; by having to &quot;learn&quot; and actually &quot;play&quot; the &quot;game&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well said.  Interesting way to look at it.  <br />
<br />
It's true, they aren't really anything new.  Just adding some stats etc. across the board to characters without thinking much about it.<br />
<br />
Expansions seem less exciting every time and more mechanical.  The last thing you would want to buy one for is for adventure or exploration -- or anything &quot;questy&quot; - maybe more like sheerly expanding the &quot;Ever&quot; part of &quot;Everquest,&quot; that's all.<br />
<br />
Just more of the same, adjusted upward what, 5 or 10%.<br />
<br />
*Yawn*<br />

You have to defend the city for LDON points or some other workable prize.  I'd rather they go in a different way, than add content, new zones, more uber weapons.  I'd rather have events than new content... Sony/Verant did seem to get more popular when they did that &quot;fabled thing&quot;...I remember when GM's did events...

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Creativity seems to have died a long time ago.<br />
Gonna disagree. Gates has a LOT to offer if people stop focusing on the negatives and look for it. Quests, massive ones, shawl type stage quests with varying rewards, a lot of decent loot farming areas.<br />
<br />
But it takes a while to get there (no book). CRs are a pain (no GYs).<br />
<br />
Wanna know what BORKED EQ. PoK Books and Graveyards, thats what.<br />
<br />
Oh, and having EVERY zone you would want to go into all within 100 yards of each other. Sheesh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yea ppl got lazy me included, i want nexus type zone for GoD from wich i can access em all, then it will be a good exp.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Who cares?  What it offers is boring.  Which is what I was saying in the first place.  Plus things like flagging are outright tedious and have even been unbalancing to the game.  Gates is sure as heck not an expansion to hold up as proof that EQ expansions are still interesting and high quality.  <br />
<br />
Forget the cut and paste zone design and cookie cutter mobs you kill with cookie cutter tactics.<br />
<br />
Just compare it to how exciting Velious was.  Everybody was exploring as fast as they could, fascinated by everything.  It was an absolute blast.  The dragons were scary and mysterious, and Kael was majestic and terrifying.  The dorfs were cool and fun.  There were basic things about faction that some people started screwing up and trying to fix, but it wasn't all cut and dried -- there were different kinds of faction.  There were mysteries that were REALLY fun, like the Tower of Frozen Shadow.  Which was also filled with fun mobs and experiences.  There were really, really fun areas like the big orc camp in East Wastes and the Orc Chieftain with his horrible habit of popping super tough mobs when he died.  (Still killable -- but you had to be smart!  My druid regularly soloed him in the low 50's when other whole groups couldn't do him.)  There were just so many really FUN things to do and discover.<br />
<br />
Gates?  Dreary stuff.  Except I do think the big ship was kinda fun.  Although boat trips suck hugely now just like they did then.  Horrible time sink.<br />
<br />
Or how about Kunark?  Fantastic stuff, really great new super meanie race, scary as heck to travel through.  Ocean travel to frightening and cool islands like the chessboard isle and the ogre isle on the way to Overthere.  Overthere itself, an evil/agnostic city; just so many fun and scary things.<br />
<br />
No way can you compare the thought and effort into making fun, rounded, interesting worlds in Kunark and Velious to what Gates is like.  Not even close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think BlargX summed up what i remember EQ being..and that i sorely miss... and the crap that is EQ today...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was going to wait for someone else to say it, and bravo you have, that's why I included in the list of options.  I think EQ would be far more compelling if they ditched the disposable expansions approach, and started working purely with what they have already.  Think of all those zones that don't get used anymore, they get updated occasionally, but it's usually half hearted and never lasts longer then the 'shiney thing effect' (Bravo also to whoever came up with that one).<br />
<br />
Think of how much more dynamic they could make EQ by getting some serious storylines going.  I finally worked out what makes Velious appealing, and that is THE PLAYERS ARE PART OF THE STORYLINE!  In pretty much the rest of EQ all the quests that I can think of are always refering to past events.<br />
<br />
Like NinthSZ has said, imagine some race invading another.  You could have the whole thing devided into weekly sections.  Just to give a clear example something like:<br />
<br />
Week 1: Ice Goblin scouting parties have been spotted in far greater numbers then usual in the Northern Tundras and Planes, some have even been reported venturing near Barbarian and Human cities.  Local authorities are calling home all travelling citizens to help investigate what could be the start of a Major attack.<br />
<br />
Week 2: Goblin hoards are reportedly amassing outside the gates of Permafrost, it has been speculated that with the release of 'The Sleeper', The Rogue Dragon exiles are reportedly growing massively powerful, and are most likely responcible for this ominous activity.  City officials in Qeynos and Halas are desperately asking for reinforcements to launch a pre-emptive strike on what is sure to be the start of an invasion.<br />
<br />
Week 3: Despite valient efforts to stay the attack, a full scale invasion of the northern lands has begun.  Qeynos has already in part fallen to the goblin hoards, and a last attempt to retake the city is about to be launched.  Halas has so far managed to resist all attack due to it's heavily fortified location, but the City is also in dire need of help.  It has also been reported that several Factions of Gnolls and Orcs have allied themselves with the uprising, which could spell the end of any Human occupation of the northern lands.<br />
<br />
Week 4: And so on.........<br />
<br />
Obviously this is just to give an example, I can see the many flaws in creating a major war in these zones, for Newbies, quests, etc.  But the point is, with each week, depending on the story we would see changes to the zones involved.  Like increased numbers of mobs (Goblin Soldier, Elite Soldier, Captains, etc.) charging around.  Something like the Ring and Shawl wars from Velious, but longer lasting by far.  We could see Barbarian NPC's fighting the Goblins (Imagine that, mobs fighting each other just to add depth to the game).<br />
a_goblin_invader002: Shouts, &quot;We will finally forefill our promise or ridding you scum from our lands!&quot;<br />
You could perhaps gain adventure points depending on your kill Ratio, whatever the rewards, they would no doubt have to be reasonably good for the sake of the l33t dud3z.  But the emphasis should be on ENJOYING IT RATHER THEN JUST GRINDING TO BE MORE UBAH!  You could even have GM's taking part to spice things up even more, and take away the predictable attack element.<br />
<br />
A reasonable percentage of people have voted for this kind of option, we can only hope that we can spread the word and more people will see it our way.  OK, so SONY doesn't get to squeeze money out of us for releasing tons more expansions.  But maybe we can make them look at it this way, less people will get fed up by more uninspiring expansions and leaving.  Maybe even people who used to play will take a look and go, &quot;Hey, they're doing something different, maybe worth signing up for a while to see what's happening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scary, difficult to code, wreckless, non-l33t, no doubt to some people.  But worth a try maybe, as Ninth said, look what's been the most popular things that have happened.<br />
<br />
We'll see...........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Except I do think the big ship was kinda fun.  Although boat trips suck hugely now just like they did then.  Horrible time sink.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just an fyi, but the boats are gone- you can access Abysmal Sea via the Magus in Nedaria's Landing.  Abysmal Sea rocks for the tradeskill junky as well.<br />
<br />
Aside from that derail, I am going to have to agree with Blazz.  PoK books and graveyards killed old EQ.  Today, you have to drag someone kicking and screaming to any zone other than one accessed to by PoTranq.  There are plenty of zones out there that have better loot rewards than any tier 1/2 PoP zone, but people will only stick around in PoP due to the +.6721% xp that they will net.  We see evidence of this trend with the last patch where they added a PoHate npc and a Gunthak portal stone in PoK.  Did we really need a Gunthak stone? It saves 3-4 mins?  <br />
<br />
There are so many aspects of EQ that have been nerfed, dumbed down, or completely removed that a lot of the &quot;fun&quot; is gone.  My favorite expansion was Velious, but I played a druid at the time.  To get to Velious you had to take a boat from Nro (needed to run there or get a port), then you landed in Iceclad.  You then had to trek to GD if you wanted to head to Thurg or to EW if you wanted to get to Kael.  If you were lucky to win some Velious armor drops- you still had to get the gems and the faction.  Passing through the land of Velious you encountered:<br />
<br />
Gnomes (old world gnome model)<br />
Snow Cougars (old world lioness model)<br />
Dire Wolfs (old world wolf model)<br />
Snow Dervishes (old world Lavastorm rock swirlies)<br />
Snow Griffins (old world griffon model)<br />
Mammoths (old world mammoth model)<br />
Snow Orcs (old world orc centurion model)<br />
Minotaurs (old world minotaur model)<br />
Snow Gnolls (old world gnoll model)<br />
<br />
New Models:<br />
<br />
(Coldain)<br />
(Dragon Models)<br />
(Kromrif)<br />
(Manticore)<br />
(Grizzlies)<br />
(Rabbit?)<br />
(Snow Rhinos)<br />
and a few more.....<br />
<br />
Kunark was great, they incorporated many new models but repeated them zone after zone after zone...<br />
<br />
Goblins<br />
Iksars<br />
Brutes<br />
Drolvargs<br />
Iksar Skelly model<br />
Moles<br />
Sarnaks<br />
<br />
These are all the standard fodder for 80% of Kunark content.  There really hasn't been much change in the &quot;amount&quot; of designer content- its just not fantasy this time in GoD.<br />
<br />
The mentality in EQ today is grind,grind,grind.  Every post by X player wanted to know what to do at 55-62 is told the same thing: grind to 65.  No one wants to &quot;witness&quot; the beauty of the game simply because it could de-track from &quot;maxxing out my levels asap&quot;.   The bazaar reflects this mentality, anything with 45 hps or less and avg stats doesn't sell worth a damn.  Unless it has &quot;required 63+&quot; or no requirement lvl whatsoever- people don't want it.  How many 65 caster types have at least 50% of their lvl 65 spells when they dinged 65?  How many casters completely bypassed 80% of their level 60 spells in the grind to 65?<br />
<br />
The &quot;fun&quot; is EQ typically is the very things that people complained about.<br />
<br />
Fun: I like to explore the different zones of EQ.<br />
<br />
Reality:  Give me a PoK book so I don't have to cross 2 zones to get where I want to go. <br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Fun: I like to frequent zones in EQ that people rarely go to.<br />
<br />
Reality: I want to go to the best xp/loot zone and not have to key/flag for it.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Fun: I would like a line of group accessible gear that I can modify.<br />
<br />
Reality: If I can't win it in 5 groups then I can't be bothered with it.<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Fun: Why do people need to price gouge items in the bazaar?<br />
<br />
Reality: I just upgraded my belt, what is the best price I can get for my old one?<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The reality of the problem is that EQ hasn't changed much other than the Devs have &quot;tried&quot; to cater to past complaints.  EQ has gotten too easy and hence why we see so many &quot;I'm bored with EQ&quot; threads.</div></div><hr />

Got to learn how to efficiently group there.  Heard how bad rangers were(i was one) but didn't care... saw all the high levels going in KC... visited the front but the place was too scary to enter by myself...finally late at night when dreadlands was empty.. i'd go inside KC and ask for groups...and some nice people would let me group even though i was low... after that i joined a guild and came velious age... well you get the point.. there was so much to do with each expansion.... now its just grind and loot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hmm everything is blamed on pok books and graveyards, I think in reality its more of a multitude of factors for example the unimaginative design of pop and the exp bonus there. And also perhaps the shift from a majority group centric play to raid centric play.<br />
<br />
Graveyards and Pok books would have better if they could have been explained in a roleplaying theme, they can't and it mechanizes the game too much. I think another solution to something that helped people get places faster would have been better, I mean before pok books there were pots in td people used that was hardly badly thought of.<br />
Before pop, travel was very tedious which people do forget when remembering prepop. Before, people relied on druids and Wizards which was nice for interdependency but annoying when you could not find one. I think a solution could perhaps have been along the lines of enhancing each classes ability to travel.<br />
An ability like having every race a gate ability to their home town would have been better. And perhaps having in some zones something like they have in innoruuk forest, a mob that whacks you to the zoneline, clever idea and fits in with the roleplaying ideals. <br />
Just my thoughts anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The problem isnt completely Gates though, its that the game is OLD. I swear if they shipped Velious right now, people would:<br />
<br />
Bitch because its too hard<br />
Not go because of the boat<br />
Complain about the treks to the various cities FROM the boat<br />
Whine about the senseless camping and tradeskilling for some quests<br />
Moan about the cookie cutter outdoor zones with all the same models<br />
Bitch about there not being enough &quot;true&quot; dungeons<br />
<br />
Etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the game is old, and there isnt really much of anything new they can do. Gates is an attempt as some fresh ideas. Taking the LDoN concept one step further, combining it with the flagging process, removeing the BIGGEST complaint about flags (require a raid) etc etc. They added a cool city. They have LDoN camps that I am SURE are part of some future expansion. <br />
<br />
There are campable zones with loot in them, they just take some effort to find, JUST LIKE KUNARK, JUST LIKE VELIOUS. I get so sick and tired of the instant gratification mindset that is SO prominent in this game. If you cant get it, solve it, beat it, or own it in the first month it SUCKS now. I just do not understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">this is all a red herring.  None of the poll options are correct.  The CORRECT one goes like this:  <br />
1) Use current money from EQ subscriptions to improve the game instead of squandering it all on EQ2 development.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">There ya go.<br />
<br />
That's always been the correct option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It's so true. You watch the EQ2 children going into orgasms over gigabytes of voice acting, over textured armor and transient lighting effects and all I can think is, &quot;That's my subscription at work&quot; :(<br />
<br />
And they'll keep releasing expansions, because expansions make them money. Wherease they can't update a zone without allowing everyone access to it.</div></div><hr />

The worst part is, it's not the graphics and recorded voices that make a good game.  And the sad part of that, is there's enough simpletons out there who disagree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">One expansion a year is plenty, as long as good work is being done on older content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Heh they need to stop using Live as a test environment (ie Directx 9 fiasco).  That was last straw for me.  I will not be back to EQ (4 accts lost between wife and I plus another 2 with best friend who quit with us).  It had its moment but now time to find something new to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I think it is about time they gave us all a Free expansion!<br />
<br />
Been playing since beta4 own 3 accounts and what I have 2 free zones to show for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">new content is always good but they need to fix the problems first before making new expansions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Well I voted for the last option. I don't want them mucking with the<br />

<br />
Yup.  I'd be surprised if EQ2 didn't have lots of people trying it and making it an initial success.  People outside EQ by and large haven't even heard of EQ's failures at all, so they'll have no particular reason not to give &quot;this new EQ2 thingy I've been hearing about&quot; a try.<br />
<br />
But that doesn't mean those guys will be long-term customers, at least not like we've grown accustomed to thinking of EQ customers as long term.  If they don't make that game much, much better than this one, and give customer service that's not just better but of a completely different order than the CS of today's EQ, there won't be such a thing as a person who plays EQ2 for five years.<br />
<br />
I would be surprised if the eye candy and celebrity voices mean a lot short-term.  I doubt they'll mean much of anything long-term.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I think we have gotten three free zones. Veksar, The Warrens, and Stonebrunt Mountains. Hmm come ot think of it was Paineel a part of the original game? I thought I remembered hearing something about how you couldn't be a Erudite SK or Necro at release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Also The Hole, Kedge, Sol C, Nedaria, Jagged Pine, Chardok B, Hate #2, CT #2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">what I'd really like to see is another Velius-style expansion. Luclin was a very hub-based expansion, as was PoP &amp; GoD, with LDoN &amp; LoY seeming more of 'extensions' than expansions.<br />
<br />
What I think made Velius special, was it had the warring factions, three great cities each as functional as each other, but each could also be raided. It had a nice faction dynamic. Way back when I remember guilds recruiting saying 'were a CoV guild' or 'were currently on giant faction'. Nowadays it's all about flagging &amp; progression.<br />
<br />
I answered 'more expansions but fixing as a priority'. I really think things need fixing first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Veksar - Planned for release in Kunark but was not finished to to pathing issues you technically paid for it with kunark but they released much later :)<br />
Kedge - this has been in as long as I can remember<br />
Hate #2 - Zone revamp<br />
CT #2 - Zone revamp<br />
<br />
So yeah, there was more than two... but a lot of them were revamps and &quot;unfinished&quot; zones that were suppose to be released with expansions that were later released as a &quot;free zone&quot;<br />
<br />
Check out your original maps if you still have them, tons of zones that were planned are there but were not released. I think even some of the LoY zones were on the orginal map.<br />
<br />
I was a little short sighted but I feel jipped darn it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">No, the Veksar we have today is a completely new zone. The original one was an underwater dungeon that was abandoned early in kunark development, and never included in the game in any form, so you didnt pay for it.<br />
<br />
One zone which is in the game, but was never opened due to pathing issues was the plane of war. The zone files are on your computer and you can look at it using a zone viewer. To bad, because it looks like a neat zone. I think the entry to it is the unused stone portal on the far left of the stone circle in PoT.<br />
<br />
CT #2 probably should be a zone revamp I guess, since it is the same zone allthough the content was completely changed. PoH #2 on the other hand is a completely new zone - it isnt a revamp.<br />
<br />
The original maps dont mean anything so far as the zones are concerned. Those extra placenames were not real zones, just there for flavor and potentially as future expansions. If you poke around in the corners of a lot of zones in most expansions you'll find what appear to be zone lines that go nowhere (the tunnel in Stonebrunt, the door in SH, the door at the bottom of the hole, the tunnel in Neth to name just a few). The existance of these doesnt imply that zones were intended at those points, they are just doorway placeholders to future content if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Well the results are in!<br />
<br />
Think that gives a fairly good idea of what people want in regards to expantions.  Was good to see my personal favourate of 'Continuing EQ by Updates only' has got a significant backing.<br />
<br />
Will SONY take this into consideration?<br />
