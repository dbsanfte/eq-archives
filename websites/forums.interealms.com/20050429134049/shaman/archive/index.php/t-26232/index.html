<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I felt the same way about no transfers off of downmoore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can not belive that Frostwolf isn't on there. I'm glad they are allowing moves, but come on. That server goes down more than...well, you fill in the blank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, a server transfer off of Silverlag was the only thing that would keep me subscribing.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty suprised it's not one of the ones listed.  Laggy as all get out, continually down...sheesh.</div></div><hr />

They are not doing all the servers at once. <br />
<br />
I belive they have enough sense to get to all the afflicted servers, but somone somewhere has to be first. As a testbed as well as a learning experiance for the techs and players alike. <br />
<br />
Give it a little time. In this day of fast food and instant dinners noone appreciates the amount of work those poor bastards have to be going through. They know stuff is borked and I am certain that the shmoes that do the real work are not rolling in any of the dough. They are doing alot all at once while getting new people all the time, it has got to be a whirlwind of stress and stepped toes on everywhere.<br />

Snoww/Gadgyt/Feather/Srathor + whoever else I want to play</div></div><hr />

<br />
With all the crap on Silver Hand, we made an alt alliance guild on a brand spanking new server, Eldre'Thalas.<br />
<br />
Guess what... down for emergency maintenance for a good part of yesterday evening.<br />
