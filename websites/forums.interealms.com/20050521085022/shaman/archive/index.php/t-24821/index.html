<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>apocobring1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">did anyone else have bad luck with ssra crashign when their guidl was going for emp?<br />
<br />
i have made 2/4 guild raids on emp we have done (was out of town for the twp that we actually got to fight him)<br />
<br />
but the  2 i have been on the zone has crashed on us while in the insignia room. blood was up so we petitioned GM, but gms can't alter spawns. Fantastic. That coupled with the staggered spawns that were put in in luclin so the euro guilds wouldn't lock down every spawn.<br />
<br />
in my guild alone there are *not including characters on the same account* approx. 100 people if you include multiboxers. there is about 1200 a month alone, but soe can't make one zone reliable for us. is this a trend for ssra, or have we just gotten horrible luck?<br />
<br />
as a guild member put it &quot;it happens once, ok, stuff happens. it happens twice, that is unacceptable.&quot; (btw - this is on the torvon server)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hardware gets screwy sometimes.  You might want to check around with other guilds and see if anyone else has been having trouble with that zone on your server.  I know I tend to go LD a lot in Ssra, and so do several people in my guild.  I think it may be related to heavy scripting in the zone, but who knows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah, ssra has never been all that stable as far as i can remember.  <br />
what is worse than haveing the zone crash is those freak occurances where a guild was fighting emp and all of the sudden emp is killling people at zone in.  i know 1 guild on my server who actually killed him at zone in after another guild wiped in his room.  i find that little bug most amusing now, but when we farmed him nothing pissed me off more.  much love for end game content working as intended :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've never crashed in Ssra, and spent many a month in there.  That was a couple years ago though, so not sure how its acting now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>enokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">SSRA has always crashed for me like no other zone in the game. Think I'm using my 3rd graphics card and my 2nd PC since I started EQ, yet the amazing thing is that SSRA has always been the one zone I crash in. I can LD without warning or lockuo or crash to desktop. Sometimes I can go hours without crashing and sometimes nothing but hours of crashing.<br />
<br />
When I'm bored and need something ultra risky to do, I always go solo deep in ssra, its amazing how often I crash and die.<br />
<br />
My guess about ssra would be &quot;its working as intended&quot; or &quot;currently under evaluation&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I guess the main question here is basically: &quot;Is it crashing for JUST you, for you AND a bunch of other people you play with, or is the zone crashing as a whole in EQ&quot;. <br />
<br />
The initial poster said the zone itself is crashing, which indicates an issue with SOE rather than the individual systems of the people raiding there. This is the first I have heard of this, myself. I raided quite a bit in Ssra a couple years back and it was always a fairly reliable zone. <br />
<br />
My best advice is to continue to /petition, /feedback, /bug the situation, and I also recommend you encourage your guild to do a &quot;Mass E-Mail&quot; about the condition of the zone to SOE. Nothing abrasive or flaming, just have a bunch of people describe the situation. You could also post on the SOE boards, and see if the problem is limited to your server or is also happening on other servers. Sometimes, a particular server gets a definite problem with certain situations that other servers do not experience. A bunch of e-mails from ONE server on ONE zone would probably get a lot of attention. Just remember to keep the e-mails civil. You can also mass /feedback and /bug, but I DO NOT recomment sending a ton of /petitions. This can be detrimental, as it fills the petition queue with a ton of spam, and that can piss of the people you are trying to get to pay attention to your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe the last guild I was in also had problems with the zone crashing when we were in the insignia room/emp room. Also on Torvonnilous. I can't remember for sure if the entire server went down or just the zone though...I believe it was just the zone. It was a few months ago now. We had killed him quite a few times before then with no trouble like this sort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've heard that there &quot;used&quot; to be a way to crash a zone that people were in.. not sure the exact details on it but I know that people have been banned/suspended for doing it.  Not sure if this still is something that you can do, but i'd heard something about at the zoning screen you turn off your computer, which crashes it.  Don't quote me cause I honestly have only heard this secondhand.  But, if you have a close rival or someone that's very interested in camping the Emp spawn it could be related...</div></div><hr />

Used to crash all the time when Thermo famed it on torvo (Thermo, NDR, VW, Hota, and HA were all hitting the zone at the same time) end of last year. 200 people in zone would make it a holy mess with 12 second lag and lots of random crashes. We lost cursed a few times because of the zone crashing mid event. Also had one entire run at HP where he never attacked a single time the lag was so bad. <br />
<br />
There are definately zone wide issues there, at least on certain servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaknab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmm I can't recall ever having problems with Ssra crashing during raids. However mobs &amp; PC's getting shoved through walls and ending up in the basement is a comepletely different story.<br />
<br />
On a side note other zones that seem to have problems are VT, no matter when I go in there with a raid or solo I always get constant spikes. The other night we also had a CoA instance crash on us during a raid, wuwu gogo 2 hour lockout. At least the don't have lockouts in Ssra!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>apocobring1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yeah we have full zone crash on us, characters locked out and all...i guess ssra just can't handle 50 whole people in it =P</div></div><hr />

The local Uber guild on my server is convinced that SOE purposely crashes some of this &quot;high end&quot; content until its completely finished, and rumor has it CoA is NOT done (theres a shocker, eh).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now why does that not surprise me? I get a kick out of how they supposedly &quot;lost&quot; the Item Database for CoA. Lost my ass, my money's bet on it wasn't finished on relase and only went live when they said it had been mysteriously &quot;lost&quot; and then patched it in to supposedly &quot;fix&quot; it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ssra used to crash a lot when we were doing it, but at that time you might have 90 people raiding the emperor and another raid of 60 doing Cursed, with smaller raids doing HP/XTC at the same time.  So 200+ people in zone. I doubt you have that many now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My guild, Shards of Time went through Ssra about 6 months ago and we had all sorts of problems.  He once booted the MT to the zonein, another two times the zone crashed, it's an insanely buggy zone.  On some of those occasions, there may have been other raids going on, think CA was doing XTC or HP one time as we got f***ed while killing emp.<br />
