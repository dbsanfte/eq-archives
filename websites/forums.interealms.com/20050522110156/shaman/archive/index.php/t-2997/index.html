<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I pulled this from another thread that was going off-topic, because I thought it was interesting.  People without it think it's overrated, go figure.  People with it like it.  I have it and I like it a lot.  It's especially useful for recovering from a wipeout.<br />
<br />
Some random tips, which may or may not be common knowledge.<br />
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It takes up to double the mana for the spell.  The most efficient time to cast it is when you have just over the amount normally needed without MGB.  This is what I mean about recovering from a wipeout.  You only have to canni back one cast of Khura's Focus and you can buff the entire raid.<br />
&lt;li&gt;The reuse timer starts counting when you activate the ability, not when you cast the spell.  So, if you know that you will not be casting a group buff for a while you can activate it and just wait.  Then, when you use MGB your reuse time will be less than the normal 72 minutes.<br />
&lt;li&gt;It makes clerics cry, because of Focus + BAotR stacking issues.  They get over it. :P<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
<br />
Here's what other people already wrote in the other thread.<br />
<br />
Gathu:<br />
MGB is just too situational. When I was putting those points in, there were no focus items, and 6.0 torpor annoyed me. I really like 3.0 torpor, and 4.0 celerity, 13.0 gfocus, etc. are all nice as well. If I could remove the last point in it I probably would (thanks focus items making it near useless!), but I don't regret not putting the 9 in MGB at all. <br />
<br />
Plan to get SCR Mastery, SCM3, and Channeling3 before I get mgb. MGB is just a very overrated skill for shamans...it's fun to see all the targets, but just not really that necessary given our mana regen.<br />
<br />
Jing:<br />
I'm doing quick buff before MGB as well. MGB just doesn't help enough I think. We regain mana so fast that focusing a few groups (usually another shaman or 2 on my raids with group focus too) is no big deal at all. I can't justify spending 9 points on it. <br />
<br />
I have run 3, regen 3, MC 3, Cannibalization, Casting Fury 1 (damn that jbb nerf), Spell Casting Reinforcement 3 and Healing Gift 3 (just maxed that last night). <br />
<br />
I'm going up to Quick Buff 2 next, as I have an Essence Lens now, so Quick Buff 3 is a waste.<br />
<br />
Galamann:<br />
For me, MGB is anything but overrated. I am in a guild where we have at least 40 people per raid and i am the only active shaman in the guild. Occationally i get another shaman on the raid, but most don't have malo or torpor. I got MGB before C5 and i think i made the right choice. Raids are alot more relaxing and i stress out alot less. If you are a shaman in a large raiding guild with one shaman, i recomend MGB before anything else.<br />
<br />
Jilariz:<br />
MGB is silly. With Cannibalization, you can cast GFocus every three minutes practically mana free.<br />
<br />
Giac:<br />
For a shaman the usefulness of MGB doesn't lie in the mana he saves through it. <br />
In a world of despawning NPCs, time limits to clear a certain area and the like, the ability of pre/rebuffing fast and save time due to that after a wipe or even buffing on the fly, is of noticable help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">and the timer continues to count when you are offline!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally I went the usual run3 regen3 mc3 cann v route and then went straight for MGB. I've had mgb for about a month and a half or 2 months now and I wouldn't change it. Currently working towards quick buff (probably gonna stop at quick buff 2 since i should have my shissar ring by then). It really depends on your situation tho. I'm part of one of the major guilds on my server that raids a fair bit and seem to end up as the only shaman around far to frequently. Admitedly I can buff a raid fast enough with out MGB to easily beat the clerics buffing thier groupds out. Even do it fast enough to not be too far behind a cleric MGBing but it's alot of effort and I'm constantly casting. MGB makes life alot easier in those situations.<br />
<br />
The other thing where it has been handy is when your looking to beat a despawn timer like with AoW or the ssraa basement. As still the only shaman with mgb it was definitely the right choice for me. I would say tho if you have 2 or 3 shaman around regularly who already have it go for something else. Personally I'd say quick buff but buff reinforcement and Spell casting mastery have thier benifits too.<br />
<br />
And yes I did take a break from aa points after MGB. Compleated some quest, became a grand master smith etc so it has taken me almost 2 months to get 3 points now =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do alot of raiding with my warrior- MGB is the coolest dang thing since sliced bread. Everyone who raids should have it. The drop in prep time is incredible.<br />
<br />
Seeing a raid party of 35-40 people get Aego in one cast makes a believer outta you pretty fast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm in the same situation as Jing, albeit with a lot less AA points. I currently have run3, regen3, mental clarity 3, spellcasting fury 1 (2 points on fury was a small price to pay for the sheer fun of having crit nukes :D My best is 1011 with mage focus bracer.)<br />
<br />
I'm currently working towards massive cannibalization and then going with spellcasting reinforcement 3 and then quickbuff 3. Mass group buff is great for chanters / clerics, but with my ability to cannibalize, and since our raids usually have 2-4 other shamans all with group focus as well, mass group buff isn't a huge concern for me. If I was in a guild with only myself and perhaps one other shaman, then mass group buff would be much more attractive to me. So, mass group buff pretty much boils down to how many shamans your guild fields at raids - if you've got 2+ other shamans who regularly raid with you, MGB is a waste of 9 AA points IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">MGB is esential for some shaman.  I am a solo shaman way too much and it helps me alot.  IF you raid with 3+ shaman usually, don't bother. IF you don't raid at all, don't bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I regularly raid with 6+ shaman (all level 60 - most with MGB), and I wouldn't trade MGB in for anything.  It's still very well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If I accumulated points quickly (yay, got point 24 today) I would get MGB.  Since I don't have a lot of time to get AA points, I would rather spend them on stuff that looks really cool and helpful to ME, and if that's a selfish attitude, I'm willing to live with that.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of two levels of quickbuff, then SCM, then maybe SCR...then, who knows...<br />

At this rate, I'll never make Elder! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My thoughts mirror what Jing said.  As a shaman, you should be able to buff an entire raid w/o mgb easily enough.  You would be better off getting canV QB and scm3 first.  <br />
<br />
The only time it really shines if after a wipe on a *timed* encounter.  Examples would be a second attempt at aow or cursed.  Then its good.  Its also good if you just get annoyed buffing, or if you do a lot of raid leading and cant really deal with the buff requests.<br />
<br />
I havent gotten jaded enough to hate buffing quite yet, so ill wait on mgb till at least QB is done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With cann5, 13sec grp focus casts, and torpor, I can still rebuff the entire raid by myself and be ready faster then the clerics who have MGB. Even on fast despawn mobs like AoW I can get people up to speed and be ready faster then the other mana classes.<br />
<br />
For me MGB will be the last thing I ever get.<br />
All the other skills are so much more beneficial all the time. (cept maybe pet hold :D )</div></div><hr />

But hell, before I quit there was not even group focus, let alone MGB.  I'm sure people remember the fun days of single-cast focus on 40+ people.<br />
<br />
Besides, I only have 2 AA points... MGB is a LONG way off even if I did want it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think it comes down to the amount of shamans you normally raid with. If you have 3 or more per raid, all with group focus, then generally you won't find MGB all that useful, except as pointed out on despawning mobs when you fail once (Avatar of War). The time we failed AoW and we wanted to try again before despawn is the only time I found myself wishing I had MGB. That one time alone still does not justify the 9 points for me.<br />
<br />
Quick Buff 2 here I come. Then maybe Healing Adept (since I have healing gift maxed, adept won't suck quite so much).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&lt;b&gt;Seeing a raid party of 35-40 people get Aego in one cast makes a believer outta you pretty fast. &lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
Apples and Oranges, bub. MGB is quite a bit more beneficial to clerics than it is to shamans. Clerics can't regen mana anywhere near as fast as us, plus group Aego is considerably more mana than group focus. Also, you gotta factor in the peridot cost savings on a MGB Aego. Without MGB, shamans do just fine buffing raids, but if your raid has no cleric with MGB, you'll notice a huge difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Don't take it personal, Jing, but the idea that somebody would classify MGB as not worth the 9 points, because you have only been in one situation where it would have been helpful and then is going to waste 12 points on Healin Adept is quite amusing to me.<br />
Healing Adept might be ok for Druids, but healing for 19 points more at a cost of 6 points for me is something i'd consider if there was a BotB next month and only then. I guess different play styles dictate different &quot;AA paths&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't bothered purchasing Healing Adept yet... <br />
Do you crit the extra amount you heal through Healing Adept ? I.e. are the 38 more HPs you heal due to Healing Adept multiplied with 2 as well ?<br />
Common sense made me think it would work like Spell Casting Fury + Improved Damage so i am kinda curious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, being able to focus 40 people without messing around with tells from group leaders..that's just silly- or how about mgb Shadoo or Jasinth? Man, that's useless :p I mean what use is it having everyone's resistance spells on the same timer? Not like you'd wanna cast it on everyone at the end of buffing or anything, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
With cann5, 13sec grp focus casts, and torpor, I can still rebuff the entire raid by myself and be ready faster then the clerics who have MGB<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you guys never play with a mage or something? You do know clerics can use mod rods- right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Jharassik, the fact that you suggest using shadoo/jasinth shows you aren't real up to speed on the high level shaman game, so I'll not bother arguing it with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Our group spells:  Billy, Shadoo, acumen, Jascinth (the craps for dispellers), regrowth, agi, sta, FoS....<br />
<br />
  So with 7 shaman's in a guild with MGB, you can in the cast time of gFoS (15 sec?) get the whole group preped from shammie side of the field.    Throw in a spare couple of shams with MGB and you can have recasts of Jas and Shadoo, etc. for those dispelling mobs too.<br />
<br />
<br />
    Course, a guild with that many shaman's with MGB that all show up all the time would be a dream.....  &lt;sigh&gt;    Nice dream though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Being in a raid guild, raiding 6 days a week, I have no regrets about going for MGB right after C5. The amount of time and frustration that it saves me is priceless. I can't tell you how frustrating it is to have people not pay attention and just ask group leaders to get the buffs asked for. There are enough times I have cast group focus on the same group multiple times because they all thought that they would ask and not tell each other. Gah! Doesn't help that frequently I am the only shaman there, or one of two shaman that is there. For me it is a Godsend. Did I mention that I also play as a warlord at the same time most of the time? Frequently in the MT position as well =(<br />
<br />
Makes it really frustrating sometimes trying to heal groups of people that are feasting on mod rods, curing curses on tanks, rebuffing ressed people, and keeping aggro on second machine all at the same time. Such is my eq life heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">And actually Jing....<br />

Yeah, no one ever needs any poison or disease resists. <br />
<br />
It's not like Zlandi, Trak,  Sev, all sorts of crap in ssra, harmtouches, lifetaps, debuffs like tash line (off the top of my head) require them or anything, right?<br />
<br />
Who's not up on the high level game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Do you guys never play with a mage or something? You do know clerics can use mod rods- right?<br />
If we wipe, the mod rods are typically long since used up.<br />
<br />
How many mages do you know have mana to make mod rods after a wipeout? How many classes have mana quickly to heal people for modding after a wipeout?...shaman<br />
I still contend that a single shaman without MGB will still be back up to speed with his buffs and manapool long before any of the other casting classes are. <br />
We aren't just talking about clerics here, the enchanters need mana for AE C3, the wizards for nukes....everyone can't rod.<br />
<br />
Question for all you MGB advocates; How do you handle all the late comers and stragglers that show up to raids after you have buffed. Or wait till the last second and force the clerics/casters to move/rebuff?<br />
Or like on an extended length raid or clearing Ntov/PoG where people are always coming and going. Seems to me no matter how good it is, your still forced to cast those single/grp spells on people.<br />
Unless your lazy or the latecomer (wildarr;) ) I think the points are better spent elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Ya..so you don't buff until after you wipe? Wouldn't the whole point of any buffing at all be to do it before you engage whatever your target is? Maybe my experience is just the exception to the rule, but generally mages pass rods to clerics, who buff, modulate, get druid/shammy heals...and...have their mana back.<br />
<br />
As for late comers- scheduled raids are..scheduled..you are expected to be there at a certain time.  Buffing 39 people in one cast and then buffing 1 late person is still tons more efficient than buffing 6 full groups, a minigroup of 2, and a latecomer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Yah, you do only need to MGB after a wipeout and its a race/timed spawn.<br />
<br />
Otherwise casting grp versions of the spell are just fine. It's easy to do and easy to finish long before the other buffs are done. Our spells don't cost anything and mana is basically limitless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">&lt;i&gt;*chuckle* <br />
<br />
Yeah, no one ever needs any poison or disease resists.&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
My point was that a high level shaman would use Epuration, not shadoo and/or jasinth like you suggested. Epuration lasts like 3 or 4 hours (I have casting reinforcement 3), so you don't need to cast resist buffs last like you said. I did not know that Shadoo still stacked with Epuration. However, there's very few mobs that require high PR and DMF stacks with Epuration so it's usually not even necessary to stack Shadoo.<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;harmtouches, lifetaps, debuffs like tash line (off the top of my head) require them&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure HT's and lifetaps are both unresistable when cast on players, so buffing resists to prevent those is silly. I don't know what the hell you're talking about with Tash, being as it's unresistable. Shadoo/jasinth/epuration/lucky rabbit's foot/praying to Joe Pesci all do just as well when trying to resist Tash.<br />
<br />
All this without mentioning the fact that Epuration is only 400 mana with a fairly fast cast time. Epuration buffing time is so trivial that no one would waste MGB on it I'm pretty sure. <br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;Who's not up on the high level game?&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
I think you answered that pretty well.</div></div><hr />

Lets talk<br />
<br />
Zland, Trak, and Sev are not the &quot;high level game&quot;<br />
<br />
When 12 people can kill trak no prob, its not the &quot;high level game&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The high level game, or &quot;crap in ssra&quot; as you put it, is different.  Tash is quite unresistable, and lifetaps and harmtouches are near impossiable to resist.   Disease resist is important for some encounters there, usless for others.  Poison, however, is of no use whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

As for tash, do me a favor. Duel a chanter, and have them tash you. Then, cast cure poison. Tell me your results. It  is poison based. Harmtouches and lifetaps are entirely resistable. You simply have to have high disease resists- remember when they nerfed necro lifetaps way back when? Yeah. No more lure.<br />

Bottom line? If you raid a decent amount, you'll never regret getting it- it will make you a more powerful raiding shaman.<br />

The logic is clearly flawed here.  Not only is tash unresistable, but the fact that it can be cured has nothing to do with anything.  <br />
<br />
You would think, of any class that a shaman would know this after the changes to slows.  Just because you can cure something doesn't mean it is a poison or a disease.</div></div><hr />

As for tash, do me a favor. Duel a chanter, and have them tash you. Then, cast cure poison. Tell me your results. It  is poison based. Harmtouches and lifetaps are entirely resistable. You simply have to have high disease resists- remember when they nerfed necro lifetaps way back when? Yeah. No more lure.<br />
<br />
Bottom line? If you raid a decent amount, you'll never regret getting it- it will make you a more powerful raiding shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do yourself a favor and talk to a Wizard who does pvp and high end content regularly. Lure based spells can and fequently are resisted by pcs but in PVP even with over 300+ resists it's basically unresistable.<br />
<br />
NPCs can resist life taps and HT's but players have no chance vs players or NPCs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Been hashed out pretty well here.  I 100 percent agree that one should get Supercan, QB and SCM over MGB, because even in those few encounters like AoW or Cursed, with these other abilties u can fully buff a raid in under 10 min and be FM.  And that one shaman only.  Will take at least that long for other casters to get mana back to FM and do buffs including if they have MGB.<br />
<br />
The only reason I feel I would have wanted MGB was when AoW was corpse camping me and I was rezzed really late.  This has happned to me twice ever and something that 9 points doesnt justify when the other 3 ablities will help u out so much more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would sure hope that 3 abilities totaling 35 provides more benifit than a single 9 point ability in MGB. Ignoring the cann skill since almost everyone agrees thats the first class skill to get no mater what 9 point MGB vs 30 points for scm and qb. You need to compair = points to = points. MGB vs quick buff 1 &amp; 2 or MGB vs scm 1&amp;2 and QB 1. <br />
<br />
I definitely agree that in general quick buff or SCM is more useful to a shaman but then again they should be they are more general skills. For a raiding shaman who is fequently the only or one of few shaman on a raid I would say MGB is much better than equal points in quickbuff or quickbuff and SCM. For a shaman who doesn't raid much or who typically has 3+ shaman on the raid MGB probably isn't the best choice especially if their are already shaman with the skill.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Im usually one of only 2 shaman at our raids and we raid everyday.  As I said only 2 times ever that I wished I had MGB not at all worth the investment.  Rather even have SCR, Healing AA stuffs and channeling focus over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Damman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">MGB is a fun skill, much like rabid bear.<br />
<br />
MGB isn't close to Cann 5, right. MGB may not be as useful as SCM3 in saving mana. It's still a good time watching Focus go off on 60 people, and it saves a good amount of time should you wipe, which is all I really use it for now. It's been a good skill to have should you raid frequently, as it adds another safety bumper to a Shaman's ability to Focus the crap out of people when the clock is running. I personally got MGB and Rabid Bear just on novelty value, and love using either whenever I can. All that withstanding, I've casted MGB CHA more times than MGB focus.<br />
<br />
In reality, anything outside of Cann5 is mainly for novelty, and MGB doesn't hold much water in terms of *SCM improves abilities 18% per point more than MGB!!* ideals.<br />
<br />
The help that SCM, SCR, QB, provide is anything but unnoticeable, but the difference is small like chipmunk. Just get mental clarity 3, cann 5, and then who cares? Get whatever you want to have fun with, the remaining skills aren't worth getting if you hate exping for AA anyways. Shaman can work around everything else with gear or tactics.</div></div><hr />

It's not like Zlandi, Trak,  Sev, all sorts of crap in ssra, <br />
- If you are getting hit my Sevelak's AE, then you should be the MT. The rest of the party shouldn't be hit by AE. If that's not the case, then you have no clue how to kill Sevelak.<br />
<br />
harmtouches, lifetaps, <br />
- I had a Shadowknight before I canceled that account. No player ever resisted HT. Never. Only a very few select mobs resited the Disease based HT.<br />
<br />
debuffs like tash line (off the top of my head) require them or anything, right?<br />
- Psssssst, Genius, Tash is unresistable. Psssst, Einstein, meaning there is no way in hell you can resist it. Feel free to bump your MR to obliveon, Tash will always land. You can cure Tash with cure poison line of spells, however that won't make it poison based. But hey, you knew that right? I mean all you brag about is the &quot;high end game&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Zorlac, I'll wager dollars to donuts that he meant Severilous, not Sevalak. I think Sevalak AE is magic based anyway, isn't it? He's the one with the annoying mana drain, right? Or is that Cekenar? I get them mixed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Shavas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">What about mgb just purely for fun?  I almost never raid(did the raids I needed for epic and for the most part that's all I've ever done.... hard to scrape up enough game time at once for a raid) but I'm still getting mgb next and I don't have any quickbuff or scm.<br />
<br />
The reason is just to be able to buff whole areas of people like the wc tunnel.  Sounds like nine points worth of fun to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Bah so i misworded, that's not what I meant with tash, it was a bad example(taps/ht are resistable from npc&gt;player- I have resisted them in the past, more than once. Just takes some good resists-and resist buffs). <br />
<br />
So spank  me.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is poison and disease resists are required for end game, I'm done arguing that point(yes, i meant severilous). If you can't think of any situations where they're needed, please proceed to your nearest short bus.<br />
<br />
Jingo, and others against mgb- if you don't want to be more of an asset to your guild(assuming your guild raids a decent amount). Then don't get mgb.<br />
<br />
When the shammies with mgb say they like it and would get it again, and everyone who has firsthand experience with mgb says it's a good thing- it's a good thing.The people saying it sucks don't have it and pretty much lack any experience at all from what I'm reading here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Sevelak is Hoshkar 2.0 in NToV. Same AE, much more HPs but I don't think it gates. You fight him on a ramp, his AE is directional, something in the 1.5k damage range. Only MT is supposed to be hit by it.  And I wouldn't qualify Severilious as &quot;end game&quot;. I also think Cekenar is the mana drain one, but isn't big deal, like 100 mana per AE hit, magic or cold based and easy to resist.<br />
<br />
EDIT: checked it, it's Zlexlax the disease dragon, not Sevelak.</div></div><hr />
