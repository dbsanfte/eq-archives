<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hettar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya, I had a quick question about the new wisdom cap, im sure this has been answered a few times before, but since the board was wiped i was unable to find a thread on it:(. K, here is the question. I heard that for every point of wisdom below 200, you got 11 mana from, and for every point above 200, you got 6 mana. This evening, my friend told me that i was mis-informed and that for every point below 200 you get 6, and that every point over 200 was worth 12. My friend isnt a total idiot, so i wanted to get some input from you fellas before i argued with him about it. Also, are there any clicky snares that shamen can get, other than the troll necklace thingy. Please post and let me know, thanks. <br />

Used to be only 1 or 2 mana per wis no matter what after 200.</div></div><hr />
