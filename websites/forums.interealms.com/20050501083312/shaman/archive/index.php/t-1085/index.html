<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am willing to bet that the new effect that reduces aggro when turgur's lands also increases aggro when it is resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I bet the slow is working as intended, no matter what. Verant handled everything about the slow very nicely. The aggro reduction works wether the spell is resisted or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think that the aggro problem is still with us, compounded by a higher resist rate.  At least that's my impression after a pretty full day yesterday.<br />
<br />
First, we went to CT, and I seemed to generate &quot;undue attention&quot; after slowing, tho resists didn't seem to be a problem.  I just chalked it up to the taunt bug.<br />
<br />
Second, we did The Va'Dyn in Akheva.  I malo'd, got a resist on slow, another shaman slowed.  The fight with VD is long enough that he needs a reslow, which I applied after dinging him a couple of times with Ice Strike.  I believe I got another resist, then reslowed him, and after that he couldn't be taunted off of me by our level 60 ST equipped MA (in addition to a bunch of other guys doing major damage with ST stuff).  Dirt nap Gard.<br />
<br />
Later, we went to NToV to gank Eashan.  Insane resists, I kept asking our enchie if the things were tashed.  Even then, a ton of resists.  Our two pre-60 shamans died multiple times, though they did a good job of getting slows in.  Me, died twice, once on a fatal pull.<br />
<br />
My impression?  No reduction in aggro, but an increase in resists.  Just wondering if this is what other's experiences have been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CT is not exactly the best place to test oout the agro reduction.  That zone is more the exception to the norm.<br />
<br />
Personally I noticed that resisted/held did not generate as much agro as previously.  I did notice that if the mob turns out to be immune (cuz i forgot hehe), then you can forget it.  I had a mob on me for 15 minutes while a dozen melee and 4 of the best equipped warriors could not taunt off me.  So i tanked ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I noticed increased resists with slows from this last patch. I would try 3 times to slow a light blue mob in the Hole, and a chanter 2 levels lower than me could land a slow every time on first attempt, same mob. <br />
<br />
Agro seems to be about the same to me before and after the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sokath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm last night spent an insane amount of time in KC doing Hands/WL (Damn paw still hasn't shown up).  I was able to slow hands first shot almost every time and rarely pulled agroe even on second cast.  Bodyguards, on the other hand agroed alot more, and I knew if first slow was resisted i was gonna get hurt, but never so bad I needed a cleric heal.  On Warlord, I slowed all but one first try was summoned every time, and only got eaten on the one resist.  First caller resisted my slow, summoned me and proceded to beat me within an inch of my life, every caller after that summoned me but never hit me and slow landed every time.  I have to say so far I am pretty happy with this change.  But we'll see after a few days.  All if this camp was a monk as MT BTW to no taunt and he was using a 2HB =)</div></div><hr />
