<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Anytime you hit accept on a collection adventure you're risking giving yourself a headache.<br />
<br />
They can be real fun adventures if the drop rates are good but even when it does seem to be good it can change.<br />
<br />
Last night I was in a collection. Was going great, we were shredding through the mobs and getting pretty decent drop rates. Started to slow down a few times then we got real deep in the dungeon, had over 20 mins left with only two more drops to collect. No problem eh?<br />
<br />
Well.. about the next 15 or so mobs didn't drop anything. We did succeed but only with a few mins left to spare.<br />
<br />
Other times I've done collections with 40 mins left to spare and other times I've done it where even with a good group and high DPS we just couldn't win no matter how many mobs we killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Might be me, but I've noticed that if you try a item collection of 25 or MORE, the drop rates are better and we'll finish with 20-30 minutes left.  Every item collection of 24 or less I've tried has been close with one failure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't mind collection adventures.  Forty-Son is right, though -- take the ones where they want you to collect MORE and it will be much easier.  I think that the total number of collectables is a percentage of the the number you need, so if you need 20 they might put 30 collectables in a dungeon but if you need 30 they might put 45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont like collection. My shaman has done 7 adventures, and my warrior has done about 30 - and in all those times I have only succeeded once on a collection and that was the night before last. And, I was surprised we succeeded because it was a pickup group and, frankly, they were slow as crap. The very first night of LDoN, my warrior and 3 guildies did our first dungeon (collection mission), and we did pretty good for a 4-man group. We had to collect 22 golem skins in Miragul's, but we only had 20 when the timer ran out. <br />
<br />
At least with a slaughter mission, you just kill everything that moves and it counts. Assassinate are too easy - just get to your mob however you can (invis, pacify, etc) and kill him. Rescue are a bit more challenging, but only because you have to clear the path out for the hostage - but I usually win on rescues even before I had maps. Collection are just like slaughter, but you have to hope the area you are slaughtering happens to have been spawned with some of the collection items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Astraa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Could just be me, I've never had a problem with collections. Occasionally we'll have a close one, but all missions are like that.<br />
I'm getting a bit cranky with all the theories I'm hearing every group about some missions being too hard, some dungeons being too hard. Had a Rogue the other day trying to tell me Takish was the hardest dungeon, I could be running though blind but I don't see too much of a difference between them in the number of casters, mob placement etc etc. I can't count the number of people that swear Rescue is the hardest (I don't understand it)<br />
I understand some people have had problems with just not having the things dropping in Collection missions, and if its the case that SoE didn't put enough of the items on the loot tables, and they change it, everyone will be happy.<br />
I'm not gonna believe that every person that fails a collection mission is because collections are &quot;broken&quot; or whatnot, which is what some people want to believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Supposedly at the Fan Faire it was stated by a dev that 1.5 times the number of items you need to collect are randomly placed on mobs throughout the zone.  As streaky as the RNG works, I guess it possible for a big pocket of the items needed to placed very deep in the zone or in a corner off the beaten path.  Never had a problem with collectionsmyself, but I've only done about a dozen or so collections.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've had one that couldn't be completed even in the extra time (and yes that was one of the collect a small number ones). For the first 45 minutes or so we were getting one drop per 10-15 mobs. I've had a lot that have come down to less then 5 minutes remaining. I will not do any more collection adventures until this is fixed. It is completely random and does not rely on your group hardly at all. Why do an adventure that may take you 90 minutes or you could fail completely based off a random number when you could take a rescue or slaughter and pretty much be garunteed to win?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Saraei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">They will probably take that data and nerf the drops in the &gt;25 collection events, knowing them :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I definitely try to avoid collection adventures. I have only failed on 1 collection (Deepest Guk, 30 widgets, took us 90 minutes plus 1 mob to get all 30, we cleared at LEAST 80% of the dungeon in that time. I have had several other collections that come down to the last ten minutes, where we normally finish other adventures in the 40-60 minute range. A 60 mob slaughter takes 45-50 minutes, so I don't see any reason to risk failure with a collection because the widgets won't drop, even if you kill well over 100 monsters. <br />
<br />
All of the other adventure types, you can control whether you win or not. With collection, a substantial chunk of it is out of your hands. There's no reason to risk it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Collection can be really bad or really good. Because it has chance of being really bad a lot of people avoid. The items that are meant to drop, will drop  in sparse and frequent bundles. And some of these trends of sparse bundles can be pretty bad and can push you to the time limit even when you have cleared possibly twice the mobs of a standard slaughter or assassination mission.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The collection missions just irk me.  You can have a great group, kill fast, have no deaths and still get hosed by the RNG.  It's just not worth the hassle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have been on 4 collection missions.  The first on I went on was 2 days after LDoN came out, and I had to collect 35 claws; The claws dropped frequently and my group finished with about 25 minutes to spare.(was in Mistmoore)<br />
<br />
The Second was in Marguls, and had to collect something.  THe group that I had was FAR from optimal and died 3 or 4 times, and then it was decided to call it quits.  Failure because everyone left.<br />
<br />
Third and fourth were both in Mistmoore, and both were the collect 26 fangs.  THe third one was DPS heaven with wizard, mage, rogue, cleric, paladin, and me.  The fangs did not drop fast enough and even though we were ripping through mobs we could not collect them in time.  Fourth was just as good 2bst, warr, sk, cleric, me and we collected 25 fangs when time went.  Bad thing was that the last fnag dropped 2 seconds after the timer ran out.<br />
<br />
Im glad they are letting us /feedback about these.  Ive given them my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've done rather alot those blasted collection missions.  From what I can tell though it can and does become quite streaky with the drops.  I just make sure we systematicly clear the dungeon.  Every time we have done so we have not had any problems getting them all.  Only times we have failed to collect them all doing it that was is when we get rushed and have a couple deaths and must wait for them to return.  Or we go off and completely skip a section/Leg of the dungeon.  I personally do much like killing those boss mobs as our healers tend to like to zone a bit much and allow our tanks to die on them when they start to enrage.  I've yet to try one those rescure missions though.  Might have give them try some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Here is my problem with collection missions: <br />
<br />
I believe each dungeon has approximately 100 - 120 mobs in it.  At 120 mobs, if i take a 26 item collection, then 39 trinkets are placed on those 120 mobs.  That means 1 in 3 mobs has a trinket statistically (120/39 = 3 basicly).  If 1 in 3 has a trinket than math shows i have to kill 78 (26 * 3 = 78).  I can do a slaughter mission and only have to kill 52-58.  Why make myself kill an extra 20 mobs.  Even if the number of mobs in the dungeon is lower, say 100, then you still have 1 trinket per 2.5 mobs.  26 * 2.5 is 65 mobs, which is still 8-12 more than what a slaughter mission requires.  For the collection mission to work, based on the system SOE described at the fanfaire, the dungeon (for a 26 trinket dungeon) would have to have 78 mobs in it (39 Trinkets itemized allowing a drop rate of 1 per 2 mobs for a kill requirement of 52 mobs).  I know for a fact that the dungeons have more than 78 mobs.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'd like to see collection removed and replaced with escort or something.  Even if they did fix the itemization (I'm not holding my breath), mission success would still be far more dependant on the RNG than, say, slaughter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Don't know if its the same point Quinn is making btu I want to say this. Collection adventures are ok depending on how big the dungeon is. We did a small dungeon today, we had to collect 23, at the start it was very much looking bad, but as we got nearer the end the droprate increased a lot. <br />
<br />
So it seems instead of if being random if you think about a set number being in a dungeon, if its a large dungeon and only 23 are given the chances are you will fail if you have a unlucky run. But if its a small dungeon, the more of it you progress through the more likely that the rate will balance itself out. So when less than 25 collections quests are given out it needs to be ascertained that the map it gives with it is a relatively small dungeon for there to be a typical and normal chance of passing like any slaughter/assassination mission.</div></div><hr />
