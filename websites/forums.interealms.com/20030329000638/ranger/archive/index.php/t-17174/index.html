<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rakhal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hate it when level 20-33 range people leave the group for extended periods of time to get C3. I's happened when my alts have grouped with others in Paludal Caverns, Highpass Hold, Overthere, etc.They'll leave for 10-20 mins to gate/port to nexus in the hopes of donating for a C3, but these days they also expect &quot;premium&quot; looting priviledges (such as allowing them to loot every mob intheir turn with split off) to feed their habit. Try to explain to them that it's not crucial and they'll whine about how keeping melee classes healed/buffed or nuking/slowing at the rate they've been going at is impossible without C3. Try to tell them to med more and nuke less or slow down our pulls for more downtime and they'll go off about how their level 51+ halfling druid main knows all the tricks of the game, blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bellia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While I adore C3 (KEI on other servers), I have noticed something... it allows for sloppy play.  When I have C3 on my cleric, I refer to it as &quot;throwing my mana around&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just like it's clerical counterpart, Aegolism, C3 is a high level spell that is being used to &quot;break&quot; the low-level content.  I also have a 34 (almost 35) druid.  At 30-33, I was taking on reds, solo, and ending the battle 20m down from where I started.  Med for 30 secs/1 min, and back up to full.  That's just... wrong.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure it can be fixed though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Amdee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It could be fixed if the spells could not be cast on low level chars, much like many single target buffs. The group nature of these buffs makes them &quot;exploitable&quot;, although I think SOE actually desires this. More of the &quot;make the game too easy&quot; stuff we've seen since the loss of The Vision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its called C3 on all servers from my knowledge. O.o  When I used to go shouting around while on my enchanter with &quot;Anyone want some KEI as I'm passing through?&quot; the zone would either stay quiet or I would get a &quot;Whats KEI?  May I get some C3 please?&quot; from the surrounding level 50+ folks.  O.o<br />
<br />
But I haven't had this problem on my alts.  If I ever did I would tell them to hold their horses while I loaded the enchanter up (no matter how pushy ugly they got).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Elladan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Chamcham ... boy, haven't seen her in a long, long time.  Think we grouped in FM a while back ... before they even had KEI.<br />
<br />
Me, I don't get buffs from other folk unless we are grouped.  I try to be rather self-reliant, and do a fairly good job at it if I say so myself.  In fact, I think the ONLY time I asked for a buff was when I had to take Hobbletoe up through Nek in his late teens while naked.  I accept buffs, however, and offer something if I know there is a regent cost to it, or just dump what buffs I can on them.  I have been known to just dump buffs on folk while they are out soloing as well ... SoW, SoN, CoE, Chloroplast (if they are high enough), SlD.  Ranger buffs will help them out, but not to the extent that Aego or KEI does.<br />
<br />
I don't get buffs off of people because a) I'm perpetually broke and b) I'd rather have the feeling of accomplishing something myself, then just accomplishing it.   Call me odd, call me weird, but I don't play for power, I play for the fun of talking to friends, and actually making it through a battle on my wits (such as they are).<br />

<br />
I know what you mean. I can admit that when a friend dropped an Ancient aego on Trevawn once, I almost had a cow. Now I'm trying to find friends to give me the hat trick of buffs (Vallon's quickening, Blessing of the Nine + Kazad's Mark, KEI, spirit of the predator, focus of the seventh, ) just to see how crazy I can get with it. As far as needing the buffs, nah. They just reduce downtime (which I think was the whole point).<br />
<br />
Makes me laugh to see how dependent low levels are on it though.</div></div><hr />
