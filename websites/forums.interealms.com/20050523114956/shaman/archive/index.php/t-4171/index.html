<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In KC last night, basement, happily killing away on my horse...when I peek my head thru the wall and notice a spectral turnkey up. So I decide to leave my current spot and clear towards it. I always click my horse off to go pull...too much of a pain in the ass otherwise. Anyway, I pull a spec. knight, pin myself into a corner, cast the horse, and, POOF, I am at the zone in area of KC right in the middle of some weaknut train! ( I was shrunk)<br />
<br />
Just a heads up at least, I found it to be annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Antoher thing with horses.. I think invis no longer works. That is.. NPC's can see your horse or something. Just a rumor I heard from a guildmate who has a horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Invis has always worked on a horse for me. But other people have reported problems, so I wouldn't rely on it.<br />
<br />
Other amusing horse bugs include the time when a groupmate's pet decided to attack my horse.<br />
<br />
My theory is that the horse, which is a seperate game entity, &quot;redirects&quot; targetting information to the rider. If you click on someones horse, your target sometimes shows &quot;Soandso's mount&quot; for a split second before it changes to &quot;Soandso&quot;. Factors such as lag possibly mess up the redirection, causing mobs to target horses instead of players.<br />
<br />
Well that's my theory anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i'm guessing you have an inky mask?<br />
<br />
There is a bug with horses and illusions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I once was riding a horse and zoned out of CT.  I was stuck in the ceiling of that tunnel then.  I had to type /dismount to be able to move again . . . and then the horse followed me around on foot until I zoned again.  Was truly odd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Another wierd thing about horses .... they create a small, invisible lump on the ground right at the spot where you summon them. If you run into one of these lumps, you're at the spot where a horse was summoned.<br />
<br />
So ... don't summon horses right in the middle of camp. Those lumps make movement difficult!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh my god! That is what those things are. I was thinking that those things were following me around. LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">invising yourself while on horse doesn't do much unless you get rid of the horse before you move(many a train started this way :P)  Yeah that invis lump on the ground sucks to move through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Konnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I actually managed to get my pet to attack my own horse in ME - took me a while to realise it too - it was back when you could still summon a horse with the graphic disabled. Everyone thought it was hilarious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Runja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was running from the Wiz spires in NK to SK on my horse when I pass through the Qeynos guard house on the bridge and see:<br />
<br />
Guard Westyn says 'Time to die Runja's Mount.  You've ruined your own lands, but you won't ruin mine.&quot;<br />
Guard Oystin says 'Time to die Runja's Mount.  You've ruined your own lands, but you won't ruin mine.&quot;<br />
Capt Linarius syas 'Time to die Runja's Mount.  You've ruined your own lands, but you won't ruin mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
I guess the size of my horse's droppings have become legendary...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">.... they create a small, invisible lump on the ground right at the spot where you summon them. If you run into one of these lumps, you're at the spot where a horse was summoned. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thats from the horses? Thanks Soupy - wondered what they heck was going on - had just put it down to VI programming ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I use my horse while invis all the time and have never had any problems....  Course she's one of the fastest variety, so maybe I'm just outrunning them before they agro or before they can hit or yell.  Everything I con has always been indiff, except for stuff that sees invis anyway.  But I know that doesn't *necessarily* mean anything.<br />
<br />
I've noticed that business of getting bumped across the zone though.  My theory is that it has to do with water...they don't like crossing it.  Sometimes my horse is willing to walk/jump into the water and just poofs when I submerge (various rivers, some drop-offs), but sometimes she won't even step into it unless I'm levitated (most annoyingly Halas).  I once tried summoning a horse while on the raft in Halas (onto which she won't walk) and got bumped to the front gate.  With the water all around in Karnors and you tucked into a corner, maybe that's what got you, Krakster.  She also will only step onto some docks that are stationary but stick out over water.  She's ok in Firiona, not in Halas.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Last time I tried using Bind Wound on my horse it locked up my controls and I had to camp out. (tried it 3 times actually to look for an easy fix, but no go)<br />
<br />
I don't recall reading anyone mentioning anything about this yet.  Perhaps it's just me.  It'd be great to be able to bind while mounted.  I'm sure I've just missed threads on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mukumuku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Isnt there an item that summons horsies?<br />
the Black ??? Girdle ... i want one</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bullwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">My horse attacked a sitting druid during a CoM Reaver raid. At first it was funny (horse had good taste at least) but it soon became tiresome. Druid_01 says &quot; Come on this isnt funny anymore Bull, i can't med can you call your horse off please.&quot; <br />
<br />
Clicking off the horse buff and camping out and coming back didnt make it stop.<br />
<br />
Funniest memory i will have of that raid is the Main Tank calling out..<br />
<br />
&quot;All Attack Bullwolf's Mount &quot;<br />
<br />
Poor old Nag took a early trip to the glue factory that night, much to the amusement of my guild.<br />
<br />
My only regret was having the horsie models turned off at the time so i couldn't see the whole thing and get some memorable screen shots.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note i have locked myself up pretty good when trying to bind wounds on horseback, I normaly have to hit esc alot, sit and stand up then zone or camp afterwards to get back to normal. While on the subject of horse type bugs i have to say that falling over the summoned invisible horse speed bump does get annoying.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it makes a diff , but i had purchased the cheap and slow, but still very useful horse.<br />
