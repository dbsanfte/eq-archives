<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jenavyra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I was playing this weekend (at my lowly level of 9), and I got a mission to look into the Lost.  Most of you have probably seen them before; I hadn't.  I run around in King's Row for a while, trying to find some, and eventually make my way over to King's Garment Row or whatever, where I find myself some Lost.  As I'm fighting a group of three, 2 scroungers and a Head Rifleman, I found myself thinking, &quot;Dude, I *want* that guy's plasma rifle!  Why doesn't the assault rifle blaster power look more like *that*?&quot;  Then I ran into a Head Swordsman with plasma buster sword in hand and stop sign breastplate, accessorized with tires for shoulder plates.  These guys are awesome!  I wish I had a screenshot..  Maybe I'm just making a big deal over nothing, but this is easily the coolest &quot;mob&quot; set I've run into in a game.<br />
<br />
So, anyway.. I guess i'm just curious what your favorite villian types are, and what things you might like to see in CoV (just wish-lists, obviously we don't really know what they're doing with CoV yet).  I for one would like to see some of the Lost textures made available - I really want a Stop-Sign for a chestplate.. I mean, really really. *grin*  And I've not even gotten to the later stuff; I can only hope that higher up villians continue to be as cool.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, as for favorite type so far, having wandered my way only up to 15, I can say that the spectral demon lord ghostie things are my favorite so far, though I don't expect to see those on the playable character creation screen.  *grin*<br />
<br />
I've had that same thought with the TV-heads and the trolls.  I hope they really go nuts with the types of faces/heads you can use in CoV.  (dangit, I STILL look at that and see claws of veeshan)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a love hate relationship with Tsoo Sorcerers. On one hand, they look cool and use their powers well. One another hand, they are bitches to fight, because they use their powers well.  <br />
<br />
The upcoming giant robots look pretty awesome. <br />
<br />
I wish there was an evil midget faction though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wouldn't be surprised if they created an evil midget faction, Flabbo... send em feedback!  *grin*</div></div><hr />
