<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All,<br />
<br />
I recently dinged 63 and realize that all of my buffs are now 61+, therefore my old Extended Enhancement focus item is no longer doing me any good.  I thought I might be able to compensate by using the tribute system, however, from what I've read, the EE focus provided by the tribute system, Persistent Boon, caps at level 60 spells, or EE III.  Can anyone verify that this is accurate?  There does not seem to be many (only saw one) level IV focus effect in the tribute system.  Is this right?  And if so, any suggestions on the best way to get EE IV.  I already have a good range item, so the Ceramic Shield of Valor would not be my first option.<br />
<br />
Any info would be greatly appreciated, since it will impact my next purchase.<br />

Drops ring of firewarding. Nice gadget for an easy camp.<br />
<br />
That said, until SoE nerfs the tribute system, which will probably accompany the &quot;enhancement&quot; tomorrow, get all the focus you like from Tribute. Goes up to Focus IV. Flickers on my spells, so i'm assuming it works.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys.  Yeah, the necro list was the one I referenced, from the same shammy thread.  Just wanted to confirm that this was accurate and up to date.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, looks like the ring will be on my list of gear to camp.  I have a Ceramic Shield of Valor, so it is only a little inconvenient swapping it out with my totem when I need to cast long buffs (usually only once every hour or so).  So that will do for now.<br />
<br />
Thx,<br />

blazz  those tribute values are kinda not up to date :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It takes a lot of time, but you can reference tribute values from Lucy under the item search.  LUCY (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/) <br />
<br />
I think droga has the best tribute per time spent.  Many of the named in droga drop items worth 10-15-20-25k tribute points and you can collect the drops in a relatively short period of time.  Can net 50k tribute or more in a three hour stint.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">also veksar  is a good sourse of tribute too :P &quot;gomduig&quot; ~</div></div><hr />
