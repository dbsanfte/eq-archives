<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bcarshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 55.76 Shaman on the Nameless, and usually 2box with my 52 monk, though do alot solo as well.  I also have a RL 65 Cleric friend who will group with me when our schedules match.<br />
<br />
I have read several places about good exp for my level in Old Sebilis, and have been there twice, and hunted the Iskar Necros / Gangrenous Scarab.<br />
<br />
We'd like to learn more about the zone, because I understand it to be a really good place for my level.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a good guide, or have any details about the camps, what it takes to break them, etc. etc. etc.  There aren't too many people hunting there these days, so at any given time, most of the zone is available.  (Barring the need for a rogue, of course)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nikkei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi there, earlier today i was in sebilis with my 53 SK, we fought our way to the necrocamp, and it was really fun to go to yet another indoor zone, i like places like seb, velketors labyrinth, veksar and chardok.<br />
<br />
Anyway, here is a map of the place i found on the net, it has the froggies marked in red squares (tho i think some wanderers are missing) and some of the camps/named ones marked to.<br />

Hope it´s of any use for you, and happy froghunting :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 55/52 combo best advice is start at zone in and start working thru the content. Seb is one of the great zones, IMO.<br />
<br />
Casters are shaman/necro/wizard/enchanter ... shaman and wizard are the most common.<br />
<br />
Mobs are old world dmg and hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Mobs do add and at your levels you will generally get a minimum of 2 per pull - given the probability of a caster being one mob, FD splitting will get interrupted often (FD ... casting mob spell hits after.)<br />
<br />
One of the nice factors - the best, IMO - is the zone itself defines where to go and what to do. As you progress deeper the difficulty increases.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Seb is still my favorite zone in the entire game.  Took some Guildies down to Juggs last week and did some spell farming.  Forgot how much I missed that place /wipes tear from his eye.  (A couple of them didn't even know there was a second level....I know I know....I just shook my head too).<br />
<br />
Anyway, avoid this zone if you don't have the Cleric with you.  At level 55, the risk vs. reward is not worth it unless you are going there simply to get away from idiots or to have a little fun.  Exploration past NGE at your level is dangerous to say the least.  But if must go there, keep your Magic resist up at all times.  Having an Enchanter turn your Monk against you may discourage you from ever returning to this magnificent dungeon.<br />
<br />
I would love to tell you all about the zone, but it would take many hours.  When the Cleric is on, you could probably make it all the way thru the first floor....minus the Crypt of course.  Take advantage of those times to learn the zone, then duoing there will become quite simple in later levels.  Then you can plunge down to the 2nd level and start all over again.<br />

It also yields the best loot for shammys in that level, the JBB. clicky 268 DD bracer always comes handy. Hierophantcloak and the bardsword are still nice toys to sell or use.<br />
<br />
Sebilis is a great place to be</div></div><hr />
