<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chelesa_Reborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I'm going to be leading a raid soon in Plane of Storms.  http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2274<br />
The information given there leaves a lot to be desired.  I was wondering if any of you have done this quest and if you could give some more information.<br />
Thank you,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As I understand it, this is a huge waste of time.  It's a 3 hour raid event and all you get is a &quot;decent&quot; necklace that is nowhere near good enough to warant the 3 hour time commitment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild tried this once.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Save Relv's Forest Quest&quot; is really just the event to reach the 4th Giant Lord of Storms. Falto, Lord of Thunder is every bit as tough as the other 3 giant Lords in Storms (he looks like one of the West-Wing &quot;Brann&quot; giants in BoT, which otherwise do not appear in Storms). He also spawns adds throughout the fight like the other Lords. If you wipe on Falto, you will have to wait for a graveyard recovery and will not get a second shot at him (since he is in a sub-zone that you are ported to).<br />
<br />
I would recommend trying this only with a raid force that you are sure can beat the Giant Lords in the Forest / Coastal / Desert camps. At least on those guys, you can try to rez / rebuff and go again if you wipe.<br />
<br />
If you do this event, make sure to kill the Mephits away from the zone walls. If you kill a Mephit near the zone wall, it can spawn it's splits inside the wall, which will make it impossible to spawn Falto without petitioning a GM.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chelesa_Reborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you for the information, I appreciate it.  I know that the quest isn't rated as being a great one but my guild is fairly strong and if you saw my magelo you would see that almost anything besides a cloth choker is better than my current neckpiece. :P  Just something I'd love to have a go at.  Thank you again for the info, can't wait to see how it goes.</div></div><hr />
