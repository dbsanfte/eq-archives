<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kusai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
How would a lvl 55 Troll Shaman do in Plane of Disease or Plane of Nightmare?<br />
<br />
I duo him with a lvl 62 Monk and was thinking about getting out of Velks and taking him to POD.<br />
<br />
1) Would Slow stick consistently there at lvl 55?<br />
<br />
2) Would of have to Resist debuff the mobs there first or just slam slow on them?<br />
<br />
3) also, what mobs in those zones you recommend I take on?<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance<br />

Finding resists aren't all that bad, expected worse, just dinged 56 today in PoN, was in PoD later doing spiders on second ledge.<br />
<br />
Recomend though haveing both turgurs and torgors up, if resist on turgurs you can cast torgors while its refreshing if your not getting interrupted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i do PoN and PoD all the time (just dinged 55 last night), and while slow doesnt stick every time for me, it doesn't stick for my level 60 shaman friend every time either. It does stick the majority of the time and I am definantly a contributing member of the party. We killed near the hedge in PoN recently, and that is such a great camp, was there for about 4 hours. I don't really like PoD as much, the xp seems slower.</div></div><hr />

Generally smarter to just mal-x if the first slow bounces.<br />
<br />
Mobs in POP hit hard, and you dont want to pull aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It'll resist a bit on most yard trash mobs, then again I've had nights with not one single resist and I'/ve had nights with 5 resists in a row.<br />
<br />
Just keep yourself hp buffed and ac buffed and take the hits like a troll! Get that mob slowed b/c if it isn't slowed your grp is screwed and one rez is a lot better than 6. <br />
<br />
Most of the time I can get agro after slowing it then I just root it and I never get hit.<br />
<br />
The only main problem can be if it resisted and agroed on you but I've still rarely died from that. <br />
<br />
Keep away from the lvl65 guards near the hedge though ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: Damn ancient Sig</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Im 52 and ive been fighting with groups on the wall in PoN, slow rarely resists and noones complained.  Slowers are in enough demand in PoP that a low-mid 50s shammy is better than no slower at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taldur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have been doin PoN, PoI, and PoD since 52, im 55 now.  Id say about 1/5 of the mobs resist a slow or 2, but none have totally resisted.  Even the mobs in the courtyard in PoD, most were red and yellow, I was landing easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i have been int pon since 52 ... dinged 58 last night ... taken me 2 weeks for 6 levels .. just be sure to stand next to the tank .. you will get agro when slow lands ... and you can not be main healer ... dont let them say otherwise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">PoN near the gobbo river we were pulling hobgoblins saturday afternoon.  90% of the time I'd land slow first try, occassionly get some agro, usually not but I'd stand next to the tank to not ping-pong the mob (had a rogue for some nice damage).<br />
<br />
Every once in a while I'd get a resist, take a round of two of beating, wait for tank to build up more agro, slow, resist and then never get agro off me until a) I was dead  b) channeled the 3rd slow or c) cleric healed me so much mob went after him.<br />
<br />
We even had a 59 mage in group tossing her mal-X on the mob and there was just the occasional one that refused to be slowed.  By time the 3rd slow was resisted it was better to quit trying &amp; use my mana healing because the mob was at or below 50% life by then.<br />
<br />
Hedge mobs were no real problem slowing tho.   Occassional resist but usually stuck the 2nd time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, overall I end up tossing malosini on when inc, and then slowing, as I tend to group with casters a lot, and they love us for Mal*.<br />
<br />
Overall, no probs.  Often if 'sini bounces, slow still sticks.</div></div><hr />
