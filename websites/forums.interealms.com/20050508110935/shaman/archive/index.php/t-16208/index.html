<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, if you look here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=259), you will see UgZug's AMAZING alchemy guide.<br />
<br />
<br />
 There is one SERIOUS flaw with it though...<br />
<br />
<br />
  Look at the LOW reputation he has, and the TON of posts praising him.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I know that Jaruden posted a bit talking about reputation (here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=12845&amp;highlight=reputation)), and I know that I didn't read it, and most of you probably didn't...  I figured I would learn soon enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
  On the lower right hand corner of the post, there is a yellow box with a guy shouting in it.   if you like, or REALLY hate, a post, click on that and add to the fellows Rep... Cause honestly Ugzug should have a couple screens worth of Rep by now, and that means there are probably other posts out there with no proper credit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I disapprove of this post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I honestly have no clue why you would dislike a post explaining some of the features this forum offers, but so far plenty of people agree with you and are at the same time demonstrating that they now know how to give reputation :)<br />
<br />
<br />
   Only thing I can guess you hate about it so much is that it seems like a plug for alchemy, and you all just HATE alchemy.   I was pointing out that one thread as an example to prove the fact that very few people seem to utilize Reputation, not saying &quot;UgZug is a GAWD, bow down before his might!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
  But hey, if people took it that way I don't mind a couple dozen negative rep, I just would like people to use the feature more often so that credit is given where it is due and newcomers can readily identify who is helpful/well informed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Caanus I would wager he / she was being facetious. Yes it's an awesome guide. No I don't need to be told to give Ug &quot;mad props&quot; - I do that when people on Xev ask me about alchemy.<br />
<br />
/r Go to www dot interealms dot com and look up Ug's alchemy guide<br />
<br />
Honestly, do you sleep better at night knowning you have a high rep from people you've never met here on SC?<br />
<br />
I mean a good bunch of us have been coming here long enough, we get on each other's nerves like a family Thanksgiving reunion.<br />
<br />
Glori is going to get pis.sy about where people park (Their sigs)<br />
Krak is gonna tell you not to eat meat (The vegetarian / JBB)<br />
Litgruv is gonna be the guy driving a Porsche wearing ripped blue jeans and a torn &quot;I'm with stupid t-shirt&quot; (His Magelo)<br />
Mojokyn and a couple of others are gonna be knee deep in debt but sporting trophy dates and expensive cars (The Ubers)<br />
Blargx among others is gonna dominate the conversation because like it or not - they make sense.<br />
Mill is the drunk relative who brings one 6-pack and drinks 3, then tells the same ol stories year in and year out. (Then pukes in your bathroom, apologizes profusely and hits on your 16 year old daughter)<br />
<br />
We're gonna lament the passing of Sam, Tudamorf (The annoying one - who was right more often than not - but still annoying), Eduin (who was more annoying than Tuda, but still missed), and Talamay Crystalspirit  who had the great tips write - up.<br />
<br />
Frekkels will be the responsible one, Land will piss some people off but be right more than he is wrong.<br />
<br />
And I apologize to anyone who is a contributor and I overlooked. <br />
<br />
PS And Bracey will be the crazy ol aunt we keep in Glori's basement because she (Bracey not Glori) keeps talking about time and wears a hat made out of aluminum foil.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;I started singing, anything I could do to distract time.&quot;<br />
<br />
My wife and I looked at each other and said, &quot;Bracy!&quot;</div></div><hr />
