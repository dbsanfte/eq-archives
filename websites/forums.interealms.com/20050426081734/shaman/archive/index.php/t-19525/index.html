<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if anyone has tried soloing regular mobs, and named, or doz in HoT?<br />
Tried search, and didnt find anything,( although not to hard =p ).<br />
<br />
Any feedback is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i think someone soloing Doze would be truly exceptional. But i am sure the trash could be done, maybe the named drakes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dozer would be an impressive solo but I wouldn't find it hard to believe either. All dozer does is a single slot dispell. Bring a telescope or some other item that is insta clicky and then he is pretty simple - fully slowable, doesn't resist for a damn and doesn't exactly  have a boatload of HP. No doubt would a shaman be able to live through his melee, he triples for about 600, and once slowed that's pretty pathetic. However it would be a fight of stamina, basically, as quiescence could probably keep you healed but the quest is if your mana pool can transform into enough damage to kill him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">trash is doable, i could see doz being done. tough fight till slowed.<br />
biggest problem i would see are the drakes, i can drain my manapool and still not slow one.  the resists to magic and disease slow are outragious.  even at 65 they can eat through me pritty fast.  Flurry drakes are straight up rape.  i can't see a flurry drake getting soloed unless you get some lucky slow lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maybe with the new GoD slow (further -40 resist) it'd be possible to get the drakes. Otherwise, yep they're gonna cause pain.<br />
<br />
The gating mobs will be big trouble too, have to fire off spiritcall for the last 30%, but doubt you'd be able to have the dps to kill em before SC ends.<br />
<br />
Doze - uh, don't think so. First off, doze does resist slow sometimes, and I really doubt you can live through even one resist. And you're not going to have tash/oos/hos on either. Secondly, the AE is not as easy to resist as the standard mobs, ok maybe if you're EP/Time equipped you'd resist, dunno really, but I got hit a lot by it (no bard but then you're talking solo).<br />
<br />
Lastly doze has a lot of hp, quiessence is only 300/tick and doze hits quite hard - I'm not convinced  quiessence would be enough to keep up with her slowed dps.<br />
<br />
Overall I think your main problem will simply be getting slow to land before you get torn apart :) But even if you manage that I'm not sure you could keep up the healing with quiessence - and if you start using tnarg's you'll likely be oom long before doze is out of hp.<br />
<br />
Mini named would be pretty easy I'd think, getting em single might be a problem in some cases though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Regular mobs doable but tough, they're resistant.  Good resists will negate most of their ae, and they only hit for 300's?  You can't solo doze.  AE is unresistable (500 dmg), he quads for 900 plus a proc.  Even if you landed slow, you'd be dead before you could chain tnarg yourself oom.  He has over 150k hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think anyone could currently solo dozeker.  His regen is insane.  I just don't think that a shaman could out damage it.  Like to be proven wrong tho so let meknow how it goes.</div></div><hr />
