<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know a lot of us are concerned with the latest in P}{4t L3wtz and upgrading our gear. Many also proudly display their uber pixels in a link to Magelo. (Shameless plug).<br />
<br />
But, in the interest of charity, and to keep a semblence of humor - what is the WORST set-up you have ever seen, Magelo or otherwise.<br />
<br />
Besides mine (I'm twinked for Kunark era), I remember Litgruv's. (No offense Lit). The ironic thing was Litgruv had done all these wonderful solo feats with what I would consider, ahem, &quot;sub par&quot; gear.<br />
<br />
Then there was the Troll Druid I grouped with in Sebilis Jail awhile back. No seriously. It wasn't the RMB's on the wrist or the nice urine colored boots, nor was it the Velium Jasper rings, It was ALL of them. And an unwillingness to Cann. (&quot;If I get aggro I tend to die.&quot;)<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey&quot; (I was on my Enchanter) I says, &quot;Have you ever been to Shamans Crucible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the Troll Druid replied, &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I'm a robe class and my AC unbuffed is almost as high as yours buffed.&quot;<br />
<br />
(Course I did meet a Charisma Enchanter once who had a whopping 330 AC. She got aggro once and died faster than you can say: Froglok PWNG)</div></div><hr />
