<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night hunting in HoT I had a Corroded chain tunic drop which I was asked if I wanted. I naturally said yes and looted the tunic... I go LD and the server is LOCKED when i return to logon. When the server came back online they did a roleback and my corroded chain tunic was gone. I petitioned a GM and he said they dont return items lost due to roleback, *%^*&amp;%^<br />
<br />
Anyway on to my question.<br />
<br />
I am number 1 on the list for a Corroded chain tunic from ToV and number 3 on the list for a Chesplate of Vindication. We kill vindi and hunt HoT alot but i am thinking i will see the Vindi Breatplate sooner. which would you guys go after?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">vindi hands down, won't bother to take a chain bp from someone who would actually wear it and not replace it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Vindi<br />
<br />
- stats are better<br />
- effect is way better, RH as a buff is obsolete.<br />
- rangers and rogues can't wear vindi, you can, spread the love around a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Vindi Bp all day long! I have the SS bp but only b/c a Vindi was nowhere in my near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">wolfcallers!  Vindi BP is ugly.  :p<br />
<br />
Relevent Stats?<br />
<br />
Vindi BP = 45ac, 160hp*, 0mana, 15sv all, 3 regen per tick.<br />
Wolfcallers = 43ac, 69hp*, 180mana#, 4sv all.<br />
<br />
<br />
The effect on Wolfcallers is less useful now.  It is handy before you have the new sta buff and I still find myself using because its mana free and i dont have to sit down to mem a spell.  I find that Boar is sometimes a waste because a lot of people still cap sta at 65.<br />
<br />
* = If you are below 255 sta.  Sta over 255 gives less than 2hp per sta.<br />
# = If you are above 200 wis.  Wis below 200 gives more than wis above 200.<br />
<br />
<br />
After wearing the wolfcallers for so long and planning my HP goals around having it as a BP, I feel like I would personally miss the mana on it.  I know a lot of shaman say they never go OOM.  I say they aren't doing enough then.  ;)<br />
<br />
Personal choice.  If I was wearing something else now, I would choose Vindi over Wolfcallers.  I just don't really feel like making a lateral change for mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">vindi BP all the way, I got a wolf callers way back in the day and thought it was the bomb till I saw a vindi bp drop (my guild hunted HoT but hardly ever killed vindi) Anyway vindi owns wolf callers in 3 major depts.<br />
hp / sta .. this is your primary goal as a shaman hp lets you live longer and canni more safely.<br />
resists .. 15 to all saves thats 75 total resists, very few items end game or not have that much resistance<br />
effect .. 2hp regen any kind of hp regen(worn) you can stack on yourself stacks so all you can wear the better.<br />
<br />
I am still wearing vindi BP with wolf callers in a tink bag, and will probably still be wearing it until the far distant future when I get an elemental bp pattern.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">vindi hands down. if you want some sort of CR bp or wolfcallers style bp you will pick one up in pog when your guild starts doing tunar :)<br />
<br />
btw wear vindi and have the other one banked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">vindi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I gotta agree... Vindi BP<br />
<br />
I spent months getting my Kael Quest BP (Spirit Callers), then picked up the Vindi in a single easy kill -I havent worn the Spirit Callers since.  The HPs, resists, and regen are very nice.<br />
<br />
If your guild is paying attention,  you can get a vindi kill every day and outfit your guild in BPs very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Vindi for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">vindi <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
... i keep my wolfcallers banked for doing tradeskills<br />
<br />
id wait the extra time for the vindi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was cocky...I passed on every chain BP that droped in HoT last year, kept sayin I would get a Vindi instead.  My guild had not even managed to kill Vindi yet at the time, hehe, though we had a few close attempts.  But when we finally did kill him, he had the BP and they gave it to me. Still wearing it almost a year later...not very many items that can replace it. With cannV I need all the HP I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmmm...Stackable AoB +100hp +15 to all resists vs about 180 mana.  What was the question again? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would be happy with either.<br />
<br />
Guild has not yet attempted Vindi.<br />
<br />
After 4 months of ToV, no chain boots legs or BP have dropped.<br />
<br />
Sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ya, I spent about a year doin HoT on and off before I finished my skyshrine off, minus the BP. Saw only 3 chain BP drop. I got the second legs I saw drop...it was actually after Vindi and I had to get faction up because we were starting to do west wing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">another vote for Vindi here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Best way I have ever seen to get armor is to roam around ToV killing as you go.  For all the hours staying in one spot I saw very few drops, but the drops wandering ToV have always been great.  HoT may be a bit different than the rest of ToV, but I would not be shocked to find out that mobs deeper in have a better chance of dropping armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I noticed that too.  Roaming seemed to give us better loot, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well I am a proud owner of a Vindi BP :) Thanks for the input.<br />
<br />
If your guild is paying attention, you can get a vindi kill every day and outfit your guild in BPs very quickly. <br />
<br />
We actually farm vindi so we have had 3 BP drop since my last post. Now i need a pair of vindi boots to go with my bp hehe.<br />
<br />
I agree with Naagruz about HoT. We get FAR better drop rates when doing &quot;Laps&quot;. We started calling it the plate cycle becuase the high frequency of plate drops &lt;grumble&gt;. I have yet to see the chain legs drop which is my next upgrade although we get multiple sets of chain gloves each lap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">My guild tackled Vindi for the first time Friday night. Our gimp arses took him down with no deaths. We then proceeded to smack The Statue as well. Yesterday, we knocked off Vindi again. Two death in three days... and no BP on either kill. <br />
<br />
So, my question: How often does Vind have a BP on him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Vindi definately. 180 mana isnt even 1 torpor ;) *huggles his vindi*<br />
<br />
Just got it this weekend. I log on to char select explore mode just to stare at myself in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">&gt;How often does Vind have a BP on him?<br />
<br />
Its not uncommon, I think the first two Vindis we did had boots, the rotter. If you havent had a BP in four kills you've been rather unlucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">So, my question: How often does Vind have a BP on him? <br />
<br />
Well he will drop the Breastplate, boots or Earring when he is killed. So i guess there is a 33.3% chance he drops the breastplate. It sounds like your just unlucky. I personally been involved with 6 or 7 vindi kills and I seen the earring 1 time (thankfully).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Galdir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">we kill vindi aloot and the dropar rate is realy random last 4 kills we got bp before that we did have 4 boots drops still no earing that one is rare i think . <br />
<br />
Vindi bp is realy nice. <br />
<br />
Galdir lvl 63 oracel on AB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">4 Months ago a chain BP dropped in wtov and I won the random.  It was a huge upgrade for me (I was wearing a PSC).  However, at the time, my guild was still killing vindi.  A rogue tried to persuade me that I would have vindi BP soon enough and I should MQ it with him.  It sounded right to me, and I almost did it, but decided not to.<br />
<br />
2 Months ago, still wearing my spirit caller's BP, we killed kland and a peerless BP dropped (80hp 80mana).  I claimed it (spent DKP points) on it.  A warrior called me a dumbass for wasting my points since I would have a vindi BP soon.<br />
<br />
1 Week ago.  I finally got my vindi BP.  I lead about a dozen raids on him myself, and attended a grand total of about 30 vindi slayings.  My guild no longer does vindi as an official raid where you can claim the BP with points, but rather as pick up raids where everyone that attends and wants an item randoms for it.  Otherwise, I would have just claimed the thing a long time ago and been done with it.  I lost about a dozen randoms and we had I don't even know how many pairs of boots drop, but one day, he dropped BP and I won it.<br />
<br />
The moral of my story, is not to count on that vindi BP coming soon, hehe.  It is definately the superior bp, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">In regards to his droprate, he will drop one of the following items (and only one) every time:<br />
<br />
BP drops 60%<br />
Boots 35%<br />
Earring 5%<br />
<br />
Also, he can drop an ST key shard 5% of the time.<br />
<br />
In the majority of the vindi kills I attended, I had crap luck and he dropped boots.  However, looking back at the drops from all the vindi raids my guild has ever done, the numbers I posted hold true.  Bp is common, boots uncommon, and earring rare.<br />
<br />
Funny story:  My roommate (a shadowknight) and I have been trying to get vindi BP's for months and months and months.  I finally got mine last week.  A few days ago, he set up a raid of a few of our most uber friends to go and kill vindi.  No one from this crew needed a BP, so he was sure to get it if it dropped.  As vindi was going down, I looked at him and said &quot;he's going to drop the earring&quot;.  In all the countless vindi kills we've been to, he has never dropped the earring.  However, on this kill, I was right.  He dropped the earring.</div></div><hr />
