<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We will resume where we were last week in the Tower of Frozen Shadow. <br />
<br />
This event is open for people from 29 to 40. <br />
<br />
Last week, we got 3 keys from floor one and 2 from floor two with some nice drops. <br />
<br />
This week, we intend to push past floor one and will also make our stay on floor two very brief as we head to wipe out floor three (and perhaps beyond). <br />
<br />
Meeting place is the kobold camp next to the tower. We will form up shortly before 7 and move in. After we get past the first floor, if you don't have a key, it will be difficult to join us, so if you have interest in coming, please be on time.<br />
<br />
In game contacts are Griss/Bearan and Calon/Klydon. <br />
<br />
We will probably be short healers this week as I don't think Bomar will be able to attend. <br />
<br />
See you there!</div></div><hr />
