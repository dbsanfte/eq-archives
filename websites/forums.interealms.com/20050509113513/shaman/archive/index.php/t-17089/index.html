<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey guys, i got bored while soling giants in BoT.<br />
i found that, two shaman a cleric , 2 wizzies and a mage could clear south camp in at least 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
everyone was 65 except the other shammy and the mage. they were 64 and 63 respectively.<br />
<br />
i would pull with malos, when giant came into camp, me and other shammies dogs hit mob, absorbed the damage, and held the mob for slow, i would begin casting blood of saryn, get aggro, then other shammy would cripple, i would cast ebolt, i was MT.<br />
then ... two wizzies and mage and pets get into it, wizzies use HUGE nukes along with mage and since i have huge aggro from the dots and me tanking, i can hold aggro while they chain nuke.<br />
i burned 2 aa points in less than an hour.<br />
we cleared south so fast we started to pull middle south by valbrand for the other group (they were there for the named)<br />
if i got two we just rooted one and slowed it.<br />
fully buffed i have about 5110 hps. <br />
i didn't die, nor go below 25% hp, CH was cast as soon as i hit 60%<br />
we even killed a few Krigers no problems.<br />
the cleric had no flowing thought so he was horse back most of fight.<br />
i had a few mana problems but can 5 fixes that as long as the other shammy didn't mind healing me a bit.<br />
<br />
this also can be done with a druid healing, and without the other shammy, you just need a chanter to slow.<br />
<br />
i was kinda surprised we cleared the camp that fast. i think this will be my new group from now on.</div></div><hr />
