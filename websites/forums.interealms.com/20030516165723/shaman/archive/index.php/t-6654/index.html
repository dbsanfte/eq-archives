<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kraeger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I currently have a self buffed DS for 59. Potion, Kunark BP and Regal band from chardok. Does anyone know what else I can stack? I know coldain ring doesent stack with... the potions I think. Or maybe someone else has a nice tip for another DS source? :) <br />
I saw a potion in FV by the barb hut, dont know if someone sold it to the vendor. But it had shield of lava on it, 8 charges. Didnt want to waste 800pp just to see if it stacks tho.<br />
<br />
Cos when soloing high lvl mobs and nameds you dont always have time or mana to use dots, cept maybe epic. Then the DS and pet helps you so much cos you are still causing damage even if all you do for 10mins is trying to stay alive with canni torpor and chloro. Try it, its great :)  I did Veltar in DL in no-time using 59 DS and a few dots.</div></div><hr />
