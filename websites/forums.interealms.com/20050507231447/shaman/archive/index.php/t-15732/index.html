<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question about the pups that get summoned with Spirit Call.  I need to know what they will and will not attack at the time that they are summoned.<br />
<br />
If I do not have and never have had aggro, but I am on the hate list, will they attack the mob?  ie.  I have Malo'd and slowed the mob, but the MA has kept aggro the whole time.<br />
<br />
If I have had, but do not currently have aggro, will they attack?<br />
ie.  I get aggro when slowing and take a hit, but MA quickly gets it back.<br />
ie2.  I pull, get Harm Touched and then MA (or my regular pup if soloing) gets aggro once I am back in camp.<br />
<br />
I just got SC1 this morning, so I haven't had much chance to experiment with it.  I got it before MC and Can5 for some fun, but I was a little underwhelmed by it this morning.  I don't think that I will regret getting it now, because I needed some new skill now to keep things fresh.  It has been a while since I have gained a new skill.  Lately it has just been an increase in a skill/spell line that I already had.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was a bit diappointed by the damage that they seemed to put out.  There wasn't really a big noticeable difference in how quick the mob died.  Maybe I just need to work with it for a while to get more familiar with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If the mob hits you they will attack it as long as it isnt mezzed, then you have to get aggro again to make them attack.  If you summon them on a mob and that mob dies, they wont attack the next mob unless that mob hits you.   I havent parsed it, but in some experimenting SC1 seemed to do about the same amount of damage as BoN.  Give or take some.  These dogs push mobs around real hard.  position your pet on the mob stand to his side,  cast SC, then move in a semi-circle aroiund the mob.  The dogs pop out 1 at a time so this makes a circle of dogs around the mob, it helps reduce some of the push.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tify</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I too just got this for the fun factor.  I also noticed that there was no noticeable drop in the mob's health when SC (multi Cujo) was used.  I liked the effect, watching lots of cujo's run out and attack the mob, but was disappointed when the mob took the same amount of time to kill.  <br />
<br />
Are there any parses that show how much SC does in damage?<br />
<br />
Did I just waste 4 aa's?<br />
<br />
What do you more exp'ed people think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The number I've heard thrown around most often is 30DPS per pet.  Situationally, these are very handy.  You're really not going to notice their DPS in normal *shudder* exp grinding.  You'll call them, the mob will die a little early, and your dogs will stand there, useless, and poofing before the next pull.<br />
<br />
When do these dogs shine?<br />
1)  Casters.  Yes you can circle the dogs to cut down on push, but if you make sure to pile your dogs on the same side, that push can be used to help interrupt NPC casting.  Talk to your MT, convince them to push in a circle (this is especially beneficial when partnering or in small groups).<br />
2) Partnering / small groups.  That extra damage makes a huge difference if you go for max recycle.<br />
3) Adds.  Those dogs can tank adds.  They will ENRAGE, just like your trusty pooch.  Use them to burn each mob down, or use them to distract an add for their duration.  Just remember, if you want to get max use out of them, you can do it without killing the chanter, just root and poke, or root and sit - if you must.  <br />
<br />
Other points of interest - I've seen the dogs split up and go for different targets on occasion.  I think it's just when one gets hit by said mob.  The ONLY time they'll attack something that hasn't damaged you is when you first summon them.  I have NEVER seen them break mez.  If you have to cut and run for the zone, there is absolutely nothing (save for a defensive warrior, maybe) better at holding critters off you than this skill.  That's three critters who have to be knocked all the way down, and then hold out through enrage, before they'll come after you.  That's a lot of time to get to the zoneout and still not end up training anybody.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They attack whatever mob you have targetted when you hit the ability. If that mob subsequently gets mezzed or dies, then something has to hit you or the call is wasted because they will just stand there. They will switch to a new target if the first target dies and something else has hit you in the meantime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I often get spirit call to work on 2 mobs.  But, my groups normally chain pull. <br />
<br />
They will attack whatever you have targetted when you first summon them ( don't target your buddy on a pvp server - hee hee ).  Then after that mob dies or is mezzed, they will attack anything that hits you or damages you.<br />
<br />
The way that I get them on the 2nd mob is to root it and walk right under the mobs feet.  Root causes mobs to attack the closest thing, so I just get closer to the mob than the tank and they hit me once, dogs agro, then I back out.  If you are in PoP tier 3 or 4, you may want to drop a Q on yourself before you get hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
also, regarding spirit call, this is one of the absolute best things we get on pvp server.  The dogs damage can't be resisted and they are good at interrupting casters.  I try to VP the target first tho, so they can't run away from the dogs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After the initial targetted mob dies, they act like an enchanter pet -- i.e. stand around idly until a mob attacks you.<br />
<br />
Duration is always 60 seconds; re-use is always 12 minutes.<br />
<br />
As others have said, this AA is not going to significantly increase your overall DPS. But it's damn handy for a little extra burn, or for pushing, or for smacking around the occasional cleric mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spirit Call (And Virulent Paralysis) give you one more trick when things start going Horribly Wrong.<br />
<br />
I have SC3, and it's great.  I could have spent the same AAs on MGB, but MGB has never saved my group.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">30 dps for all 3 at level 1 is probably about right.<br />
<br />
When I parsed our pets rescently hasted and dual wielding they put out about 30dps. Unhasted and unweaponed they should be about 10-15dps each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They will attack whatever you have targetted, regardless of its current feelings towards you.<br />
<br />
If you summon your pets and put them on mob1, while mob2 is rooted in the corner, and then mob1 dies before SC wears off, they will not attack mob2 if all it has been doing since they were summoned is stand in the corner.  However, if mob2 hits you or casts on you, they will go after him as soon as mob1 is dead.<br />
<br />
Basically it works just like your normal pet, except you can't control them.  They will defend you when you are attacked, but you have to be in more danger than just being on the aggro list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I use my 3 dogs for pulling very resistant mobs, the SC pack and my normal True Spirit usually give me the time I need to debuff/slow/cc/break a particularly nasty mob/camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Are there any parses that show how much SC does in damage?<br />
I parsed out the damage one day.<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=7462<br />
Pets do about 800 - 1000 damage each vs level 45 mobs.<br />
Against higher conning level 60 mobs like in PoV I've heard they parse closer to about 750 damage.<br />
<br />
Oh ya.  click search!  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
A recent Spirit Call story for you...<br />
<br />
I was in the Deep, camping my last VT key shard w/ a pickup group (/shudder) which was actually doing quite well.  We had made it almost to the bridge, and were about to clear the area before crossing when the SK and Beastlord both have to go to a raid, leaving us with just the 65 cleric, a 65 enchanter, and myself.  Thinking it would be tough, but worth trying for this lousy shard, we decide to persevere.<br />
<br />
Cleric pacify pulls but we get 3 anyway somehow, enchie locks one down and we have 2 on us.  Cleric backs up too far, aggros 2 others, is OOR for heals from me and dies very fast. Before we know it we have even more from somewhere else and there are 7 or 8 mobs on us.  Enchanter gates after trying to lock them all down for a minute unsuccessfully (a few wouldn't mez).  I burned a good bit of mana keeping her propped up while trying to root park.<br />
<br />
I'm clicking my root-legs like mad and trying to get enough breathing room to mem gate myself.  Sit &amp; smack with 3 mobs (even slowed) on me starts taking nice chunks out of my health before I can even get gate memmed.  Burned VP twice to push off unslowed mobs while furiously channeling (hurray for boots of stability) Q in between Turgur's casts.  Regular dogdog died early on.<br />
<br />
Running down to about 40% health, I channel a Spirit Call and the 3 puppies come out.  Backing up and rooting mobs, the dogs somehow (it certainly wasn't planned) split up on 3 different mobs, and I channel my gate cast w/ almost no visible mana left, 2 mobs root parked and 2 more beating on me.  I ended up in Plane of Tranquility at like 9% health out of a buffed 5700+ hp.<br />
<br />
Spirit Call definitely saved my bacon that night.  While I'm not spending points for more dogs right now (finishing LR), I will eventually get the extra 2 mutts. :cool: <br />
<br />
Very nice AA ability, and I use it daily.<br />
<br />
PS: We ended up picking up 2 other people and the rest of the Deep camp was mostly uneventful but we all walked away with our shards (hurray!).<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wanted to post for the record, because I'd never seen it mentioned before, nor seen it happen.<br />
<br />
Last night, one of my sweet little short-term poochies SHIELDED me in the middle of a bad little episode, after Vobober was already dead.  Not sure if this is new or not, but definitely another cap in the hat of this very worthwhile AA (well worth the points spent for the first level, at least).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">They have always shielded. A nice bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Short list of points I have learned about Spiritcall:<br />
<br />
1)  It is a great way to pull mobs when solo'ing and you know they will resist slow before Malo.<br />
<br />
2)  Their hate list is set up as..<br />
 a - The mob you had targeted upon activation of ability<br />
  b- Any mob that hits you/casts on you WHILE THEY ARE OUT.<br />
<br />
3) Their target is determined as:   Whichever mob is on their hate list and CLOSEST TO THEM, they will hit.   (this one I am not 100% certain on yet, but have yet to see an exception)<br />
<br />
4)  /shield and Enrage are the 2 most useful things about the pets.   But the damage is free and pretty nice too.<br />
<br />
5)  You can circle the mob to place pets in a manner that they won't push.   Fortunately most raids you will then see the mob pushed by the PCs right over your pets to force them all onto one side anyway, then they will blame you for all further push.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">a quick tip to get em on another mob after the first died. face to face mele with a tanked  mob will win ya a reposit more then enough to upset the dogs.  safer then other means including root.</div></div><hr />
