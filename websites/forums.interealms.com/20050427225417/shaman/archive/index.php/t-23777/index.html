<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I didn't go to up for exp, I came to help a friend with the aliencave and thought maybe I could get exp in the process.  Wrong answer, we made it to the entrance of the cave, main objective was Radir Fireshower.  We took heavy adds at the entrace ,so breaking in proved to be interesting. But we made it and went in, cone in a clear all the way thru both main clear areas.  and we Waited in the 2nd clearing and we pulled the  named to this position.  I had to do 2 AEO slows due to all the adds the Ranger brought, but the druid did succor before we bit the dust.<br />
<br />
After 35 min of fighting constantly with DBs in this zone I won a grand total of  2% exp.<br />
<br />
WORTHLESS.</div></div><hr />

Once you ding 61 just about all xp outside of PoP, LDoN, GoD, and OoW is pretty dismal :(  It's there, it just sucks - for the most part.  Droga is tolerable because it was revamped, however CT isn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ldon owns till 64 for xp..try that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe your LDoNs are different from mine, but in my experience, I rarely get more than 5% exp from a successful Nro / EF adventure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the mobs in those caves in Up have 15-20k hps which is pretty high!  I think some blonde developer thought that the 2 caves in up would be a raid target for guilds in the luclin era........which did kinda happen.<br />
<br />
If you are huntin outside of POP for exp then u need to mass slaughter mobs for exp......eg dont huntin zones with post loy lvl hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lileann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">5% isn't bad depending on how long it takes you to do the adv.  For me it generally takes less than 40mins, so the time vs xp isn't great, but its not horrible.  Besides the loot is usually ok, and you can rack up your points for that incorpreal armour in EF (cause if you aren't in a raiding guild than this is some of the best you can get).  But the above is correct, PoV till you can get BoT then BoT till something better opens up for you.  I am not sure about OOW, kinda stuck in Afghanistan atm so haven't been able to try it out to see how the xp is.</div></div><hr />
