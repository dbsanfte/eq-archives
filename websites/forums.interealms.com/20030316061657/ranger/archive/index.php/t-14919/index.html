<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dartaniun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i decided to sell my fungi to a guildie for 100k today after he asked about it a few days ago. at first i declined the offer but then i started to think he'd use it 24/7 and i was only using it in certain situations, and i am currently using the plat to work my fletching skill up. <br />
<br />
here's my dilemma: with my tradeskills suit on and KEI my wis is at 231 but with a focus and normal gear my dex is maxxed at 265 and wis is around 198 (with the KEI as well as focus). i spent the entire duration of the focus buff, bout 2 hours or so, working on making bows in thurg (bank is easy to get to and max faction for cheaper supplies).  i dropped about 20k plat and my skill went from 216 to 220 in these 2 hours or so. can anyone that has 250 or getting close to it if i should be doing something else for skillups. because at this rate i'll drop 100k and still be around 235skill not 250 where i'm hoping to be. or at least close to it.  i've heard of people spending around 50k from 202-250, and i'm not seeing how this is possible at the rate i was going tonight. anyway, i'm looking for some suggestions as to increase my skillup rate, or decrease the amt of plat i'm spending for practice.  and i keep some CHA gear to buy the bow staffs since they are quite expensive when buying/selling over and over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you want to save money while making bows, then get a friend's gnome to tinker cams for you; around 100 or so skill.  <br />
<br />
This no longer makes money, but it does save a bit of money (because the cams cost so much from vendors).<br />
<br />
Alternatively, if you'd rather save money but spend more time, hunt acrylia, and the condensed substances (fire, ice, shadow).  The arrows made from these will still get you to 250, and get you there a lot cheaper than the compound darkwoods will; but at the cost of a lot more time spent.<br />
<br />
The third option is only available to wood elves (are you a wood elf?).  Mithril arrows.  Supposedly they changed the rate of skill gain since I did any skilling (when I did it, I made money on the darkwoods, but I did it to get a BFT made, if that helps any with the timeframe); but when I did mithril arrows 40 combines got me from 202 to 204 (got a lucky one at the very end of that batch) and then it took me about 280 combines to go from 235 to 243, which is where I stopped as I've got a geerlock.  My fletcher doesn't have great stats; 124 wis, 98 or so dex, except when I could get buffs for them.<br />
<br />
250 is a nice goal; I'd worry more about 243.  243 and a geerlock (or the fletching trophy, I forget the name but its a knife) will put your effective skill at the max, 255.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did 202-250 on about 50Kpp.  BUT, this was before the:<br />

Changes to the sellback prices on darkwood bows<br />
AND<br />
Changes to the rate of skill ups<br />
<br />
235 to 250 cost me about 9Kpp making Mithril Arrows.  The bulk I spent on Darkwood (no gnome tinker) at about 25pp loss per sellback, 300pp loss per failure.</div></div><hr />
