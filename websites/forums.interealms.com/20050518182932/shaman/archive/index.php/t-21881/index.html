<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siroro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I understand the fact that asking for totally new line of spell is out of the Question but in most short fights we dont get the time to cast everything we want so i have been thinking of a New Type of Debuff<br />
<br />
A Multi Debuff<br />
<br />
A debuff which contains of many different aspects that stacks with most other debuffs and saves debuff slots on raid encounters well here it is!<br />
<br />
Slot 1 : Slow - 65% <br />
Slot 2 : Decrease Atack by 75<br />
Slot 3 : Decrease AC by 42<br />
Slot 4 : Decrease All Resists by 50<br />
Slot 5 : -20 Accuracy <br />
Slot 6 : Decrease Enemy Max hit by 15%<br />
Resist Adjust - 75<br />
<br />
I believe this Spell should stack with everything. (if a better slow EG Turgurs is to be cast it should remove the slow factor from this spell) <br />
<br />
This spell should come with quite a hefty Mana Cost to compensate for all the factors it gives and should become very useful for very quick encounters like LDoN mobs as no other spell should be required.<br />
<br />
I believe this spell should be 100% immune by raid encounters and only used on one or few group encounters to make us useful! <br />
<br />
I am thinking the spell should be along the lines of 600 Mana cost and 5 Second Cast Time.<br />
<br />
Please leave your comments here in an orderly way ! tell me what you thing about this kind of proposal for a one group encounter!<br />
<br />
Edit: Changed proposal a little</div></div><hr />

<br />
way too much to code, and too much for 800 mana, but your on the right track.<br />
<br />
slot 1 : slow 60%<br />
slot 2 : decrease strength by 120<br />
slot 3 : decrease armor class by 80<br />
slot 4 : decrease agility by 120<br />
slot 5 : decrease desease and poison resist by 60<br />
<br />
say mana cost of &quot;510&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">While I like the idea of some sort of multi-debuff, why str/agi/dex, when we're arguing in other threads that they do next to nothing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Anything that is less then 75% slow for us will be bitched about and rightly so. Even with the lil nik nacks it would be less effective then a 75% slow i feel. <br />
<br />
<br />
Props for thinking outside the box though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">why str/agi/dex, when we're arguing in other threads that they do next to nothing?<br />
  Exactly what i was thinking. We would be contradicting ourselves and you im sure it would come back to bite us in the ass. Not to mention its pointless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Siroro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was thinking more of a Slow with Atk Debuff Component. I guess the agi dex and strength were just things i would also like to see in a debuff even though they dont do much!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We got slow mitigation because someone thought that slow preventing more and more damage each expansion was unbalanced. Now, fight durations messed that up but the general idea is probably right. What we need is a debuff that does not scale.<br />
<br />
Turgur's Weakening<br />
Reduce each hit by 300.<br />
Cast time 1.0<br />
Mana 200<br />
Unresistable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If we are going to dream, lets dream big.  How about a Malos/Turgur combo?  I know I could fill the extra spell gem spot :D<br />

I just have to say, I love this idea!   It's unconventional for a shaman in a way, yet I love the thought, as it's still damage mitigation.</div></div><hr />

so do i, but in doing so you crush older content, by making it <br />
<br />
reduce each hit by 31% (i say 34% because, 25% is too low, and 35% is too high)<br />
cast time 1.0<br />
mana 200<br />
unresistable<br />
<br />
 you leave older content where it is at. and the higher up, becomes more shaman friendly</div></div><hr />

    <br />
<br />
         Sony don't worry about older content and trivialising it . Lvl70 will make everything before god trivial.</div></div><hr />

Did you even bother to read my post? My proposal was a &quot;fixed&quot; debuff to prevent the scaling that lead to slow mitigation. Anything that reduces by a percentage, wthere its attack speed, miss chance or damage per hit does exactly the same.<br />
<br />
If you truly worry about older content have the spell reduce DI (damage intervall) instead - that way it cannot reduce damage below the minimum hit of the MOB.<br />
<br />
I do not see a reason for this though. HoT spells reduce MOB DPS to zero too when you do older content. CH reduces MOB DPS to zero in a ton of content. Yet when a spell reduces the DPS of one MOB that will die in 6 seconds to zero instead of countering the DPS twenty of them will dish out alarm bells go off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Siroro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would like to see some more Unresistable or Very hard to resist debuffs, as i normally have to Spam my Turgurs or Malosinia on raid encounters even after Malos. A good example of this is the one group &quot;bosses&quot; in Bastion Of Thunder, as they resist our spells badly but others seem to drop spells without a problem; ive even had a beastlord able to slow one faster than I have!</div></div><hr />
