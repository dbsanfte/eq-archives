<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ferine Avatar is the lvl 65 shaman spell which does 140 ATK, Str, Dex and Agi buff.<br />
<br />
I just got this spell and have doubts about its usefulness considering I also have primal avatar.<br />
<br />
I have been offered a lot of pp for it and I am very poor.<br />
<br />
What do you all think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree this spell is not the best of all our 65 spells :(<br />
<br />
But FA is better than PA in 2 points:<br />
_20 more everywhere<br />
_recast time of ONLY 1 min<br />
<br />
If you have some aa point into duration and some focus, avatar can last around 10min, wich is pretty nice. Avatar increase melee damage by 10 15% i heard (depends on ac of the mob mainly) and with such recast time, you can buff all your melee in group easely, or make a list of damage dealer during a raid. Ask them to make a macro &quot;please FA me&quot; and this is nice.<br />
<br />
You may be poor, so that may be a reason to sell it, but not sure if many people will be willing to pay much for such far too common spell...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i use that spell on every raid i attend.  It's recast time is 1 minute instead of 3 like the rest of our avatar spells and means i can keep it on 6 people before i need to rebuff any of them for boss mobs and the DPS on rangers, rogues, MA, is noticible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'd keep it. I actually get a lot of use out of mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd definately keep it.. especially since I don't have any of the other avatar spells =P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I keep it memmed now on raids and even some XP groups if people don't have a primal.<br />
<br />
I get good use out of it and it keeps people happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kromy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Perhaps one of my reluctance to scribe this spell is that I am getting too many requests for buffs and dread having another spell that I get bugged for.<br />
<br />
Most of my guildies have primal weapons anyway.<br />
<br />
Unless the extra 40 ATK really makes any difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I read somewhere that for every 10 points in attack you get about 1% more dps. so avatar is 10% more dps and ferine is 14% more dps. Downside is even those with avatar weapons will want it so more buffing. Plus there is apparently an attack cap from worn items and that includes procced avatar so anyone close will want it.</div></div><hr />
