<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm at the point in my epic quest where it is required of me to kill Neh and Rak.  I've saved these parts of my epic to do last so I don't waste any more of anyone's time than I have to, and assume that there are  alot of you that did this too.  <br />
<br />
What I'm wondering is since Rak's reaver is on the first floor and you have to fight through his reaver to get to Neh, do you pull his reaver where you want to spawn him, go kill Neh and swing back down and kill Rak?  Or how does this work when you do it in one trip?  Hopefully our guild can do this in the coming week or so.   :D <br />
<br />
Anyhow, thanks fer her help.<br />

<br />
Probably best, if you have the firepower and the time, to kill Rak, then the Queen then wait for a repop of the Reavers.  Did this once on a 10+ hour raid for Druid and Chanter Epics (4 jade reavers and 2 chanter pieces).</div></div><hr />

Actually, IF you have maxed true spirit faction you can do Rak without going for neh ashiir. I did this past Monday. All I did was redo the rathe mnts part and turned in the gem in EJ after I killed kirn (3 times). Rak dropped the scale and the epic was mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Indrii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did this the other day with another shaman who needed these two steps.  We pulled Rak's reaver to the archway on the left(when looking at the castle) and killed it, and Let Rak spawn untouched.  Rak then waited there patiently for a few hours (yuck), as he isn't KOS to anyone, while we made our way up to Neh ashiir.  We killed Neh, then the shaman gated to the spirit sentinel and turned in the item, then we ran back to Rak, and killed him with two fire pets only, the tanks hid around the corner far away and only the healers were within casting range. Easy :)<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

We pulled rak to neg 250, pos 125 and let him stay there till the end of Neh.  he doesn't aggro or add unless you attack him, we fought right on top of him with other reavers :)  the tanks were made to stay around the corner, near  #3, and the healers for the fire pets were the only ones closeby, against the building at neg 250, 0.  no one else got near or touched rak besides our 2 level 49 mage fire pets, it took about 5-7min to kill Rak.<br />
