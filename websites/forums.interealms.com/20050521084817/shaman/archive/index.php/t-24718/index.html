<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I'm a slow leaner. My mum says i'm special.<br />
<br />
My experience of OoW so far is:<br />
<br />
Draniks Scar:<br />
Trash mobs: green cons - trivial<br />
Named mobs: some soloable, some single groupable....<br />
Boss mobs: ?<br />
<br />
Nobles Causeway<br />
Trash mobs: soloable but boring. Ok exp<br />
Named mobs: Single groupable, Ok exp<br />
Boss mobs: 2 groups+<br />
<br />
Walls of Slaughter:<br />
Trash mobs: 2 - 3 person, ok exp<br />
Named mobs: Some single groupoable, some 2 groupable, good exp<br />
Boss mobs: 3 group - raid force<br />
<br />
MPG<br />
Trash mobs: Single groupable, good exp<br />
Named mobs single groupable - ? Good exp<br />
Boss mobs: ?<br />
<br />
My question is what are the various other zones like? Where do they fit in compared to DS / NC / WoS / MPG?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As judged by whom? <br />
<br />
My regular crew can't handle an MPG camp. Our Cleric doesn't have the levels/gear/spells/AAs to heal there. Any time I've been there, I was there for malos/slow only, grouped with all level 70s. Hell, in one group, the MA told my he had a standing offer of 10kp to anyone who could pull agro off of him. The mobs were all red to me at 67, so 70+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zunayn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">'the MA told my he had a standing offer of 10kp to anyone who could pull agro off of him'<br />
<br />
easy 10k :)<br />
<br />
Riftseekers good zone too, very nice exp but u need decent gear as they quad 1300, also named that drop 69 and 70 spells and hp augs.<br />
<br />
Anguish my new 1 group farm zone but i &lt;3 rifts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bloodfields is comparable to Harbringers spire, maybe a bit easier.  Harbringers Spire is easier than Nobles Causeway.  Both have plenty of blue mobs for you at 67.<br />
<br />
You can root-rot in any zone, so boring soloing in Nobles is gonna be the same as boring soloing in WoS and boring soloing in the Bloodfields.  /shrug.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Boss mobs: Reported Boss mobs but no information to date<br />
<br />
Harbringers Spire<br />
Trash mobs: lvl 50 to 60 mobs soloable. Poor Exp at lvl 65 Plus  Single groupable - slow exp for 60plus <br />

Boss mobs: single strong 65 group<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PG really isn't that hard if you camp named like Blind hunter and whatever that other discordling named guy is. We had our tank go down a couple times because the cleric wasn't paying much attention and with 6khp I was able to spam heal myself while tanking to keep myself alive until the dps could finish him off. The named really aren't very hard as long as you have either a really good cleric, a druid/cleric backup healer, or a pretty good tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the info. I appreciate it. <br />
<br />
I was basically looking for zones that me and 2 others could do where we would be able to take out the regular named. <br />
<br />
Our group is based around Monk, Rogue and me, so no cleric and only a quasi-tank. The 3 of us can do LDoNs in about 40 mins, so we aren't entirely gimp and our crowd control is good. However, without a CHer and with me on slows and Crowd control, we have to be careful not to bite of more than we can chew<br />
<br />
It looks as though Harbingers &amp; Bloodfields are going to be worth a look...so thanks again for the info.<br />
<br />
Regarding Muramite's Proving Grounds. MPG trash and some of the named are most definately doable with single group. And I don't mean Time geared either. I have spent quite a while there with people ranging from my ghetto-ness up to mixed VT/EP geared. Bottom line is you do need a good tank (ours is about 11k when buffed) and a competent cleric, and you are pretty much golden.</div></div><hr />
