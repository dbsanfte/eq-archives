<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it possible to get the tear from fear and then do the 2 CoM fights on the same raid? Or do i have to do Neh then fear then back to CoM for tear? Also before kirn turn in my faction was only kindly is that enough because I have heard people were warmly at that part but Kirn aggroed and I have done all my steps in order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did all the steps in order and my faction with True Spirit is also kindly, I'm at the Kirn step.  I've heard a lot of diffferent reports concerning faction, I was wondering if I should just max my faction doing the woe and envy part and then complete the quest.  Seems kinda dumb to have to go that route though, parts of the quest was not meant to be repeated 20 times over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, you can get the tear first and then do the final two battles in CoM (Neh and Rak).  In fact, you can pick up your tear at any point in the process of getting your epic, there is no faction generating step involved with obtaining the tear.  Broodling pops, smack broodling, loot tear, bank tear until needed.  No faction, no dialogue, no hand in...smack, loot and go!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did Neh and Rak in the same raid, I just made sure to turn in the diaries to the dog before I turned in my tear. <br />

Sounds like you're on the right track :)</div></div><hr />
