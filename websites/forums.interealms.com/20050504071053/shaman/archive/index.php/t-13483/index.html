<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yes yes, I know it's been asked so many times, but lately I am stuck deciding what AAs to go for next.<br />
<br />
I have the following abilities :<br />
<br />
Run3, Regen3, MC3, CanniV, VP1,RC1 and SC1 (yes been damn bored and needed to reward meself lol ) I have 1 extra AA point atm <br />
<br />
Since I live in Asia, groups are hard to come by and on numerous occasions, I am healer, slower and CCer in the group. <br />
<br />
I am now trying to decide what AA would benefit the most and with as much immediate impact as possible. I am considering between the following 3 AAs but will be open to other options.<br />
<br />
These are : ND for more hp ( would give me about 230 more hp with ND3), SCM for mana savings or SCR/SCRM for longer duration buffs and topor. All these require 12 AAs to get the 3rd level bleh and more for SCRM<br />
<br />
Or should I do a mix of all 3 and get each to lvl 1 then follow up with level 2 etc.<br />
<br />
I am doing 100% AAexp atm cause I see no reason to level up since I can't get my hands on any Spec parchs atm. Still don't have a single lvl 63 spell and don't see myself paying 10Kpp to cast group replenish or 12kpp for grp sta etc. The group can  just stick to Tali brute and khuras regen lol<br />
<br />
So any opinions would be helpful in makin my decision. <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
PS so frustrating to have PoTac flag but no one wants to go there to hunt but I get tons of BoT invites. And when I finally get mini boss raid groups, the mobs have not popped grrrr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Scm!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i suggest SCM<br />
<br />
and getting level 65 is more important than worrying about spells...its all about the resists</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
In your situation, I'd recommend SCM next.  The investment is grueling to get to SCRM, but I think it is worth it.<br />
<br />
I'd also recommend you level to 65, and not let lack of spell availability hold you back.  I went from 62-65 with NO change in my spellbook.<br />
After a few weeks, I had a few spectrals.  I JUST finished getting my last 63-64 spell this week, and I STILL have no 65's scribed.  The reduction in resists is worth getting those levels even if I can't cast any of the spells.<br />
<br />
Getting to 65 (with your second-third AA title) will get you more groups, especially in Tactics.<br />
<br />
When I'm looking to grind, I use the LFG tool, even if I'm not going to be ready for 5-10 minutes.  I put what my preferences are in the block, and I'm rarely looking for long.  (&quot;Tactics, HoH, BoT preferred&quot; is what I use.)  Level snobbishness is a real factor for some pickup groups.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I find that at odd hours many people are looking for a shaman for a Tactics group, because their existing one (like me!) is going to bed.  This could be to your advantage if you network enough. :)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ahh okies thanks for the info so far.<br />
<br />
So SCM first for mana savings and lvl 65. Which first then? I do not like splitting AA and normal exp. it's all or nutting for me.<br />
<br />
As for pickup groups, yes I network a bit but the problem is that the regulars that pick me up dun want to do tactics :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would say get to 65 first - makes a noticeable difference to resists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I like SCR (I don't have the 8th shawl so it may have been more important to me).  I think I'll go for SCM next just because the clerics I know rave about it.  ND will be down the line because I can still improve my hp equipment.<br />
<br />
You'll get specs eventually and the prices are dropping on a lot of spells so keep checking the bazaar.  Oh and talk to other shaman on Torv, they'll sometimes give you their dupes which is really nice.  BoT has been the best place for specs for me so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like SCR also (have SCR3), dont have SCRM yet though, or SCM.  The longer lasting buffs and Q/Torpor is worth it, especially finding myself in chanterless groups often and having to dole out haste and Ferine Avatar.<br />
<br />
I took the path of waiting until I had at least a few spells for the next level and worked on AA's in between, so do whatever you feel comfortable with, I wouldnt have liked being 65 without any 63-65 spells although there arent many great 63-64 ones.  Being 65 will probably give you a better chance of getting the 65 spells simply because many groups/guilds may not let you have one until you can scribe it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">65 then SCM imo...<br />
<br />
at 65 u will get more groups for a fact...a BoT group or whatever is not going to pick a 62 over a 65<br />
<br />
getting 65 first will enable you to grind those SCM aa's faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">65 first.  Resists are noticeable improved at 65 versus 62.  You'll feel the change in BoT, especially.  Feel free to live in BoT - its the best place for random Spectral drops, imo. <br />
<br />
Then, SCM3 for your situation.  I am not a wholesale fan of SCM for everyone - a shaman with Canni V, a decent mana pool, access to some form of mana regen in groups (you can find PotC/PotG/Bot9, Spiritual BST-buff-of-the-day, and/or some chanter crack in most any group situation, or pay for it easily before grouping), and at least MC3 + FT1 (I assume everyone 60+ has, or will soon get, a Solstice Earring) should be able to do most day-to-day shaman casting without running oom.  Because you keep busier than I usually do, what with healing, buffing, slowing, AND ghetto-CC, you'll appreciate the mana savings.<br />
<br />
After that, SCRM is really, really good.  Its 20 AA total, and that sucks, but longer-lasting buffs mean less annoying recasts, and the effect it has on Torpor/Quiescence is simply amazing.<br />
<br />
Although planning *past* that (31 AA more than you have now) is a long way down the road, consider Combat Agility (and its follow-up, Lightning Reflexes).  Shaman get hit a lot, especially agressive ones like you have to be with your mixed roles.  PoP mobs hurt.  A lot.  Being missed when you draw aggro not only keeps you alive, but makes you smile when you see the spam of &quot;attacker misses you&quot; text.  ND is good, too, if you need a bigger HP buffer for Canni, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks all for the advice.<br />
<br />
Finished off my AA to get SCM1 and have 6 blues into 63 so I guess I'll grind it out over the next few days to get 65.<br />
<br />
Btw, I heard from others on this board and in game that AAs at 65 were slower than AAs at say lvl 63. Any proof to this?<br />
<br />
Also trying to get one more Metallic Liquid as a guildy said she would make me a Ceramic Shield if I gave her the ingredients! woo hoo! Too bad I have lost 3 straight rolls on it so far grrrr lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
AAs are slower at 65 vs 63.  Some clame 63 is the 'sweet spot' for getting AAs/power level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ahh .. kk so I should not expect to get 4 AAs in about a 5 hour session in Inner camp in PoV like I currently get?<br />
<br />
How much slower is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">2-3 AA in 5 hours in Inner at 65, depending on pull speed and skill of the group, and on how many mobs the Outer group snakes from you.<br />
<br />
IMO, the slower AA rate is more than made up for by the resist rates at 65 - and the knowledge that you're done with that normal XP thing.  YMMV, of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ahh ok. Thanks for the info :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There is not a huge diff at all of AA in 65 vs AA in 62 or 63<br />
<br />
the difference will be made up by the fact you will be &quot;wanted &quot; more for grps as a 65 than a 62-3-4</div></div><hr />
