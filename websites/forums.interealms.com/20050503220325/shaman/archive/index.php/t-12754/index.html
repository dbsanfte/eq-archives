<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've seen posts for this before but I just can't seem to get this through my thick skull.<br />
<br />
Do I have to purchase a key ring?<br />
<br />
Once I have the key ring, how do I put keys on it?<br />
<br />
I'm supposed to keep keys on the ring and in the bank, then I will be able to use any key whenever I want to?  ( i.e.  I can have the key to seb on the ring in the bank, but still enter seb without the key actually being on me)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the clarification<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">keys automatically add themselves to your key ring the first time you use them (no need to purchase a key ring)...to check what keys you have ... /key</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">To clarify, it's not a thing you can see in your inventory.  They're like character flags, something attached to your character but intangible.  When you use a key, it's added to your keyring.  From that point on, you will automatically be able to get past the door or zone or whatever it was requiring the key, without actually having the original physical key on your cursor.  Once you zone into Sebilis with the key on your cursor, you can stick it in the bank or even delete it and will still be able to get into Sebilis just by clicking on the zone entrance.  It is recommended to check that the key was added to your keyring (via the /key command that Wudoman mentioned) before you actually delete it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's actually a 'virtual' key ie something that you never physically see. <br />
<br />
As soon as you use your key to get into somewhere like Seb, then it is added to your key ring. You can then destroy it if you want. You don't have to leave it in the bank.</div></div><hr />

Someone in my guild checked this out with a GM and they said yes you can destory the key and it will still be on your key ring BUT if you reinstall EQ or playin it on someone else computer the key will not be there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So in that case the key must be local to the client... and not your character?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A follow up question....<br />
<br />
What if I haven't used a key I have since they implemented the keyring, do I need to use it once?  ( i.e. ToFS keys, I've had them forever, but haven't been there since key rings implemented ).  I'm sure if I use the /key command I'll have my answer, but was just curious.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks again<br />

<br />
I went on a different computer and my keys showed up on my key ring.  I did not try to get in Seb or HS however.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you need to use it again now.  If you last used it even a short while after the keyring was implemented, I would go use it again just to be safe, as they were buggy in the beginning.  It should be trustworthy for anything added now.<br />
<br />
ToFS has a few extra quirks.  It *seems* that once you use a key on any level, it adds keys to your ring for every floor up to the highest level key you have.  It also seems that using any key on any mirror, even a key that doesn't belong to that mirror, will give you all the keys you're entitled to.  So if you have the key off the third level and the key off the fifth level, and click on either first floor mirror, you will now have the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth level keys on your keyring.  I'm basing this on reports  in this thread (http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1998) from EQ Traders. <br />
<br />
Also, I'm still not certain how the ToFS keys are actually named in the keyring.  It seems that they're named by the floor on which they drop, rather than the floor they take you to.  I had all the keys up to the sixth floor in my possession when I used the first one to take me to the second floor, and the /keyring told me I had the Fifth Floor key.  (It only lists that one, but let me go up to the fourth after deleting all my lower level keys, so it only lists the highest one you have even though you're keyed for all the rest.)  But I'm hanging onto my key to the sixth floor until I get a chance to go up there and use it to go to the sixth just to be certain as I can that it's been added.  <br />
<br />
As for keys being stored locally, that'd be very surprising both because of the hacking risk and the hassle to people using more than one PC.  Can anyone confirm one way or the other?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is good info on the keyring. I'd been searching around for how it worked but never found much. Now that I know, I tried it in game - and either something is wrong or I still don't know how it works. Can only certain keys appear on the keyring? I haven't gotten any of the high level keys like Seb or Howling Stones, but I have some Befallen and Najena keys, and these don't seem to show up when I use the /key command. I tried /key and /keys and saw nothing. Is there a special window where the info shows up, or are these keys not included in the keyring feature for some reason? Maybe the keys have to be Kunark or later?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Not all keys can go on the keyring.  I don't know exactly what their standards were, but it seems to be mainly higher level ones.  I'd heard elsewhere that Befallen keys don't work, so hearing the same of Najena doesn't surprise me much.  I do know that Skyshrine, Sebilis, Howling Stones, ToFS, and Sleeper's work.  I vaguely recall hearing Vex Thal and Veeshan's Peak too, but I'm not positive of those.<br />
<br />
Remember you also have to have used the key since they implemented the /key function (and possibly a while after it was first announced, since it was buggy at first.)  When you use it, if that key is eligible and not already on your keyring, you should see a message saying it's been added to your keyring.  Then using the /key command will display it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The message will display right in your main chat window.  I used the /key command last night and my seb key was the only one listed (it's the only one I've used since they implemented the keyring).<br />
<br />
haven't used any of my other keys so can't respond to which one's may not show up.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

Why a sceptre would fit on a keyring but a ring would not is a question that keeps me up late at night.</div></div><hr />

SOE simply wouldn't allow this to be a client side thing.</div></div><hr />
