Have I just been asleep, or is this news?  Anybody found it yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know, honestly, but I will definitely look for it at the SH shaman guild tonight when I get on. Wow. I hope this is real.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ummmm, unless I miss my guess, this is really HoS????<br />
<br />
lvl 49, stat buffs??<br />
<br />
&quot;you feel tough&quot; is the HoS effect</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If this is HoS where is the hp's?  is it nerfed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ubiqu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No, it is not HoS.  IoS is a new spell line that appeared in the spdat when they started adding PoP spells.  I assumed it would be released then, but I am unsure if they decided to release it early or not.  I am not sure I really see the point of this spell, HoS seems better in almost everyway.  Though if it stacks with Kragg then it perhaps could be a substitute for kragg/str/dex/sta casting, cutting buffing down by half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OK, i didn't catch the hp part, sorry...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If no one has found it, perhaps they add the PoP spells to the live server spdat but dont stock it on any vendors until the PoP release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This would a pretty nice spell.. I hope it's live, I guess I'll have to run out and look..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lemy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I logged in and checked in SH and couldnt find the spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lucy shows change to non-vendor status, but still live.  I wonder if this is one you get randomly for turning in parchments in PoK?  Also, do you turn in to the Beastlord or the Shaman guy?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Replenishment is also listed as non-vendor on Lucy's but that is buyable at vendors so I dont think you can trust that particular bit of info too much. Verant apparently has other ways of deciding which spells are on vendors and which are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I know a BST in our guild has this spell, received it from turning in an ethereal parchment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ask him if it said Shm on it before he scribed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That it did</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is the flag they use to determine whether or not you're allowed to delete the spell from your spellbook. As you can see, it's incorrect for the new Blast of Venom, Shock of Venom, and Replenishment spells. So don't trust that flag at this time for PoP spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well I am glad that we can use it and that it is listed shm on it, what I am not happy about is that I have to waste my precious parchments to the BL guild master in hopes of recieving this spell.<br />

/sigh</div></div><hr />
