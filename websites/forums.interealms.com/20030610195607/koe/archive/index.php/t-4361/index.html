I have a Dell PII450<br />
256 MB RAM<br />
Window 98<br />
Video Card is ATI Radion 64MB AGP4X/2X<br />
<br />
My graphics are totally messed up and I can't seem to<br />
fix them.  Seems they are in a 16 color mode which I can't seem to change.  I have gone into safe mode and deleted the<br />
display drivers and rebooted so that windows could<br />
re recognize them and still nothing.  Also looks like I am<br />
missing a driver - ATIHIT.DLL - on start up.  I try to get the<br />
drivers from the CD that they sent me, but nothing seems<br />
to work.  <br />
<br />
My eternal gratitude to anyone who can figure this out.<br />
<br />
