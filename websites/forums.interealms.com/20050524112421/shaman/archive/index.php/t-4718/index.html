<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just need a few basic tips/possible upgrade ideas. I am basically looking for resist upgrades and hit point upgrades without serious damage to my Ac or mana pool (wis damage is OK IMHO as long as mana pool remains within +/- 100). <br />
I am not epicd as of yet, but will be soon ( /e crosses his fingers). My guild is now on NToV rotation, but due to RL requirements I do not get to raid/level much these days.<br />
Cash is not a &gt;huge&lt; object, have a few plat laying around, but time is, quests are ok as I love no drop toys :D <br />
I am working on my Dizok Faction as we speak, just a few thousand more and I will be dubious! /cheer<br />
Any ideas will be gratefully considered :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here's a few suggestions:<br />
- Barbed Rubicite belt, more ac, more hp, and a little less wisdom.  If it costs too much, a spider fur belt comes real cheap, and you can afford to dip down to 200 wis imo.  Dunno, maybe buy a spider fur belt, and then start looking for the better belts out there ie barbed rubicite and artificer (if u can find a smith). <br />
<br />
- For range, I use stone idol, pretty rare drop ME off those 4 arms, but it's a decent place to farm exp if you find a cool group.  Idol doesn't have extra hp though, but has the ac, extra wis and extra mr.  15 mr too, thats pretty nice for range.<br />
<br />
- For the helm, I have both wolf caller and slime covered rubicite helm.  Wolf caller (and Spirit Caller) have more ac and wis, but rubicite helm has a whopping 65hp.  It looks incredibly retarded, but 65 hp is 65 hp, and good for a helm slot imo.  Bought one for 5k I think.  <br />
<br />
- I have the crystal spiders eyes too, but I been doing a little researching, and I think Tae Ew Ritualist's Mask is better.  Ac 7 cha/wis/int 7 hp 40 mana 45 effect invis.  Only one less ac than eyes, otherwise it's far superior.  Problem is, with the effect, I'm not sure how much it will cost ya, maybe a lot.<br />
<br />
- Nice talisman, nice focus effect, I wouldnt change that :)<br />
<br />
- Shadel bandit ring is cool, but maybe you should buy a djarn's amethyst ring for second finger slot.  Djarns has 80 hp, no ac, but 9 agi, so it *almost* compensates.  <br />
<br />
- Hiero cloak for back because it has 75 hp/mana.  <br />
<br />
- Barbed rubicite for leggings, and I know you do lose a lot of wisdom and and a little ac, but you also gain 65hp. <br />
22ac still decent for leggings too.<br />
<br />
- Black Fur boots you should really hotkey in inventory.  Lot of boots to choose from out there, including all the ww ones (which can drop off yeldema), they're good for mr and ac.  Barbed dragonscale boots are nice too because of the hp on em.<br />
<br />
- Worked dragonhorn bracer is not the best quality out there.  It's nice, but peerless and matchless are better.  I could also suggest bracelet of sense (ac 12 wisdom 15 resists +6).  They're quite expensive tho, think around the 20k range on solusek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also does anyone know the best way to get faction up high enough with the iksar shaman guilds to do the cudgle quests. my faction with the legion of Cabilis is currently &quot;cannot possibly get any better&quot; but that is just the guards (non KS) correct? Any help here would be appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hallyguk_RZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok 3 upgrades i see easy to get:<br />
<br />
Waist: Chitinous Belt, go for 300pp on rz<br />
Back: Hierophant cloak , 3.5k on rz<br />
Face: Death mask of the elysians 1k on rz<br />
<br />
Get this for some nice upgrades and you do anyway fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The recommendations above look good, I'll just /agree with them.  Few more...<br />
<br />
Go for a Stone Idol (4-arms, already mentioned) or Divine Inspiration (goranga chief) from Maiden's Eye- each nice free range slot upgrades<br />
<br />
Lodi shield would be a nice all-around upgrade (ac 23, +10 wis, +20 fire, +20 cold, +10 magic, permanent water brathing) - expensive, though.  <br />
<br />
Barbed dragonscale boots (ac 19, +9 sta, +30 hp) would provide a nice AC and HP bump.  If those are too expensive, just swap out the black fur for some JB boots for the AC.<br />
<br />
Bracelet of Sense (Wis) or Fortitude (Stamina=HP) would be a nice upgrade to the dragon bracer, and provides +6 to every save.<br />
<br />
For when you NEED saves, I'd grab a Stone of Morid (+30 fire, +30 cold, range slot) and maybe a star ruby stein (+10 to all saves, primary/secondary.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the ideas, I forgot to add that I have just gotten my third CFE for my Spirit Callers booties and will be upgrading my boots shortly to those; as for the ranged slot items, I will be LFG in ME I guess :-); howling harpoon was awesome till I hit 50, needing the Ac and hit points now....will look into them. <br />
As for the Lodi Shield, I want one badly, but they go for 35-40kish on Karana server (sometimes less) and I want to make it a point of pride that I will keel that freaking turtle myself and make my own shield :-) Buying stuff in Bazaar is nice, but you have to make a stand somewhere.<br />
I have the typical Blue Diamond save gear, but hate to give up the Ac that the other items give, I am not my guilds main shaman, but I typically do the Cripple/dotting when on raids and that does generate a few aggros :-), so the resist gear ideas is appreciated as they seem to not affect over all Ac by much.</div></div><hr />
