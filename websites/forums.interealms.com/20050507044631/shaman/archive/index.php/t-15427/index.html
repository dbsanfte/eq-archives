<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now this is killing me I joined a hardcore raiding guild, and did a whole lot of flagging I wanted to post the log to see if anyone can identify what mobs I'm missing for Elementals:<br />
<br />
you say, 'unlock memories'<br />
Besting the burning prince proves your might, but you must prove your warrior's spirit.<br />
Your heart beat speeds as you recall the warlord's flaming axe, behind the dark sockets of his helm you seek darker intentions.<br />
you say, guided meditation'<br />
The history translated for you reveals the fate of Zebuxoruk.<br />
Trapped in the plane of Time you must gain the power of the elementals to gain entrance.<br />
The Chiper of the Divine Languages appears on your arms for a brief momment then fades.<br />
You have completed all of Honor's Trails.<br />
Mauvain is grateful to you for taking his case before the tribunal. The information provided to you, that mithanial marr and Karana carry information that you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />
Tylis has been removed from his agony.<br />
Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is forever in your debt.<br />
Saved from certain doom, milyk and adler are forever in your debt.<br />
Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the crypt of bertoxxulous should be open before your might.<br />
The portal into the Plane of fire has been altered. Miak needs you to find the correct way to channel the portal.<br />
Arlyxir's wealth of knowledge flows through your mind.<br />
Jiva's strenght fills your body.<br />
Xuzl's arcane wisdom pulses in your mind.<br />
the pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
<br />
Please to minimize confusion (the progression is confusing enough) please post only if you are more or less sure what i miss! thanx in advance guys! this has been a long hard slogg, I'm pretty sure I'm 1-2 max kills away from full elementals access ~ and this week we took down Fennin Ro, I want to catch up to the rest of the guild asap!<br />

Make sure you Hail and say 'what information , what lore' to the gnome in the library.<br />
<br />
You might need more I'm not entirely sure</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have found this to be very helpful.<br />

<br />
This is also very nice and a little more in depth.<br />

<br />
Look at the bottom link first and scroll down to the bottom to the summary area.  Have you done all those things yet?  If not, that's what you have left to do.  If you have done all of them, make sure you have done all the proper hailing and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Looks like you haven't completed the Cypher of Druzzil. Judging by those messages (and comparing them to mine, since I'm only missing Arlyxir, Xuzl, and Sol Ro), you need:<br />
<br />
-Rizlona<br />
-Dresolik<br />
-Mithaniel Marr<br />
-Vallon Zek<br />
-Agnarr<br />
<br />
I'll log in and now and get the complete messages to show which you need exactly.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Here's the text I get. I'll try to detail what each message means...<br />
<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:28:45 2003] You say, 'Hail, Seer Mal Nae`Shi'<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:28:46 2003] Seer Mal Nae`Shi snaps from her meditation,  'Greetings traveler, I am Mal Nae`Shi.  I have come here to heighten my awareness through meditation, much can be learned through a brief exploration of one's self... Assuming there is something there to learn.  While reaching inner peace is a journey each spirit must undertake on its own, I can begin your voyage with [guided meditation] which will aid your memory, once you are seated.  I can also [unlock] some [memories] which may previously been inaccessible.'<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] You say, 'what guided meditation'<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] Learning of Zebuxoruk's fate, the only way to save him is gather materials that will allow you to power up the machine to send you into the Plane of Time.  Maelin has charged you with finding an elemental power source sufficient to activate Meldrath's time machine.<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] The Cipher of the Divine Language appears on your arms for a brief moment then fades.<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] You have completed all of Honor's Trials.HoH trials<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls. (Aerin'Dar)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before the Tribunal.  The information provided to you, that Mithaniel Marr and Karana carry information you should seek, could be quite useful. (PoJ trials)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] Tylis has been removed from his agony. (Saryrn)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] Saved from a world of eternal nightmares, Thelin is forever in your debt.(Terris Thule)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] Saved from certain doom, Milyk and Adler are forever in your debt. (Bertoxxolous)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the Crypt of Bertoxxulous should open before your might. (Grummus)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] The portal into the Plane of Fire has been altered.  Miak needs you to find the correct way to channel the portal. (Incomplete PoFire flag)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] The power of Dresolik surges through you. (Dresolik)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] Rizlona's song slips through your thoughts.(Rizlona)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] The parchments of Rallos are scribed in a language that you cannot comprehend; they do however have detailed drawings of the manaetic behemoth that you have already destroyed. (Manaetic Behemoth)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:10 2003] You remember Nitram's words - 'three small turns to the right on the bottommost rivet should open the door'. (Xanamech - PoI factory)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:21 2003] You say, 'unlock my memories'<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:21 2003] The Cipher on your arm glows for a moment, the booming voice of the Warlord rings through your ears, 'You have finally earned the right to claim you have 'defeated' me.' (Rallos Zek)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:21 2003] You have received a character flag!<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:21 2003] An Image of Mithaniel flashes before you, 'You have finally earned a place of Honor.  Wear this Cipher with pride.' (Mithaniel Marr)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:21 2003] You have received a character flag!<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:21 2003] An Image of Mithaniel flashes before you, 'These notes should assist you on your quest for the Fallen.  Justify the Honor that you have been given.' (Agnarr/Karana)<br />
[Fri Aug 01 18:29:21 2003] You have received a character flag!<br />
<br />
heh guess it's been a while since I've 'unlocked memories' but I remember before my most recent break (February to June), I could zone into PoEarth, Air, and Water but not Fire. So all I need to get into Fire is Xuzl, Arlyxir, and Sol Ro. I already have all the flags necessary to enter Sol Ro's chamber (Rallos is the key for that one, I think).<br />
<br />
If you go over your messages, match them up with these to figure out what you're missing. Sorry for the length of the post but I thought it might be useful to others as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">TZ, VZ seem to be missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds like you are only missing Vallon Zek. Sol Ro minis are not required for elemental access, only for access to Solusek Ro's chamber</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This is everything you need, just figure out what you didn't kill:<br />
<br />
Justice Trials<br />
<br />
Thelin - 18 man event in PoN, gives access to PoNb.<br />
<br />
Terris Thule - In PoNb. Part of Saryrn storyline.<br />
<br />
Grummus - In PoD, access to CoD. Make sure to hail the guy right outside of the disease port in in Tranq and say &quot;What Ward&quot;<br />
<br />
Carpin - In CoD, gives key to Bertox area.<br />
<br />
Bertox - In CoD, need for access to Saryrn.<br />
<br />
Agnarr - In Bastion on Thunder, once Agnarr is down you hail Karana and say, &quot;i will follow the path of the fallen.&quot; To get flag.<br />
<br />
Aerin`Dar - PoV dragon, grants access to HoH. <br />
<br />
HoH Trial 3 Room<br />
HoH Trial Villager<br />
HoH Trials Rydda<br />
<br />
MithMarr - Need all 3 HoH trials to get into HoHb for MithMarr.<br />
<br />
Saryrn - Must have Bertox and Terris to get her flag to unlock. Make sure to tell Faylia in Tranq that &quot;I will go to that plane.&quot;<br />
<br />
Behemoth - Tactics Access in PoI<br />
<br />
Tallon Zek - In Tactics, the one that is not part of Rallos script.<br />
<br />
Vallon Zek - In Tactics, the one that is not part of Rallos script.<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek<br />
<br />
SolRo Minis - These arent required if your guild can shuttle you up with the 15% rule. They are: Xuzl, Arlyixer, Rizlona, Protector, and Jiva.<br />
<br />
Solusek Ro - Grants Access to Fire. Need Rallos first. Do not need his minis but helps alot to have them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, Slace, I think you're about done.  I believe the cipher of the gods is the zeks and saryn, etc.  The problem is that you are missing 3 pre-flags.<br />
<br />
Go to the library and take the elevator to the top (where grimel is, if you've worked on the aid grimel quest).  There is a Grand Librarian Maelin or something up there.  He's a gnome in the back.<br />
<br />
Hail the librarian for 1 flag.  Then ask him, &quot;What lore?&quot; and &quot;What information?&quot;  He pre-flags you for both RZ and Sol Ro (the god, not the tower).  You may need to unlock memories and come back and ask again.<br />
<br />
I think that's all you need to complete your elemental flagging.<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
P.S.  Oops.  Maybe VZ as well.  At any rate, go talk to the librarian, and post any changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Definetly looks like one of the zek generals (vz/tz) or both are missing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yup I think It's one of the Zek Brothers (Vallon) and AD in PoV, although I'm unsure if AD is a definate requirement for elemental access ~ well I guess we'll have to kill him and find out! thanx guys<br />
<br />
Slace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">very good chance you missed a preflag or two.  i remeber when we first killed RZ, a ton of people didnt have the preflags or didnt hail everyone fully and that was a big issue.<br />
<br />
Common ones where the guys in the sickbay, guy outside PoD and the gnome.  As said you need to hail him, and say what lore and what information.  he gives a bunch of flags and you may have to say stuff to him unlock memories and then say mores tuff to him.<br />
<br />
Flags suck hard</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is what complete elemental flags looks like, sans solusekro:<br />
<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~misterconservative/flags2.JPG<br />
<br />
also:  did you do Keeper of Souls?  He is the mini-event with the guy in the cage, on the level directly underneath saryrn in plane of torment.  His flag doesn't count unless you have bertoxx flag already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You still need Dresolisk and Rizlona<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't need them to have access to elem planes &amp; time.<br />
They allow you to zone in Sol Ro's lair but you can already using the 85% rule..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heard the 85% rule was nerfed for solro.<br />
<br />
Also heard that you don't need carprin cycle for elemental flag, if you got bertrox using the camping bug... or getting a mob to warp down and summon you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cattiebri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Suddail the summon/camp bug doesn't work for Bertoxx, you need to have carpin or the flag doesn't take. Looks to me you're missing possible Zek twins, Bertoxx and Keeper of Sorrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Looking more like Vallon ~ I'll let you all know I've done Bert and Keeper of sorrows ~<br />
<br />
Slace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">we success get one to enter solro room unflag(both zone and room unflag) in about last month, it just hard to get unflag rule work on this since so many people take up unflag spot for zone in Sol Ro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You don't need them to have access to elem planes &amp; time.<br />
They allow you to zone in Sol Ro's lair but you can already using the 85% rule..<br />
<br />
You need them for fire, or rather, you need Sol Ro for fire, and are you sure you can 85 % into his chamber? I wasn't sure, we've never done it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">We got people into the SolRo chamber today using the 85% thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This &quot;Your heart beat speeds as you recall the warlord's flaming axe, behind the dark sockets of his helm you seek darker intentions.&quot; means you still have yet to kill MM.<br />
<br />
I know this cause I get this message when I talk to the seer to unlock my memories and the only god I need to killl is MM for my ele flag.<br />
<br />
Not sure about the prince thingy. Good luck on getting your ele flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">you say, 'unlock memories'<br />
-Besting the burning prince proves your might, but you must prove your warrior's spirit.<br />

<br />

-Trapped in the plane of Time you must gain the power of the elementals to gain entrance.<br />

<br />
-The Chiper of the Divine Languages appears on your arms for a brief momment then fades.<br />
-You have completed all of Honor's Trails.<br />
I believe the 2 of these together say you've killed Mith Marr in hohob and have the required 3 trial preflag<br />
<br />
-Mauvain is grateful to you for taking his case before the tribunal. The information provided to you, that mithanial marr and Karana carry information that you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />
You've done PoJ trial<br />
<br />

<br />
-Now that Grummus has been destroyed, the entrance to the crypt of bertoxxulous should be open before your might.<br />
Grummus is dead (duh)<br />
<br />
-The portal into the Plane of fire has been altered. Miak needs you to find the correct way to channel the portal.<br />
You've hailed the drake at the entrance to PoF<br />
<br />
-Arlyxir's wealth of knowledge flows through your mind.<br />
-Jiva's strenght fills your body.<br />
-Xuzl's arcane wisdom pulses in your mind.<br />
You've killed 3 mini's in Sol Ro Temple<br />
<br />
-the pack of notes from Tallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />
You've killed TZ.<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't have the MB flag yet from PoI in order to be able to enter Tactics.<br />
You don't have the VZ flag from Tactics.<br />
You don't have AD flag from PoV (though you don't actually need it to get ele flagged, it's good to get for completenes sake, and the free AA and increase to charm stats)<br />
You don't have the other 2 mini's in Sol Ro Temple (Protector of Drexsomething and Rizlona)<br />
You don't have Agnarr killed thus giving you Karana's flag.<br />
<br />
To get access to Sol Ro Temple you need:<br />
kill MB<br />
kill VZ<br />
<br />
To get all of your elemental plane access you need:<br />
kill MB<br />
kill VZ<br />
kill Agnarr<br />
<br />
Killing AD is NOT a requirement for Sol Ro Temple access or Ele Plane access.  You can get the 3 trials done, and get Mith Marr's flag without AD having been killed.  I know this for a fact since one of the clerics in our guild is such a situation.<br />
<br />
Doing any of the 5 minis in Sol Ro Temple is NOT required to get flagged for PoF.  My 55 monk has never seen a mini, but can free walk into PoF because he has all the other flags.<br />
<br />
Doing all of the 5 minis in Sol Ro Temple, having Sol Ro Temple access, and having killed RZ are all the requirements to enter Sol Ro's chamber.  If you have a raid of 32+ flagged people for Sol Ro's Chamber, you can get ANY number of other non-flagged people up there using the 85% rule.  It's a huge pain to do so and can take a fair while, but I'll leave that up to the reader to figure out how to do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just to add, I am not 100% sure you have Mith Marr on your flag list.<br />
If you haven't killed him yet, you need to add that to the list of targets you need to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Slace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Thanx Juujuu good break down, and in conclusion I have been on 2 MB kills and hailed the Gnome AFTER fight I've since read that there is a line to say to the Gnome for a preflag (the one just inside the factory). I'm hoping that will take care of that missing one. MM has been killed 2 times and I'm certain I have that flag, leaving the bish VZ. Angnaar is a strange one, I've ben on 2 kills (check Magelo for one of his loots) and was sure I did all the hailing correctly. Bah! this flagging sux.<br />
<br />

<br />
My rogue only needs grummus for ele flag and gets the warlord message.<br />
<br />
<br />
It does not ONLY mean you miss MM, ... it just means you don't have the other flags for elemental so RZ is useless...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thanx Juujuu good break down, and in conclusion I have been on 2 MB kills and hailed the Gnome AFTER fight I've since read that there is a line to say to the Gnome for a preflag (the one just inside the factory).  The gnome that you hail after MB dies is the flag dude, but not the preflag dude.  Walk up the ramp into the factory.  Open the door (or get someone to open it for you).  Hail the gnome that's standing to your right a bit.  Tell him &quot;i will test the machine&quot;.  Get preflag.  Then go visit the seer to get your MB flag fixed up so you can zone into Tactics.<br />
<br />
Angnaar is a strange one, I've ben on 2 kills (check Magelo for one of his loots) and was sure I did all the hailing correctly. Bah! this flagging sux.<br />
Agnarr's flag comes from Karana himself.  You have to go up the stairs, open the door, hail Karana, and say something like &quot;i will follow the path of the fallen&quot; or something like that in order to get your flag.  Just hailing Karana doesn't do anything flag-wise.  Also, hailing Karana and saying the flag phrase doesn't work if Agnarr wasn't just killed.  I tried that with my monk that was camped out in Agnarr's room one day.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Slace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Whelp I'm finally there with a little help in sorting my missing Flags, which were AD in PoV and VZ in PoTac. Also missed a preflag in Poi factory, luckly there where 2 entrance groups there and a factory group so it was and easy smash and grab hail! Then a lot of running around and hailing mage and Maelin and was able to zone into elementals Rrrrarrr!! Thanks for the pointers guys it helped.<br />
