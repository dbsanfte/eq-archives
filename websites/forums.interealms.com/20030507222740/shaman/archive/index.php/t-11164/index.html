<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am starting a ikky shaman (although I may go with a Troll) and wanted to ask the novice and the pros about equipment.<br />
<br />
I am level 1 with<br />
25,000p<br />
Emerald scaled bp (I think thats what it is called)<br />
<br />
Need to cover my scaley butt so what would you recommend I get to do this? I'm on Kane Bayle if that helps (price wise).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bonethug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Crystal Spider Eyes for face, Ivory Imbued Collar for neck, Metal Linked Crown for Head, Hierophant's Cloak for Back...that should cost you about 25k</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I was gonna start over again I wouldn't go shaman, the class has been taking a beating since Luclin and it will probably only get worse. Be an enchanter, they buff way better and always get groups, and if you make it to the end game you can charm some ridiculous stuff. Also when you buy your expensive level 60 spell KEI you can slut it out to make all that money back. A Shaman who pays say.. 100k for 1 copy each of malo and torpor aint makin that money back very easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah, taking a beating? Shaman's are a damn good class.  I don't think I've ever waited more then 10 minutes for a group in PoV, I never waited for groups in PoN/PoD.  As far torpor/malo goes, eventually the prices will drop because the level 65 ones will become more and more common.  Plus if the low level torpor goes in, it'll drop the price of the 60 torpor.  <br />
<br />
Yes chanters are good, very good, but you also have to be a damn good player to make them that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And it's pretty sure, that eventually, SOE will realise how strong Chanters are at the moment, and nerf em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Interesting, I always thought the reason to play a class was because it was fun, not because of one or two spells.  I’ve thought about playing an enchanter, as they do get a lot of nice spells and it would be fun to be able to enchant my own jewelry.  But I would hate to always be responsible for crowd control.  That’s just not what I like to do in a group.  I’m envious of the money level 60+ enchanters can make by doing noting more than sitting in a safe spot and casting a spell.  But it just wouldn’t be worth getting to that point, at least not for me.  Druids and rangers may not be the most popular classes in game, but I love playing them.  And now I’m finding that shaman are fun too.  Every class has its problems, but if you have fun playing that class then any problems can be overcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Iksar bp, REIF, FBSS and some ordinary hp/AC gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ah, the Ceremonial BP is almost non existant on Kane Bayle, same thing with Rune etched icewurm fang.<br />
<br />
<br />
=(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In your price range, no item will make as big a difference as a Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate.  I can see how you might think you can't get one, but I'd be very surprised if that were true... they are quite easy to get, and druids farm them for sale in the bazaar.  Unless there's something different about your server that I'm not aware of, there should be plenty of these flowing through the economy.  I got two, each took about 8 hours of farming the TT cycle.  Not hard, my ranger grabbed the mob and pulled him back to my necro... the fight is cake for two people or any kiting class.  Worth every minute of the camp.<br />
<br />
It's not vital, but I still wear mine at 54, and probably won't replace it for a while yet.  I figure if I'm fighting and am going to need AC, I'm better off with the regen.  With canni, it's like FT3.<br />
<br />
If you have 25k, yet your server doesn't have any REIF's or ikky bp's, then I imagine you should just buy whatever basic gear you can and start levelling.  How can a starting person have 25k on a server that has nobody farming the TT cycle?  Just curious.</div></div><hr />
