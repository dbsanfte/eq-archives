<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just finished reading Gloriana's detestment of the Testement of Vanear for the second hand.  Ok, I still have one at 36!  I guess my question would be, what should I use in that slot.  I do have the Shield of Falsehood.  Right now my wisdom is 196.  I guess I was/am more concerned with wisdom than ac or hp.  The forum is great, and I have learned a lot.  Thanks in advance for your insight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The biggest problem (aside from it looks goofy) is that it doesn't have any AC.<br />
<br />
Use your shield of falsehood for now, it's got good stats for your level.<br />
Charred Guardian Shield<br />
Clay Guardian Shield<br />
Sarnak Battle Shield<br />
<br />
are all nice, but if you don't have any money don't sweat it...just use your Shield of Falsehood until you are ready to upgrade.  That's over 20 AC for free!  And it has 5 wis on it anyways so you aren't losing much .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sarnak Battle Shield comes to mind if ur looking for ac and other good stats. It's only a couple k these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Moonhaawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was also looking at the Charred Guardian Shield in Sol A.  Any thoughts on that one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your epic shield is better.<br />
<br />
At lvl50, charred guardian shield has only 10 more mana than epic shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">chitin shiekd from Velks, rather common on terris nd goes for about 3k maybe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hmmm...<br />
<br />
Trash the Shield of Falsehood....<br />
<br />
Go for the Crystal Chitin Shield (about 3 - 4k pending on server)<br />
and get a Sarnak Battle Shield when you go for resist Gear or Solo :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aqualungg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">skull marked shield from umbral is pretty good mid-level gear.  22ac 7wis 50hp/mana, off the top of my head.  got a couple stashed on mules, that i cant find a buyer for the life of me.  was asking 4k, so i dont think they go for an unreasonable amount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">crystal chitin shield or sarnak battle shield is your next logical upgrade</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have an SBS, and I like it a lot, but the WIS is lacking, so I'm thinking of switching to a Crystal Chitin Shield, or maybe saving up for a Bone Braced Buckler or even Stretched Fungushide Shield. Definitely pick up an SBS or CC Shield.<br />
