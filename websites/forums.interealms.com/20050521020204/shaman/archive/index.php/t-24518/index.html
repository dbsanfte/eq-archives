<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Updateing you guys on the things ive been up to again .<br />
<br />
Firsts off let me say THANKS to you all for the wonderfull and productive feedback ! The willingness of our community to help me in gathering info is a major help . I owe my thanks to everyone that has posted in my various threds , PMed me with info and/or send me a /tell in game .<br />
<br />
Now on to the Issues that I have been discussing lately .<br />
<br />
1. Pet inaite DW . As you know I submited our feedback to Kyth and she then forwarded it to the proper Dev/Dev's . I have not yet recived any information on this issue . Rest assured that I will continue to bring it up untill I hear something .<br />
<br />
2 . Ancestral Aid stacking Issues . As you know I submited our feedback to Kyth and she to the proper Dev/Dev's . It is my understanding that this issue is being looked at . Infact if im not mistaken stacking changes are already being made on Test server . Thanks for all the input guys . Looks like they are listening on this one . I am not 100% sure of the exact changes on test . Hopefully they will get it right .<br />
<br />
3 . Might/Sence stacking Issues . As with the outhers info has been submited through the proper channels . No responce thus far on this issue . I will continue to voice our concerns about this .<br />
<br />
Be aware that I am bringing up these Issues as often as I can and I will continue to do so . Looks like we may actualy see some changes to the way Ancestral Aid stacks with some of our own buff lines and possibly even druid HoT AA .<br />
<br />
Thanks to you all .</div></div><hr />

Seems just like a bug to me.</div></div><hr />

   Back in a patch sometime between GoD and OoW they made many group skills and spells not work in the old Planes for some reason. MGB no longer works there, and I know there were other AA's and Discs I think that were made to not work, but ive never heard an explanation why.</div></div><hr />
