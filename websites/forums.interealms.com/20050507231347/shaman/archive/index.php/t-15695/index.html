<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rbronso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I just hit 60 after 2 years of playing(woot!) and I currently have run3 regen2 metabolism1(250 baking/198 brewing) mental clarity1 and 2 unused. No malo no torpor no epic no jbb yes on horse!<br />
<br />
I read in a post, that I tried to find again in search function but could not, that someone mentioned that you should do aaxp in 60 becuase you get less aaxp per kill in 61 than in 60.  Which leads me to my question How does aaxp work?<br />
<br />
What i Know(or think is correct): Mob cannont be green to get aaxp, you get same xp whether aaxp or regular, aaxp is baded on same amount of xp as level 51.<br />
<br />
Questions: So if i kill and even con at level 51 then id get say 1% aaxp(just making up numbers), but if i kill an even con at level 60 id get say 4%(again random numbers) becuase i get the xp cause mob is level 60 but im basically level 51 cause im doing aa. So it is the same as killing a mob 9 levels above me.<br />
<br />
So as long as mobs arent green, then I should get same xp at 60 or 61 if mob level does not change.<br />
<br />
Please link any sites you find that havea good definition of aaxp, or youre own thought findings.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance, love the board and have learned much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the other side of the argument is you kill more/faster at 65 so its really a playstyle call</div></div><hr />

Just curious, is it true that the races that get experiences penalties don't have those penalties applied to AA?  In otherwards, they get the full experience into their AAs.</div></div><hr />

Wow thank you for the quick replies Sullone One!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
where AAs are concerned, Morel, you are correct that racial penalties do not apply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">let's take the same mob for both of your examples.<br />
<br />
at level 51, you get x amount of exp for killing mob Y, it takes you say 10 minutes to solo it dead. <br />
<br />
at level 65, you will get the same X amount of exp for killing mob Y, it takes you 3 minutes to kill it dead solo.<br />
<br />
AA exp is always the same it takes the amount &quot;M&quot; to get AA #1, and it takes the same M amount to develop AA #100, unlike level exp which rises as you level. level 51 takes amount P, level 52 takes P+R to develop.<br />
<br />
so, it's up to you. you can earn exp and use it to ding 65, then grind out 4 AA+ a day, or you can spend 1 day per AA at 60 and have fun developing, or you can spend 4 days per AA at level 51 and get your baron first.<br />
<br />
myself, i got run 1 at 55, and am now burning to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Repiv Dashammie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i hit 65 about a week ago..and have a total of 14aa at the moment. run 3 wis 1 regen2 nd1 mc 1 and spirit call 1 i have jumped around on my aa and havent really followed the procedure of getting canny 5 and that stuff i wish i had though. but now that im 65 i can go get aa fairly quickly some say 1 aa in 2 hours or something like that so ill have to check it out (took a break after hitting 65)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">There are a couple different things to consider. It used to be that dinging 61 greatly increases the level that a dark blue was. (something like 45 at 60 and 53 at 61) That was so it isn't as bad but it does get slowly higher and ends up being mid 50's or so for dark blue at 65. So there are things at 65 that you wouldn't be able to hunt for exp that you could have at 60.<br />
<br />
There is also the difficult mob bonus for fighting mobs closer to you level. So a level 58 mob killed by a level 60 is gonna give you more exp than the same level 58 mob killed by a 65.<br />
<br />
Obviously the best situation is being high level and killing mobs at or near your level. In a good group in PoFire i've done entire aa's in under an hour. If however you aren't able to hunt higher level mobs like this you'll get the best exp by killing mobs near your level possibly at a lower level.<br />
<br />
Obviously the rate at which you can gain exp can vary greatly based on a number of different factors. Leveling up typically requires you to kill higher level mobs but potentially yeilds greater exp.<br />
<br />
The actual numerical amount of exp required for an aa is constant reguardless of level, race and class so the faster you can get exp the faster you can get aa's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I grinded AA's in 60 like no tomorrow. I still think that because easier mobs are DB, its much quicker (At 63 i dont kill anything faster than at 61 for example) Ive got 54 AA's at level 63, and im happy because they are more useful to me than been level 65, with no spells, under-par armour and even less money from trying to buy 65 spells :)</div></div><hr />

/wave Urdegish. I owe Milaria by first-born child, talk to her about what she did for me. Hint: Torpor :)<br />
<br />
When I hit 60, the first thing I wanted was 61 and the new pet so I could solo PoG for money(this was before the protector re-nerf). At 62 I hit PoV and BoT and piled up AAs easily, they come fast in those zones. I'm now 63 with 28AAs and plan on 100% AA until I get the 50% buff duration(drooling over a 1800pt Torpor), spirit call, VP and a few others. 63 is a nice level to AA at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">63 is a nice level to AA at.<br />
<br />
I'd like to respectfully disagree with your statement. If you're levelling in BoT, HoH, PoV as you've said, I'd recommend getting to 65, for the simple reason that it's that much easier to get a group there. Also, once you get to 65 and a cushion, you don't need to worry about levelling any more.<br />
<br />
Even if you don't have any of your 64/65 spells (I didn't when I got to 65), your existing spells will be more likely to hit mobs there.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you have a particular reason to stay 63, or if you're levelling with guildies or friends, and it doesn't matter to them, do what you want to! In fact, do what you want to anyway, I'm just expressing my opinion! :)</div></div><hr />
