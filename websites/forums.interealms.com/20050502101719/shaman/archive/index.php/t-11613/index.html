Seems to be very rare though, camped it for 8h and seer only spawned once and it dropped some crappy mnk/dru/bst gloves :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've camped this guy for about 24 hours total and seen him twice.  Once he dropped a ring that had effect Spirit Sight (Combat) .. obviously a bugged ring, and the other time he dropped the charm.  He spawned about 2 hours apart but never again after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grubbnubbnubb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Da Charm is his rare drop.<br />
Da gloves issa his common drops.<br />
He seems ta pop once every 4 ta 5 hours on average it ya killin da placeholders on respawn.<br />
It is very dull ta sit der fer many hours.<br />
I ended up wit 12 pairs of gloves befores I got da charm, campin it fer a few hours here anda der.<br />
I glads I gots it I guess, but it odd havin ta bust ya butt ta git an item wit less stats den mah food...<br />
<br />
Side note on da camp, most da stufers was light blue wit da rare dark blue ta a 65.<br />
About 1 inna 3 seems ta be a SK fer a 850ish HT.<br />
Things got a silly low agro range, easy ta pull single and der issa lots ta pull, I brought sum lower lvl's friends anda dey gots great exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Took me 35hours of camp. Have fun...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">2 weeks, 0 Charms, I rather spend my time AAing.  As least thats productive.  They put in cool charms, then make the damn things so rare that are good its a waste of time to acquire one.  At least make them ALL Focus 4 items.....  For the time invested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh btw, 200 pierce, 200 1hblunt 75 h2h(max)  193 2hblunt and the charm gives me .. 2ac 2dex 2wis 10mana that's it.   I'm hoping the 7more points in 2hblunt will push that to the item's max, which is 5ac 5dex 5wis 20mana Ext Range III.<br />
<br />
Kinda silly that, with all weapon skills maxed except one that is only 7pts from max, the charm is nerfed all to hell.</div></div><hr />
