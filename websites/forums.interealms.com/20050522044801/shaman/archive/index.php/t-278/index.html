<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some thoughts about clicky items:<br />
<br />
I still have yet to ding 60 (grinding through 59 faster than I thought I would though) and get my hands on a copy of Torpor, but I have hunted WW with groups quite a bit.  2 clicky items and 3 crap buffs should be fine for most of the weaker (soloable) dragons. Personally I use my black furries and a tinkered spyglass.  Spyglass is easy to get, but the effect tends to be short-lived.  I pretty much click it between every cast/JBB blast to keep it up.  In my experience, it is fairly rare to get a buff further down the list dispelled.  It is usually the first one(s) that get dispelled.<br />
<br />
What do the rest of the WW hunters out there like for clicky-items?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korhal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">coldain ring, sow boots, then i throw up VP hammer buff and Jbone BP buff as more stuff just incase first 2 get skipped or in case of multi pulls</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Coldain 8th ring is well worth the effort (even if you are majorly kos to coldain now). It's got decent stats, AC 8 Str 8 Sv Magic 8 so I just leave it on at all times, not just to buff with it. I use that as my first buff at all times, and if I'm gonna get dispelled a lot I'll use goblin earring and black fur boots as well. Then I lay on VP hammer buff and Riotous Health from my BP. 5 buffs for a total cost of 0 mana.</div></div><hr />
