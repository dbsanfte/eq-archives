<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ormis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now that the old forums are gone, I can't do a search, but I know I read about it here.  Could someone re-clue me in on how to make a Cannidance hotkey so that you Cannibalize and then sit just in time to get the med tick all with a single button push?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">erm the full key is something like:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast X (x being the slot you keep can in)<br />
/pause 15<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
You will have to tinker with the pause time to get it to sit you down after Canni.<br />
<br />
I don't use one key for this since the pause time seems to be affected by lag, and in some cases I would end up interrupting myself a lot.  I just use one key that has:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 3<br />
<br />
and then hit my sit button when I am done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok there may be a painfully obvious answer to this that im missing but for people that dont play on the &quot;small screen&quot; for eq how can you time your cannidancing to be effective at all anyways?<br />
This is the way I learned and maybe im just ancient and out of date but the dreamcatcher icon to the left of your screen spins once every 6 seconds.These 6 seconds being known as a tick.<br />
That catcher spins you stand canni then have your butt on the ground before it spins again.<br />
To the best of my knowledge this is the only way to benefit from cannibalize and meditate at the same time.<br />
Now like I said I could be really wrong but if im still right then just making a hotkey for it is useless unless you play with the bordered screen so you can see when youre catcher spins.<br />
Just from my experience im one of the few people that still play on that screen but maybe im wrong.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am under the impression that bringing up inventory while in fullscreen mode allows you to use your hitpoint counter as the tick timer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oagal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">for perfect efficency, you can watch your health or mana bar move up, but even without, if you have the hotkey setup so it takes you 2 seconds to stand cast and sit, if you just randomly do it, and stay sitting for more than 4 seconds, you will get cann and med tick 66% of the time - on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">oh here is another hotkey I have to plug... it's pretty damn nice:<br />
<br />
/loc<br />
/doability 1<br />
<br />
(ability 1 is sense heading)<br />
<br />
This key gives your loc, and then your sense heading at the same time.  It saved me a button slot.  Oh and when I need to do CR I add a line so it reads:<br />
<br />
/loc<br />
/doability 1<br />
/corpse<br />
<br />
That makes for a nice all n one CR button.  Ariachne, an officer in my guild, taught me this and it makes me really happy.  Kind of sad the type of things that bring you joy after playing EQ for so long.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I really like to add redundancy to the canni Hotkey so that fizzles aren't an issue. Using this with Canni III is almost essential:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/pause 2, /cast 3<br />
/pause 2, /cast 3<br />
/pause 14, /cast 3<br />
/sit on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Problem with multiple casts on a single hotkey is that if something happens and you want to regain control of your character, you can't do it until the hotkey runs its course.  Nothing like getting attacked right after you hit the key, trying to cast slow, then sitting down in the middle because the hotkey got to the /sit on line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well Weiss, that hotkey isn't actually casting canni multiple times. It's only casting it once. There's a difference between a multi-cast canni hotkey and a failure-safe hotkey.<br />
<br />
A multi-cast hotkey does indeed suck for the reasons you mention. The failure-safe hotkey I listed above really only adds 0.4 seconds to the hotkey's overall execution time.<br />
<br />
Here it is again:<br />
<br />
/sit off <br />
/pause 2, /cast 3 <br />
/pause 2, /cast 3 <br />
/pause 14, /cast 3 <br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
This hotkey casts canni ONE time per press, not three times. If you fizzle canni, the hotkey will attempt to cast it two more times. The maximum time taken for this hotkey is about 1.8 seconds.<br />
<br />
Compare and contrast this to a multi-cast hotkey:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/pause 30, /cast 3<br />
/pause 30, /cast 3<br />
/pause 30, /cast 3<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
That will take about nine seconds (assuming three seconds is enough time to cast canni and ungrey the spell gem -- which I'm not certain of). First of all, you miss a med tick, defeating the whole purpose of canni-dancing. Second of all, it takes too damned long. Finally, it fails to deal gracefully with fizzles, and that's an issue given Canni III's tendency to fizzle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldnt say it better.<br />
<br />
My Hotkey was<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 6<br />
/cast 6<br />
/cast 6<br />
<br />
and use standard &quot;sit&quot; hotkey (well I do cannibalize standing once in awhile :| )<br />
I think I'm gonna change it to your  soupy, thanks (minus the &quot;/sit on&quot;) :).</div></div><hr />
