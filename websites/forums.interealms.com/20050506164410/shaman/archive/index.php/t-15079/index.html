<br />
DO NOT PRE-ORDER LDoN!<br />
<br />
Doing so will:<br />
<br />
Prevent you from zoning into any PoP zone. You will not be able to log on or create a froglok character. New models will go away. AA will vanish. If you die, you will de-level down to 50. Half of your bank slots will disappear.<br />
<br />
This is not a joke.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is just a test for what happens when you beat eq... I hear it's going live next patch~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">SO if I get on one of my 30 toon's and he ends up dead will he go to lvl 50?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">no, if you're 65 and pre-order it acts like you only have original eq and puts you to original's level limit with no aas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Anyone able to post a picture for me.  I would love to show what happened to me that night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>The Antifrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lol, its incompetence like this, in everything they do, that kept me from buying LoY and preordering LDoN.  I don't buy any Sony products, for that matter.  I equate Velious to Metallica's Justice For All cd, the last good thing before a giant downhiill fall, in both cases.  I bought Luclin because Velious had been good, and at the time they hadn't been shipping out buggy expansions every few months.  I'm not sure why I bought PoP, but it was a mistake.<br />
<br />
I'll never buy another one though... Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">According to Sony this is fixed, but a guild rogue still ended up lvl 50 after a death in PoAir last night.  Thankfully he managed to get a gm there pretty quick (well, about an hour or so) and the gm even brought his corpse to our raid for the rez so he wasnt left behind which I thought was pretty decent of him.<br />
<br />
Dont think I am gonna be pre-ordering it for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Correction Gurck, you don't buy any Sony products EXCEPT for buying the use of EverQuest every month.<br />
<br />
It must not be too bad for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Wow, this thread suddenly arose from the dead.  Get back down, thread! *beats thread back to bottom of list*</div></div><hr />
