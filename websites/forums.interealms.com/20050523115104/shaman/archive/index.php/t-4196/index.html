We spoke with Alan VanCouvering this morning about Inner Acrylia.<br />
Many players have been wondering if this Luclin zone will be finished in the near future.<br />
<br />
Here's what Alan had to say: <br />
<br />
Inner Acrylia is not really on the time line right now. We're aware of the concerns that some players have about the zone, but we've got a full plate right now <br />
I'm sorry, we just won't have time to think about looking into Inner Acrylia for a while yet. <br />
<br />
- Alan <br />
<br />
Hmmm interesting.  Never even heard of this.  Anyone have any more info on what this zone will be like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't offer a whole lot of insight, but here's what I know about Acrylia. <br />
<br />
www.ringofvalor.com<br />
<br />
Looked to be a higher level raid zone, requiring a large amount of ring encounters, scripted wars, etc to gear up for it. Ring of Valor is the only guild I heard of that was actively pursuing it.  Once they made it further in, it became apparent that the loot blew chunks and the scripting wavered between &quot;pretty broken&quot; and &quot;ridiculously broken&quot;, and one of the key mobs was removed so they could &quot;retool&quot; the zone. That was like 1-2 months ago now, kinda sucks for them. <br />
<br />
That's just kinda a synopsis of what I got from their guild page. I'm sure someone has better first hand info, I'm just a compulsive web surfer at work ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's fairly accurate.  From what I understand Acrylia has 5 or 6 rings.  To get to the next ring you have to do the ring before it to get a key.  You apparently have to do this for every single member in your guild.  The loot is apparently horrible, and as mentioned I'm fairly sure the boss of the last ring has been removed from the game.  <br />
<br />
So basically it's a huge huge time sink for not terribly fantastic loots (see Seru)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I can't think of another computer company in existance that simply ignores various parts of their products.  They aren't EVER going to fix inner acrylia.  It won't happen before the end of EQ's life cycle.  The things they say they are PLANNING on fixing take a year, i don't think there is hope for the things that they flat out state they don't have time for.<br />
<br />
Anyone with half a brain knows that Verant/SOE has unethical business practices, and eventually Verant will do something that is actionable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To gain access to inner acrylia, you must complete this quest (http://pub35.ezboard.com/fthesafehousefrm13.showMessage?topicID=3430.topic) for each person who wants to get in. This quest is harder than emp key/emp bane/10 shards combined. If it wasn't for having to kill Emp himself, it would be harder than the entire VT quest, and much more time consuming.<br />
<br />
Once inside, there are a total of 4 scripts. 3 of them are independant events, much like the Ring of Fire that is elsewhere in the zone. All 3 of these are either broken, untuned, have horrible rewards, or a combination of any of those 3.<br />
<br />
The 4th event is a long and detailed script that progresses you deeper and deeper into the zone, much like Sirran in sky except with a lot more depth. Eventually this script spawns a tagetable version of Tashakhi (the boss of the zone, aka 'The Master') and grants access to his lair.<br />
<br />
During that event, you kill 4-5 mini bosses (it's been a few months now, the memory is hazy), who either drop nothing at all or a no rent key for some of the locked doors you encounter along the way.<br />
<br />
After 3-4 months of key work, we went in and took Tashakhi out a couple of times before VI removed his trigger. His loot table seemed to be about 5 items deep, with 3 of them being garbage and 2 of them actually being nice (but lacking).<br />
<br />
Of the other 3 events in the zone. We have only defeated 1 of them, and got loot that redefines the word &quot;craptastic&quot;. The remaining 2 involve bugged and untuned fights which we decided were not even worth the effort anymore due to what loot we had already seen. One of them, in fact, was designed to be a &quot;difficult encounter for 36&quot; and yet repeatedly spanked us with a force of 60+.<br />
<br />
Once turning our backs to IA, we moved out west to Ssrasaly and in 1/3 of the time it took to get a raid force keyed for IA we managed to get about 98% of our active guild members keyed for Emp and a large amount of those stupid bane weapons where they need to be. Plus, we got to kill a lot of BGH snakes along the way and get loot we would actually use!<br />
<br />
It's a disgrace that VI has the mindset that it's ok to have a &quot;full plate&quot; working on the next expansion when their most recent one is not yet finished to the point that it can deliver what was promised at release. But hey, that's just par for the course for this *******s.<br />
<br />
Too bad we are the only guild to put a serious effort into IA keys. Be a lot harder for VI to backburner that zone if there were more people who actually cared what happened in there.<br />
<br />
On a brighter note, Seru dropped us some nice loot last night!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Komonwalz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know of at least another guild with a large part of their roster keyed for Inner Acrylia... so you are not alone out there ;)<br />
<br />
And oh yes, they pretty much unbalanced the three paths by making Emperor the door to VexThal. IMO both Seru and Takhashi should have been dropping Gatecallers as well. Would have helped to smooth a bit the heavy competition in Ssra if guilds could get power sources off two other zones.</div></div><hr />

****<br />
<br />
Uh , how do you figure? they would all lead to the same zone where there are only 12 bosses which can be cleared by 1 guild in 2 days or less.<br />
what are the other 2 guilds going to do while that happens?<br />
<br />
we dd serubanes while we were doing emp banes. took us 2 months to do both. we farm emperor and seru and we still have days of nothing to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would base VT rifts on the difficulty of the mob, using emporer as a rough guidline.<br />
<br />
Old version of Tashakhi was meant to be &quot;as hard or harder&quot; than the emp, and fell VERY short of that. He wasn't a pushover, but he was far from a major challenge. He was not worthy of dropping rifts (unless you want to justify it by the time required to farm keys).<br />
<br />
Seru is the easiest of the Luclin timesinks to complete (keys and bane weapons). Seru himself is also not hard enough to justify rifts. But most of his loot is well balanced rvr-wise at least.<br />
<br />
New version of Tashakhi is just speculation, since they won't let us fight him. He'll probably be emporer level, and if that is the case, he should drop rifts. Of course, by the time they put his trigger back in, my guild will be fully keyed for VT off Emp, so we won't give a damn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Komonwalz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It is not about the total amount of high end content available Chukzombi, but about the botleneck effect that happens if several guilds camp Ssra at once. Competition over spawns is already fierce enough to have that same level of competition moved to the key quests... that is what multiple paths of access to the rifts would solve.<br />
<br />
Its not enough racing for actual loot dropping nameds, that we also got forced (depending on your server competiton level) to race for keyquest mobs. Allowing both Seru and Takhashi drop rifts would eliminate the neck to neck competition I have seen in Ssra for banes/keys.<br />
<br />
Thats why the luclin paths are unbalanced, the only way of accessing vexthal is Ssra.</div></div><hr />
