<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cesta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am getting so frustrated trying to get the Shaman Powder from a Yun shaman in Trakanon's Teeth.<br />
<br />
The issue that I have is basically that the frogs are so social and seem to come out of the woodwork everytime I attack a Yun shaman.<br />
<br />
For the record I'm a 52 Ogre Shaman and I normally don't have issues with green swarms.  The problem is that 13 frogs (my average over the last 4 attempts) is just too many for me and the pet to handle.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something basic in the camp setup?  I've been trying to weed frogs out randomly to lower the overall numbers in the zone and then pull Yun's out one by one until the powder drops.  The problem is that no matter how many frogs I weed I seem to get 5 or 6 when I pull the Yun.  Then I get adds in dribs and drabs until I have this ravening, croaking little horde eating my pet and eyeing me hungrily.<br />
<br />
I've done a lot of item camping and I'm generally pretty good at separating a quest mob from their retainers.  In this case the aggro range on the frogs seems to be the main problem.  It feels like they literally have an unlimited aggro range in the zone.<br />
<br />
Does anybody have a good way for somebody to pull frogs in Trak's Teeth without getting half the zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mukguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I used a druid, he ran out using track and tagged him and pulled one back solo. I would suggest getting a druid or a ranger to help you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ROFL .... I remember those days trying to get the BLACK shaman powder... and only to turn around and have his green buddies and a few ghosts crashing my party!!<br />
<br />
Fret not... If you are an average soloing shaman, I've got the perfect location to deal with him.. Actually 3.. but only one has NO roamers coming close...<br />
<br />
Regardless of location, do the usual .. Make and buff pet.. buff yourself.. and get a FRESH sow (lol.. I still remember the days of sow wearing off on a pull!!)<br />
<br />
Loc 1:  Along NE wall between EJ and Seb.. closer to the aquaduct there is a rock that you have to go around.. park pet their and scout around... Mr Yun is uncommon to path there but he does alot.. I kill him quit often for the powder.. which I hand off to guildies or unsuspecting lowbie shammys!  Problem with this location is the 3-4 roamers that can make your day a WHOLE lot more interesting!<br />
<br />
Loc 2: Along south wall between Emp Ganik temple and Seb... There is a curve area that looks out over the corner of the temple floor(the &quot;cement&quot; area)... Mr Yun will path along that square going north and then hang a left continuing along the temple floor.  He's usually pathing every 5-10 mintues MAX.. Same issue... Cept you can get a few ghosts if you are not careful..<br />
<br />
Loc 3: Alot harder to describe and I dont have the exact location.. just by terrain and memory.. NO roamers path here... Along the west wall is a structure of some sort(more closer to the SW corner)... Just south of the structure is a valley area and a big rock (hmm .. I seem to like rocks.. and I aint even a woman!!! .. umm .. NOT ghey either SO ****)  Park pet there and face east .. should be a hill in front of you... Go over hill and you should now be looking out over the Temple floor.... Just off to the left should be an intersection of the hill you are on .. the corner of the temple floor, another hill running east/west...  Mr Yun will path along the temple floor heading west(ie towards you from Loc 2 pull spot).. Gank him and drag over the hill!!  There are 2-3 pathers in the area... but once you pull Mr Yun over the hill back to the wall.. no adds will come....<br />
<br />
Course now that I think about this.. Pulling is the KEY!  So either learn to pull... or improve your leet FD skills!!!<br />
<br />
Damn I type to much...</div></div><hr />
