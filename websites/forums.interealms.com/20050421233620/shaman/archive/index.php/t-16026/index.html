<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">POWERLEVELED: (Written as level 40+ characters getting EXP with a 60-65.)<br />
<br />
This is *not* a guide for people who rely on their horses/lizards. I have always loved dungeons, so this is where I EXP or PL my alts. This is also not a place to PL if you're not willing to enjoy a challenge or a good crawl.<br />
<br />
Tactics: <br />
1.) Using a 65 Paladin, who has no problem healing himself here. Pick up KEI on the Paladin. This can also work if you have a Cleric or Druid to PL you, although it may be a little slower. Shaman/Cleric/Necro/Etc...<br />
<br />
2a.) With Knight: Shaman slows, sometimes Malaisements first, on incoming, while Paladin tanks; can also nuke for slightly faster kills.<br />
2b.) In case of Druid, Cleric, or Necro doing the PLing: root, slow/malaisement, DoT, tank, get healed.<br />
<br />
3.) Remember to always root MoBs at 24%ish unless you have a snarer.<br />
<br />
4.) These are not generally loot camps, but you can still walk out with enough for some spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Hole:<br />
Why? Because it has a 25% exp modifier, and can get you exp just as fast as any PoP zone if you want to risk going deeper in.<br />
<br />
Zin: 40 to 45/48.<br />
Pulling from Zin to the drop off, including the 1 or 2 wanderers and the Golem and Crusader at the base of the stairs, will net you a whole yellow at 40, 3/4s a yellow at 43, 1/5 yellow at 45. Consistently, every 16 minutes, barring race penalties. At 45 you can either start going in deeper (I recommend the jail area, which can be loads of fun) or move to the next PL spot. Remember to Maliasement the Golems. Enjoy your IGS if/when they drop, as well as various other Withered Leather/Loam Encrusted gear.<br />
<br />
The Jail Area: 45 (with a good Knight/Necro PLing you) to 55.<br />
I love this spot because not only do I get good EXP on whoever I'm PLing, but because there's the off-chance you'll spawn Slizik the Mighty in the jail cell--leave the named rat alone and count it as a strike against you--that drops Idol of the Underking, which can still net you 40k on my server.<br />
<br />
The Crawl: (For those who want a challenge.) 50 to 55.<br />
Unless you have a gater doing the PLing, or you're PLing someone who can't gate, learn to love Thurg Gate Potions or 10-dosers if you plan on getting out. Start at Zin and begin clearing down to the Jail Area. If you kill fast enough you can clear the Jail and walk back to the drop off unmolested. Turn the other way and go deeper in. I wouldn't recommend going *too* deep, as CRs can be a pain. But if you want a good challenge to keep you on your feet, this is it. There will be 2s and 3s because of pathing and wanderers. I do not recommend going further than the second room (draw a line between E and F on this (http://www.eqatlas.com/hole2map.html) map).<br />
<br />
<br />
Sol B/Nagafen's Lair:<br />
<br />
Bats: 45 to 50.<br />
Sonic Bats are your best bet until 50. The EXP goes fast, the bats die easy, and if you buff MR you never have to worry about their stun. I tend to use my Paladin for PLing, although I do sometimes bring out the Cleric, depending on what's needed. Bats will start slowing down at 50, at which point you can start taking &quot;The Walk.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Walk: 50 to 58/60.<br />
The Walk is the trek from LBugs (Lower Bugs, right beside the Sonic Bats) to Effy (Efreeti Lord Djarn). Clearing LBugs is easy if you can single pull them. I always pulled from a distance using a low-level stun. When I didn't have a Chanter helping me with slows I'd use stuns to mitigate. If you're PLing as a Shaman, this should be cake for you. If you're PLing the Shaman, and you're not a Knight/Necro, you might want to consider bringing a friend along for slows. The EXP is hard to beat outside PoP. You'll be receiving AA, albeit slowly, and they'll be making fast progress on the trek to 60. if I remember correctly from when I did this with my Cleric I was getting a full yellow from LBugs to Effy's room (sometimes including Effy and a GEB or Ring drop) at 55 with a Paladin and Enchanter grouped. When you've cleared Effy's room begin heading back to LBugs for the repops, or to clear them. Rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
58+, you can sart doing the Planes for exp, but I do not dual-box/PL there, so you'll have to get advice on that elsewhere. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tyrika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am curious about the hole, what kind of a group would I need at level 43 to hunt here? Would it even be possible? I generally group with a level 43 rogue, druid and ranger but I can usually find other people who are bored and want to try out areas they have not been in before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 43 you'd be best having an FD puller and/or some Crowd Control to get them single. When ever I had my Shaman too close to zin when repops happened, they would bum rush her while the paladin was off snagging more from the tower.<br />
<br />
Before the revamp it was my favorite zone. Now it's just silly having something green to my Paladin mitigate slow. I heard they changed it so that it only happens deeper in, but I was very annoyed regardless.<br />
<br />
Now I'm spending time in KC basement with a necro :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ueauvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">my shm and bst hit 43 recently so i use a similar tactic<br />
pler is a 65 ranger, personally i think they are better than paladins :p 53ds up, ft 9, 6k plus hps self buffed and snare root etc<br />
PLUS AM3 EQ HEADSHOT<br />
shaman hits follow on group then /follow on ranger<br />
ranger casts shrew to give speed/utravision to shm and walks not runs, shaman casts haste on ranger and goes to sleep<br />
ranger pulls everthing with bow snares melees repeat.  with headshot firing and runners with finishing blow fights are fast.  2 or 3 adds? woot saves time snare em they hit ds i get around to killing them<br />
in about 3 hours got both chars to 44 and made 3k in DULAK.  if the poo hits the fan shaman has horse can heal/slow etc although haste is all he has cast so far, beastlord is bit slower, same with any melee class. takes the  pain i felt going thru 40-43 in gunthak itching to do it this way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nurga is another great place for this.  63 water pet (if I remember right, which ain't guaranteed) assasinates the first 1/4 of the dungeon on a very regular basis, and what's more rewarding than pulling a critter to have the pet just slaughter it outright?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ueauvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well they are now both 49, i have made 27k odd and i also pled a friends warrior from 41 to 47<br />
<br />
forget assasinate, headshot 305 dex air bow<br />
melee just as easy.  money then used for twinage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shareel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was in the Hole with my 43 Shammy &amp; 65 Ranger last week. Moved from ZI to Jail and back over the Stonebridge (the door is never locked, so The Hole isnt longer One Way) and got an full level from 43 to 44 in 1 hour &amp; 450pp on cash loot. My taktik was the same as Ueauvan wrote. Ranger pulled single and snared + meleed them down. All was done with 65 Ranger and 39 Shammy Buffs and my Ranger was most time at full hp exept I pulled 3 at once where she dropped down to 80% and healed up after fight. The hole is an amazing zone if you want to PL an toon from Lvl40 to 50+ and also an great zone to adventure with and group Lvl40+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">great info here guys,gonna try moving my sk from nurga to the hole and give it a try hehe.<br />
<br />
i use a 65 cleric to powerlvl the sk,so if yall know any tricks/advice i mgiht not know,let me know.my sk is 42 atm btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>loobusk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I USED THE SHADOWKNIGHT POWERLEVELING way! It seems to me very few know of it, but<br />
Its FAST, SAFE, EASY,VERSATILE, BUT BEST OF ALL,<br />
*IT IMPROVES YOUR SKILLS*.<br />
The shadowknight does not have to be high level!<br />
My shaman went from 1-44 in 3 RL days, ~1.5days /played , using a LVL 56 semi-decently equipped troll shadowknight.<br />
To see how this works, take PL'ing in Gunthak beach area for example listed below:<br />
1) Shaman in bear form sits at camp spot.<br />
<br />
2) Shaman spares only buffs that have impact (ie, regen, haste, dex) but conserve mana for nuke kills.<br />
<br />
2)SK pulls mob , beats it down with Low damage, however good ratio weapon i.e Shard of Night 21/24 piercer, until mob is at &lt;10% health.<br />
<br />
3)SK TURNS AUTO ATTACK OF THEN FEIGN DEATHs (even at lvl56, FD works 95% of the time.) IF IT FAILS get up, wait , RECAST (You'll do this very very rarely).<br />
<br />
4)Shaman gets up, casts the best mana cost effective nuke (enough to kill off the mob).<br />
<br />
5)Med shaman/SK repeat.<br />
<br />
The beauty of all this is that it allows the Shaman to have casting skills pretty much equal to level. <br />
<br />
At lower levels, your shaman(or X char) will be 1 shotting red cons. Which takes about oh less than  15 seconds for the SK to bring down to &lt; 10%and  FD on. Sometimes, you can try two or three mobs at a time, provided that you give enough distance between ur shammy and the mobs.<br />
You maybe thinking other classes that can FD can do the same, but what makes the SK superior is their utility spells and ability to dish out insane damage to the mobs ur killing, with virtually ZERO MANA COST. You don't have to rely on ur pet or worry about DOTS kill-stealing the mob, you have life-taps and can TANK.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Well, the only arcane skills that will be exercised that way will be Evocation and, if you alternate spells, Conjuration. More importantly, it can leave your Defense behind, and Defense is time consuming to raise later on.<br />

<br />
I am sure a SK would do fine FD PLing, but I swear that when my Monk is FD PLing, she never - and I mean never! - KSs with her DOTs or runs out of mana :)</div></div><hr />
