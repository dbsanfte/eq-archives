<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know FT is capped at 15.  What is HP regen capped at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">30, I think with regards to gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In a recent thread on the Steel Warrior boards, several people said 35 worn regen is max, although one said 45.  /shrug  Anyway, it's pretty high, that obviously stacks with any innate and spell regen you have on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">FT is 15<br />
<br />
HP Regen... well<br />
1.  Need to consider what is your race<br />
2.  If you have Max Regen/Aura focus gear equivalent to 15 Hp a ticket <br />
3.  Need to consider what illusion form your in.  (Such as Bear or Great Bear.)<br />
4.  Need to consider what buffs you have on (for example Po9 or even beastie spiritual stuff, etc)<br />
5.  Need to consider whether you have Replenish or any of your own <br />
regen buffs on.<br />
6.  Need to consider whether you have any AA regen invested <br />
7.  Need to consider whether a bard is sing a hp/mana regen song<br />
8.  Oh and whether you have a fungi scaled tunic or that other fungi patch tunic.<br />
<br />
<br />
A Rough max total maybe:<br />
18 hp (standing as iksar or troll) + 15 hp (in Regen/Aura gear) + 2 hp (bear form) + ~18 hp (from Po9, Spirtual, etc) + 25 hp (replenishment) + 3 hp in AA regen + 20 hp (64th lvl Bard song) + 15 hp (Fungi)<br />
<br />
Roughly: 116 hp a tick ~ <br />
<br />
But again I am probably going to be sited on a few additional hp regen sources that I have not mentioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Roughly: 116 hp a tick<br />
<br />
Well, mana regen is much higher than 15 if you consider all sources, too.  I kind of assumed he meant worn regen, since that's the equivilent of FT.  Anyway, any shaman worth his salt could keep up Q indefinitely, so add 200/tick to that if you want to go that route. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Worn regen is capped at 35.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AFAIK worn regen is caped at 30. Total regen I dont think there is a cap. I have personally gotten my regen to 165ish. <br />
<br />
28 natural<br />
15 fungi<br />
15 fungal regrowth (bug stacked, cant be done now)<br />
25 replinish<br />
40 regen potion<br />
50 druid regen spell<br />
2 bear form<br />
total 175<br />
So 160 with out the fungal regrowth since that bug has been fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I must be missing something, you say you got 50 hitpoints per tick from a druid regen spell?  The highest hitpoint per tick regen spell I see that druids get is Nature's Recovery (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2520&amp;source=Live), and it is only 30 hitpoints per tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh, Yeah the FT is capped at 15 was sort of my hint that I meant Worn regen.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering how many of my misc slots I could fill up with Regen augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Worn hp regen is 35.<br />
<br />
You can see it on my profile &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=272569&amp;alt=94705&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
If you add up the total hp regen its 37, but it caps at 35.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>DemonMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nature's Recovery = 30/tic<br />
Replenishment = 25/tic<br />
Total = 55/tic spell based regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, Nature's Recovery stacks. Shocked me the other day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye, but he listed Replenishment + a 50 hp per tick druid regen spell.  Natures' Renewal is 30 per tick, and it is the highest single spell regen that I saw.  Just making sure that it was a typo and not me completely overlooking a new spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ack yep my bad Recovery is 30 sorry guys I am not sure where 50 came from. In my figures tho I am only useing a worn regen of 15. So if you had maxed worn regen it would come out the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Looking at this profile,it can go higher than 35.<br />
<br />
Nice little porfile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=228404)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Item regen: 29 from that profile.<br />
<br />
What was your point again? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">slightly off topic, and totally noob question here...<br />
<br />
what is the regen of a troll in his mid-levels (39/40ish?) both standing and sitting?<br />
<br />
I have tried to look it up but I am kinda confused by what I see so I thought I would just ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thorman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Item regen: 29 from that profile.<br />
<br />
What was your point again? :)<br />
<br />
lol k,thought someone mentioned 35 was max base but guess I didn't pay attention to the worn</div></div><hr />
