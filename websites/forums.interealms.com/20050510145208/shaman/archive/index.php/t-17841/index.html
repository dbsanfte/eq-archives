<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hotelseven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all...just thought Id take a few moments and express how, in my opinion, the bazaar has allowed me to fully enjoy EQ.<br />
<br />
I first started playing EQ about 3 years ago.  I made a Barbarian Warrior.  It was horrible.  I got to level 29 and quit because the downtime was far too long and the fights were far too close for my comfort.<br />
<br />
I then made a Wood Elf Ranger whom I enjoyed playing until level 30.  Then he began dying when fighting low blues!  Also, the downtime was very long.<br />
<br />
Since I enjoy soloing I decided to then try a Necro.  I got him to level 14 and quit him because of the same reasons.  Long downtime and inconsistant fighting (sometimes could easilly kill a high blue, then would get smoked by a low blue).<br />
<br />
I quit EQ for those reasons for about a year.  After realizing that there were no other good MP games out there I decided to give EQ one more shot.  I figured, I like to mostly solo and the things that detered me from the game before were: dowtime and dying.  So I made a shaman, figuring I could solve these problems with SOW, Canni, etc....<br />
<br />
Well I am at level 32 now and am absolutely loving my Shammy.  The reasons for this, though, I believe are due to the development of the bazaar.  I have equipment now that should last me through my 50's.  This was unheard of before the bazaar.  Items like my Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate, or my Soulstripper (and every other piece of equipment I have with HP, Mana, Wis, AC, etc) have made dying much less frequent, and have drastically cut down my downtime.  I can consistently whipe the floor with high blues, usually without losing much more than 25% health.<br />
<br />
Not to say that getting this equipment has come easy.  I have spent litterally hours buying and selling at the bazaar.  I started off buying spiderling silks and making them into silk threads, then spider silks into silk swatches, etc until I could buy expensive items.  I have put over 72 days into this character (most of which have been overnights left on the bazaar hoping to sell my goods).<br />
<br />
The bazaar also makes for a nice change when you get sick of hunting stuff.  Its amazing how addictive it is when you buy a bunch of stuff at low prices and try to sell them for a bit of a profit.  I find myself always coming back to the computer to see if Ive sold anything.  Imagine if I invested as much time in the stock market..haha.<br />
<br />
Anyways, just thought Id give my 2 cents.  Thanks for listening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You have picked a very versatile class as a shaman. Should you grow tired of soloing (beacuse soloing takes time and more time) you will be welcome in many groups.<br />
<br />
Be advised though that you need to choose your spots carefully, but with that in mind there are few more adaptable soloing classes.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the bazaar, its indeed possible to get some decent gear in there if you invest time doing so. I recently met a player who was running around in expensive gear (including a SoD wich goes for 200k pp if it goes at all). Everyone who saw him asked eachother, whose twink is that? It turned out he wasnt a twink, he had just spent 3 months in the bazaar getting gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I couldn't agree with you more. My story is very much the same. I started with a Barb Warrior and made it to lvl 44 before I just gave up. He had pretty good gear for his lvl so I sold it and began making money in the bazaar. Most of the time I am able to have EQ running in the background while working so could work the bazaar off and on all day and sell overnight while I was sleeping and lvl my new Shaman in the evening. I worked the bazaar steady for about 6 months. I now have almost the best drop gear for my 58 Shaman and shouldn't need to buy anything else.<br />
<br />
I'm glad your back in the game and that you are a Shaman. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Indeed.  The bazaar can be a great tool.  I wouldn't say that I overly enjoy the financial aspects of EQ but I have learned to leverage them to accumulate a lot of easy plats.  And I too have to check my trader regularly to see if I've made any plats.  &lt;sigh&gt;  I'm an addict.<br />
<br />
I'm in my 2nd EQ life having 1st played from release through just before Kunark and I started over from scratch having given away my first account thinking I'd never be back.  The EQ economy has come a long way.  I doubt my original 50th DE wizard accumulated a total of 10k in the roughly 1.5 years I played him - and he was in an uber guild of that era.  In this, my 2nd EQ life, my shaman can easily produce and spend 10k in a week.<br />
<br />
I've made a small noobie fortune mostly selling easily acquired or fabricated tradeskill items and the occasional greed roll LDoN drop that comes my way.  Enough so that I feel like I'm in very decent gear, have bought every spell (or had em research combined) I've wanted so far, and have even blown a couple thousand plats on gear for my alts.<br />
<br />
I haven't made that much doing speculation (buying low and selling high) but if I see something I know sells easily going for cheap while I'm in the bazaar I'll buy it and sell it...but generally I'm not that patient and sell my goods at a price to keep them moving.<br />
<br />
At some point I hope to be making more plats via normal xping and adventureing but for now I still make considerably more on side ventures.<br />
<br />
I try to help people that are new to the game and struggling to buy gear and spells out with a little knowledge - I inform them of the value of simple noobie drops like bone chips, spiderling silks, and pelts.  Few true noobies and many returning EQers have no any idea of the value of these items and the easy money to be had.<br />
<br />
Also, whenever someone tries to beg from me I say 'no' and tell them to go farm some silks.  You can easily tell the scammers from the real noobies based on the responses you get when you tell them that.<br />

PS - Most classes can do well with some nice bazaar bought gear - but shaman are glorious regardless.  I was loving my shaman even back in the low levels before I got my bankroll going when I was making patchwork armor and thinking I was so very smart in my old-school ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree, the bazaar has been a godsend for the more casual player.  You can get yourself geared up and spelled up to a workable level to enjoy the game pretty easily, yet there is always something more high end to shoot for.<br />
<br />
Class-wise, I think shaman are lucky to be less gear dependent than most classes.  But we do need those spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definitely always something to shoot for in my case...that's for sure.<br />
<br />
I guess shaman can be less gear dependent but I definitely spend my share on attempting to maintain good gear.  Maybe this is why people that sell shaman spells put the smack down on us for them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is not the bazaar that is allowing you to be more effective. Its mudflation. Prices for most midrange items are insanely low. <br />
<br />
Then again given enough cash to twink with the game is easy enough for a rat to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cremkorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Looks like the girls like shopping.<br />

Hey, if you get that necro J-Boots you would like playing even better.  Until torpor a shaman cant solo anything fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Until torpor a shaman cant solo anything fun <br />
<br />
I'll disagree with you Crem. Yeah, bards can swarm kite, wizzies and druids do their quad kite, necros fear kite and rangers can bow kite. <br />
<br />
I'll use my exp with the hoppers in DSP as an example. I was level 52. Wizzie was quad kiting and there I was with Goner and my droghog. I had two, wizzie got stunned on his quad, went down like a sack of potatoes and his four jumped me too. At the same time, some uber heading to ME or UP trained 3 shrooms on me. Tally this now, 6 hoppers, 3 shrooms, 9 mobs on me. I go to town, tossin slows, stoic on the doggy, handin out dots like a dealer in vegas playin blackjack. I'm channeling like a big dog, root parkin all over. I finished all 9 with 80 health and 30 mana. RFP already. I have to think not too many classes could do that and come out that well and damn was it fun.<br />
<br />
I've soloed to 54 so far, had a blast doing it an done it quite well. Torpor adds some bigger mobs to our list of capabilities, but what I think the fun of shaman is, is that we can make so many impossible trains, insane mobs doable. Its our wide array of capability that makes us kick *** so hard. My main used to be a war and I got him to 54 before I figured out that it was shamans that made it everything possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Da Mighty Akymeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In my limited time on EQ ( about 2 years on and off ) I have noticed the bazaar having a fundemental effect on the way the game is played. I remember when totemic armour was ( almost ) a MUST for budding Shaman. Seeing a toon in a set of Totemic was regarded as Godlike. How many Shaman have or are doing the Totemic quests now ?<br />

Still at least no EC tunnels and nearly all my gear was bazaar bought :o</div></div><hr />
