<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Note: This guide will focus on those from level 1 to level 35. It will give tips as to were to hunt solo or grouped, and where to farm PP as well.<br />
<br />
Levels 1 - 10<br />
The following zones will pertain to where you started out. Kelethin or Surefall Glade.<br />
<br />
Kelethin/Greater Faydark<br />
This is zone has about 60+ people in at all times, so finding buffs will not be hard. Basically if you started out in this zone fight even conned and blue conned everythings. Just keep killing till you ding level 4. Then go to the Orc Lift and get in a group of 3 or more people (make sure they are all level 4) and head up to Orc Hill and hunt there till you hit level 9 or so. If you cannot find a group at level 4 go to Butcherblock Mountains and solo at the X - Roads fighting everything there even conned and dark blue conned. Do this till 10 or so.<br />
<br />
Surefall Glade/Qeynos Hills<br />
If you started out in Surefall Glade go zone out into Qeynos Hills then follow the path till you zone into Qeynos. Fight here at the Newbie Garden until you hit level 4 then zone back out into Qeynos Hills. Hunt anything that is even conned or dark blue conned solo or go to the Blackburrow entrance and get in a group and hunt the gnolls guarding the entrence. When you get to level 6 go into Blackburrow and hunt dark blue or even conned gnolls solo or get in a group and hunt the yellow conned gnolls at the &quot;Bridge&quot;. Do this till 10 or so.<br />
<br />
Levels 10 - 15<br />
<br />
Kelethin/Greater Faydark<br />
When you hit level 10 (or 9 if you hunted at Orc Hill) zone into Crushbone and hunt the dark blue and even conned orc solo or go to the slaver pits/slaver caves in a group and hunt there till around level 12 or 13. Then you can either solo the dark blue and even conned orcs solo or get in a group at the Throne Room. Stay here till 16.<br />
<br />
Surefall Glade/Qeynos Hills <br />
When you hit level 10 go to snake ledge and solo the snakes here till around level 12 or 13 or go get in a group and hunt in the snake pit till around 13 or 14 then go to any of the gnolls rooms till 16.<br />
<br />
Levels 15 - 25<br />
<br />
Kelethin/Greater Faydark<br />
At this time go to the Nexus and go to Shadow Haven and get a bind by the soulbinder. Go to Pauldal Caverns and get in a group and hunt the Recondite Bandits till 26 or solo the single mushroom spawn by the entrence at level 16 and stay there till 18 then go solo Phatog Fliends till 22 then go get in a Recondite group cause the EXP from Recondites is insane.<br />
<br />
Surefall Glade/Qeynos Hills<br />
Get a port to the Nexus and do the same thing that was said to do in Kelethin/Greater Faydark Section.<br />
<br />
Levels 25 - 35<br />
<br />
Everyone<br />
Get a port to Misty Thicket and then go to kithicor Forest and go to HPH. Then go to HK and get in a GR or RR room till 28. Then go to the WR room till 35. If you do not want to group... group till 28 then solo Mamoths in Everfrost or get to level 32 then solo Snow Cougars in Iceclade Ocean. Also if you feel the experience is lacking and your willing to spend half an hour or so looking for a group, you could get a port to the Nexus and ask for a partner (preferrably a healer if your a tank, or a tank if your a healer) and then go get a port to Lavastorm Mountains and fight at Soluseks Eye or more comonly know as Sol A. The experience here is incredible and the loot is awesome.... but its really hard to find a group here. You could do the same thing with Lower Guk. Also you could go to frontier mountains at 25 and fight at the giant fort till 30. Good Exp and Loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Places to Farm PP<br />
The only place to farm at these levels is the Aqua Goblins in Butcherblock Mountains. These Goblins drop 4 different items that sell for 4pp each. These items are: Djariks Stien, Goblin Backbone (stackable), Goblin Blood (stackable), and a Goblin Head. <br />
<br />
Conclusion <br />
There you have it. The is my first guide so bear with the typo's or stupid formating or what ever. I have leveled a Cleric using this guide (not doing the solo parts) and a Ranger (doing both the solo parts and the group parts) so none of the information is false. Hope you have fun with it. Oh and if you're ever on the Bristlebane Server give me a /tell on Yuum or Azen. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Umm . . . dunno what they're called on your server, but on Xev the four goblin rooms in HHK are called the LR, GR, WR, RR.  LR = Lookout Room, which is the small, dead end room just off of the Guard Room.  GR = Guard Room, which is the first room with goblins you come to.  Going down the stairs from the Guard Room, you see a room to the right, thats the warrior Room (WR).  And last bug not least, going past the WR you get to the Raider Room, RR.  When no one's in the RR people from the WR pull from it (if they have someone who can split em, that is) . . . but the reason I point this out is because the RR spawns are higher level than the WR, and that people are more likely to get a WR group before they can get a RR group because of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pinolian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From 15 to 24 the best exp in the game hands down at that level is Paldual caverns. You can make 3 levels a day easy there, and if in a bandit grp, also get loot to sell.<br />
<br />
After that Lake of ILL Omen until 29. Good groups agan = very fast exp, as many as two levels a day<br />
<br />
at 25-32 you can do the bridge near cazic thule, defenders and setntinels etc. You have to be careful about bouncers however.<br />
<br />
<br />
At 29 go roleplay and head to the Overthere. Grouping there you will average 2 levels a day until level 35 or so. But I reccomend staying here until 40.<br />
<br />
At 40 you can do dreadlands, non casters outside of cazic thule (zealots, fantatics, protectors).<br />
<br />
at 45 you can solo in echo caverns, umberhulks, all melee mobs that can be pretty nasty so be careful. you can do these til 50.<br />
<br />
at 47 or so you can do griffs in Jagged Pine. I hear they are good til 51.<br />
<br />
At 51 you can solo alot of the outside of dreadlands, especially if you have your call of flames quest spell.<br />
<br />
at 50  you can group in velks, and that is very good exp. you can solo there at 54 or so, if you are careful. single puls will be tough tho<br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, animals in JPF are good to 55 at least.<br />
<br />
I hit 55 and went to get my HotT, and haven't been back . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Azen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow thanks for all the comments on the guide guys! Astroshak the reason I didn't put the Raider Room in my post about HK because in my Experiences with leveling a Cleric at HK to 35 and leveling a Ranger there till 33, the RR just didn't have good exp. Me and 5 of my friends all went to the RR for an hour or so and got mabye half a yellow. Then we went to WR and got a yellow an hour. Also I don't like the LR room because that is for like level 20's and level 25's to solo but get bad experience. I also am going to edit my post with a couple more options at the 25-35 region. Thanks for all your input. Keep it up. Give me ideas to make this guide the best! ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oldunson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think you'll find the aqua gobbies have been nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Anchoritedog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Aqua Goblin camps  have indeed been nerfed.. Instead of the old 4plat per item you now recieve between  6and 7 silver per item.. Bye bye gobbos it was fun . :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pinolian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if you are desperate for cash around level 20-30, farm spider silks and sell silk swatchs in the bazaar for 7-15 plat each.<br />
<br />
Takes a few hours in upper guk to get 200 silks, but seeing 1500 plat in the next morning when you check trader is pretty nice when you are a young buck ranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good guide!<br />
<br />
(and a little bump from a new friend.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Negil Elvandor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is also the Aqua Goblins in Dagnors Cauldron for low to mid 20's, kinda dangerous if you get some adds.</div></div><hr />
