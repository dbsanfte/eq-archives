<br />
I am using Crydee's guide, (very nice, BTW) and it seems like there are some mighty big intuitive jumps between what NPCs tell you and what you have to do. <br />
<br />
For example, the woman in Surefall Glade talks about her dead mother. How do you get from that to a skeleton half way across the world?<br />
<br />
So, I'd like to hear some stories about how this stuff was worked out? What went through your minds?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Filson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was only in my 30's back then (I'm a slooow leveller), but it was a pretty awesome time to be on these boards.<br />
<br />
It was pretty much a massive community effort. Everyone was posting every scrap of information found on the board. There were long periods of searching, then sudden rushes of progress. <br />
<br />
One of the hardest parts to figure out, if I remember, was the runecrested bowl. Unfortunately at the same time the epics were out, there was the invasion of 'rude' people in the Qeynos area, and they were dropping enchanted clay -- that had nothing to do with our quest. I don't know who talked to Kinlo, but I'm assuming it happened while in the forge to get dwarven wire for a trueshot bow. Deciphering the ancient pattern was a source of never-ending entertainment. I would say that was the pinnacle of the group effort part that went into solving our epic.<br />
<br />
I also remember alot of confusion over what parts were the same as the druid epic, if they had shared steps at all, and when the two went separate ways.<br />
<br />
There were, of course, some notable pioneers. Crydee of course really brought it all together. But, there were others, too I can't remember. Folks that had to try leaps of faith like throwing mystery ingredients onto the potters wheel and hoping they didn't poof (remember, back then if you didn't have the right ingredients for a combine, kiss them goodbye).<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, now it's not so hard to go through, but I've got to salute EQ for designing an epic quest tailored for rangers. Wizards just got to go out and kill insanely tough mobs. We got an epic quest designed to exercise the greatest asset a ranger has, the community that came together on this board.<br />
<br />
(BTW, donate a buck. Or better yet, do what I did; buy a mousepad and throw in a little extra for the board.)</div></div><hr />
