Anyone else going?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I'm not going, but I believe my guild has the most attendees of any server, so you'll probably meet a lot of my guildmates before I do...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah... I'm going. Quite nervous about it for some reason. Will people think my butt looks big? Will I need to perform party tricks to show how I got the nickname soupypoopy? Will Absor show ANY sign of the NUMEROUS love letters, packages and phone calls? <br />
<br />
My heart's a-flutter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yep.  I'll be there.  God help you all!<br />

Chutoi</div></div><hr />

*no offense to the pasty overweight readers of this board, unless you get punched of course*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,<br />

Frekkels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>NewShaman1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I went to the MN Fan Faire and had a blast, unfortunetly only 10 people were there from Rodcet Nife so I didn't get to meet many people I knew online.  <br />
<br />
There were however alot of Fires of Heaven and Celestial Tomb fights going on from Veeshan server.  Its nice to see they not only fight online, but fight in RL as well when put together LOL. <br />
<br />
Have fun, wish I could be there :)~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hyllus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They should have a Fan Faire in Freeport Maine ;) Just thought of it from passing threw maine a few weeks ago =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Frekkels, <br />
<br />
OHMYGOD!!<br />
<br />
Please hug Fnord, Eltherion, Kalor, Barbasol, Dakon, Impman, Ojuillean, Tanvarin, and Cherrywood for me!<br />
<br />
I'm so jealous, I went to the Seattle Fan Faire and none of my guildies were there, I had a really fun time, but I would have loved to have met more people that I &quot;see&quot; on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
Please don't forget!</div></div><hr />
