<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well thnx to the outstanding advice to hit burning woods i have now done in  2 weeks what most my guild mates say tookthem months . im not 2 blue bub into 52 . burning woods has to be the best place in the game for a shaman 48ish with a JBB.  <br />
<br />
im finding at52 alot is green or light blue and the stuff that IS dark blue are getting considerably harder to kill . this is ofcourse expected as i am higher level and thats the point .<br />
<br />
but ...<br />
<br />
<br />
is there any ogod placed for a 52+ ?  anything even remotely close to how good 48-52 was in burning woods?  it would be nice to keep up a nice pace as long as possible . i think  BW spoiled me ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
thnx for your replies in advance</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gytmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Solo in CoM, OOT Seafurries can be decent if you have both jbb and epic thru about 54 (granted, several start to light blue at 52, but every one of them should give you exp through and including 54 - this is just for a change of pace though, and to add some coin while you are at it, as they drop gems and you can farm gornit at the same time - w/o epic, you will get exp, but not very much, downtime much longer), Sol B, maybe L Guk, Scarlet Desert.<br />
<br />
Overall for pure experience though, I'd say CoM is your best bet - experience bonus in that zone, and the kills are easy.  Just my 2cp, hope it helps....</div></div><hr />

thnx mate .. im not evil but they look great too for a change up from CoM and on into when CoM is too low</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Muddie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Currently at 52 , I'm either doing the Temple on the right or &quot;attempting&quot; some singles from Gazebo's (note I die more often than I can get a single). The temple I'm talking about is the one where the High Scale Icon drops. Its got loads of spawns inside and out. Only problem are the 3 lower floor spawns , I can't seem to break em lol. Well Good luck and Good Hunting =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gytmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Muddie's suggestion for where is CoM is a good one.  Starting about 54 or 55 you can solo the enterance to the castle, i.e. the gazeebos (epic really helps there).  Or you can just hunt near the zone in if there are not many people in there - pretty underutilized zone, usually quite empty.  Just pull one by one as many of the spawns near the zone in back to the zone in as you can b4 first one repops, rinse, repeat.  Exp is good in there at your level, mobs are easy, and there is also some decent random loot (couple monk sticks, etc.).  Enjoy :-)</div></div><hr />

well was trying CoM last night and no matter where i went i was either not strong enough to handle the adds or they werent strong enough to be worth it .<br />
<br />
kinda sad cause i luv that place :(<br />
<br />
<br />
tried SD and maybe i was just having a bad night , but it seemed like the aggro range was minimal 2 miles :p<br />
<br />
ahh well  , search goes on . thxn for the tips thus far . so far the giants in BW seem to be best .  drop nice loot and still dark blue  ( most)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hey Lit, where did you hunt at in BW? Been there before with my necro, but after 3 deaths due to lag, etc I swore never to go there again.  But now I have a better connection/computer so I'll give it a try.<br />
<br />
The skele's in DL are perma camped.  I'm running into too many light blues in Tenebrous mountains, so BW sounds like a good alternative.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Giant fort in BW starts to go light blue but is still great XP until you hit 54 or 55.  Decent plat loot, too.</div></div><hr />

Now I am fortunate in that I have all the appropriate 'toys' for my level: Fungal, JBB, EPic.<br />

Oh and dog-dog. Dam.n I love our Wolf.<br />

Get a Ranger (Chicken.sh.t. RUN) of 45 or so, slow the clumps of dirt and go to town.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ginslunger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Solo options:<br />
<br />
CoM Temple<br />
Cobalt Scar Wyverns<br />
Scarlet Desert Plateau<br />
The Grey<br />
Maiden's Eye<br />
Wakening Lands (stay away from the dragons)<br />
<br />
You're honestly to the point where you should be looking to refine your group skills.  I know it can be hard to find groups, but I often used soloing at that level to kill time and spent my minimal downtime looking for groups.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have gotten great exp soloing the gazebos in CoM at 52 with a JBB and horse.  Breaking the 3 spawn in each gazebo is a tough fight, but doable solo if you use pet and immobilize carefully.  Pull with Immobilize, hitting the nearest mob facing your direction.  Sometimes all three dont agro. If they do, get pet on one, root park one, and tank the third one.  If it goes bad, gate to entrance and try again.  Same thing with other gazebo.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, another group have broken up some of the spawns for you, making it that much easier to get going.  Once the spawns are broken, I could hold both gazebos and have time for a few other pulls from the approaches.  Awesome experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd recommend the goo house in CoM.  I did that up though 54 or so.  Most of the goos will be blue until then.  Be careful of the goo in the center of the central goo house.  It is a higher level goo (the ubergoo!) than the other 2 in the house.  You should be able to single pull all of them.<br />
<br />
There are 2 houses just past the central goo house (towards the castle).  There are also 3 goos in each house.  However, it is very easy to accidentally get all 3 of them at the same time when pulling, so breaking them can be hard.  Creep near them and use proximity agro to try to get singles.  I don't believe any of the 2 houses have an ubergoo.<br />
<br />
All told, with the central goo house and the 2 other houses, there are 9 goos.  They are great exp.  The ubergoo can also drop some spells and a club (wintry club?).<br />
<br />
Breaking them may take some patience, but it can be done.  Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The first reply to your posts was the best one.  That link will tell you about one of the best exp spots in the game (and doable by a 52 shammy with JBB easily).  GL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">awesome replies guyz . i see some definite options. but i think the statement bout me getting to the point where i need to focus on groups is correct . i think im going to take a week break to coem down from the high of getting my JBB . goign from 48-52 so fast leaves me feeling like im doign something wrong now that im not UBER leveling . time to get back into playing just to play. not just to level to go on raids.<br />
