<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all<br />
<br />
I am having some problems figuring out what flag i am missing.<br />
Recently i got around to killing Mithaniel Marr and thought Sol Ro here i come. but i cant zone in ???<br />
<br />
I went to the librarian and talked to him and still no luck.<br />
<br />
i went to the seer and said unlock my memories.<br />
All i get is &quot;takes me back to my childhood&quot;<br />
<br />
I then do guided meditation and get the list below responce.<br />
And idea what flag i am missing?<br />
I thought it was MB but i did that raid last night and got no responce from the Gnome before or after th fight.<br />
<br />
I am at a loss, and help would be much appreciated<br />
<br />
You say, 'guided meditation'<br />
The information obtained from Mithaniel is written in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />

You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls.<br />
Mavuin is grateful to you for taking his case before the Tribunal.  The information provided to you, that Mithaniel Marr and Karana carry information you should seek, could be quite useful.<br />

You remember Nitram's words - 'three small turns to the right on the bottommost rivet should open the door'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">did you visit the gnome in PoK library ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes i have seen him and hailed him.<br />
got a character flag<br />
But still have the above listed responce from the Seer.<br />
Do i need to say different things to the librarian to translate the other bits ?<br />
<br />
Will the question &quot;new lore&quot; have him translate things for me ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You remember Nitram's words - 'three small turns to the right on the bottommost rivet should open the door'.<br />
<br />
I think that means you killed the PoI dragon and have access to the factory, but you haven't killed Behe yet. Once you have Behe flag it reads something like 'Giwin wants you to meet him in Drunder so he can present you to Rallos Zek'. I could be wrong, but that's the only thing that stood out as a possibility to me from the text you got. The fact that you got no response from the gnome also suggests this - you need the pre-flag to get the flag afterwards. Looks to me like you may have to do this bit again..  :(<br />
<br />
Just checked HERE (http://www.ironvine.com/ci/flags.asp) and it does indeed look like it's MB that's missing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yea i know<br />
But as stated in the original post i went to a MB raid last night and got no responce from the gnome either before or after the raid.<br />
<br />
So i have to assume that i have the flag.<br />
or no ?<br />
<br />
any idea's ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you have already spoken to the Gnome before, I do not think that he talks to you again.<br />
<br />
I have been on three failed Behemoth raids but I only got a response from the Gnome the first time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sometimes, if you get the flags out of order, you need to cycle back and forth between the librarian and the seer several times, to get them all straightened out again. I had to visit each 3 times with my ranger, back and forth back and forth back and forth, before all of the flags finally straighened out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok went to the gnome and did the more lore thing and now i have this as an answer. Still not sure why it looks like i am missing the MB.<br />
Or do i?<br />

any idea's ?<br />

The History translated for you reveals the fate of Zebuxoruk.  Trapped in the Plane of Time you must gain the power of the elements to gain entrance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The pack of notes from Vallon are scribbled in a language that you cannot comprehend.<br />

looks like you need to speak to Maelin in library again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Okay, just a quickie--do the following and then come back and post results.  Let's make sure you have all your pre-flags.<br />
<br />
Go to the grand librarian.  &quot;what information?&quot; &quot;what lore?&quot;<br />
<br />
Go to the guy (adler?) outside the PoD ****pipe and ask, &quot;what ward?&quot;<br />
<br />
Go to thelin's healer in PoTranq and follow conversation all the way to end.  Not sure, but think it's &quot;what jeweled dagger?&quot; to get you within 2-3 prompts of the pre-flag.<br />
<br />
Go to Fahlia.  &quot;I will go to torment&quot;  Hail Tylin, too.  If he thanks you, you've got that whole line done (bertoxx, keeper of sorrows, saryrn, grummus, and I think, TT).<br />
<br />
Hail Adler's brother, too--just to make sure.<br />
<br />
If fact, you may want to do all of the above 3-4 times, with a trip to the seer to unlock memories each time.  Yes, it's a pain in the butt, but sometimes all you are missing is one pre-flag and they can be a real pain to straighten out.<br />
<br />
Once you do that 3-4 times, then come post what's missing.  Once we eliminate the pre-flag questions, we can see what you're missing!<br />

Everything looks fine as far as flags go. Should just need to go to the librarian and say &quot;what lore&quot; and &quot;what new information&quot; I don't see anything wrong with your flags tho.</div></div><hr />
