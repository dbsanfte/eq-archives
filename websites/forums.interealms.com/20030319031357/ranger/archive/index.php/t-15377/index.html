<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Jaggedpine Forest is still good for the soloing, though staring at animal rears is, as always, very boring.  <br />
<br />
I find that the best xp I've gotten yet is in the Planes, however, grouped.  <br />
<br />
I've not really looked at other places to try and solo, as I've been trying to get money for some new leggings, and just been slaughtering in CC when I'm unable to get a group in the Planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Laana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went through levels 52, 53 and 54 in Jaggedpine now at 55 it seemed to have slowed down quite a bit.  There any other good solo grounds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beeoz0r</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used to see rangers soloin ent mobs in karnors, not sure what lvl though, but velks would work just as good.  Quick note, they were just rootin, dot'n, and then bow puck'ing them.  So it probably isn't that good of an idea if you don't have a tolans bracer or ndless quiver =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am in almost the same spot you are in. I DID solo most of 55 in Jaggedpine, just because there was really nowhere else as good to go to. EXP slowed down a lot, and I did a lot of anacondas and very few griffons (most were light blue). Even tried panthers, but not only were there not that many of them, but exp didn't seem very good on them either. I posted a thread asking where to go at 56, because at 55 Jaggedpine was still the only option I saw.<br />
<br />
Soloing dark blue mobs that you can't fear when you get to this point just seems like endless downtime, even if you can take them, you will be sitting regening hp/mana for so long based on each kill that it will make your brain turn to putty. I don't have a fungi or epics yet (see my other thread titled &quot;56&quot;) and I am still looking for a better place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Streaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok I find I can solo effectively in Velks. I do wish however that my PR was higher the devouers DOT is a B-itch even with my fungi and regen on. The hunters are also pretty tough to and that is only because of they hit so hard. <br />
<br />
If you decide to hunt here this is what I do. I am keep myself at the bottom on the left side. You are not that far from the zone and no trains come across ya. If you get in a pickle just root and leave. Also NOTE this if you are doted and low on health  and you zone ALL buffs includeing the dot will be erased. Not sure if this is a bug but everytime I had to zone and had a dot on everything was gone. This is a good way to save yourself if the dot is going to kill ya. Roots have a had time sticking and when they do they seem to not last long so just pull with snare. Also note that when the spiders are low on health they will not try to flee!!!!</div></div><hr />
