<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seriously he still rocks... lvl 54<br />
The crusader nerf really hurt for 2h spec... but I have compensated quite a bit by getting rid of AGI gear and going alot into strength....I have over 200 str... 200 sta... so just over 3k hps (low) but 6k armor and tanking to take damage is not an issue... With that maraudon trinket to boost stats by 25, dps goes up even further when soloing. <br />
<br />
I do better than 100 dps with a 1h dimensional blade... (my truesilver 2h needs an upgrade though command still is brutal. at avg 600dmg a proc and any crit brings it over 1k) But with improved retribution aura (about 20-30 dps) and crusader with blade sharpened.... its easy to break 100 dps...<br />
<br />
51 Flayers go down in 25 seconds... sometimes faster (without using the undead nuke) so no complaints there.<br />
<br />
I can and have taken down 5 pulls with 3, 51 wizards in the pull, and still am wondering if I can solo princess.... Not sure due to that damn fart.<br />
<br />
Solo there are no problems.<br />
<br />
In groups.... the game is designed very strangely... For instance, I did the quest where you had to kill all the trolls up in NE Eastern Plaguelands... Had a 60 mage with us... Seriously... there is no way to tank and really no need when 1 wiz just kills .... everything. <br />
<br />
The absolute best use of your talents at that momment is just to heal... however that said.. when doing groups without a mage that destroys everything.... If they give you a 15 count on the main mob before starting... the mob goes down easily. Actually its sort of fun... cause all party chat is like 15,14,13... the countdown to doom. And actually I remember this same tactic being used quite a bit in EQ... so relatively little change there.<br />
<br />
Overall I am happy with my pally... just wish they hadn't nerfed crusader into the ground for 2hs quite so bad since it was my favorite seal due to it just being fast and there are not alot of fast 2hs out there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Careful shrewd, you are going against the grain here, most pallies claim 15-20 dps as max.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Glad to hear it, Shrewd.  I still like playing my pally as healer because it's so abusive using the game's hardcoded rules against it, but that's pretty much it. Soloing still takes too long and combat is too boring, IMO.<br />
<br />
One thing I am curious on is how you're breaking 100 dps with a 35 dps 1h weapon. Are you fully retr spec? I have both a Thrash Blade and Fist of Stone and both outdamage a green dimensional weapon. I lost roughly 6-8 dps when I dropped my retribution talents after consecration for holy but I still can't get much over 65 dps. It must be your retr aura that's making up the difference, but that is really only effective against fast hitting melees (def. not casters or big slow hitters like ogres).<br />
<br />
The most frustrating thing for me is comparing my dps with no seal, crusader and wisdom/light.  The difference is negligible and well within the margin of error, which is sad given that crusader is (in theory) a dps seal.<br />
<br />
One thing I was really happy about was that judgment of wisdom works again if you take the imp. blessing of wisdom talents (was bugged prepatch). I really wanna encourage healadins to try out imp. blessing of wisdom + fist of stone + judgment of wisdom + seal of wisdom sometime and watch your mana go up.  You can burn completely oom, wade into melee and then be fm in short order. Then you can listen to the other casters in your group bitch about how overpowered pallies are. It's all good. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try playing a paladin and grouping with 2 mages and a hunter as your regular group. I stand there while they destroy everything and I wonder why I&quot;m even there. I can heal and it does help, but I played a shaman in EQ and was trying to go melee in WoW, but in groups it is as if I'm back stuck playing a shaman again.<br />
<br />
(for those who follow my posts, which is unlikely, you may remember me saying I played a mage, that was before I switched servers -- and yes I'm thinking of going back to that class or warrior or something, anything ;p )</div></div><hr />

Yeah the retribution aura makes up for it... thrash blade sucks IMHO... its slow and the crits just are not there... with a dimensional blade I hit for 88 dmg per hit every 1.1 second... retribution aura is doing 19 dmg, crits and vengence (talent) make up the difference.<br />
<br />
Against slow guys or casters... I use command and 2h.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">remember izmalis... vengence is lead by crits and fast blades mean you are under its effects nearly 100% of the time...</div></div><hr />

Right, I forgot to consider the speed of the dimensional blade and the effect of vengeance.  Still, I typically use the Fist of Stone regardless because of its proc/stats and it's also very fast. I'm still not seeing those numbers but then I don't typically run retr aura other than when grouped.  Do you wear a lot of crit gear? I wore the ornate plate for awhile and that did seem to boost my crit rate a noticeable amount for soloing.<br />
<br />
I do love the fact that I can be healing in the middle of a pack of mobs and still contribute dps with consecration AE.  I'll def. take my paladin to 60 but it's going to be slow going as I can't bear to solo him anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seriously righteousness isn't bad either... it is nearly comparible when using a 2h... at 60 I will try a respec.. that has 30 ret 21 holy to get sanctitiy aura... I'm wondering how insane the commmand crits will be and righteousness should be huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually my crit gear is non existant. I have the helm of the mountain and legs fro princess. Warmonger chest from badlands quest, and a bunch of other Green Ah stuff. I have like 11% chance to crit only, but that number has to be increased when you are fighting lower level mobs, because I &quot;feel&quot; like I crit more than 1 in 10 swings... <br />
<br />
Just hit 55, Against black rock slayers I am still using a 1h.... The truesilver is a nice weapon (my personaly choice VS lower level elites and warlocks) But against higher level stuff I go 1h w shield and crusader still.<br />
<br />
The solo time is much larger than rogues, but I can tell you for certain, I can do somethings now at 55 a lvl 60 rogue would flat die on... and of course vice versa...<br />
<br />
Did find that I need to up the STA more though... I need an extra 1k hps or so it seems for Black Rock.. Depths...<br />
<br />
Tried overmaster pyron last night solo... was not pretty, 6k armor or not... he hit me for 1k dmg in a single swing + proc. I could survive it over time, but not with only 3k hps..<br />
<br />
After I hit around 58 gear will not be being constantly upgraded and I can farm some decent sets (sta/ac, resist, crit/str) But for now it is just a hodge podge....</div></div><hr />
