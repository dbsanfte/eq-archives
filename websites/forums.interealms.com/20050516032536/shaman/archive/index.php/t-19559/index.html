<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
I just wanted to get your thoughts on the Proposal thread and what you thought went well and what could have gone better. Right now, we are at 350 unique responses, 348   in support.<br />
<br />
First, let me say it was my privilege to gather your ideas/feedback/dreams/suggestions into one thread. The Crucible is lucky to have so many passionate and creative individuals willing to take the time to craft eloquent design ideas (many of them with numbers to back them up). I keep saying I contributed very little to the thread, and it's completely true, the true author of the Proposal is the Crucible itself. <br />
<br />
There are way too many people to thank individually, but I would like to thank Chutoi for getting us started with his incredible initial post on TNZ. The rest of you... /salute.<br />
<br />
What went well:  <br />
* So many people, overcoming the huge obstacle of shaman versatility and coming together to try to find consensus<br />
* Changes to the GoD cannabalize spell suggest that they heard us<br />
* The poll was useful to narrow down our areas of focus<br />
<br />
What didn't go so well:  <br />
* Posting to TNZ, I'll just leave it at that<br />
* Brenlo did not respond to the emailed proposal<br />
* No response from the other two SOE feedback email addresses<br />
* No SOE representives posted here, even if not to agree/disagree with us, just to let us know that they are listening<br />
<br />
After years of saying &quot;Why even bother to try to come together, we're so different, we all play so differently, there's no way we would ever agree on anything,&quot; I thought this attempt was extremely valuable and positive. <br />
<br />
I'm interested in your feedback. If there is a future effort, how can we be even more effective?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think that the One Voice past is pretty much as good as it is going to get on our end.  Everything else is up to developers.  If they choose to ignore us, there is nothing else we can do about it unless you are willing to cancel your account/pre-order.<br />
<br />
The only suggestion I could make is to try to mold these forums in to a more hospitable place.  If I was a developer and I read the one voice post, then came here and browsed around, I certainly wouldn't want to post.  I've beaten it to death already, so I will just say this:  I think there is too much cynicism and negativty on these boards, and it is starting to hurt the community.<br />
<br />
edit: Oh and the IGE banner probably doesn't do much for persuading devs to post here, but that is out of our hands now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We pay them for a service. The reason for the cynicism and negativity on these boards is the past absolutely horrid job on their part.<br />
<br />
You're absolutely right thought, it is all in the dev teams hands. They can either try to do their jobs(speaking directly to their &quot;cs&quot; man) and make their service work or kick back and do nothing and let it decay even farther.<br />
<br />
The gap between us and soe is not so large that a moderate effort on their part couldn't more than solve the problem. A post a week written in a professional matter addressing the community's concerns or asking for our input would be a godsend at this point, and would take possibly an hour out of one of the days in Brenlo's work week. <br />

If your pr people have the time to read all of the online comics they most certainly have the time to spare interacting with your customer base.</div></div><hr />

Here's some fun food for thought:  I work in one of the worlds largest corporations and all they care about is how success is measured, how they can make it better, and what their customers and the world say about them. The volumes of studies and information gathered to improve the products and services offered to their customers is staggering. Information like the proposal and the polls is very valuable information, information they should be paying analysts to compile. For them to ignore such a freebie would be quite foolish indeed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a REALLY good point.  Companies like Sony spend millions on focus group testing, satisfaction surveys, product testing, market research, etc.  You did the work for them - it will be really sad if they don't even respond or acknowledge it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keldrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If SOE cared about the community of players, then they'd be putting out advertising dollars to have their own banner up at the top of this page.  They haven't posted squat here in years.  Now that there is a banner for IGE, suddenly THAT's why they dont post?!  /boggle<br />
<br />
Or they would host Class forums on eqlive to listen to, and address our concerns.  Much they way they do over on the SWG site.  They even have volunteer player professionals over there to coalate top issues and concerns.  Anarchy Online has a similar program and company hosted profession boards.  The programs aren't perfect... but they are THERE.<br />
<br />
The fact that they don't do it here means they really have no intention of listening to us or acting on our concerns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm interested in your feedback. If there is a future effort, how can we be even more effective?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The biggest advice I could give is: do not get discouraged.  In a short time, the shaman community banded together for a collective goal.  It is often difficult to address every person's idea or thought, and I thought focusing on a few categories was a decent approach.<br />
<br />
Many people complain when something is broken, but they never take the time to draft a letter or pick up the phone to call.  Opinions are great if they are used effectively.  Just because there is no response from SoE does not mean anything.  Granted, it would be nice if they acknowledged.<br />
<br />
The main thing is: this community took the time and energy to draft a proposal and send it to SoE.  At least people stood up to make a difference, and in the end, that is what matters the most.  I am sure SoE saw that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The proposal was a good idea.  Over all it seemed well thought out and insightful.  I know that on the TNZ boards got things derailed a bit, but I suspect that we would have still been looking at a new canni that was almost identical to canni iv if it had not happened that way.<br />
<br />
I am a little surprised at the accusation (if I am reading things correctly) that the proposal is a result of, or a cause of, some vast negative sentiment on the part of posters on this board.  Reading back at the proposal proper, and the posts of several people, like Chutoi, it seemed that they were well-reasoned attempts to articulate what some see as upcoming problems.  It does not seem a wellspring of woe and despair.  If anything the wording of the proposal reinforces many good aspects of the shaman class, and reiterates out strengths, as well as our weaknesses.  <br />
<br />
Even though things got ugly over on the TNZ boards, I think it had some positive effect on the shaman abilities like the improvement on Canni.  I doubt there whould have been a way to express dissatisfaction with the up and coming expansion that would not have caused some shrill disagreement.<br />
<br />
I would say the best way to improve upon what was already done is to try to keep consistently saying the same thing until it is taken seriously.  Sony designers do have a hard time, as no matter what one person asks for, there is someone else who will not like it.  It is impossible to balance thousands of differing points of view.  I think a consistent, unemotionally articulated message will, in the long run, be respected.  Keep up the good work Gloriana, and everyone else who put thought and effort into the proposal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well there is one thing you could do.<br />
Unlike SoE the Sony Corporation of America (SCA)does take customer feedback serious.<br />
You could always send a mail to the managing director of SCA and ask if it is standard practise for Sony to ignore its customers.<br />
I can guarantee you that a reaction will follow.</div></div><hr />

Why do I have the feeling that it went something like this:<br />
<br />
SOE Developer (Ted) gets email with URL to proposal.<br />
<br />
SOE_Ted: 'Hmm what's this? Shoot, I haven't nerfed anything inawhile, should be good for a laugh.'<br />
<br />
SOE_Ted: &quot;Hey Bob - what's a Shaman?&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE_Developer_Bob: &quot;Hybrid Class of Beastlord and something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE_Ted: &quot;Oh yeah forgot. I got an email from their class boards.&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE_Bob: &quot;What's it say?&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE_Ted: &quot;Hmm looks like a proposal for some changes or alterations to class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pause.<br />
<br />
SOE_Ted: &quot;Wow...I count over 100 people in support. Most of them level 65's with a lot of days played. Oh wait. 2 people disagreed.&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE_Ted: /e hits 'delete key'<br />
<br />
SOE_Bob: &quot;Anything interesting?&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE_Ted: &quot;Naah, they mentioned something about Gates of Discord..what's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE_Bob: &quot;That expansion we're putting out in a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE_Ted: &quot;Why would they complain about something we haven't worked on in 4 weeks?&quot;<br />
<br />
SOE_Bob: &quot;Dunno...say what can we do to improve Bards?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're referring to me, then you're misinterpretting what I meant.  The Proposal is the most positive and constructive things to ever come out of these boards.  Gloriana did an excellent job of writing the proposal and keeping it 100% constructive and reasonable.  She sorted through hoards of unreasonable demands and expectations and managed to single out a few key things that we most need improved.  I certainly do not see the Proposal as one huge, collective whine.<br />
<br />
The negativity and cynicism I was referring to was just a general attitude that has been taken by an increasing number of posters here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Caster's Realm has an IGE banner (it's small) on their news page.  I know they aren't considered the best reliable source of info, but they do get exclusive interviews with SOE people, especially at fan faires.<br />
<br />
I think the best thing for us now, is to keep persuing SOE in terms of getting someone on their staff to at least come here once in a while.  Also, would like to see what their vision (if any) is for shamans, especially since the game has changed hands.  The description of shamans on the official EQ site, is nearly comical when reading the other class descriptions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the shaman class i do think needs looking at. i think some of the proposal was abit confused at times, like our versitility, we aren`t that versital. we can solo, or we can debuff in groups. their are lot of classes that can solo what we can, but add more versitility to groups. i think if anything we are less versital as we once where.<br />
<br />
but apart from that, some good idea came out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">if SOE would shut IGE down their banner wouldn't be here.  <br />

now they're just at fault twice for not controlling the selling of characters/play/equipment and also for not having any sort of communication with the playerbase</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">the only thing there is too do now Glori IMO is NEVER give up . Not untill we at least get some kind of an official reaction . We  need too continue too voice our opinions too the people that are paied too listen too us .<br />
<br />
Druids didnt get Fixed bease they tried one time then gave up when they were ignored . They were given HUGE upgrades becase they refused too just sit back and say nothing while being ignored .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My main is a warrior.  I have been thru a class that was a close to totally broke as you can get.  We waited, and complained, and waited some more, and complained.  We sat and watched as each month in future plans melee rebalancing would be mentioned as something coming.  Then we complained some more.  Finally, after about a year, we got some fixes.  We still have issues, but we are far better now than we were.<br />
<br />
Shaman are not now broken to my mind(note mine is 57, so have yet to see high end with her).  Shaman do have some legitimate issues tho(as I argued on The Steel Warrior when the link to your post at TNZ was pointed to), and it is far far better to work towards getting those issues fixed now, than to wait untill your class is broken.  If the length of time it took for SoE to do something for warriors is any indication, starting early is a very good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I though the proposal was great. It was well-written and contained a number of options for improving shaman. The fact that a rough consensus emerged from these boards is telling in itself, since shaman have never really come together on the issue of class balance before.<br />
<br />
As for making the proposal more effective - I don't know what else we can do, short of forming a massive picket line at SOE headquarters. They know where these boards are, and there's no way they can be ignorant of the proposal's existence. I guess we just have to be persistent and keep making SOE aware of the problems with our class. It's up to them if they want to act on our concerns.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if one of the developers would stop by and at least acknowledge our efforts, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good point was we all came together and did something. We spoke and if they dont listen, well that shows us the state of the SoE consumer interaction and nothing cna be done about that.<br />
[<br />
Frankly i think we need to just wait till after the expansion buzz dies off and everything will be just fine.<br />

Present changes that are doable, not ones that will overpower our class. Whining about change without presenting an alternative never got anyone anything useful or worthwhile. If we got no response outright -- we must have at least made someone somewhere raise an eyebrow and say, &quot;Huh.&quot; That's a start, that's our fingerhold. Grab hold of it with both hands, and Light help you, don't let go.<br />

- A good number of those negative cynical bastards are guildleaders, raid leaders, people with a metric crapload of AA and elemental+ gear, members of Time enabled guilds, people who pretty much every day are at the top of the content foodchain. Those people have witnessed this class erode over the last 3-4 expansions. Cynicsm has been building up because SOE makes stupid decission after stupid decission (remember PoP stat buffs? remember GoD disease DoT?). GoD was nothing more than the trigger. <br />
<br />
Negativity is due because SOE finds it more interesting to fixing how doors turn instead of addressing core balance issues. Warriors have been broken since when?<br />
<br />
Negativity is due because idiots flock to these boards without basic knowledge of game mechanics and spewing garbage like &quot;Shaman slow is 20% more powerful than enchanter slow! OMGZ THEY ARE UBER! OVERPOWERED!&quot;. This of course without taking 2 minutes and look at the entire picture.<br />
<br />
Negativity is due because SOE has been constantly ignoring every single feedback we sent them. It took us what? 5+ months of constant complaining for someone at SOE to realize ... hey, the PoP stat buffs are really worthless!<br />
<br />
Negativity is due because SOE has no customer support. None. Zero. Nada. Or you wouldn't have guilds being locked out of Time for 22+ days. Not to mention, when CS gets involved, it's the fault of an emulator!<br />
<br />
Negativity is due because it's obvious SOE has no clue what a shaman should be. Or we wouldn't be getting those groovy disease DoTs. Not to mention SOE has no clue about their own game. <br />
<br />
But most importantly, negativity comes because many of us oldtimers care about this once powerhouse of a class who is now slowly becoming obsolete. Many of us remember how pathetic some classes were after release, how pathetic some classes have become, we care, we don't want the shaman to descend to those levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Helios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I guess we just have to be persistent and keep making SOE aware of the problems with our class. It's up to them if they want to act on our concerns.<br />
<br />
 Its up to Shaman to show some backbone and be willing to put their money where their keyboard is. If you keep giving them money, and buying crappy expansions that don't help your class, then as far as Sony is concerned there isn't actually any problem. You can keep wasting your time &quot;making SOE aware&quot; but is that really your job? You're paying them you shouldn't have to explain why they are doing a bad job.<br />
<br />
 It's striking how little SoE seems to know about how Shaman play the game. I remember when POP was coming out they were going to give shaman some ridiculously retarded single target STAT buffs like agility. When was the last time that was useful? The Shaman community had to go to a bunch of effort and time EXPLAINING TO SOE how to make their expansion right. They changed the buffs finally, but how can you feel good about a company so clueless that without any input from the actual players they would have released spells that at the very best could be viewed as a sick joke.<br />
 <br />
 Then, not having learned their lesson, the very next expansion they try put out a new spell for druids and shaman that literally does the EXACT SAME THING as an existing shaman spell. Lets see, nice upgrade for druids and completely redundant piece of crap for shaman. OK thats game balance. If they had any pride or integrity they'd be embarrassed by stunts like that and many more like them. Literally anyone who playes a shaman 60+ could do a better job.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if one of the developers would stop by and at least acknowledge our efforts, though.<br />
<br />
 There's no mystery about why SOE aren't even acknowledging the proposal. They don't care. They have an addicted player base that will stand for any amount of consistently horrible customer service. Enjoy.</div></div><hr />

 Then, not having learned their lesson, <br />
<br />
 Oh yeah, did I forget the current GOD situation? I'm just shocked, really I am, that they try to saddle shaman with a new slow that would take up an extra spell slot that no shaman has room for instead of a real upgrade. Oh yeah and a new disease DOT. How can you guys stand it, honestly? I didn't buy LOY or LDON, quit shortly after, and I'm never buying another SOE product ever again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the One Voice post was very powerful, even if it went completely unseen by SOE.  We were able to overwhelmingly put aside our differences and over time define our most pressing grievances in order to agree to speak in a unified manner.  Many of us disagreed with the prioritization and even the wording of some of the One Voice post, but we still signed with &quot;I agree&quot;.  <br />
<br />
I'd like to see us try this again one month after GoD is released.  We can start the 'formation thread' a week after release, and build it up into another cohesive post, using a poll for priorities a week before the One Voice final 'signature thread'.<br />
<br />
I agree TNZ was a mistake. :p   Just Dev corner next time! :D <br />
<br />
Perhaps a One Voice in game activity, similar to the Steel Warrior sit-in (non-violent, non disruptive, etc) could be arranged to fix Plague of Delusion. ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm not buying GoD and I have bought EVERY expansion so far.   I'm a hard core player but not at the very hard core high end of the game.  I have devoted almost 4 years of my game time to this game,  I have a ton of characters, and a ton of friends online. <br />
<br />
It's always been obvious that SoE does not have a single dev that plays a shaman, and probably never will.   Hey Brenlo GO MAKE A SHAMAN,  then group with a beastlord and an enchanter in any PoP event or Ring event or LDoN adventure and then come back here.   Do us all a favor and just go play the damn class.   Then tell us you want your shaman to have another disease dot so you can go off and play by yourself for hours and hours (yes even though you at SoE practically force us into groups).  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">A good business tries to reach out to their customers, not make their customers jump through hoops to reach them. <br />
<br />
IGE banner is an excuse.<br />
<br />
In your entire history of playing EQ, what could possibly make you describe SOE as a &quot;good business&quot;?  The marvelous customer support?  Their ability to enforce policies like &quot;no plat sales&quot; (just look up and to the right)?  Their masterful planning of high-end content (which typically isn't even completed until months after the expansion is released)?<br />
<br />
SOE may be a successful business, but a drug dealer can also have a successful business, that doesn't mean they're a good business..<br />
<br />
Anyhow, as for what we could have done to be more successful, I think having everyone post was a bad idea.  Instead, people should have sent an email (with an optional form letter for them to copy paste).  If SOE got 300 emails, it'd be a lot harder for them to ignore than one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">We just have to continue to push this issue. If they did not respond, send AGAIN. And AGAIN. Until they will respond. We've been ignored for far too long to drop this now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">All the work being put into making the proposal is very impressive and it turned out to be a fine proposal no doubt about that....<br />
<br />
...BUT it apparently had exactly the effect I suspected it would ( = zero)<br />
<br />
It is mindboggling how Verant and now SOE manage to ignore 99% of what their customers think about the game but I fear its the relative lack of real competition that makes them in to the slackers they are.<br />
<br />
I have a suspicion that even though SOE might be ignoring this community that there are people at Blizzard that are tasked with regularily reading whatever positive or negative comments and ideas are being thrown around here. It should be veritable goldmine for them so that they are able to avoid most of these issues when their game is ready for launch. The fact that SOE doesnt realize this major threat is hard to understand but I guess they will realize when WoW launches hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">perhaps they do recognise this threat, which is way they not putting the man power into it. or they could just not know what to do and so sit there paralysed:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I agree that you have to push it abit. Let the proposal or whatever it is be sticky here a year or 2. There are ofcourse devs checking the sites from time to time when they are bored. But I can asure you that if I was working at SoE as dev I would never post here ever as I would be overwhelmed by spewing of this and that. I dont think the proposal had zero effect, as it is sent to Brenlo who have read it Im sure of and I guess you could cc it to Lyndro who is in charge of all spells in eq too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">We pay them for a service. The reason for the cynicism and negativity on these boards is the past absolutely horrid job on their part.<br />
<br />
One of the many reasons that I am looking forward to WoW.  Nothing motivates Sony as much as the thought that they might lose a buck somewhere.<br />
<br />
Regardless of if you play WoW or not, EQ will likely get better as a result, befitting us all.  CS is one of the worst areas of EQ in need of improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">You can bet it was noticed.<br />
<br />
And I would go so far as to say the devs were probably impressed with the content of the proposal.  The problem with this sort of thing unlike real government is that we will never see what SoE may have done without our proposal.  Maybe nothing was actually changed but they have to at least been educated to our views and that is all we can do on our end.<br />
<br />
At the very least we as a community can say &quot;Hey, we do our best to explain our views and needs and now we have a right to bitch up a storm when we get screwed over.&quot;  Not like they can say &quot;but no one has complained.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">First off, thanks to Glori and other class leaders in contributing to the effort to get SoE to recognise shaman concerns.  I feel we were moderately successful, but I feel we failed to present a rocksolid argument to other classes who oppossed us at every turn, mostly stating arguments spawned in ignorance.  I think some of the numbers we posted here should have been cross posted to other class boards.  It's sad to say, but misleading crap like Thott's graphs did more to misguide people on the shaman class than our recent efforts to educate people because it was presented in pretty, easy to read graphs and was presented by a person who WAS widely respected by the playerbase due to his guild and position (it's sad to say, but if guys like Furor calls crap on a stick cotton candy, many would eat it).  Had we presented a sumarised, easy to read, pretty summary ... well ... we would have been flamed to hell and back, but more people would understand.  It's hard for SoE to support class upgrades when every other class is screaming at us calling us unrealistic and worse.<br />
<br />
I loved this quote, and I fully support it:<br />
Well there is one thing you could do.<br />
Unlike SoE the Sony Corporation of America (SCA)does take customer feedback serious.<br />
You could always send a mail to the managing director of SCA and ask if it is standard practise for Sony to ignore its customers.<br />
I can guarantee you that a reaction will follow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The negativity and cynicism I was referring to was just a general attitude that has been taken by an increasing number of posters here. <br />
<br />
I do not agree with this statement at all.   The overall attitude of this board and EQ player base in general has always been a &quot;At arms length&quot; relationship with Verant and now SoE development teams.  Posters on this board do take a higher road in general but there has always been a undercurrent of negative posting here. <br />
<br />
If anything, the real issue is the loss of some of the stronger voices in our community due to burn out, disinterest, and anger at Everquests handling of the Shaman class along with advanced age of the game in general.   This loss of community effects the balance of quality of posts and posters on this site.   As new players grow in the game, some may fill the gaps but never replace the vanguard posters that helped grow our class from beta into first expansions.<br />
<br />
Gloriana <br />
<br />
Thank you for your direction on this issue and taking the high road in attempts to communicate to the development groups at SoE.   Sunmoon has stated that based on IP logs there are SoE IP addresses surfing this site.  IGE aside, SoE does come here and read our comments though they don't post or add to our community.  That is their loss not ours that they don't engage a classes community on it's major class site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I was impressed that the One Voice post was able to come together.  I think that Gloriana leading the way, and a lot of other people with positive suggestions, helped pull together a list as near to consensus as everposted here.<br />
<br />
It may be that our opinions will now be in the minds of the devs, going forward.  I do not know.  Doesn't matter, as Glori's questions were:<br />
<br />
What went well:<br />
the effort to get agreement was systematic, and used the poll to rule out some issues that were considred by some to be important, but were not high on the lists of the majority.<br />
The writing and editing was excellent, with no &quot;pride of authorship&quot; issues.<br />
<br />
What went wrong?<br />
We waited too long - period.  Concerns/copmplaints/whines started with the first hints on the new expansion, but the consensus and One Voice post were delivered late in the process of the expansion.  <br />
<br />
Net Result?<br />
EXCELLENT - we now have a consensus on what are the issues that the majority agree concern us.  We have done the work (thanks again Gloriana, Chutoi, et. al.) and have a product that will not be obsolete any time soon (judging from the changes that have appeared in Lucy, anyway).  <br />
<br />
Next time SoE starts talking about an expansion, we can pull this back out, re-poll to see if new issues have developed (how would I know - ancient spells drop like candy and are cheapening the shaman class?), and have it sent to SoE reps to re-affirm our concers - at the beginning of the expansion development cycle.<br />
<br />
If we do that, I think we will have a lot of impact on the next time around.  <br />
<br />
I greatly value the effort to get agreement, and I am impressed by resulting list of suggested ways to address the concerns we articulated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Next time around, I think the proposal should be much shorter and more specific, and the request for a canni upgrade should be phrased as just that, not as a mana regen upgrade.  No one buys that we need improved mana regen, when what we really want is not necessarily more mana per tick, but less pushing of the Cann IV button (as I understand it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">If SOE hasn't posted here because of this site's IGE banner, then they are two-faced.  Like I said before, Caster's Realm has a little IGE banner on the right side on the front page, just below a big ad banner.  Yet, they can have personal interviews with people at SOE?  They had a recent interview with someone posted on Feb 2nd.<br />
<br />
I really just want a thorough explanation on what their blueprint is for us, not just in future expansions, but for the last several.<br />
<br />
If SOE were just a bit more innovative with upgrades to spells/AA's to make my shaman life of nearly 5 years more spicy, then I think most of us here, wouldn't even have issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Overall I think we did a great job, personally.  And Gloriana, while the content of the proposal maybe didn't come from you personally, the ambition and initiative started with you, and that is every bit as powerful as the content itself.  So, Thank You!<br />
<br />
One small thing I would change is the way the poll was done.  I believe it would have been better to have a poll that only took each voter's top choice, instead of allowing them to click all (if they so chose).  That method would have still allowed us to pick the top 5 overall issues, but it also would have allowed us to be sure we centered on what we are the most passionate about.<br />
<br />
I'm not good at putting my ideas into words, but hopefully that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Negativism and cynism are a direct consequence of Verant/sony's inability to balance the introduction of slow immunity and mitigation with something constructive for shaman.<br />
Only think they thought of was creating an hybrid class with a true raid role and a slow better than ours in exp groups. We had... a no-upgrade to torpor and 100 more Hp on our only useful buff.<br />
<br />
The problem with you Jinheim, is that you are satisfied with MBGing focus and having no influx on the outcome of any given raid, and being main healer in normal LDON.<br />
<br />
I'm not, and many aren't either. <br />
<br />
As it is, the &quot;once voice&quot; project didn't give us any of the things we NEED to survive as a truely useful class: dps, heals, or a totally new ability.<br />
<br />
Maybe we didn't go at the right place, maybe they are afraid of making us too good compared to druids who had such a hard time before.<br />
<br />
Or maybe everquest is so soon dead that having legitimate concerns about such pointless things as shaman raid-role and exp-role and seeing them ignored or mocked makes us cynical and bitter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">compared to druids who had such a hard time before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, I just had water coming out my nose.<br />
<br />
You should really put warnings up to put down anything you are drinking before you make jokes like that.</div></div><hr />
