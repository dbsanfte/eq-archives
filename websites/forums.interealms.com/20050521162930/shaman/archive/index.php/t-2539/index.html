<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to understand how horses work with luclin/nonluclin models for your race.  I have the top of the line horse and love the old troll models.   Trying to understand what I gain/lose from using luclin/nonluclin models.<br />
<br />
Tell me if I am understanding things correctly:<br />
<br />
With luclin models:  I have the all the advantages of horse back including hard to cast on in pvp, always meditating, faster top speed, but I would suffer from being ugly (new troll stinks) and having problems with starting and slowing down.<br />
<br />
Without luclin models:  I gain all the above advantages except faster top speed?<br />
<br />
Does the harder to cast on thing still apply when using old models?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">without luclin model, you still have invisible horse block part of your screen, but you won't get speed advantage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's right, you won't get the benefit of faster speed with the top of the line horse. Also, you aren't always meditating - only when you are not moving and not attacking with auto-attack.</div></div><hr />
