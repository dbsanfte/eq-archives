<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Remus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to figure out what are some good prices to keep an eye out for these spells.<br />
<br />
I often seen ppl trying to sell one of those stat buffs for 30k lol I mean I know it's from a spectral but come on!<br />
<br />
Imbue Disease - Make this yourself &lt;- Ingred. drops in PoD<br />
<br />
Blessing of Replenishment - Group version... how often do you use this? I seldom if ever used the old group regrowth spell.<br />
How much would be a good price to buy?<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Boar - Group Stam, only group stat buff I like.<br />
Only Stat Buff in the 63/64 range thats worth anything IMO.<br />
<br />
Strength of the Diaku - Single Target STR buff... why bother have Focus already.  Only Clerics/Magi types may want since it kills their self only spells... but who really cares?  &lt;-Seen this at Bazaar on Karana for 30k.  Who ever was trying to sell it was smoking something, or needs to be smacked upside the head.<br />
<br />
Malosinia - resist debuff with magic resist check, need to pick up but at what price?<br />
<br />
Malicious Decay - disease debuff, hmmm limited use.  Sure some mobs can be slowed with diseased slows... but with the new coding and slow mitigation... have they flagged any PoP mobs with disease slow only?<br />
<br />
Tears of Saryrn - Rain DD, decent spell<br />
<br />
Imbue War - No idea where drop for this comes from<br />
<br />
Breath of Ultor - Disease DoT<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Gindan - Group Dex... does NOT stack with Focus.  Why bother with it... again only ppl who dont want Focus would want this.<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Diaku - Group STR... Does NOT stack with Focus.  See above.<br />
<br />
Aim of the Gindan - Single Target DEX buff... Does NOT stack with Focus.  See above.<br />
<br />
Velium Strike - DD<br />
<br />
DDs, DoT, 1 Stat buff, 1 debuff are good.  Disease debuff questionable same for group replenish.  But what are some prices you think are reasonable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">assuming that there is no way you can get them other than buying....you going to have to pay whatever the server market demands...<br />
<br />
if you are in a guild or can get flagged...dont buy any...specs drop from non named BoT mobs and non named HoH mobs...just not that often<br />
<br />
now saying that...your sta buff is only a timesaver/mana saver...you dont HAVE to have it cause u got sing Target boar<br />
<br />
Vel Strike-pretty nice DD upgrade worth it imo<br />
Malicious Decay-not too necessary although very nice<br />
Malosinia-Very Nice<br />
Disease DoT-also very nice upgrade<br />
Grp Replenish-Time/mana saver only....still get reg Replenish<br />
<br />
so basically..look at your bank account..decide what you can afford and go for it<br />
<br />
if the price is worth it for you..thats all that matters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, group replenishment would be a lovely thing to have.  I cast group regrowth all the time in raids, and clerics in particular ask for it.  On the down side, replenishment has what appears to be an extremely short duration.  I won't cast this one as a single unless I'm soloing.<br />
<br />
Group boar is also a great thing to have.  If you have 5 mins to get your raid buffed and your puller thinks, as in my guild, that 5 minutes = 45 sec, you will want this spell.<br />
<br />
Group and single dex and str buffs are a waste of time.  Verant was looking for padding for our spell list, and that's what they came up with.<br />
<br />
The offensive spells are all good.  I hear from people who have it that Tears of Saryn generates a fair amount of aggro.<br />
<br />
High end debuffs are must haves.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are hunting in places where spectrals drop, keep rolling on them.  Otherwise, keep checking the bazaar.  People sometimes sell the spells for insanely cheap because they don't know what the spells are (particularly talisman spells, because they sound like the lower level versions.. Talisman of the Cat, for example).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamans get 3 Imbue Spells and they are not turn-in spells.  You actually make these by making the following combines in a planar jeweller's kit (from PoK):<br />
<br />
Imbue Justice:  Alkaline Etched Stone, Raw Diamond, Spell: Imbue Diamond (from FP pally guild)<br />
<br />
Imbue Disease:  Bubonian Blood, Raw Diamond, Spell: Imbue Diamond<br />
<br />
Imbue Disease:  War Wraith Blood, Raw Diamond, Spell: Imbue Diamond<br />
<br />
These are tradeskill related spells.  Check EQTrader's corner under PoP Pottery if you're interested in what you can help make.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just in case you didn't know, you can use ethereal parchments to get 64 Petrifying Earth if you do the handin to the necro parchment guy instead of the shaman.  You can also hand in an ethereal parchment to the BL parchment guy to get the very handy level 49 spell Infusion of Spirit which stacks with the cleric spell Blessed Armor of the Arisen (focus line does not).<br />

Merro Xmas<br />
Prophet<br />
The Shadow Order<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Silvergun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sure, it'd be nice to have all the better spells ASAP, but I believe time is on our sides.  It opens up more opportunities to get drops, and as the market dilutes, the prices will come down.  There is no fair market value for these spells right now; sellers are just playing on the hype.  Wait it out unless you can pick up a really good deal here and there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well I just standardize mine. <br />
<br />
61/62 Spells 1000 Max<br />
63/64 Spells 3000 Max<br />
<br />
I also check &quot;Market Prices&quot; for my spells and bring the price DOWN to match.<br />
<br />
It is redicules that someone would charge 10K + for a frigging spell from a turn in. Come on people!<br />
<br />
I mean I might do this with a wiz spell (joke) but not to my fellow shaman!</div></div><hr />
