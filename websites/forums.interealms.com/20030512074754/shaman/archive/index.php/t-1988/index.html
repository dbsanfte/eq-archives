<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm thinking of starting my epic pretty soon, as I understand you can do a lot without needing to be 50plus. Besides, that shield of falsehood would be really helpful for me, as I started this guy on Firiona Vie and therefore had to start from scratch. So three questions: <br />
<br />
First off, I saw like four or five different guys to kill and get the first gem. What is the lowest level &quot;starter&quot; for our epic? I would assume the Iksar Marauder, as I remember killing them when I was 16 or so on my cleric.<br />
<br />
Secondly, how would a troll get around being KOS in Freeport, for that part of the quest? I understand I have to go into the market part of North Freeport, to the Jade Inn, and am not sure how that's gonna work out.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, if I tried Test of Patience by myself, and used invisibility to animals so sharks don't eat me, would I be able to get the Shield without any fighting?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually its not an iksar marauder, its an iksar manslayer.  I wouldl say the manslayers are around 20 or so and youre guaranteed to get one or two adds when trying to pull him so be careful.<br />
<br />
As far as the other stuff goes I cant really help you.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In Rathe Mts, you can fight Blinde the Cutpurse.  He, too, is around 20th level, and is associated with some bandits.<br />
<br />
He's on top of the hill just east of the zone in from Lake Rathetear, right smack dab in the middle of the Valley of the Cyclopes.  An easy kill (tho he does backstab) if hard to pull on his own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In freeport - use invisibility and have gate ready just in case.<br />
<br />
And yes you can use ITA for the test of patience, that's how I did it although I was about level 35 I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the info, brothers : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also, it's possible to get good faction in N FP reasonably easily, and you can then walk around most of the zone unscathed (but beware of the bards).<br />
<br />
The easiest way, if you can do it, is to find a paladin who's killing Lucan for the soulfire quest. A single tap to lucan (assuming he dies) will get you a massive positive faction hit in NFP.<br />
<br />
If you are of sufficient level, it's great fun to take a few friends and hunt the guards in east Freeport (I think it's east - the zone with the docks). As these are corrupt militia guards, you get positive faction with the paladins who control north freeport. On the role playing server, I imagine this could provide excellent RP opportunities - evil trolls invading freeport etc :) Just watch out for the occasional jerk player who will train every guard in the zone onto you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Whats this about Iksar Marauders? I aint touched em and im up to Lord Rak tear hand-in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Don't worry, there are many ways to start the quest, the Iksar Marauder is just one way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>baelish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Could someone post a summarized list of where these all spawn, or provide a link to a decent walkthrough?<br />
<br />
I have not found a walkthrough yet which lists all the possible ways to start the Epic, or recommends which way to start for each race.<br />
<br />
If you could post like this would be great!<br />

Rathe Mountains: A Cutpurse: Near the Hill Giants: Level 20ish<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most of us used Belgar's trusty epic guide.  <br />
<br />
http://eqshaman.com/epic/<br />
<br />
There are several methods for beginning the quest, among which have been reported are: Ocean of Tears, loc +800, -5400, Capt Surestout Rathe Mountains, (on cyclops hill), Blinde the Cutpurse; Butcherblock Mountains, +260, +1650, Peg Leg; Field of Bones, (marauder cave), Iksar Outcast/Manslayer</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>baelish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grumgor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh, by the way... I noticed that every &quot;starter&quot; has the same spirit say the same text. Has anyone ever answered wrongly? Instead of saying &quot;He threatened my life&quot;, answered with one of the other phrases, &quot;I disliked him&quot; or &quot;I profit from his death&quot;? I really wanna know what the Spirit says, but am too afraid it will screw up the quest and I won't be able to get my epic :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>TnT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Iksar Manslayers can be found behind Kurn's tower in Field of Bone.  Uncommon spawn there, but the Lesser Spirit pops everytime I think, because I'll see it standing around every once in a while.  Going to the marauder cave there are more manslayers, but harder to pull just one.  I started the quest at lvl 16 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Grum, you can answer incorrectly and not screw up your epic.  As a noob, I didn't know what to say to them.  I don't think the text had a prompt for &quot;Who are you?&quot;, which is a trigger for the quest stuff.  That may have been changed, I don't know.  Previously, if you just follow his prompts, you would never actually get the quest unless you knew to ask &quot;who are you?&quot;  :)<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I tried saying the wrong thing to the spirit for a laugh - he just tells you to get lost :)<br />
<br />
If you then say the right thing to him (maybe you have to respawn hum - can't remember) you can carry on with the quest as normal, it doesn't hinder you in any way.</div></div><hr />
