<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey,<br />
<br />
<br />
Since yesterday, I've been horrible packetloss (Thats what its called???). What happens is, every 30 ish seconds, my little bar in the corner starts lagging out like I&quot;m going to go LD, then by about 40 or 50% it suddenly comes back.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't gone LD yet, but it is very annoying and is causing me nto to be able to play. I haven't known anyone else with this problem so it must be my computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Can anyone possibly help me fix this? I have DSL, and datarate set to 9. But I just changed it to 5 and I still have this problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) Have you called your Cable / DSL company to see if they're doing any upgrades / maintenance?<br />
<br />
2) Do you live on the East Coast of the United States, more specifically North Carolina, where there has been some REALLY crappy weather the past 48 hours?<br />
<br />
3) Have you or anyone else kicked or otherwise disturbed any of the equipment?<br />
<br />
4) Does this problem manifest itself when on any other application other than EQ?<br />
<br />
5) Do these problems manifest themselves throughout Norrath or in one or two zones in particular?<br />

<br />
1) I 'Hail' myself when I have link issues. (And I do). This seems to send a message to the computer that &quot;Hey - I'm STILL HERE.&quot;<br />
<br />
2) Ducking USED to work, but not so much anymore.<br />
<br />
3) 'Serverfilter' USED to help (or so it seems) but not so much anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Had EXACT same problem I am using rogers @home cable<br />
<br />
Everquest only<br />
all servers<br />
all zones<br />
pretty much unplayable this is how i fixed it<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
FIrst i went to equ and i set the rate to max (9)<br />
<br />
saved <br />
<br />
<br />
then<br />
<br />
<br />
I went to dslreports.com and i downloaded the registry patch to ajust my rwin settings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then i used the tool i already had installed tweak-me gold.<br />
<br />
Go to internet tweaks select cable<br />
choose isp if listed and conection type and save<br />
<br />
no need to register the program lets u run it 50 times but u nly need it once<br />
<br />
for tweak-me go to <br />
http://www.totalidea.de/frameset-products.htm<br />
Solved my problems immediately.<br />
<br />
Dunno if u need to do the dslreports tweak but i did it<br />
<br />
<br />
Had exact same problems as you somethign if definetly wrong since the last mimipatch but now i am ok.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />
oh equ can be downloaded at http://www.speakeasy.org/~ruess/<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
make sure u hit save in tweak me and restart system so changes take effect btw<br />
