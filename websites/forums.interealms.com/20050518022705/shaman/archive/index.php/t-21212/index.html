<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think someone Ninja'ed my earring off RZTW on the weekend, read on and let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
We felled RZTW (first for my guild ... yay)<br />
Raid Leader 'linked all' loot in raid channel<br />
Distribution of loot started, I won the crossed sword earring.<br />
I head over to the corpse and the item is nowhere to be seen ... hmmmm<br />
At this point people start trolling through logs, no one in raid looted it, damn it appears we were sloppy and someone watching ninjaed us.<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
Several of us petition, I head to bed thinking I'll never see that item again.<br />
Following afternoon I log on to check my petition and some guildies inform me they spoke to the GM and the item is in my inventory (and it is) they proceed to tell me what the GM says happened.<br />
<br />
Read on...<br />
<br />
Apparently immediately after I was declared winner raid_member_x left the raid<br />
GM logs then demonstrate raid_member_x looting the item off RZTW's corpse<br />
<br />
raid_member_x was challenged about this by my guild mates and denies even going near the corpse.<br />
<br />
Right now you are thinking &quot;its obvious, raid_member_x is a cheat&quot;<br />
<br />
Thats my problem, this guy (although not guild) has been raiding with us for ages, he has never been anything but dependable, never even uttered a cross word or complained to my knowledge and is a best RL friend of a resepcted guildie who also vouches for him.<br />
<br />
We (guild officers and I) find it hard to believe he did this but the GM logs cant be wrong...can they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could MAYBE reason that somehow the server ****ed up and ate the earring, and GM was just cleaning up a server ****-up.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, do the logs taken by your guildies show this person leaving the raid early? <br />
<br />
Never know, maybe a ****wit friend of the RL person was playing him that night.</div></div><hr />

That was my first reaction -- was someone else running the character last night?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would suggest that open raiding is very &quot;Iffy&quot; In my opinion . Find a good guild . Raid with your guild . It sounds from your post like this was an &quot;open&quot; raid situation ... I would personly advise finding a guild that can raid the content you want too raid and sticking with them .<br />
<br />
Thats my opinion ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That was my first reaction -- was someone else running the character last night?<br />
<br />
Apparently not, as he was questioned about it the next day and confirmed he (personally) was there at the raid. <br />
<br />
Oh and this is my guild raid, ...my guild only numbers approx 40 people so we have to call in others for POP gods.<br />
<br />
I only raid with the guild, I agree open raids can be hairy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sad but true - faced with loot which they're not likely to be able to get hold of personally, occasionally a person may take leave of their senses and think that no-one will notice.... It wouldn't be the first time and it won't be the last.<br />
<br />
There is no reason why GMs would lie about it. If it was a server burp, they'd cough up the earring, there would be no reason to pin the blame on someone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">my alliance had a peregin bracer ninja looted over 3 months ago, and the GMs still haven't done a thing about it.  the ranger who was due the bracer is also a fellow officer in my guild.  it was ninja looted by someone not in our alliance...my guild ranger has talked to over 10 guides and we have emails in to soe ect.  nothing has been done and we have pritty much given up.  at this point it wouldn't even be about getting the loot back, but about punishing the jack ass that ninjaed the bracer.<br />
<br />
NINJA LOOTING is apparantly LEGAL.<br />
<br />
we also had a miss loot situation not more than a week ago.  my alt was due a shield from RD and one of our allince alts looted it on accident.  it was a true missunderstanding and both parties want it fixed.  this petitoin has been in for a few days. i finally got a GM that said he would look into it, yet nothing has been done.  i spoke to a guide yesterday and he said he couldn't do anything and i would have to wait for a gm (again).  <br />
galelor asks guide_01, &quot;when will a gm be on so (alliance member) and i can make plans to be on at the same time so we can resolve this issue?&quot;<br />
guide_01 tells you, 'i have no clue.'<br />
needless to say, i am less than happy with the lack of in game customer support...<br />
<br />
grats on actually getting your item back, it is a truely amazing =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sounds pretty clear to me...guy Ninja looted.  Up to you now how you're going to respond to it.  Hard to believe the GM would make up logs about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Back in the days we had someone ninja loot Vindi..  The item got returned after petition but the GM never told who did the ninja looting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It would seem that in all wisdom a guild would have the person designated as looter stay in the loot screen until the appropriate person showed up to loot each item.<br />
<br />
Sure, its a pain, but it would prevent things like this from happening.<br />
<br />
/em throws in his 2 cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you think he ninjaed the item, one thing you can do is inspect him every now and then to see if he is wearing it. If you don't want annoy him too much, you can do that in situations where inspecting can occur accidentally (looting corpses in tight areas, next to bankers etc). Or to avoid possible disputes you can just use a low level alt(s). Since many new players like to look at the gear on level 65 chars out of curiosity that sort of thing often gets ignored.<br />
<br />
This should lead to one of the three possible results:<br />
<br />
1) Guilty: You catch him wearing it. He deserves whatever the guild decides to do with him.<br />
<br />
2a) Innocent: Not wearing it, since he did not take it.<br />
<br />
2b) Guilty: Not wearing it, because he doesn't want to get caught. Won't get you the item back, but at least he is not benefiting from stealing it.<br />
<br />
Maybe this option is a bit paranoid, but might help in figuring out what happened (or just make him keep the item bagged if he did take it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Inspecting him isn't gonna do jack squat because the gm has already transfered the item and said he was the one who took it. So he no longer has the item to wear. I can't think of any reason why a gm would make up something like this or blaim him for something he didn't do. They gave you back the earring so I'd take the gm at his word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Who leaves a raid before loot's done, while still in the raid zone? I'd be highly suspicious of that guy even before GM verification.<br />
<br />
Ryam has a good idea, except it sounds like the GM probably removed the item from raid_member_x.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dan_N</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">GM's are not wrong.  We had the same thing happen on one of our RZ raids.  The GM's eventually logged on the guy's toon and gave it back to rightful winner(took a few weeks though).<br />
<br />
Always always, lock down corpse.  I do this religiously now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The GMs are not wrong. Whatever that guy was thinking he got cought. I don't think he should be raiding with you guys anymore. Thats just rude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Always locking down the corpse during the RZ event can be tricky.  Most raids don't have this problem but with many adds running around and often ending up at the corpse, it is harder than normal to do this.  We often throw a monk on the corpse until the desgnated looters can get to it or just have them link it for us.<br />
<br />
As to your story, I doubt the GMs would have lied to you.  They had no reason to.  They could have easily not told you who looted it and given it back to you or if it was a server hickup, told you that.  It can happen and I see no reason for them to make it up.  Assuming the guy was a class that could benefit from the drop and that he did drop from the raid before it was looted, I see no reason to doubt that he took it.  If it were just a mistake, he would have been smart to own up to it.  I wouldn't be too trusting of this guy in the future if you decide to allow him to more of your raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I see no reason for a GM to point the blame to an innocent player.  Stuff like that could get them in big trouble.  If it really was a server hicup, they wouldve just told you or not give you a reason at all.  What would the GM gain from misinforming you about 1 piece of loot?<br />
<br />
The player disbanding right after the mob dies on flag hit is very suspicious especially since this is your first take down of RZTW and I assume he also needed the flag just like everyone else.  He prolly saw an opportunity in all the chaos and thought he would not get caught.  Remember this is RZtW, right after he dies, there will be total chaos;  Adds will be everywhere, people will be racing toward the flag mob to hail, people running to the corner to zone out, while others are still kiting / dying.  Why would he hail and immediately disband, or did he not hail and just disbanded?</div></div><hr />

Per Occam's razor, the simplest answer is usually the correct one.<br />

This was premeditated ninja looting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Minor side track. I assume KtM is Krziik the Mighty since thats the only thing that makes sense. Problem is Mighty only drops bracers so they couldn't have ninjaed boots off him. Offosa on the other hand drops boots. I guess you got the mob or the peice looted wrong.<br />
<br />
BTW ninja looting an item has gotta be right up there with ragz for stupid things to do while applying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hey Barb, I heard about the ninga'ing of RZ a couple of days ago.   To see if I can help clear some stuff up- here is what I know.  If you are referring to a certain shammy being the ninja-lewter; I know of the guy.  Some backgroup on him: <br />
<br />
- The guy is in his mid-40's, a warrant officer in the US Army.  <br />
<br />
- He has been playing probably longer than I have, has a kid and from what I hear was a strong driving force in making the guild Illuminatis what it is today.<br />
<br />
- He is a far cry from a lewt-whore, you can check out his magelo on eqrankings.com.<br />
<br />
- He has a rep to uphold and old enough to understand that ninja'ing isn't going to help that.<br />
<br />
     When I heard about it I was stunned,  it doesn't sound like anything this guy would ever do.  The only explanation I could think of is &quot;the kid&quot;.  His son plays EQ but is pretty young, it may be possible that his son had him logged on for the raid- ninja'ed, and now he is covering for it.  Lousy circumstances either way, I am pretty sure his rep is burned in the end whether he ninja'ed or not.   Coming from what I know of the guy, it just doesn't sound like something he would do.

Hey Pred,<br />
<br />
Exactlly why I asked this question here, Ive known the shammy concerned for a ong time aswell, I know he it well equipped, I have a lot of respect for the guy. The whole thing is bizarre.<br />
<br />
Big problem is, when asked about it, he confirmed he was the one behind the keyboard.<br />
<br />
Oh and Pred, obviously keep his name well, well off this board, I know I dont need to tell you but it had to be said.</div></div><hr />

Your probably right and it was OtE.  But technically KtM (along with Reparm, Amy, PoEb war chiefs, and mist) also drops chain helms.  Out of 455 elemental drops (82 chain) we have gotten 2 chain helms.  We have gotten more helms off Terris Thule in time then chain helms. /rant off</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure KtM can't drop chain helms. The elemental drop tables seem to be inconsistant. Everything I've seen says that water, air and PoEa are pretty straight forward. They drop one slot of any type and thats it. IE KtM drops bracers and can drop silk leather chain or plate. The vine ring in PoEa drops the same, bracers of any kind. The first avatar in air is always bracers too. The second avatar in air is Gloves. Third air avatar is helms. Not all the mobs but you get the idea.<br />
<br />
Fire and PoEb seem to be more complicated. They drop mixes and will drop boots for 2 types and helms for 2 others or other things like that. I dont remember what any of them are off hand but for example a mob might drop leather and silk boots but chain and plate bracers. The mob won't ever drop leather or silk bracer or chain or plate boots tho.<br />

If he has made absolutely no effort to log back on and contact you he is a ninja looter.

Next time your guild has a non-guild player that wins an item in a raid make sure he is the last person to loot.</div></div><hr />

     No worries, that's why I didn't list the name before.  Still, all said and done, I kinda am a bit iffy on what the GM said.  I know they have logs to check issues like this, but still it seems a bit fishy to me.</div></div><hr />
