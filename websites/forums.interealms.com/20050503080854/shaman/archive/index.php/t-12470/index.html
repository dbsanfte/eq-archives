<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There was no reason to close that thread.  Put it in the grey and open it up.  they were having a good conversation that wasn't dogging each other too bad.  Besides I have some points to state ;p<br />
<br />
I am sure lots of people find the topic on how words are used in meaning and slang, very interesting.<br />
<br />
FWIW, if you are going to post something not really dealing with the game mechanics, and more about social aspects..post in the right forum so we don't see the mods freakin out! (ya ya i shouild take my own advice sometimes!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">soon as you mention a word somone &quot;different&quot; finds offensive, you are victim of the PC folks. Nothing wrong with an honest debate about any topic.<br />
<br />
Love the double standard by the way. General forum of course not place for that stuff. I spend all my time in the grey, is fun.<br />
<br />
mill the anti-PC</div></div><hr />

LOL i bet i just got this thread locked!<br />
<br />
Btw, OMG AvalacheW!  Best sig EVER!!!</div></div><hr />

It is, of course, the mods' right to do absolutely whatever they please.. however I personally feel that the moderation is beyond a little out of hand here. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This thread is Gay and should be moved to the Grey!<br />
<br />
I dont feel the board moderation is out of hand, maybe the poster should be banned.<br />
<br />
This is a game forum, not club, for fags or anti-fags to rub their nubs.<br />
<br />
Queer, Homo, Fag or lame;<br />
neither have a place in this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">nice little jingle braxton.<br />
<br />
<br />
schpleef, what do you want, this place to turn into another everlore, or any server message board out there?  looking at the quality of the posts, and what has been said lately, can you blame me?  let's use the FoH boards as an example - lots of good info, but buried beneath a mountain of namecalling and personal attacks and other useless antagonizing drivel.  I WON'T allow that crap here as long as I am a mod.  There is a solution to this - petition to have Sunmoon remove me as a mod.  Otherwise, I am going to come down on threads that have have degenerated into flamewars.  And with the atmosphere around here lately, I'm not going to be shy about it either.  Look inward if you think I'm a jerk.  I wouldn't have to do anything if the few who like to stir things up would grow up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Mojokyn its just a personal opinion - its well within your rights as a mod to do whatever you deem best.  Its just an IMHO thing, but I'm still posting here, so it can't be all bad can it? :)  One thing that I do find upsetting however, is that Sunmoon's post taunting petey (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=12469) is left in the general forums while a humorous thread I posted was moved to the grey faster than lightning.  I don't like double standards.  I will agree that flame wars don't belong in general, but IMHO the gay thread wasn't a flame war.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">sorry, i re-read my last post and that did sound peeved, and admittedly at the wrong person.  my bad Schpleef :).  <br />
<br />
well, Sunmoon is the head honcho around here...I would recommend emailing your concerns to him, he is a very fair and receptive person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just what drivel, namecalling, and personal attacks are you referring to, Mojo? Some of it is obvious, but some not so obvious. However, to the point that started this thread, why was the discussion on the use of gay and other words locked? Did you lock it? You were the one that started that thread. One would think that a moderator-originated thread would be EXACTLY what is wanted on this message board.<br />
<br />
Do what you want. Sunmoon can do whatever he wants. But if the perception and reputation of this board degenerates into &quot;mods and their friends only&quot; then you won't have to worry about unwanted threads and opinions because no one will be posting here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Um, just pointing a little something out, Mojokyn didn't start that threat, Balthos did, IIRC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
seems you noticed it too i guess.  and no, i did not start the thread.  <br />
<br />
i dont care if people i dont particularily care for post.  i only care when they start impacting others in negative ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/agree Mojo</div></div><hr />

Go to the Safehouse and ask about twinking a rogue then get back to us... :D</div></div><hr />

LOL, Love that sig!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What we need is a good old-fashioned flame board, like the wizzies necros and sks have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i will move this to the grey sometime in the near future (unless someone else does it first), but as i have said before:<br />
<br />
1) i'll leave things in the general forum for a couple days so people can see them and become aware of the thread<br />
<br />
2) there are no attacks in here.  this is discussion, not ranting.  that's fine, whoever posts it.  no locky locky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Mojo - You're right. You didn't start that thread. I had you confused with Mozeley (sp?). My sincere apologies. I'll go back to lurking, now.<br />
