<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>scooch74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else have problems with Magelo besides me? Whether I use IE 6.0 or Netscape 4.7, it never loads up properly for me and I can't see anything. Anyone have some ideas on how to correct this? I hear comments about all these great profiles that I'd love to check out, but can't.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">can you be more specific?  what exactly is the problem you are having?  error messages?  blank screen?  some elements not working?</div></div><hr />

Make sure it is enabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>scooch74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, I guess a little more detail might have been helpful on my part. What usually happens is part of the page loads. I can see the stat names listed and the various resist names listed, along with the headings of HP/AC/ATK but nothing else. That's through Netscape. When I use IE it's much the same, though I get a little more info to load like the headings for pat/gold/silver/copper. Sometimes in IE I get a second window that pops up and says something like &quot;Magelo security error has been thrown.&quot; I tried your idea Snapdragn for IE, but that didn't seem to help. Anyone have other ideas? Draznar, what security settings would be blocking it? Does Magelo use some type of programming that the security software doesn't like? I would prefer to view it through Netscape, but I'll settle for IE if push comes to shove.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i cant seem to bind items to my inventory...anyone have a fix for that one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What browser are you using mojokyn? Last i checked it wasn't functional with mozilla so you needed to be using a version of ie.<br />
<br />
scooch netscape 4.7 doesn't work with magelo. It doesn't support a feature he needs. Try downloading mozilla release canidate from www.mozilla.org</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>scooch74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Taraddar, I'm a little confused. I understand it won't work with Netscape 4.7, but you recommended Mozilla, then told Mojokyn Magelo didn't support Mozilla, or did I misunderstand? Is there a version of Netscape that DOES support Magelo, or do I just need to figure out a way to get IE in tune with Magelo? And if so, anyone got any ideas of why IE 6.0 doesn't work with Magelo?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">scooch to clarify a bit. Mozilla works with magelo correctly except that one specific feature mojokyn mentioned (binding items to inventory). Everything else viewing profiles, creating characters, the msg etc will work in the more rescent versions of magelo. No clue why ie doesn't work tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>scooch74</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, I'm getting a little smarter with this now. :rolleyes: I disabled my antivirus software and Magelo seems to work through IE now. Why does Magelo not work through virus software? Is there a way to configure the virus software to allow you to use Magelo without disabling the entire program? I use a cable modem and use Norton Internet Security to monitor my connection at all times so nothing sneaks through. Any ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Most problems with Magelo come from Firewalls. If you look thru their forums you might find all the information you need to tweak your firewall program, allowing/bypassing some features for a specific IP (e.g. Magelo server).</div></div><hr />
