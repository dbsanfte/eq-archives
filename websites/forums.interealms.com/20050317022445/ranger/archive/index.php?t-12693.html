unless you saw it in a trade window, I dont Believe its real.<br />
Dont trust links if thats how you saw it. There are programs avalable to make your own links of items, you dont get the item itself, its just a clever way to fool people. I have seen links of +10000hp/mana items, 200 ac rings, and right click manaburn items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iweil</div><div class="date">10-26-2002, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw this link too....said it was an artifact and the link actually worked...everyone I've asked in game says that they beleive this is a real bow...for 2 reasons...one its an artifact meaning there will never be another one on the server and two it has no other stats.  Persoanlly I would like to actually find out who won the bow before buying into it.  BTW I saw the link in Umberal Planes on Povar in ooc.</div></div><hr />

There were a ton of CRAZY items being passed around in links. Probably because of two things, A) GMs showing off to their friends, and B) You can call up any item in the DB if you know it's number, ot at least you could. Everything is linked to a specific number, so it wasn't hard to do.</div></div><hr />
