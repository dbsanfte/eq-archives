<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chouka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where can a Shaman that is guildless, not twinked too hard, hunt in his low 40s when hes solo? Travel is not a problem, However I would like to keep my Drwarf and Dragon faction in Velious. Pref somewhere with a good mix of exp/loot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blackke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try the Shroom castle in Dawnshroud Peaks....Very nice xp an there are several previous posts that tell exactly how to pull them.  The Zelniaks are good xp too and are not social at all  =)<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I found 40-45 to be quite easy in DSP on Zelniaks, Large Zelniaks and wolves.  Easy, Zels are non social so very few adds.  Only real danger is getting multiple wolves on ya at one time, and that is very managable with Enstill.  Very big annoyance with Lightcrawlers who aggro even if green and can occasionally blind ya.<br />
<br />
So in short, DSP provides great exp, just about 0 loot on Zels and Wolves, is close to NExus/Bazzar for KEI/supplies so it is a great spot to head when you just feel like hunting alone.<br />
<br />
With KEI I pulled non stop with Slow, sic'd pet, occasionally Dot'd and meleed with BSH, dropped everything there very quickly.  Could do at least a yellow an hour and sometimes quite a bit more if there weren't alot of hunters around.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sharrah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Got through that lvl pulling mobs to the tunnel (mob side) in Dreadlands. <br />
Pet was parked up on wall a little.<br />
Was not a bad spot.. cause higher lvl's passing through, abit rarely,would throw me a buff. Many times I had KEI, POTC/G and even a full buffing by a 60 SHM as I sat and med.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>chouka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the information,<br />
<br />
Thats pretty much what I had heard from all the previous post I looked at... I was hoping there might be somewhere where both loot and exp would be found but I guess at this range its exp all the way.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;but I guess at this range its exp all the way. &quot;<br />
<br />
that's not exactly how I would put it, but the loot is definitely (still) crap during these levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">solo at the dl pyramid, while u search for a goblin grp ?<br />
