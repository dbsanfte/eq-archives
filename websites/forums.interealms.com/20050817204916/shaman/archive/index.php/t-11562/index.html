<br />
The only thing I lost are signatures I believe :( There was a problem in the upgrade and I couldn't import them. I'm &quot;trying&quot; to get them back in.. will have to see.<br />
<br />
I know it's not pretty, I'll try and fix it up this evening and tomorrow to get back kind of where you were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't worry about it.<br />
It's working YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Woohoo!  the twitching might stop now!</div></div><hr />

<br />
the smiley pictures seem to be broken on the new post page too, but a welcome return :)<br />
<br />
wtg Sunmoon! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Woohoo!  The Crucible returns!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, there are quite a few images broken and I need to get some old images in, but at least it's up now :) <br />
<br />
I DEEPLY apologize for the downtime.. you woudn't believe how frustrating it was for me to get this thing going again :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What actually happened, anyways?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yay!  Yay! Yay!<br />
<br />
I really don't care why this was borken, just that it is fixed.  I was lost, I mean really lost without this board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I moved the server, I took a copy of the SQL database. When I loaded the SQL database here, it would no longer let me log on (or any of you) I couldn't even go in to the admin control panel to look and see what was the matter. The passwords are encrypted, so I couldn't go in and just  see why it wasn't letting me in and the old server was already wiped, so I had no fallback.<br />
<br />
So, I chose to try and upgrade to vB3 like the Rangers had and try to get it to work. The upgrade didn't work, because they were already a week into testing and I had revised code from the original beta files, so it was failing the upgrade.<br />
<br />
I had to manually go through a lot of the upgrade script and figure out the differences between the two and then change the tables and stuff by hand. This was a very long process and I'll slit my wrists if I have to do it again.<br />
<br />
As of now though, it looks like we're up, so keep those fingers crossed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ballastar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sunmoon,<br />
<br />
Don't sweat it too much, wasn't your fault.  I'm just glad I'll be able to get my daily dose of crucible lurking!  :D <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the hard work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That sounds nasty, Sun.<br />
<br />
Working in the same business myself I can understand the problems you must have gone through.<br />
<br />
Good job though mate, hope you don't have to go through manually changing the script again, that would suck.<br />
<br />
I was going Cold turkey from the waiting:)</div></div><hr />

sunmoon i know what you went thru.  pain, pain, pain.<br />
<br />
but you pulled thru, and i know that was a giant relief for 'ya.  :)<br />
<br />

<br />
Although I never really noticed it, the answer to almost any question about EQ has been answered somewhere on these forums.  I never knew how much I depended on the board untill I didnt have it.  I had to go to Castersrealm, which is a good site, but forums are not very interesting and lots of data is out of date (but Baelish is working hard to fix that little problem)<br />
<br />
Anyway...good to be home again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">My only gripe is the separation between posts (a line of the &quot;background color&quot;) which wasn't there before... I guess cosmetic changes really don't matter when we have our board back, but it's still a little weird  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Sunmoon, could you delete my two old accounts for me? One was 'Rathelon' and one 'Rathelon Steelbear'. Those were registered to my anti-spam hotmail address and now I cant log in with them because I havent checked that address in months and it's been deactivated. <br />
<br />
Or if you can just changed the email address on the 'Rathelon' one to the email address I used on this sign-in, that'd be helpful too..then I could keep my old profile. Thanks.<br />
