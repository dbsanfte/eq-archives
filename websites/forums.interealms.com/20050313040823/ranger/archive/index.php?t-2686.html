This is a discussion board, so why don't you try talking about something once in awhile instead of beating a fellow ranger down when he makes a suggestion.<br />
<br />
The top two posters was just stating something that he felt was missing or wrong.  But those below are not doing a damn thing to contribute to it. <br />
<br />
It's like everyone is becoming a bunch of trolls looking to see who can smack down others first. This is not helping our community and needs to stop.<br />

Deeger, I agree would be nice to get upgrade to AE too. Wouldn't mind being able to do a little bit of quad kiting myself.</div></div><hr />
