<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ngok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 65 shaman, have all the spells up to his age etc.  I also bot a 57 sk that has 3695 hps and 1338 ac unbuffed, where is the best place to bot these to and get sk to 65 the quickest?<br />
<br />
The shaman used to be my main, but i have now switched to an sk, got tired of tring to find a group all the time, the wait is rediculous.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Might want to take a look at Grieg's End.  I duoed my Monk and Shaman there and got great xp at that level.  Loot isn't too bad and save the occasional raid on Grieg, the zone is empty.  Once the spawns where broke (using FD) I was able to clear the entire first section in time to get back to zone and start over (DSP zone in that is).  Could kill non-stop.  Another good thing about duoing there is the fact that it is an outdoor zone.  Thus you can keep Shaman on leezard while you are chopping stuff up.  I don't know about being the best but I really liked it.  Mobs hit like wussies once slowed too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reggorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I duoed my warrior(55-58) and shaman(61, 100% AA) here. As I recall, the mobs do not run when low on health and the AA experience was pretty good(thinking about 1/2 a blue per kill). If there ever was an underutilized zone, this is one of them. I think I'll go romp through here with my 55 sk and see how things go... Good call, Haneb!</div></div><hr />
