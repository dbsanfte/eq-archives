<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm just wondering what stuff i should be aiming for equipment wise, atm i am using a slime coated harpoon which i think will last some time but the rest is pretty poor (a CGS too). The rest is mainly banded and bronze brigiandne(sp?) from PC. I'm not a twink so i don't have loads of cash but i can save some, i'm level 28 btw(probs 29 and getting spells when u read this):D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hola a fellow shaman on my server.<br />
<br />
I am twinked but some of the eqiupment i have bought or camped for.<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=148754) <br />
<br />
Giant Scale mail arms (AC11, WIS +3, INT -2, HP +20) : 185pp<br />
<br />
Coterie General Boots (AC10, STR +5, AGI +4, HP +10, SvF -2, SvD +2, SvP +2) : 145pp<br />
<br />
Fine Antique Ring (AC 3, HP +30, MANA +20, Focus:Mana Preservation II) Quest from PoK..the undead froglok tongue can be bought cheap from a number of traders in PoK, the rockhopper eye for about 5 silver in SharVhal, the cougar pelt from the bazaar for 30-50pp, the cockatrice beak is a little more difficult but someone might have one)<br />
<br />
The Owlbear Feather Circlet and Brain of Beaked Bear drop from the named owlbear prince in Hollowshade. You can probably take him if your very careful but you would have to be very careful. These items are NO DROP so if any other class is killing owlbears for their pelts (Rallik Bag (10 slot 90% reduction)needs this pelt so its quiite often happening) they might kill the prince for you and let you have the drop.<br />
<br />
You can have my JAsper Gold Earring (WIS +3) if you want and my Embroidered Black Cape (AC4 HP +15 MANA +20) when i replace it, which will be very soon.<br />
<br />
Serpentine Bracer has crap AC of 1 but DEx +3 and AGI + 9 plus Focus: Extended Affliction II. I picked mine up for 110pp but i have seen them cheaper.<br />
<br />
Ry'Gorr Battle Mail (AC18, STR +10, MANA +20, SvP +5) can usually be picked up for well under 200pp<br />
<br />
Give me a tell in game and i'll hook you up with the earring and later the cloak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, thanks for the great help m8, and for the free items! I'll see yuo on some time, and idea what your EQ &quot;prime time&quot; is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">BTW, i don't have PoP :( jsut wondering, does it have more min requirements than SoL cuzmy computer has a hard time runnig that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think PoP is any worse than Luclin. PoP is great for those quests and for travelling, and is a handy place for buying spells, but other than that has little to offer until level 50 or so.<br />
<br />
I think its worth it just for the transport system, not having a 2-box system with a drood or some such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">No probs telosk, i am on around 10pm UK time to around 2am tonite.<br />
<br />
PoP is really worth having even at low levels purely for the travel system. I got it for christmas (bless the wife, she's very understanding when it comes to EQ), so far in 2 days i have got that fine antique ring, managed to buy all but 2 of my lvl34 spells in the library and travelled to places i would never of bothered too cause they were too far away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually telosk i'll look up some armour drops (i aint rich but if i see some armour in the bazaar thats cheap i'll grab it for you) and camp them for you and if your on we can both go and camp the owlbear prince if the owlbears are up..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What items do you have at the moment? Perhaps create a magelo profile and post the link</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>malikaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">im on AB too. ill drop u a line and give u some of my old stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Come on then Telosk give us a breakdown of what you have and i'm sure between us we can twink you ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">lol, thnx for the help you too, i never expected even a reply to this thread, i'll jsut lon on take a look at my equip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">for a shield, you might want to look at a Clay Guardian Shield (you said CGS, but I thought that to be Charred Guardian).  Clay can be bought on the Rathe for under 200pp usually, not sure of yours.  What I'd really recommend though, is to save for a Sarnak Battle Shield.  Under 1k, and will last longer, IMO.  Earring, do the Jasper Kundan Earring quest in Echo Caverns, if you have a few friends to help.  It's free, and like a forest loop with STR.  For a mask, the Fine Cut Diamond Inlaid mask from PoK is nice.  The spell haste comes in rather handy, and the sarnak blood is easy to get.  For the boots, try and get some friends to help you get your Black Fur boots.  It's a step in your epic anyway, decent stats on them, and right-click instant-SoW.  Kromrif Military Leggings are easy to obtain with a friend or two, and they have very nice stats for shaman.  The fine antique ring from PoK is easy and very worthwhile.  Jaded Velium Rings are cheap enough, if you know a jeweler.  For a cheap tunic, while you save for iksar regen, a Shardtooth's Flayed Tunic is AC 14, 35 hp, 35 mana, I believe.  Usually available for about 50pp on my server.  A Smiter's Girdle is a nice, cheap belt, with decent AC, as well as a few STA and WIS.  <br />
<br />
Just a few ideas, hope they help  =)</div></div><hr />
