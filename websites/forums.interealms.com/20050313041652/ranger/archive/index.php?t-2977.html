<br />
Last Night i kite/fear against Mammots in EW in Velious. After few minutes a 'elder snow griffin' adds and hit me hard. I try to flee with my SOW up, but his running (flying) speed was equal (or faster) like my Ranger SOW. I try to snare him, but he's resistet several times and i was dying. Now my Question:<br />
<br />
Could i flee from 'elder snow griffin' with 'Wolf Form' up?? Or is 'Wolf Form' also not fast enough?<br />
<br />
Another Question. I try to hunt Icefang. But it seems he was very confused, since last Patch. He respwans every 15-20 Seconds !!! I think the Quest there with the Coldain Ghost is broken or something..any other Ideas, facts??<br />
<br />

You'd need a SoW that is higher in level than that of the snow griffin in order to out run him - or just snare him.<br />
<br />
Icefang is currently broken; he's constantly triggered by Korrigain every 10 seconds or so.  Each time Korrigain says his line, Icefang repops.<br />
<br />
If you want to do his part of the quest, you need to keep a character at Korrigan and spam him with hails.  This will prevent him from saying the quest text, and Icefang will make it to his destination.</div></div><hr />

Will give you a bit of room to try and snare and or root without interupts.</div></div><hr />

I ask because he is a druid, and also casts sow (and skin buffs, and damage shields) on himself. The speed of sow goes up with level, so it may just have been that his sow was faster than yours.</div></div><hr />

Aye Wolf form is the same as snow, greater is slightly faster but even at 59, I tend to stay away from the snow grifs</div></div><hr />

By the time the spell wears off they are across the zone and have forgotton where you were.  Also, if you fear-kite in the area over the hill behind Icefang, chances are you'll never run into a griffin - or anything else - except someone elses bad pull.</div></div><hr />

The only damage I took yesterday was when they cast stinging swarm on me (oh no!). :P<br />
<br />
The 2 I killed yesterday spawned between Icefang/Korrigain and Kael.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snoebiz</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanxs for your answers..<br />
<br />
I think the SOW of the 'elder snow griffin' is faster than 'Wolf Form', because the elders are around Level 46 and SOW of a Level 46 Druid is higher than my Wolf Form, isnt it?? Or has Level 46 Druids the same SOW like a Level 30 Ranger??? I dont know. Cancel Magic is a good tactical Idea, but its not enough time to do this. If the elder had different 'buffs' up, then i must be luckly one to cancel the SOW first. Otherwise i will die, because he hits me with 100+ DMG per hit, and when i kite/fear i had only offensive Buffs up. My 1200 Ranger HP's goes down quickly, i only have 3-4 tries to snare/weed/root/fear him.<br />
<br />
I think il wait to next patch, hopefully Icefang's and Korrigains mind works perfectly again. Then i hunt Icefang and the walruses/mammuts in the Environment of Icefangs hut. This is a 'safe' place. But if Icefang is camped, then i must go away from the safe place, and heading east to the Mammuts and the OMG elder snow griffin OMG. In this case is will get my WolfForm up. I try to go around the griffins. But next time one of this bad guys will attack, Snoebiz, the Woodelf Ranger girl, will be prepared. I think i mem Tangling weeds and Panic. If i will be hit, i try to weed's (fast cast time) and fear him alternating (first try this one some weak creatures, hihihi).. Last time the elder attacks me, i was completly unprepared. I think, now i will be prepared and can snare/panic him an then laughting flee from this bad, flying griffins....<br />

<br />
pull to the &quot;sleeping dragon statue&quot; (sleeper's tomb entrance). You never have adds there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snoebiz</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep<br />

Good tip. Thank you.<br />
If there are anytime some fearable Animals in then environment, i think this would be a good place for fear kite. I will try it...<br />

btw, make sure you werent crouched accidently</div></div><hr />

Look at the spells they cast on you.  Stinging Swarm is something like a level 20ish spell, and I've gotten root (regular root, not any of the upgrades) attempted on me by them.  If they were druids they'd be a whole lot meaner, what with VI's NPC system.  Druid NPC will melee like a Ranger NPC, with more spell power behind it :p<br />
<br />
I always TWeed em, and run, or else kill them, they are just nasty critters :)</div></div><hr />

There are more than enough ;)<br />
<br />
I made it through my 40s there, think i started at 42, left at 50 or 51 when too much went lightblue.<br />
<br />
just stay away from manticores and giants.<br />
<br />
rhinos have more HP it seems, took me long to kill them usually.<br />
<br />
mammoths are your friend<br />
<br />
oh and the wolves have really low HP.<br />
<br />
you can fearkite griffins there too, if you feel like it. just make sure to dispell them 4 or 5 times during the pull, or you will hurt yourself much on the DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snoebiz</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep<br />

I will head to Icefang, if he is unbugged and not camped. Otherwise i go to pull/kill mammuts at the sleepers entrance. I had soloed Griffins in the past, i could kill them. But the &quot;elder&quot; Version of them hits IMHO tooo hart for me. It could be, that my Panic was to big, so the elder could kill me... But in future i will be prepared to weed/panic them...hihihi..<br />
<br />
You all had help me a lot, i think with your help i find a good way to hunt in EW....Try it out next.... I was in DSP from 40-49. Very cool there. AWESOME EXP :P .. But now, in 49, there are very, very less blue wolfes and NO blue Zelniaks up. The Rockhoopers were fine to soloing, but sometimes the Tribals are up.. So i must go into a group... Much time i playing EQ, i had only 1-2 Hours playtime, so go directly into exp/soloing is perfect. The other time (more 2 hours) i just go raid and fun with my guild friends, most time without exp, loot and other stuff, only BIG FUN....So its important for me, that i could solo if i log on for short periods..DSP is gone for me in this case.. :(<br />
<br />
Next time, i heading to EW and make a new attempt to solo to 51 there...<br />
<br />
After 51... Don't know... i think its difficult to kite/fearing in good places for post 51 levels....<br />
<br />
Anyway i realyy LIKE to be a Ranger Girl...<br />

Ya, you can tell they are rangers by the level of the spell line they use.. AND you can tell cause they got sow as soon as it was lowered to level 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What level are you?  I'd assume that these griffons are blue to you right?<br />
<br />
Well from what I understand, Sow increases the base movement speed of the mob.  If the mob has a natural running speed that is faster than your normal running speed, a sow on that mob will make them go even faster than a sow on you.</div></div><hr />
