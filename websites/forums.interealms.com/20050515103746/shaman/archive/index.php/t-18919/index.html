<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">shamless repost from the necro board:<br />
<br />
 Yeah, I know this is breaking the NDA but while you're grinding away to make those 30 AA before GoD, you should know this:<br />
<br />
Ok, this is the good news. The good news is that with your 30 AAs, you should be able to max out critical affliction, if that was your goal.<br />
<br />
The bad news is that is the ONLY skill you're getting on release day.<br />
<br />
Yes, it will take your full 30 AAs to max critical affliction. It has 3 levels that go 5/10/15.<br />
<br />
Figure... screw critical affliction then. I want swarm of death. Aye? Well, here's the skinny on that.<br />
<br />
The good news is that while it only lasts 18 seconds, it has a 1 minute re-use.<br />
<br />
The bad news is that it is also a 5/10/15 ability.<br />
<br />
Swarm of death seems to summon only one skeletal archer at level one but it's bugged so the pet never actualy spawns. It auto suicides. I will assume that level 2 will summon 2 and 3 will summon 3. I hope their DPS doesn't suck for the 30aa it will cost to max.<br />
<br />
GoD is full of cool abilities like the ability to make your pet crit and flurry. Those have 5 tiers each. First tier costs 3 aa. I figured it would be a 3/3/3/3/3 skill like ID and LR. Apparently GoD doesn't work that way. I am told those also get progressivly more expensive.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am told the rational behind this is that AAs will be faster in GoD and these abilities are really meant mainly for people with near max AAs as it is.<br />
<br />
Well, again, sorry for breaking the NDA. I know it's not a good thing to do. But, this might severly alter people's exp grinding habits pre-GoD and I know I sure as hell wouldn't want to get blind-sided with this.<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
 Well, pet flurries seem to be 3/6/9/12/15 for aa progression. Pet crits seem to stay at 3/3/3/3/3.<br />
<br />
I can't really comment on either of these as they are either broken, or are so absurdly rare that I've never seen either a pet crit or a pet flurry. I am guessing broken.<br />
<br />
I have not gotten to try anything else, yet. By the way, packrat is a 5% wt reduction per level.<br />
<br />
have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Jesus christ 45 points for one skill haha.  I thought 3/6/9 was bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I feel kinda icky reading a NDA breach.  Don't know why as I hold no favor nor respect for Sony...  Might just be all my time working at a lawfirm /shrug.<br />
<br />
That being said, wheres the info bout the shaman AA's?  =P<br />
<br />
I hope the AA exp rolls in WAY faster than it does now for those crazy @!#$ prices.  Especially since our new spirit thing (can't remember the name) that regenerates melees mana is a 5 tier skill.  I'm betting anything that it reads like pet flurry and is a 45AA point ability to max. /shrug <br />
<br />
EDIT: oh wait... due to our &quot;superior mana regeneration&quot; it will cost 60AA points to max.  After all, we do have to maintain 'class balance'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Holy moly...  That's kind of harsh.  I hope the warrior HP one isn't like that, or it'll be 75aa, which is 3/4 of all the AA's I've ever gotten for her.  Homey don't play dat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One possibility on critical affliction is that it gives crits often enough to match the rate of SCF3+FOM3(12+18=30).  If it's 30 points just for an SCF-like benefit, then /boggle, dunno what they're thinking.<br />
<br />
chif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh HELL no. Now that's just gotten completely out of hand for AA costs.<br />
<br />
Get those damn things toned back to a more realistic level. Not everyone pulls in 4aaxp a night ya know dangit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why do I have this really bad feeling about an expansion where xp comes more easily than PoP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't feel this is out of hand at all. AAs are very very easy to get. Remember how long it took to get AAs back pre PoP? bout 5 hours per an AA compared to 1 now. 6 AAs to get alot of things, 30 now. The ratios work out perfectly fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it wasn't fun back then either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you want them to do?  Give you every AA for free upon purchasing the expansion?  That'd be even less fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">bout 5 hours per an AA compared to 1 now.<br />
<br />
I don't buy that ratio, though...  I don't recall it ever taking me 5 hours to get an aa.  I used to get 1-2 aa per week, with my rather limited play schedule.  Now I get 2-4, with a similar schedule.  The costs of these are gonna make me sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What do you want them to do? Give you every AA for free upon purchasing the expansion?<br />
<br />
NOW WE ARE TALKING BABY.<br />
<br />
No but 45 aa points for 1 skill doesn't seem high?<br />
<br />
If you want to create content for a game, create content.  It's like they run out of ideas in meetings and say &quot;Ok we only added 300 hours of playtime for the average player in this expansion and we were aiming for 600.  Unacceptable.  Create content, are you mad? Double the AA xp costs.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Haha, even playing as much as I do its taken me a year to get 107 AA. You people that are saying it doesn't take long to rack up 45 aa must be the same ones that have over 500.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How about Sony puts some thought into the impact?  More XP in this expansion?  All that will do is further obsolete older content.  They love to tout the fact that there is so much content in the game, but the fact is, if you're looking for XP, and everyone is at most points, the older content is obsolete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What do you want them to do?  Give you every AA for free upon purchasing the expansion?  That'd be even less fun.<br />
<br />
Velious was the worst expansion ever because it didn't add more xp grinding.<br />
<br />
Oh sh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">lol ok that explains why pet affinity being 20 points suddenly appears &quot;cheap&quot;. Damn if they wanted to put this much points on aas they could have at least made some worth getting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You're smoking crack if you don't think 30 aa's isn't an extremely high amount of points to spend for ONE skill.  :eek: <br />
<br />
Not everyone has access to PoF where you can grind out 2 or 3 aa's a night in a matter of a few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tpak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">More XP in this expansion? All that will do is further obsolete older content.<br />
<br />
That's exactly what they want to do and going to do. They want everyone to buy GoD. Yes this is stupid game wise, but it's pure economic. Everyone will go buy GoD once they realise they can exp 2x or 3x faster in GoD zones...<br />
<br />
This is just what they always do with all new expansions...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">They'll let you exp faster for a couple weeks, then they'll nerf it if they were smart.  They'd get the influx of buyers, which they will most likely get anyhow like every other expansion (besides LoY), and after a couple weeks get the game balance with exping back.  LoY was of course the exception, a big flop.  But due to the fact that there was no actual buyable CDs, they still made money off a cure crap expansion.  I personally have only gone to LoY to get Blood of Nadox (which is pretty much the same as Disinfecting Aura USED to be... they nerf us then make us quest to get un nerfed!) and to buy wormwood for the rare occasion that I make an illusion potion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">oh joy more aas per skill, i have a hard time saving up 9 for MGB and such, 30aa to save no frigign way that is happening so i can become a buff bot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">well one good thing we know the highs level cant be more than 30 aas...  or did they change that too? ;)</div></div><hr />
