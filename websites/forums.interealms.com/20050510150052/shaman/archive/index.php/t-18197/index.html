<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im confused on whether or not I should go full on for AA's for  while before leveling to 65. Im 59 now soon to be 60, and thought I would ask the community what their experience is post 60 on AA's. I hear the AA exp at certain lkevels is like leveling normal xp. What to do!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">After 59, level 60 will fly by.  I went from 60 to 61 in about an hour or so in PoV at the switch camp.  If you are going to stop in your 60's to get AA's, I would say get to 62 before you stop.  Then you have the 61 pet, nice regen spell, upgraded focus, the best single target stat buffs, and your last heal spell.  <br />
<br />
However, it took me only about a week longer to go from 60 to 65 than it did to go from 59 to 60.  (I was stuck at 59 for about a month, playing casually)  Get 65 first would be my recomendation.  61 and 62 spells are SO easy to get.  Ethereal parchs drop like crazy and most 61&amp;62 spells can be had for less than 100 plat in the Bazaar on almost any server Id bet.  Spectrals are just a little harder to get, which isnt hard at all.  Runes are had unless you are doing Towers/elementals, but those are not uncommon either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Many will say get to 65 before doing any AA's because they come faster at 65 when you can kill bigger stuff.  This is true in theory but if your guild isn't at a point where a bulk of them are flagged for anything past BoT/HoH then AA at 65 won't come much faster than at 62.  I would say at least get to 62 so you can go to HoH and BoT, then decide on AA or XP.  You could even split it 80xp/20aa and still get decent AA in HoH.  If you have the money to buy Quiesence and other lvl 65 spells, then definately get to 65 asap.  Just my opinion anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taiyed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depends on your situation, so I'll give you mine:<br />
<br />
Mostly a pick-up group shaman, once-in-a-while raid, but mostly do pick-up groups, so I'm going to 65 first (only one level away :p).  I *did* stop at 61 and do SC1, VP1, and MC1 (9 total), but realized I could have been close to level 63 in the same amount of time.<br />
<br />
Also, the XP/loot in BoT rocks.  Atleast get to 62 before you AA. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Stop at 62, get as many AA's as you like - you'll regret it later, so might as well hate yourself for 20AAs vs hating yourself for 3 AAs :)<br />
<br />
All joking aside...<br />
<br />
I piddled around and had 6 AAs before 62, then did another 17 for Canni 5 at lvl 62, and now I'm 7 blues away from 65.  I should've listened to some of the posters here and just leveled straight to 65.<br />
<br />
My advice:  level straight to 65.  Only stop and get an AA or 2 when you are burnt out and need to 'reward' yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">65 it is thanks all =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was more casual about it, since I had malo and torpor anyway.  I stopped at 60 to get canni, then 61 for the pet and the rest of the toys - SC, VP, RC.  In the meantime, I got all of my 61-62 spells through ethereal drops.  POV and POS are actually pretty good for experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Detron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had 10 AA's before I jumped into POP leveling (60+) when I reached 65 I started with my AAs again. But before that I had 0% exp into AAs. That's my suggestion. Start working on ordinary experience up to 65 first before you do any AAs. More levels, more chances to get groups as well.<br />
<br />
Remember that groups + guild raids whine on us for Fo7, Diaku, FA, yada, yada... so get yer levels asap :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One odd thing to mention though -- you get more AA per adventure in 65 normal at 63rd than you do at 65th due to the fact that more monsters are within 5 levels of you.  This said, if you can get into decent ldon groups at 62/63 then it might be an ok point to do some AAs.  It all depends on the guild etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm still in the middle of such a decision.  My shaman just dinged 59 and I have a guildie with topor and maybe malo waiting for me to ding 60.  This has motivated me to scramble for 60 as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
I was going to go to 65 after that, but I was persuaded not to due to my equipment goals.  I 2box a paladin along with my shaman, and my immediate goals after 60 are:<br />
<br />
* Camp Veksar for equipment upgrades<br />
* Loyalist shield of honor quest<br />
* Camp for grimling crystal ball<br />
* Zone into sebilis (I've never been there)<br />
<br />
IE: I'm not going to be in pop for a month or more.  I've read that 61 limits the exp you get in some old world content locations... so I plan to explore a little bit and then go to 65.  The significant factors here is that I duo by myself a lot, my guild is not waiting on me to get to 65 and my choice is being driven more by where I want to go vs character development.<br />
<br />
Just a thought,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Level 64 here with 34 AA.  Don't regret any of the AA I did getting to where I am.  I'm of the type that needs to see rewards, and also to try to be the best I can at every level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I stopped levelling at 62 to bust out Can5.  I don't regret it.  Rune spells are so expensive on my server that I couldn't see racing to 65, since I couldn't afford any of the spells anyway.  I also didn't see most of the 63-64 spells as being all that inspiring.  Certainly Can5 is a better ability than most of them, if not all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Had 18 AA's at 62 then thought bugger this.<br />
Put all exp into levelling and hit 65 in no time.<br />
Now at 65 I just watch the AA's roll in and regret getting AA's not real exp earlier.<br />
Just personal experience but go for 65 1st.<br />
As someone posted I kept reading on here to go for 65 1st then do AA's but I ignored them too :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You will have a lot easier time getting pick up groups in BoT or HoH at 65 than at 62.  That is a main reason why the AA exp flies so fast at 65.  You will save up and buy your 65 spells in the bazaar faster than getting the runes to drop, so dont sweat it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not certain that's correct.  When you get AA xp it's as if you were 51 or 52...I don't think your actual level figures into the equation...but I'm not 100% certain either...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I stopped at 62 to get canni5, best move I ever made in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I was in no hurry to get to 65, I had no runes at the time, nor was I in a guild that would be able to provide them for me.  So, I did what would be best for me and my mana situation since I was the only shaman in my guild that ever raided.<br />
<br />
It really depends a lot upon your situation though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok from what i understand 1 AA PT takes the same amount of exp as it would to fill level 51.<br />
You are not treated as a level 51 or we could go around killing greens/l.blue mobs and get good aaexp for it.<br />
Just imagine the aaexp we would get hunting in BoT for example if our level didnt figure into it.<br />
Now dont treat this as gospel and perhaps im talking out of where the sun dont shine but that is how i understand it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just about everyone here says get lvl 65 1st.  I would agree with them to a point.  My Shaman got 23 AAs needed for canni5 at lvl 53.  My reason was that I soloed alot because of weird play times.  I would pull an AA every 2.5 hrs solo at that lvl.  As soon as I dinged 59, boom I had more mana than I thought was possible.  Recently I made an SK to duo with.  Hes now lvl 60 and hes staying there for awhile to get some AAs because the mobs we kill give him more AA at 60 than the Sham gets at 65.  So my 2cps is it just depends on your playstyle and situation.  If your a grouper/raider, deffinately go for lvl 65 it makes alot of your jobs much easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 62 now and am still green in terms of grouping in bot and hoh. BoT is a lot of work at 62. Takes malo, then malosini to be a somewhat competent slower in my opinion. Coupled with some of the fast pulling groups in there it can be challenging keeping up with canni4. <br />
<br />
I've got about 13AAs at this point and am still on the fence whether or not to finish out canni5 or go for 65. I have malo and torpor though and my guild only has a few people that are level 65. We'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I stopped at 62 for Cann5 and to be honest, wasnt planning on ever going any further in levels.<br />
Then out came LDON.<br />
I did the math for my adventure points. At that exact moment I had a revelation and I decided that 65 was worth it after all. Less adventures for more points = better armor faster.<br />
In all seriousness, it wont matter a huge amount unless your guild is brow beating you to be 65. On most servers that isnt a huge deal, take for example Karana....around velious when shamans started soloing dragons in WW, people all over hell and back started twinking and PLing them.....level 65 shamans are as abundant as idiots in BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kjell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Well I am currently 63 with 23 AA points, recently got Canni V and dont regret a single AA I have worked.  I have no problems getting a BoT group and no problems keeping up with VERY fast groups (especially since I got Canni V).<br />
<br />
Yer, you can get to 65 pretty fast, but you will still be a 65 shaman, who can fulfil little more than a 62 Shaman as you will not get your 63-65 spells for quite a while.  <br />
<br />
Some people have a big stigma attatched to being 65, but personally I am warry of grouping with anyone that doesnt have a title by lev 60.  I guess it is up to you really, if you feel that being 65 is important I would just do straight XP, but I have never really seen the rush to be 65.<br />
<br />
I do however agree with most here that say get to 62, the XP in Tier 3 rocks, you can easily work 4 AA in a single evening (translates to about 40% straight XP).</div></div><hr />

I actually got my first group invite to BoT last night.  They actually wanted me to be the main healer (i'm lvl 63), while a 65 Beastlord slowed.  It was rough at first with them chain pulling because the mobs died so fast (we had 2 sk's, Bst, and 2 rangers all 65 w/ AA's and then me).  I couldn't get enough casts of Canni 4 in between heals to keep up.  Then I had a guildie come down and KEI me (he also hasted the group and another group, good guild PR).  With KEI and my Drog i was able to keep up and even was able to finally summon dogdog to add a little damage.  Then the 65Bst left and was replaced by a 63 Bst (ie 50% slow).  I was now put into the roll of slower and healer.  It was a challenge, it was wild but I was able to do it.  The group was very impressed, especially the main tank who didn't realize that I was only 63 (that impressed him more).  The only mobs I had some real trouble with slowing were the Jord Militis (which was even at 63).  I would sometimes land Malosinia and still bounce slow 1 time.  The 63 BST backed me up with spam Chloroblast heals on the SK tank until I got it slowed, then I took over healing.  It was amazing teamwork for a pickup group.   Though come to think of it most of the group was 1 guild.<br />
<br />
Question for the more informed... Haste only effects melee attack speed correct?  One of the group rangers kept saying &quot;Haste WMP&quot; and he was only sitting back with his Bow.  I didn't think haste would effect bow attack speed...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think its very situational and personal for each player as to what they should do.  I came back to EQ days before the release of PoP.  Most of the guild I was in was still below level 60, I didnt want to outlevel the rest of the guild by a lot, and no one had any higher level spells anyway and most of the tier 1 and tier 2 pop zones were locked unlike now.  I got cannV at 60 before hitting 61 and then leveled as I got spells, doing some AA in between.  When I had a majority of my 61-62 spells I leveled to 62, same with 63-64, 65 I just went ahead and got when I found Quiescence for sale and purchased it, worth it for that spell alone.<br />
<br />
Lots of reasons for and against leveling quickly.  I did what I felt was best at the time, if I were growing up now, then things would most certainly be different, I would likely shoot to 65 first like most others are recommending.<br />
<br />
As others have pointed out, at 62 you now automatically gain entrance to HoH and BoT, both fantastic xps.  Many times, if a parchment/rune drops that you cannot use (level wise), you may not get a chance to roll on it.  Same goes for groups, at 65 you will most certainly find a group easier than previous levels.  Alternately, you may also have a slow leveling guild (or friends) and you may not want to outlevel them because you group with them a lot (my case).<br />
<br />
So basically, do what you want and what makes you enjoy the game more, there really is no right or wrong answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Haste helps all melee abilities, including normal &quot;autoattack&quot; melee, range attacks (bows, throwing knives, etc), kick, bash, etc.<br />
<br />
If you dont have any useful 65 spells (Quiescence, ferine avatar, malos), it's probably not worth getting 65 asap.  If you're doing LDON, then it is advisable to get 65 asap for the larger adventure point reward.<br />
<br />
I stopped for Canni5 at levels 62 and 63.  Why?  Because I was playing main healer and slower for my group of friends.  Canni4 was NOT enough to keep up with the pace we wanted to go at.  The difference in what I was capable of before canni5 and after canni5 is astounding.  Canni5 is also a huge boon indoors where you cannot use a horse.<br />
<br />
If you don't have torpor, canni5 won't make as much difference for you most likely, but, if you have torpor waiting to scribe, you aren't going to regret getting canni5 before 65.  Also, depending on where you hunt, being a lower level may benefit you if being &lt;65 puts you within 5 levels of the mob level; this is only true if being 65 would put you out of this range.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would have regretted getting 65 asap and skipping any AAs.  Our spells, especially the upper level ones, cost extremely large amounts of mana, and not having the increased mana regen of canni5 (approximately FT30 using torpor/q to heal yourself) would have been much more difficult.  I'm still unsure how I managed before getting canni5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
good point. Was in a pickup group last night and we had a wizard with a &quot;Sage&quot; title, after we had been chain pulling for a while with me slowing and another 62 shaman healing the wizard chimes in that he was wary at first cause we all didn't have the aa titles (most were barons, couple had no titles) but was proved wrong and impressed by the groups ability.  Now that I think about it higher aa titles does mean more ability and utility in groups, not to mention a little head start on the first impression (in a pickup group at least).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Personally, I levelled to 65 first because my guild needed me 65.<br />
<br />
But, there was a long span of that 65 where I had no 65 spells, only 1 64 spell, and 2 63 spells.  Getting to 65 quickly got that out of the way, but I found myself with the ability to use the uber spells, but no plat or glyphs to get them.<br />
<br />
Had I to do it over again, I would have gone 50/50 with my AA after hitting 62 to slow down my levelling and give me time to gather the spells I needed for the upper levels.<br />
<br />
Trust me, being 65 without any spells sucks, especially when you get very odd looks from people in pick-up groups when you're using Talisman of the Brute, no Q, single Focusing everyone, and your main dots are Bane of Nife and Pox.  :(<br />
<br />
After a few of those experiences, I parked my happy butt in Sebilis and farmed for almost 3 straight weeks for the plat to buy some spells.<br />
<br />
Levelling up is very important, but don't level faster than your ability to get your spells.  ;)</div></div><hr />
