<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>chmodux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question for you guys.  I dont know how many of you have tight knit guilds where this matters.  I have a group of friends I've played with for some time..alot of whom I know IRL.  But I've also made far more friends in EQ than I ever thought i'd know from that guild.  We got large for an ep push at the end and we added alot of good folks.  However my conversion to WoW has been met with equal parts resentment, suspiscion (that I was trying to steal and convert people on a regular basis), and confusion.  <br />
<br />
Seems most people in my guild either A) have no interest in the slightest in WoW but are anxiously looking forward to EQ2 B) want to continue playing the game they've played for 6 years, and look forward to for the next 3 or so.  <br />
<br />
A total of maybe 8 players say they have plans to play WoW out of 40 or so active players in that guild.  About 5-6 from what I can tell seem to be VERY against me even mentioning that I have a website that people can come to when they want to see my progress, check up on me or talk to the others of us in beta even those in the stress test.<br />
<br />
Now that i've bored you with that little background, anyone else in beta or who are planning on playing have similar experiences.  I honestly naievely expected more than half would be chomping at the bit and the rest would be open to change from the freaking game they've played for so long and have complained about for SO long, since the WoW beta server has tons of ex-eqers.  Seems alot of it was mild complaining rather than the loathing I had for the EQ, well mainly SOE.<br />
<br />
I am now faced with the uncomfortably reality of starting a new guild and turning my back on those I've known for so long.  But its either WoW for me atm or just give up on mmorpgs.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else at all in the same predicament  and if not what has your experiences been with guilds wanting to move to WoW.  Any input even negative would be appreciated at this point.<br />
<br />
edited because I cannot type apparently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm in a much different situation.  Most of my favorite folks from my old guild burned out just before or after I did.<br />
<br />
Getting over EQ reminds me of nothing so much as the AA 10 step recovery program.  One of those steps is denial.... where people who complain about EQ, SoE and those wretched devs - refuse to consider switching.  <br />
<br />
But everybody hits the stages at different points.  I remember being fed up with EQ but continuing to play because (stop me if you've heard these before!)<br />
<br />
*I've put too much *WORK* into EQ to quit now<br />
*I'm unwilling to be a noob again<br />
*There's no way I'll find a group of people in another game as great as this group<br />
<br />
And more.  But I realized that a game doesn't have to feel like work, and being a noob again actually brings back that magical feeling, and that there are great people out there, lots of em.<br />
<br />
But you can't force anybody to realize it, I don't think.  But if you just gently put the word out there, I think - over time - a lot of that group will join you in WoW.  (especially if EQ2 is built to have the same kinds of frustrations that made me flee EQ - which seems to be what I'm hearing from beta)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how well that addressed what you were asking, but it's something I think about quite a bit.  Best of luck to you, however you go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guild plays all sorts of games.  We originally formed in UO, many (most) of us moved to EQ where we expanded some (seldom over 30 members), moved to DAoC, tried SWG as a guild and dumped it, tried CoH as a guild and dumped it, and are now scattered across the galaxy of MMORPGs awaiting the NBT (next-big-thing: a running joke phrase in our guild).  We've also poked around with games like Unreal Tournament, Planetside, Space, Above and beyond, WWII Online, Tribes, Sims Online, and Horizons, but none of those held our interest.<br />
<br />
I was the only member of our guild to get into the WoW closed beta.<br />
<br />
After the WoW stress test (where 16 guildmates joined me) and due, in part, to the ongoing web page I keep of my WoW adventures, WoW will probably be our NBT.<br />
<br />
We still have guildies strewn across UO, EQ, DAoC, COH, and SWG.  We all still meet on the guild message boards and talk about what's going on.  Occasionally we all congregate on a particular game and have great fun together.  We also meet new people in these games and add they become permamnent members of our roster.  Our core membership was originally from the same company.  Our current membership is from across the USA in at least 8 cities, but many of us have managed to meet each other in person - usually tied in on business trips.<br />
<br />
Back to your post.  In my opinion, your guild is not as tight-knit as you might think.  To us, the camaraderie is the key element of the guild - the games we play are incidental to that.  In your guild it seems like a big split between what game is being played and who you are playing a game with.  My advice is if you want to play a different game, then do so.  Some of your guildies will come along because they like playing with the other guildmates.  Other players will stay behind because they're not willing to give up their investment in their EQ character.  If you leave EQ along with some others, you will be with the right folks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those two I have heard verbatim over and over.  Yes your post helped give me a different perspective that  I needed.  Your words comfort me in the fact that they're will probably be a period of time where I have to go it with the few that are coming with and wait for a few others to decide to try the game out.</div></div><hr />
