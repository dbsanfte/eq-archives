&quot;We forgot to include a comment in the patch message about the removal of the 10% healing penalty for non-clerics. The penalty was indeed removed with this patch.<br />
Also, while we’ve included the new ‘old-world’ Vah Shir models in the patch, you won’t be able to turn them on yet. We’ll have to patch another file to allow you to choose to turn them off in the interface. That should happen soon.<br />

Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">it is being discussed on another thread - started with an attempt to paint clerics as anti-shaman.  or shaman as anti-cleric.  anyway, I think shaman and druids are happy to heal 11.1% better than in the past!</div></div><hr />
