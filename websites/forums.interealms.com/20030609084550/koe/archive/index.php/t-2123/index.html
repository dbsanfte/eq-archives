<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings Tuesday night types. <br />
<br />
Our target remains Nurga this week to follow up from last week. We will be forming at the LoIO/FM zone at about 6:45 and making the trek from there to Nurga.<br />
<br />
In talking to Griss/Bear some, I think the limiting factor of a lot of places we go is Calon's level and what he can mez. Right now, most of the mobs in Nurga are yellow/red to him and he winds up tanking adds instead of mezzing because stuns and mez are resisted so much, even after being tashed. With this in mind, I will probably try to work on Calon outside of Tuesday a bit to get him a bit up on levels and make it possible to visit more places sooner rather than later. <br />
<br />
In the next couple of weeks, we will probably try to visit Dalnir's Crypt in Warsliks Woods and continue our assault on Nurga. Part of the purpose of this is to take the &quot;tour&quot; around, collect the &quot;been there, done that&quot; badge and enjoy the sites of EQ.. :)<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing everyone Tuesday..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I have a character that is somewhat hidden. His name is Faergus, a level 30 shaman. In fact, he is so hidden, his creation date is July 20 1999 but he is still level 30. Currently, he is in Firiona Vie but I would love to try to bring him out for some of these runs if you need him. 6:45 Central is a bit early for me as I usually cant get on for another hour or so from that. However, I will log him in and see if you guys need me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Appreciate the good turn out last night.. friends, petitioners, and guildies all made up the mix. <br />
<br />
Saw some new faces and I think things went reasonably well. We did not have our usual tankage, but had rangers as mains. We did much better getting to Nurga this time with no problems. <br />
<br />
The night went reasonably well and there were a couple of deaths, but I think things were learned when that happen.. (not to mention when you are fighting multiple reds and yellows, it is going to happen).  Fortunately, we had Weezee for a cleric there and she was able to revive people back in. (First rule; keep the cleric alive. :) )<br />
<br />
I did not mez much, but used stuns a lot last night with pretty good results on yellow and red mobs. The good news is Calon has less than a yellow to go for 30. <br />
<br />
We also had several ding last night, so that is a good thing. <br />
<br />
I think at this point, we will continue in Nurga at least for another week. The xp is good and I think people are learning a lot there. <br />
<br />
See you next week.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Very educational especially for my Bard playing in this dungeon. Exp is awesome. Once again we were the only ones here. I would suggest staying here for several more weeks. It is easy to get around in here. Not too dangerous. A very good training dungeon.<br />
<br />
Levels: My group had a 33 Ranger. This made a big difference because as you  know you can't taunt yellows and reds. The other group had lvl 25 meleers which could not taunt. At 28 all the spiders were red to me. Some goblins were red. The rest were yellow. I think it would be great to stay in here until many of us are at least low 30's, get the practice playing together, then move on to the other 2 dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Eliyra Darkangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd love to come join you on Tuesday night sometime...if guests are allowed!  :)  Nurga would be neat to see...I've leveled two characters to the 50s and never once set foot in that dungeon for some reason.   I have a level 31 monk in Frontier Mountains right now that would love to see some raids.  Hope to see you all then!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kindonini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hi all. This sounds like a blast! Do any of you play these characters any other nights besides Tuesday? I (also) have a 29 chanter and would love come play with you all here, but I have class on Tuesday nights for 6 more weeks (then it's back to my regular Friday night and all day Saturday schedule). <br />
<br />
In the mean time though, the hubby has a 32 shadow knight that he would love to bring over, if that isn't too high.<br />
<br />
Kindo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Regular playtimes are roughly every Tuesday 7 CST to just after 10 CST. A 31 monk would be fine as would a 32 SK. <br />
<br />
This is an excellent opportunity to meet Keepers that you may not see normally or just in a different environment. <br />
<br />
Sometimes, people will play with us while they are with in our level range and then pass us up and that is ok. Several of the characters only get broken out on Tuesday nights as we have other characters that play. <br />
<br />
I know of several petitioners that have joined us and it gives them more exposure to different people within the guild.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing you if you decide to join us.. Just keep an eye on this section.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Weezee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hiya Keepers, As always I had a blast . We did suffer some death`s . But on the other hand I think we did very well . Those goblin`s really hate cleric`s .  Don`t know if I will be on next Tuesday , got a promotion at work so it might mean even more hours . Hope to see you next Tuesday everyone . And in the meantime Be Safe . :)</div></div><hr />
