<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard that SoE was buying out the advrtiseing of Yantis/IGE on some websites . EQInterface.com being one ... anyone else heard anything about this ? It is a pretty drastic change on the part of SoE if its true . But one I would personaly welcome .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow, that's cool. Taking the battle to the streets, as it were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow.<br />
<br />
If its true, I'll be very suprised.  And pleased.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have to admit, my initial reaction was &quot;Cool - they're sticking it to IGE/Yantis.&quot;<br />
<br />
But, Suddail's reaction got me to thinking.  I viewed this initially as a way to stem the tide of Player Auctions / ebay madness.  But they're basically just spending additional marketing dollars.  They're not actually doing anything (to my knowledge) to curtail these EULA-violators.  They're simply outbidding them for banner ads.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah, but the marketing dollars and the development dollars are from separate budgets, so this doesn't impact development.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its still money from the same company. I don't see the point of advertising on EQ websites anyway. Mostly everyone reading the websites would play eq, or if they don't I dont think advertisements would bring them back. But development changes might.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree, I have seen countless posts on this forum and others where people say, &quot;Nice, if that actually goes live I would come back to EQ&quot; and things along these lines.  But rarely do I talk to someone who came back to EQ because they saw a banner on a website - I'm sure it happens, but would have way less of an impact than developmental changes.</div></div><hr />

I work in IT in Telecommunications. I have seen a three-person team frantically working around the clock to fix one code problem while a 10-person team assigned to another project takes the day off for 'team building' (at the pub) because their project is on schedule.<br />
<br />
It doesn't make sense to outsiders (or even most insiders), but that's just how it works. If Fred's Department supports production, and they have a particular problem, they need to fix it with internal resources. Even if Mary's team developed and QAd the thing initially; her team is already coding up the next release.<br />
<br />
This might not be how Sony works - but I'd be very surprised if that was the case. Once a company gets big enough, people worry about their own fiefdoms instead of the end product - because they get penalized or rewarded based on their own fiefdoms more directly than they do based on the end product.<br />
<br />
There's only one exception I've seen: Billing. If the billing system is down, and revenue stops coming in, you'd better believe everyone is going to be working together to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the short term that is dead on.  But when budgets are made every year, that is when Devs dollars become Marketing dollars and vice-versa and so on.  EQ has been burning $$$ on SWG/EQ2 and you can see how EQ has suffered.  It started out blah and has exploded into complete customer dissatisfaction anarchy from the Ubahs down to the Casual Players over the past 2 years.  FoH was the first BIG hit that EQ took, now top Guilds from each server are starting to follow suit.<br />
<br />
Anywho, I really don't care wheather Yantis makes money or loses money because I don't deal with them.  I keep my concerns with SOE because they are the ones that control if I chose to keep playing EQ or not.<br />
