<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure everyone here knows what makes a bad shaman... but in your mind, what makes a good shaman and even more, what makes a great shaman?<br />
<br />
I hear all the time about people knowing how ot play their character right and I imagine most everyone here does. I am just curious to know what people think makes a great shaman and what you consider as playing your character well?<br />
<br />
If nothing else, this should start either a very intelligent discussion or a very ugly flame war..either way, I get some @work amusement for a bit:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a raid shaman, I think one of the best attributes is patience.  Keeping a raid force of needy tanks buffed and the constant death can wear you down.<br />
<br />
Not snapping at guildmates who ask for a buff after I've asked 5 times if anyone needs it and then unmemming the spells is a challege for me.<br />
<br />
I also value those that try new things, that don't accept limits that others impose on our class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heheh Gloriana soooo true, its just a little annoying when right before a pull u get 2 tells for focus and such.  But by far the worst is a damn paladin in my guild was asking my for avatar...... and couldnt understand that i did not have the spell slots available.<br />
<br />
But imo a good shaman is one who is willing to put up with the annoying aspects of buffing a raid, and know how to make XP groups fun or strech the limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sinladar orchammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I 'great' shaman is able to handle a situation when a group gets in over its head with a bad pull and enable the group to come out alive and well with out an evac.<br />
<br />
Like have the castle in KC getting pulled to RCY and we calmly slow, get agro, park and move on to the next keeping everything at bay till the chanter gets mezzing done and the melee catch up.<br />
<br />
(And its wonderful to be in that situation w/pet now since they can't break mez any more. Jober say 'I am sorry master, I can't attack that vile NPC')</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think it really depends. Shaman are so versatile that they can be played many different ways, no one way better than the other. Is the &quot;Battle Shaman&quot; better than the &quot;Caster Shaman&quot; ? It all depends on the play style, knowledge and skill of the player behind the PC. <br />
What makes a great Shaman is one who respects, admires, and understands the class we play. Being risk-taking and not afraid to push the envelope on our class without endangering others. <br />
As we are finding out, Shaman limitations are few and far between. There isn't much we can't do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IMO the major thing that makes someone best in their class is using their abilities to the max potential.  Like timing heals correctly, slowing big mobs without getting aggro.  Handling 3 requests for g focus without droping the F bomb.  Stuff like this.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LMFAO @ Krakster<br />
<br />
Let's see you SLAM buddy :D<br />
woohoo<br />
<br />
Um, in my learned opinion, a great shaman is no different from a great warrior or a great druid or a great cleric.  It's someone who understands their class, actively THINKS about possibilities of that class, understands the abilities and limitations of all the other classes, and can put it all together at a moment's notice.  He/she can size up a situation in a blink, know what's needed, and do it in a timely manner.  <br />
<br />
Patience for raids as mentioned by Gloriana is also important.  That's probably the prime requirement of a raid player actually, as raids tend to be long boring affairs with brief seconds of joy and deep misery.  <br />
<br />
I have always enjoyed doing stuff with a group or only one or two people as opposed to 40 or 60 others.  It just gets to be too impersonal with so many.  With a single group, my responsibilities can tax my abilities to the limit, and that forces me to adapt and stretch to be able to fulfill my duties.  Which is a challenge, which is fun.  <br />
<br />
Last night my druid buddy and I went down into chardok.  We did the observer camp as a duo, and ended up killing stuff so fast (he has dire charm) and so efficiently that we had most of the tunnel on both sides of the bridge cleared before repops.  That's just an example of what two good players can do with the right gear, skills, and knowledge of the game.  <br />
<br />
My newest favorite solo spot is under the bridge in chardok.  I haven't been able to beat that exp anywhere, and the mobs have quite a bit fewer hps than shrooms in FG.  Making for faster kills, at a larger exp modifier, making for faster exp.  And loot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, I am still learning, even at 51... I guess we all keep learning as we go. I got extremely lucky when I started playing the game by having some good friends who had played forever and was able to keep me from doing anything stupid. <br />
<br />
On a funny note, to me anyway... It took til level 48 or so before my friend finally told me to kill the ON ME! KILL IT! hotkey and just root the darn thing and move away:)<br />
<br />
Okay, so that year away from EQ dulled my senses a bit..I admit it. <br />
<br />
Also, at what point do you feel it right to educate group members, non-raid I am speaking, of what you are there for? I don't know how it is on other servers, but on Veeshan...DL is pretty much a playground and many there see Shaman as nothing more than a healer if there's no cleric around. I don't mind so much since I got Sup heal, but before then, it was such a mana drain to keep up and still they'd ignore my requests to just get a cleric. <br />
<br />
Am I wrong in thinking some education is required at times? To tell others &quot;Hey, I /can/ heal, but you're neglecting my other talents? Let the chanter mezz, so I can slow and stop pullin long enough for me to buff, so we can kill faster and easier?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd really like to get more raid experience. My guild is small and the biggest they've done is getting halfway down the Hole. I did a Vox raid a while back that was pretty fun, even if we all died twice and never beat her. It was a great experience and I'd love to do it again sometime. I'm trying to network a bit and get in on some raids, but seems I got a level or two to go before that's gonna happen;) Which is okie with me..gives me time to get that dumb shield and Skyshadow cloak in the meantime...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh...also, a great shaman has the ability to canni all the way down and knock themselves out without dieing. <br />
<br />
Buff, buff, buff, buff some more, and keep buffing, and then rebuff and buff buff buff again without getting irritated. (the best is having to drop group and group to individually shrink fatties and cast PE on people, good lord that gets annoying shrinking 30-40 people after the 2nd or so wipeout DONT FORGET SHRINK POTIONS!!!!)<br />
<br />
The ability to remember who you have buffed so when they ask you a 2nd or 3rd time for the same buff you can kindly remind them what the icon looks like and to check it. <br />
<br />
Root parking. Gotta be good at root parking to be worth a **** as a shaman imo. <br />

Great shaman dont use modrods either!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A great shaman is, IMO, defined by his or her ability to modify their playstyle after consideration of their situation. Too many shaman get stuck in a tunnel viosion mindset whereby they wear pretty much the same gear and keep pretty much the same spells memmed whatever the makeup of their group and whatever the size of their raidforce, and regardless of the targets. Flexibility is the key</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm of similar opinion on this to Landragoran.<br />
<br />
What makes a good shaman is the same thing that makes a good player.  Someone who can think on their feet and knows not only their class, but the abilities of the classes/players with them.   Fast assessment and reactions to situations really saves the day.  Flexibility is the also the mark of any good player.<br />
<br />
BTW - <br />
I've never been able to go unconscious with canni.  :(<br />
I try and try, but I either die or regen the HPs back too fast.<br />
Do you gotta hit it at neg1 hp or what?  I tried it at neg3 and died.   I suck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">From a shamans perspective, I agree, a great one is one who knows that one of our biggest strengths is the ability to fill in gaps in a group, more or less regardless of what the gap might be.  <br />
<br />
From a melees perspective, I'd say post-39 or so, a great shaman is one who HAS SLOW MEMMED.  Ok, that's not quite all it takes, but it's definitely a requirement.  After that, basically the same as 'a shamans perspective'.  One who recognizes what needs to be done and does it, rather than one who does what he feels like and expects the other less flexible classes to take up the slack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">In my experience, level 39 melees care about dex more than slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">So true Gloriana. They are also deeply concerned about their stamina bar running out (especially if they have over 100 base stamina), and so they must have acumen right now OMG!<br />
<br />
I think a great shaman knows how to slow stuff early without dying everytime they cast it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It means 'knowing lots of words'. :P It helps for when you have to tell a rogue during a Vindi pull 'you don't #^%$ing need stamina' and you need a new word for #^%$ since you moments before told him that he also didn't #^%$ing need god &amp;*@^ primal essence and you don't want to be repetetive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">/agree Landragoran<br />
<br />
Paying attention.  <br />
Having a brain and actually (*gasp*) USING it.  <br />
Patience.  <br />
Imagination.  <br />
<br />
Being able to focus on the tasks at hand, triage things coming in, and dealing with them as appropriate.   <br />
<br />
Being able to answer folks rationally when they scream and ask you in broken dewdsp33k why you slowed the critter before giving them that critical stamina or agi buff.<br />
<br />
And pudding.  Cheese, though, is a good substitute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Originally posted by Kilorn <br />
I'm sure everyone here knows what makes a bad shaman... but in your mind, what makes a good shaman and even more, what makes a great shaman? <br />
<br />
The person behind the toon makes the character.  that, and being able to laugh when stupid stuff happens and your raid ends up taking 3x as long, or you die every other pull cause your cleric wants to save mana for the guy who isn't taking any damage.<br />
<br />
But like other people said, being patient is probably  the biggest thing, as well as knowing what should be done in situations.  Drives me nutty sometimes when I (before I had MGB) had buffed all but one group or so with focus and someone would fire off mgb.  Grumble a bit and carry on :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Most definately the shaman I will always call back when I'm playing my twinks will be the one who did what needed to be done to save the group's arse. I've seen it done by battle shaman as well as dr00d shaman, it's a level of skill that only comes with in intimate knowledge of the class and what each and every spell does, and what limits can be pushed given the necessity. <br />
<br />
To me, a great shaman isn't the one who always land slow in uber encounters. It isn't the one with the best gear. It's the one who does with what he/she has things that makes others stop and watch in awe. A great shaman is the one that diffuses a very grim situation and pulls his/her group through. <br />
<br />
Patience with raid buffing is just a part of being a shaman, it's a bot activity, it doesn't make one great or not great. JBB doesn't make one great, it just makes one more effective solo. Knowledge and the ability to apply it &gt; all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">A good shaman is all of the above.<br />
<br />
Plus a good shaman is the one that joins a group looking for a cleric/enchanter/bard/warrior/whaterver-else and an hour later they don't even notice they still don't have one.<br />
<br />
A great shaman is a good shaman; that even durring all that constant casting, clicking and dancing all around; can keep up thier part of a good conversation. ;)</div></div><hr />

As tothe original post:<br />
<br />
The ability to go above and beyond expectations and limitations of popular knowledge regarding your class.<br />
<br />
ie: If someone doesnt believe you, make them, show them, convince them, etc.  <br />
<br />
Hard mob? go solo it, go solo things that any other class would blanch at the thought of soloing.<br />
<br />
Saving the day where any one else would have called zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think Landragoran Heronwing and Gloriana said it pretty well.<br />
<br />
On raids you definitely need to have patience to deal with all the requests that wiegh on your time. I'd also add patience to deal with the people shouting, &quot;get it slowed now&quot; when the mob has already resisted 5 slows and your still waiting for the pansy ass enchanter to tash the mob =)<br />
<br />
I good memory is also a major asset for a shaman. Know what you can slow and what will turn you into mush because they are immune to slow or what can be slowed with PoI etc. <br />
<br />
Knowing how to control your aggro just so that the mob looks at you and maybe takes a swing but turns back to the tank right away. The sooner the mob is slowed the better but dead shaman with an unslowed mob is even worse than not slowed at all.<br />
<br />
I'd also add that for any class to be a truely great player you need know not only your class but other classes as well. Knowing what other classes are capable of and how to work with them only allows you to do your job even better.<br />
<br />
Finally any great player has to be someone you trust. Someone you know is going to be there when the spit hits the fan and they are going to be able to some how pull things off. Some of the most fun i've had was actually in smaller groups with fights i'm still not sure how we won.<br />
<br />
One in particular was when i was in FG with me, a lvl 60 warrior and lvl 60 rogue. We where doing the 2 shroom patches by the fungus beasts. I was doing most of the pulling so that the melees kept busy killing. I go to pull a shroom at the exact same time that the warrior decides to pull a fungus beast since they had finished the previous mob. Unfortunately the closest fungus beast was a group i had been avoiding since from the looks of them 4 of them would come together. Sure enough when he pulled he got all 4. So there we where with 4 fungus beast and 1 shroom vs the 3 of us. Since this was both guildmates we know we had a chance so we just went at it. I went crazy slowing mobs, root parking while the melees where busy trying to beat them down. Just as i was finishing off slowing the mobs both tanks hps started to get critical and dropped to the 1 bubble range. I started firing off torpors. The whole thing was a blur but in the end we end up winning even tho every one of us was below 1 bubble hps at least once and I went oom twice durring the fight.<br />
<br />
If any one of the three of us had doubted any of the others ability for even a second the best we could have hoped for there was to run to zone but since we all stood our ground and just did what needed to be done we where able to pull it off and man was it a blast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Great shaman know how to use their spells in the right situation.<br />
-Knowing how to solo a highly difficult mob like a Dragon or Lodizal or Emperor Chottal is a good start.<br />
-Knowing how to handle lots of adds while soloing is good too.  A level 60 shaman should have no difficult soloing 3 blues at once, or more if they are easy mobs.  For example, a great shaman should be able to solo 4 spiders in Velks at the same time.<br />
-in an xp group, a shaman should be able to take the place of an enchanter for the most part.  I remember in my mid 50s hunting in Karnor's and being the sole healer for our group of 5 tanks + me and being able to handle a 4 or 5 pull of mobs without too much difficulty and having no one die or run to zone.<br />
-on a raid, you should be able to handle doing buffs for a queue of people, while still watching over your group's health, and debuffing where appropriate.<br />
-quick thinking and quick acting are important</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">A couple items make me think someone is doing VERY well as a shaman, and I normally try to find at least one of them in shammies before I give them my vote to get into the guild (though we aren't exactly the most exclusive around)<br />
<br />
1) you really don't give a flip if you die.   Sure, you'll check for the best rez you can, but you won't whine over it.<br />
<br />
2) Not only do you not care if you die, but you go for revenge the moment you do.  Trying every trick in your book before calling the mob unbeatable by you (and with how many tricks we have, you die a few times or have close calls with Gate)<br />
<br />
3) You know when you really can't win.<br />
<br />
4) You have used every spell you have ever written effectively (Imbue ivory and the summon food spells are the only ones that don't apply directly to our battle.   If you have, and still do, used blind, Rage line, and the AE rain when appropriate, you are well on the way)<br />
<br />
5) Quested / rare gear that gives you an edge.  I know you may thinl gear doesn't make the man/woman.  But you said GREAT, not just good.   You can be good on your own, but to be great, you have to be dedicated, and that means finding extra tricks.  a DA idol, the free pet tooth, snare webs, anything that will give you an extra edge shows thought.  And if it is rare/quested, it shows dedication<br />
<br />
6) Ability to fill in the gaps for any one of the &quot;Holy Trinity.&quot;  That means being able to tank (including keeping taunt), being able to be main healer (without slacking on slows or buffs), and being a master at root parking.<br />
<br />
7) backing up every class you do have, while playing every class you don't have.   Just cause you are root crowd controlling doesn't mean you take heal off mem or stop buffing<br />
<br />
8) maximizing groups.   You don't jsut exp grind.  you find the way to make mana last longer.   Totally remove med time, expand your camps reach and get more exp.   That means finding out which buffs you don't need, and convincing people that you shouldn't cast them.   Finding who to have tank, and when (if you use regrowth of Dar'Khura, then the cleric is wasting group mana every second he is FH.   Having him tank at just the right times, for the proper duration means less med time later.    An SK that goes 2 hours without using HT is a flaw, unless you need the security in reserve.  A cleric that goes 2 refreshes of DA is a waste as well.<br />
  It is all well and good to just grind away when with random people you don't know, but when with friends and guildies, no time shoudl be wasted unless you have cleared every exp mob you can possibly reach.<br />
<br />
9) Equiping your TEAM.  It is all well and good for you to be decked to the heavens.  But your normal exp group should also be getting upgrades.  If they can't do it themselves, you should be willing to assist since it furthers your own exp and capabilities.   Consider it investing in later quests.<br />
<br />
10)  Presence.  You have to be out and known.   If you don't let people see that you are capable, they won't listen when you know the only way to survive something.  I don't mean brag, I just mean that you don't become a &quot;yes man&quot; and do what everyone else asks of you.  Make sure people know that you are driving at a better gaming ability than that which is known to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">You have to have the courage to die.  Unless the monk(or SK or whatever) dies on the pull, the first person to die will almost always be you in a raid, and very often even in a group.  People will be healing the main tank, but will figure that since you have torpor, you're invincible.  Of course, you can't cast torpor on yourself WHILE slowing(though you can cast it before), and torpor doesn't heal enough hitpoints fast enough to save your life against really tough mobs a lot of the time anyway, but most people don't really think far enough ahead to realize that. <br />
<br />
So knowing that, you have to be willing to step up to the plate and take a chance on dying.<br />
<br />
I've seen a fair number of high level experienced shamans who wait a long time before slowing, same like I see chanters who wait forever to tash, because they're scared of dying.  Many of them are the people who took bad advice from (usually melee class) friends, who think of shamans as pure casters and tell them to forget hitpoints and AC, wisdom items are the ticket.  So the shamans become so weak that they are terrified to get in the thick of things.  So...they let the other shaman around do the dying.  Not that a shaman who has the proper AC/HP gear is near as likely to die but....<br />
<br />
Besides courage, you need to be adaptable.  If the chanter dies and you need fast damage on multiple mobs who are now unmezzed, could you break out the rain spell?  Can you tell from watching the way things are going where the cleric tends to focus -- ignoring caster health maybe even when he has plenty of mana, so you have to pick up the slack?  If you have a mage in your group, how about torporing him so he can be a spell-casting maniac with his mod-rods?<br />
<br />
And you need to keep in mind the old stand-bys, like keeping the chanter healed so he can save all your butts, remember how thin his margin of safety can be.  In the middle of all your hassles and /tells, you have to keep your head, and remember not just to keep up with your own responsibilities, but to pick up the slack from people who forget theirs.  <br />
<br />
Which sometimes means flat out ignoring the requests and cajoling and commands and extraneous blather and just getting the job done.  You need the ability to compartmentalize and actively focus.  You can't just hit auto-attack and go get a soda.  <br />

The great thing about being a jack-of-all trades class is that you have all kinds of opportunities to shine, if you play the game alertly.  Maybe not every day, but you can pull a lot of miracles out of your arse if you apply yourself.  Or, you can just try to be incredibly efficient.  Considering the amazing amount of mana we can put out, we have many opportunities to crank up kill rates and make people feel safe, too.<br />

He can make them feel good about themselves, maybe without them even realizing why they're suddenly so powerful today.  He can make them feel good about the TEAM.  And say, man, we gotta come back and do this again!</div></div><hr />
