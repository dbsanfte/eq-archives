<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thanks to some help from some close friends this weekend, finished my cudgle. Many thanks to Champions of Cabillis and all the helpful posts here at The Crucible - blows me away that people can work together across servers to figure these quests out. Thanks. <br />
<br />
Here's my take on the final fight. First of all, the Iksar Apparition is an 8 hour spawn. We killed him earlier in the day while exploring the south wing looking for the stage. No faction hit. <br />
<br />
Once you are ready for the final fight, head thru the fake wall that leads to the stage room. Set up shop about halfway though it. I suggest clearing that room out at this point. Make sure you do the pulling  (or someone iksar) so as not to agro the handin guy. Once room is clear, do the handin, and take a few steps back, watch the show. Just stay back from the stage, make all the non iksar hang back. They can move up just enough to see whats going on and still not agro Rile or VS. Once the fight begins either 4 or 6 Iksar skeletons pop and observe the fight. These guys are pretty high level, 54 or 55 for sure, and they have a ton of HP, and have to be GoK'd if I remember correctly. <br />
<br />
My group makeup was 60 monk. 60 monk 60 chanter, 60 cleric, 60 necro and me. One of the only *MUSTS* i'd say for this fight would be a damn good enchanter. <br />
<br />
Eventually VS kills rile and becomes targetable. As it was suggested to me, inch up until you can pull VS with malo, you'll get 2 of the big skelly dude adds, have the chanter take care of those, tash VS, and slow him. Once slowed its total cake, we waxed him very very easily, it wasnt even close. Unfortunatly I didnt clear the room of the normal trash before I did the turn in, so I had to pull most of the rest of the room once VS was dead, keeping the chanter very buzy. While The Spirit of Rile is waiting for you to go turn your 7th cudgle and vs's head in, the skelly guards will repop, so go ahead and pull them all when you are ready. While the group had them occupied, i ran up and did the turn in, and went back to help kill the rest. <br />
<br />
Glad to finally be done with the quest, its a rockin range item. Only thing I dont like about carnage, is that it doesnt last very long and the 15 sec cast time, I found myself having to click it, ALOT to keep it on tanks when playing around with it this weekend. :D owell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">grats krak!<br />
failed my first attempt, just did vsr again so soon as i get my group together were ganna try again.<br />
one question tho...you say you got tho the set up hall and killed all the normal mobs. do all the mobs repop before thescript is over? that's kinda what happened to me last time, all the regular mobs repopped before venril became targetable. (without a chanter we all died swiftly) is there enough time to clear the room &amp; do the turn-in so VS will become targetable before repops occur?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually I did the turnin with a full room pop, I suggest you kill them all before doing the turnin. The script takes about 10ish mins to make VS targetable, and IIRC HS is on a 21 min repop timer ( not positive about that ). So yeah, with a solid group you should have no problem at all clearing the room before repops.<br />
<br />
Bring a good enchanter!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">awesome, thanks for the info<br />
