<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gildana.</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I am here to ask a question about where in Planes of Power we should level:<br />
<br />
62 Magician<br />
56 Cleric<br />
57 Shaman<br />
<br />
We are looking to level me to level 60 quickly because I have Torpor in the bank waiting to be scribed. We don't enjoy finding groups so we would like a place the three of us could level quickly. I have never killed in Planes of Power and not sure what to expect XP wise. The only place that came to mind was Plane of Disease. Is there any suggestions of zones to level. If you do supply a zone name, please also supply what mobs to kill and what part of the zone. Thank you in advance if anyone is to reply to my plea. I will be searching through the 50-60 and 60-65 forums for possible ideas thank you.</div></div><hr />

hmm then tell ur friend to do trial for PoV/PoS (the mag) and then lvl the clr and shm to up to 60/61 and then do the trial...<br />
<br />
but to get up to 60, just do PoN its good<br />
