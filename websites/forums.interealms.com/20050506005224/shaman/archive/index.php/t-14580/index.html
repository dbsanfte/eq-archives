which one will you chose ?<br />

I used the search function but i didnt find many advice on shaman/beastlord combo. i should have precised that in the first post.<br />
<br />
I knew that SK/shaman was a good one just would have liked some posts about the viability of the beastlord/shaman one compared to SK/shaman.<br />
<br />
I think that with beastlord i will kill mob faster but then i will prolly have to fight non caster mob since the casters will drop the HP of the beastlord too fast. <br />
More hp and the snare built in the SK will make dungeon treks easier ( dont have to use the snare necklace ) but the killing rate will be slower.<br />

But i would like some advice from someone who played this combo and the viability in the end game.<br />

But i dont think a BL could handle tier 2 tho because the only pet heal i have right now does 1250 and thats not gunna keep up with the dmg of the mobs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personal opinion only here, I think an SK would make a better partner.<br />
<br />
Until you hit into the higher levels for paragon, spiritual dominion, etc, the utility of a BL is that of a lower level shaman. SKs abilities in the pulling department (FD, snare, fear), better AC and hitpoints, HT and a pet (albeit a weak one). SK is just more appealing than a BL as a partner because it brings more to the table of what a shaman doesn't have instead of having a weaker backup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Snare, FD pulling, better mitigation, ability to get agro back instantly if needed, I am sure there are more but that is more than enough....heck snare is enough for me.<br />
<br />
Besides we share quite a bit of utility with the Beastlord....a lot of that would be wasted....or at least less useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">beastlord all the way, pet classes rock... why bother with an sk when you can have the dps of a bst pet, bst, and obviously you and dogdog</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thank you for asking your question in a clear and unambivilent manner.<br />
<br />
    Well-played beastlords and shamans both require a considerable amount of hands-on management, so if you're twoboxing, its gonna be real hard to get the most out of both toons.  The same is not true re: the SK and shaman duo.<br />
<br />
   With an SK/Shaman setup it goes something like this:   <br />
<br />
SK pulls mob with snare, then switches to shaman.  <br />
<br />
Mob walks in slowly.  <br />
<br />
Shaman hits the autoslow macro (which halfway through tells the pet <br />
to attack) and then jumps back to the SK.<br />
<br />
SK starts getting serious about building aggro, getting all those debuffs/taps in, fixing pet positioning, etc., and then moves back to the shaman.<br />
<br />
  And thats it.  Back to the shaman for the rest of the fight to dot, nuke, canni, heal, etc, unless some wierd **** happens requireing you to have the SK do something different, or if you get bored by not really playing the SK much in reality.  I spend my time aabout 50/50 for that reason.  The point is, the option to slack some (or, to not go crazy) without losing signifigant DPS is there for you in a way it can't be for the Beastlord/Shaman arrangement.<br />
<br />
     There are many, many other issues that you didn't ask about re: why the SK is the superior partner.  Some are valid, most not.  I think, sometimes, that most of what's sayable on that particular topic has already been said, and can be found through the search function, as the harpies mentioned earlier.  Don't let that stop you from asking questions here though.  Zones, abilities, and game mechanics change constantly, so telling people to use search can be iffy, especially if the quesrion is somewhat subtle or otherwise unusual.  Also you tend to get more info from live (current)discussions than from reading reams of possibly outdated and/or irrelevant posts.<br />
<br />
        Good luck with the twoboxing, it really rocks.  <br />
<br />
            Oh, and Go-Go Fatty powah!  :) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not that I'm Biased or anything...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Shaman Paladin works. Requires more work for twoboxing but a paladin can keep aggro and keep one healed while doing the slow/malo stuff. (this is based on grouping with my two paladin friends, so this is not when 2-boxing).<br />
<br />
Or you could pull with shaman, and slow like when soloing and then use paladin stuns to switch aggro.<br />
<br />
On the other hand i never tried SK so i cant tell if its good but i have heard many people say so.<br />
<br />
Since your choice is limited id go for SK. Just wanted to say i like paladin partners.<br />
<br />
Theres a dude in my guild who is very sucessful in 3-boxing Shaman, Ranger and Pally :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Depends on how high level you want to go.  If you are duoing in PoP, you are going to be a lot less effective with a bazaar equipped beastlord tanking vs a bazaar equipped shadowknight, no question.  The SK also brings the aggro kite option with snare.  <br />
<br />
The big plus for the BL is excellent DPS, but you don't do any DPS when you are dead.<br />
<br />
If you have no desire to play up to the PoP levels, tankability is not nearly as big a concern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm currently leveling a monk up to 2-box.  Got him from a buddy in the mid-30's who quit.  He's OK thus far (mid 40's),with a 51 Shaman. Since I'm really casual I'm not too worried 'bout the high-end problems monks seems to have.  Who knows SOE may implement a melee fix before I die!<br />
<br />
2-boxing 2 casters and pets is waaay too much work for me.<br />
<br />
Starting over, I'd probably do an SK, FD is great when the $#@% hits the fan, and I get that beer confusion thing going.  <br />
<br />
Plate/snare/aggro/FD seems pretty hard to beat.  Actually have a baby (lvl8) gnome SK/cleric 2 box going for giggles.<br />
<br />
Oh, ignore the **** stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>anigelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I myself have been duoing with a friend of mine that has a Beastlord. I am 58 froggy shammy and he is 54 lizard beastlord. We have been hunting in AC for about a week off and on, and the AA and loot has been rolling in. This combo works really well. Hope this helps you in some way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i Would Use Search !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">SK - for these reasons<br />
<br />
Snare/Dot generates more aggro than slow, and usually more than Malos and Slow = Shaman rarely gets hit on the incoming.  Probably not a big deal pre-PoP.  However, one session in PoV or BoT will show you why having that big aggro spell (SK's) on the incoming is a good thing. <br />
<br />
Snare is great for dungeon crawls to keep the bastages from running away.  All you have to do is worry about gaters then.  Yes, we have root and VP.  Snare = they turn and stop fighting at about 15-20% health.<br />
<br />
Large race SK's also have slam, which allows you to interrupt casting wielding a 2h'er.<br />
<br />
Large Race SK - all the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give it a rest Yodel - maybe they just want the most up to date info or maybe they don't know how to use search...either way, if you don't care about the thread, don't respond.  (see my earlier response for my &quot;on topic&quot; reply)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I can't believe how viscious some shamans have become to people posting these types of questions. I know we get them all the time, but if you dont want to help them out just dont post anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">1).  Shadowknight/Shaman is unbelievable.  An epic partnership.  If you are dead set on using a shaman, use a shadowknight, hands down.<br />
If you really want to use a beastlord, get a druid.  Beastlord/Druid and Shaman/Shadowknight are two of the best damn combos in the game.<br />
<br />
2).  Use search.  +reputation for all who told him to use search =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">SK is a monster and very fun, with a very different playstyle than shaman, so he's great to just play as a single when you just don't feel up to cannibalizing for hours that day.  And of course with a shaman he's a perfect partner, having two of the best spells that are used with real frequency in the game, FD and snare.  A SK can also levitate himself, invis, invis to undead, regen your mana and health, comes built-in with his own mana regen type spell that winds up better than KEI(pact of hate, skelly form)...he's just a superb all around toon.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't take others words on macros too much.  Make your own and change them according to your needs.  I have no need for macroing my shaman/SK combo.  I like the control of choosing exactly when spells fire off in the very moment, myself.<br />
<br />
Work up different spell sets, though. Lavish some attention there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Shadowknight brings pretty much everything missing from a shaman.  Fd, snare, superb aggro management.  Basically, just re-read flufy's post :D<br />
Better dps on a beastlord, but your abilities overlap so much, you're loosing somwhat.  Basically you can do anything with your shaman alone you can do with shaman/bst boxing.  You just do it faster with a beastlord.  Sk adds some flexibility to the mix, but will grind xp a touch slower.<br />
Of course, if you want to use a beastlord, druids make a great complement.</div></div><hr />
