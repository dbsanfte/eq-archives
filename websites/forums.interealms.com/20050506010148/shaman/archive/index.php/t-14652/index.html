<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drakaeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hiya guys, I'm looking to make some good money to upgrade the gear on my monk and shaman combo.  I was thinking the fungi camp in seb or boots of flowing slime camp in CT would be a good place but not sure if I could handle it, I've only been to seb once and never been to CT.  I have their magelo profiles up to date below.  Also, if you have any suggestions of other camps I could do I'm all ears.  I tried the search function but got errors every time I tried to open the threads I searched for.  Sorry if a similar post has been posted before.<br />
<br />
***edit***<br />
Shaman doesn't have any of his 59 spells.  No torpor or malo etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">torpor &amp; malo are both lvl 60 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drakaeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know that, was saying those in addition to the 59 ones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kristofos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pog would work for cash making.  Probably better than holding a camp waiting for an item to drop that you then have to sell to a player.<br />
<br />
Easily make 3 to 5 k in a couple of hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You could farm alot of cash in Seb, but im not sure if you could do the King camp.  Tough without snare.  The booties in CT may be possible if you dont get hurt too bad in resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sounds like Sebs would be good if you can get a good camp where a lot of gems drop. PoG is supposedly somewhat tougher since the protectors are back to having zonewide aggro again. hmmm.. Mobs in Crypt of Nadox seemed to drop a fair amount of vendor loot (weapons/gems) when I was doing the blood of nadox quest. Not sure of the item drops, but I was easily making a few hundred pp per hour and I was fairly timid at first as I knew nothing about the zone when I started the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your gonna have a hard time breaking the camp in ct, say nothing about holding it. Did this camp once, was me dual comping my 56 druid and 55 warrior at the time witha  63 epic cleric, a 62 warrior, a 64 mage and a 61 chanter. Took us 3 trys to break camp, but once it was broken all was good. The slimes are a major pain in the ass, seemed like they had a ton of hps and pretty good dps. Maybe ya can take it when your both 65, but at your current levels I doubt it. <br />
Your best bet is probably the bugs camp in OS. can get lammies there, some diamonds/blue diamonds, seen an ods drop there etc. Also if your non kos to dragons in west wastes maybe ya can get a few upgrades/drops from some of those. No torpor sucks but I'm sure you could handle a few of the easier ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drakaeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I figured both camps would pretty much be rough, thanks for confirming it for me :)  Looks like straight cash camps are gonna be the way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">stolastorv, you should really find another chanter lol! I did the camp duo with a chanter and he did it too with a cleric (chanter pet tanking)...<br />
<br />
pacify works fine there to single pull, you just have to find out how to use it :pppp<br />
indeed, if you are out of the water, you cannot cast on a mob in the water...<br />
<br />
hint: if you are in the water, you can cast on mobs in the water :pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Definitely don't do the King camp in Seb for cash.  While the payoff is good should you happen to be lucky enough to win the Tunic, the chance of it showing is pretty weak.<br />
<br />
Other camps in Seb are exceptional for cash, including Necro jail and Necrosis.  Juggs might be a good alternative as well, but I have never hunted there for cash personally.<br />
<br />
Good luck :).</div></div><hr />
