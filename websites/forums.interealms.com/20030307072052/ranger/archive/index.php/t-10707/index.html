<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shenlong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Now for the explanation.  Most Rangers want a class defining ability, most Rangers want that ability to involve archery (from what I've read).  Considering the amount of spells they add with each expansion, this seems to be the easiest thing to do, add spells.  This would give Rangers a reason to use archery before 50+.  This would make us the hands down best archers in the game, even before lvl 50.  The reason I recommend the mana cost and duration of these buffs is because this would be our class defining ability, it shouldn't be a hassle to keep them up.  I don't think it would unbalance us, think about it.  The Arrow spells end up being only 1 higher than our damage bonus to our main hand at the last spell.  At any given level, we would have to choose between a slightly higher archery only haste, or a slightly lower haste from an Enchanter that will affect melee also.  I'm only level 40 at the moment, so I haven't included anything above 49.  Well, any feedback will be appreciated.  I have thought about sending this to Verant, but I don't know how to, and I wanted to get some feedback from other Rangers first anyways.  Thanks for reading this :) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shenlong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So I guess this is just a bad idea...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lenas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a good idea.<br />
<br />
But, I think that adding any more than 5 &quot;&lt;i&gt;bane&lt;/i&gt;&quot; damage innately to arrows would seem overpowered by verant.  If you took that 9 fire dmg ~in your lvl 49 spell description~  that could make some arrows (blessed mithril champ arrows) up to 20 damage, and that would = insane damage output.<br />
<br />
VI wouldn't go along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foxx Firethorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heyo,<br />
<br />
Actually I like the idea of spells to add fire dmg or whatnot to our bow. The line of spells we have include fire, so I dont think cold dmg would run along that idea. Maybe something like a call of earth for bows spell too, charging your bow temporarily with a random chance to proc some not too powerfull effect. <br />
<br />
The only things I think is of your spells is the mana cost is too low, and the duration is abit too long, and perhaps make them require some spell component (fire emerald or whatever)? As for the haste, its not a bad idea, but the way you put it is just waay to powerfull combined with quiver haste to get from a spell. Either it could be alot less powerfull, or a disc.<br />
<br />
I do agree, for the small improvement on Trueshot to Raincaller they should make it abit easier to get. You can get a Trueshot bow about the time you finish your Trueshot armor, so they should make it attainable about the time you can finish Ivy-etched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sionach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I like these ideas alot - I think it'd be really nice to have Archery be viable throughout a Ranger's career, rather than just in the endgame.<br />
<br />
Also, the Blessed Mithril Champion Arrow already has 4 Fire Damage on it, right, so just make the elemental damage non-stackable . . . if the item has an effect, the spell doesn't do anything.  As for it being overpowered, nine damage on the final spell might be a bit high, but it would be situational - a lot of mobs would resist that damage partially or completely (we're pretending elemental damage isn't currently broken ;) ).<br />
<br />
Ranger Archery cap should already be 252, imho, especially since we get so many Archery based skills and spells.<br />
<br />
As far as the Raincaller - honestly, I never bothered with it because it's basically just a Trueshot with stats and I could get a better dropped bow.  What I'd like to see is Ranger-only Fletching instead that ALL races can do (instead of the current Wood-Elf bias, and yes, I'm a Wood Elf, but I still think everyone should be able to have some fun ;) ).<br />
<br />
BTW - I totally agree about the 2hr buff duration . . . I have never understood why it's &quot;overpowering&quot; to not have to cast the same buff 3 times an hour.  :p<br />
<br />
If you decide to send this off to Verant, be prepared for the fact that they will likely ignore much of it.  :(  Sometime down the line, you may see some of the ideas implemented, but Verant doesn't seem to be much for taking this type of input from customers.  /sigh  Anyhow, go here (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_feedback.jsp) and log in to submit your ideas to Verant.  Good luck!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>leeda_goodlife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">5 mana for a 2 hour buff?<br />
<br />
35 mana for 10 minutes is a lot more likely.  or, have the duration scale with level.  or perhaps more along the mana cost/duration of call of earth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Korkrest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Archery only haste sounds all good, you need realism added though.<br />
First of all, no haste spell will ever get a duration of 2 hours, 30mins tops.<br />
secondly mana: a realistic cost of the last line of these spells is around 150-200mana.<br />
Other then that, nice ideas :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yea its really a good idear ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">good idea, but I would expect mana cost to scale up per level to around 100ish, and the buff lasting 2 minutes to 5 minutes. 5 minutes is a long time. having the haste spell last 2 minutes would be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blaiz Wildarrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dont think verant would go along with the bane dmg thingys, but i would think they could afford to pop in a few of those haste spells or maybe add them to our archery buffing spells we have already, ex. hawk eye could be plus 10% archery and 10% haste, dont get your hopes up though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Colphax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmmm, I shudder to think of what the archery haste spells would have done to my bank account before I got my Tolan's Bracer :P<br />
<br />
Otherwise some nice ideas that could make Archery viable before 55 bazillion AA points, although I do think the duration and manna expense would need some balancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shenlong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thanks for all the replies :D !  I plan on posting a revised version of this, and hope to send it to Verant after I make sure its balanced.  At least if it's balanced I figure I'll have a 2% chance of being heard, instead of the normal 1% :) .<br />
<br />
p.s.  The mana cost and duration were only like that because I would be considering it our &quot;class-defining ability&quot; so to speak.  But I'll change 'em anways, cause I doubt Verant would care.</div></div><hr />
