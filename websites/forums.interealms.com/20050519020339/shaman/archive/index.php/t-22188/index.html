<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been spending a little time in GoD. Duoing with my Shaman and SK Bot. I can't get any guild groups intrested here however. I remember reading a very good info nugget on GoD zones. <br />
<br />
I want to try and get some folks intrested but due to the nature of the zones and the lack of intrest from my guild it would save me a ton of time to actually know some things to go up against. Does anyone have a link to that post? <br />
<br />
I tried a search or three but it was in the middle of another post. And I for some reason think it was from Blazz or Grizlor but searching so far has been fruitless.<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance. And heck Ill thank yah afterwords as well. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ummm someone posted something about a good spot in the 60 to 65 hunting grounds forum. think it was in an areana or somethign should still be near thetop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it was in one of the threads that degenerated into a &quot;raider vs non-raider&quot; debate, but of course, that doesnt narrow it down much. I remember the one you are reffering too though, I will look. It had a bunch of links to 1-groupable Gates gear that was pretty decent, better than Ornate in most cases, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yah That is the one I belive.<br />
<br />
And i still feel like some major stuff needs to be done to lessen the gap tween raider and non raider. Playing in GoD just amplifies that feeling.<br />
<br />
But at the end of the day EQ aint gonna change The people running the show have no real reason to change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for looking for it Blazz. I am gonna poke around again and see if I can find it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">No luck man, I cant remember who posted it, either. I scanned some of the threads, but it didnt stand out. <br />
<br />
Certainly not going to argue about the gap. More and more I am becoming convinced that its one of the biggest problems in EQ. There is such a huge difference between a 65 with 50 aa in Bazaar gear vs Time gear. I mean, a HUGE difference. <br />
<br />
I will keep looking as I think about it though, I want some of that info too. It was a good post, I remember bumping the guy. I think he had stuff for about 10+ slots with 75/75+ doable with one group of Bazaar geared people in Gates. Just cant think of a good keyword anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Use the CP and look through your old posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh, another thing I wanted to mention, Snoww. I was chatting with some friends in a guild that just broke into the EPs on my server. They were remarking what a blast they were having doing &quot;tough&quot; mobs like the Birds and General in Fire. How fun the encounters were, how even dying was a blast. This just pointed out to me how the gap kills EQ. Once you have gear that is 75-125% better than any &quot;non-raider&quot;, the encounters become so trivial that they cease to be fun. Sure, there are other encounters that are challanging when you get to that level, but not enough to satisfy. My guild ends up doing so many &quot;raids&quot; that remind me of LDoN normal. Heck, LDoN Hard has even lost a lot of its &quot;fun factor&quot; appeal, we did one yesterday in 35-40 minutes, collect 26, never left the first room, with a bard pulling and an 11K warrior tanking. It was so bad (disgustingly trivial) that the warrior remarked half-way through on a mob I didnt land slow on right away &quot;Wow this one hits like a Hard, where did you find him&quot;. See, he didnt even realize it was a Hard adventure til then, LOL. This is not some attempt to blow my own horn, just pointing out that once content becomes trivial, it loses so much of its &quot;fun factor&quot; appeal.<br />
<br />
Dumbing down content isnt the solution either. SInce the changes to Vxed/Tipt to make them more accessible to &quot;lesser geared&quot; players, BARDS in my guild are SOLOING Vxed. Not kidding. People sit outside, wait til he solos 50 mobs, zone in, and bard-speed run/fade up to the Hail mob, then just die if they cant get gate off. The happy medium is more and more difficult to achieve when the gear disparity is so large. <br />
<br />
Sorry bro, didnt mean to de-rail your thread, but I wanted to mention that in a spot I knew you would read it. Maybe I will take a few negative hits and start a &quot;See what happens when nerf content to apease the masses&quot; thread. If anyone starts in on this de-rail here, I will. In the meantime, I am still hunting for that thread, for both of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Use the CP and look through your old posts.<br />
Dude, heh, any idea how many posts I have made in the past 3 months? Probably 80% of my total. Some threads are almost half me, backed into a corner with 5 or 6 guys letting me have it for one thing or another, and me blasting back every other post, heh. I will try it though. <br />
<br />
Wish I could remember WHO said it, then I could search his posts. Was a Time-level shaman who plays with casual friends and helps them camp gear. His posts were solid and well written. He provided links to the gear he spoke of, and in most cases zone locations as well. I am fairly sure it was in a 5+ page thread, too, so that would narrow it down a bit as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Use the search feature on this board for Riwwi Arena.  As stated this link is for a necro but pretty well layed out. http://web.syr.edu/~tjmyers/platfarm/riwwi.html</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Blazz,<br />
<br />
I know that the overabundance of gear has hurt EQ alot. It is a classic Monty Haul game now. (Old DnD term for games that have spiraled out of control into sillyness almost.)<br />
<br />
But In Dnd. You could take your charecters to another GM. Or start a new game with the rules you like. &quot;We are sadly in thier world now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I enjoy challange. I really enjoy a diffacult fight I mean why else would I play a shaman that at one time (Karnors era) Would pull, crowd control, tank and main heal often. I tend to run my groups ragged, because I am normally the puller and every now and again I pull beyond our level of a fight just to see what would happen. (And die so much it aint funny)<br />
<br />
But when your margin of error is so small now due to gear shortcomings compared to content changes and revisions it is less fun than even overpowering stuff. You always if overpowered have the option of pulling more to make it intresting. But you when undergeared can't pull less than 1. <br />
<br />
You know my stance on things. Multiple paths to items gear content and flags/Encounters. One method is simply poor planning. Or a lack of caring or too tight of a budget. <br />
<br />
EQ is certainly a fantastic game. The best I have ever played. But the luster is gone now. And gameplay is what would keep people playing and they lack that now for the people below the glass ceiling. I am going to try GoD with more regularity. And I hope I can carve a niche out. But the game itself needs serious TLC, and Rytan and people who can't make the changes that are needed to impact the game are now just a liability. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I do not see any problem with mudflation as such. You can still find challenging but doable encounters at any combination of levels / AAs and gear. Just as you always could have the GM throw tougher encounters at you in DnD.<br />
<br />
What is a problem is such things as the lacking one-group flagging options in PoP, buying a new expansion and finding out you will not be able to do much in it until you spent another half year in LDoN and so on.<br />
<br />
Raid content is simply a much smoother progression then single group content is. You have very rewarding content here and there (BoT, GoD trials) and nothing to bridge the gaps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yay!<br />
<br />
I found it. Or at least part of it. Post 222 By Shabura Naarteban Page 6 of this Post Good God Info  (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=21676&amp;mode=linear&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=6) <br />
<br />
Yay And thank you Shabura! <br />
<br />
Also folks read this post again after a good month of cool down time from the typing. I know I am biased becasue of my part in many of the arguments, but this one seriest of threads is a gold mine for ANY developer of MMORPGS. It is a shame EQ doesnt do anything with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />
