<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zolina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">According to Lucy, all the spells that used to be instant recast, including heals, now have a 2.2 second recast time.  I sure hope this doesn't go live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Legenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Those spells never were instant recast. What Lucy is showing us merely seems to be a different representation for what is already in practice anyway. Also see:<br />

It takes 2.2 seconds for your spell gem to refresh after ANY spell is cast so changing 0 recast times to 2.2 seconds isn't going to make 1 bit of difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">will this affect Tri Plated Golden Hackle Hammer much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jooneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Does this affect casting spells right after memorizing them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lendien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">IF this is including items, no more instant click haste from dark cloak of sky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ditopher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I seriously doubt that it would affect items... in fact it would affect so many it's just unreasonable. I'm pretty sure this applies only to spellbook spells being casted, and it's not a nerf of any kind, I think it's just to cover the spell recovery time so there's not more of that, &quot;spell recovery time not met&quot; message when you chain cast quick spells like minor heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ulaian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It is probably to prevent people from using an instaclick item to refresh spell gems earlier than they would naturally. Now, after you cast a spell, you have to wait 2.2 seconds before casting any other spell since that is the time it takes for spell gems to refresh. But if you use an instaclick item, all spell gems that don't have a recast associated with them refresh immediately and without delay, meaning you can cast, click an instacast item as soon as spell finishes, and then cast again with no delay.</div></div><hr />
