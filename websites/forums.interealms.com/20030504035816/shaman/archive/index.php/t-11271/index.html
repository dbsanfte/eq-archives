<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail fellow shaman!<br />
<br />
I frequently duo with a monk, or sometimes group in teir 1 pop.  I am unguilded and do not really raid (that wont change for a few months at least i imagine).  I plan to work on AA's after hitting 60 in order to maximize playable content for myself and my monk partner.  I recently got a decent deal on torpor (45k) and am wondering what my spell priorities should be after that.  I am not rich, and expect to have no more than 50k (probably more like 35) to spend on spells initially.  I have jbb, horse, no epic.<br />
<br />
Based on my play style, what spells should be my next priority to acquire?  Prices on my server (when available)<br />
Malo 35-60k<br />
Pox 10-25k<br />
VoB ~5k<br />
Avatar ~ 5k<br />
<br />
I am really kind of clueless which to make a priority now.  I am concerned that Pox will be to slow to be mana effective, Malo is too slow casting and mana costly, and of minimal value, on mobs I would hunt at level 60 for exp, that the component cost for avatar is too high to be used routinely (144pp an hour to keep it up!), and that I rarely melee so value of VoB is questionable.  <br />
<br />
Heck - I wonder even if stoicism would be a suitable enought substitute for torpor to incline me to sell torpor (not really tho hehe).<br />
<br />
Which, if any of these, should be my priority?  Thanks all for your input :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malo. I know, most people think it's just a raiding spell, but I use it every day, whether exp'ing or raiding. If you're hunting in PoP zones and get a bounced slow, it can hurt.. BIGtime. ;) By casting malo on the incoming and slow as the mob gets to the camp, I almost never get a resist. Since you have torpor, you shouldn't be hurting too much for mana by casting malo, especially if you have a horse on top of that. I would like to have Pox, but get by without it. I would like to have Avatar (well, primal avatar -- I'm too poor to use regular Avatar) but get by without it also. However, I would be much less confident in my ability to slow mobs consistently, without malo (esp as I am not level 65 yet). Besides, malo will not only help you land slows more consistently, but it'll help the other casters in your group and make roots/snares more reliable. Malo is pricey, but if you have the cash to get it, you won't regret it. Just my opinion. Your mileage may vary. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Malo. for the exact reasons Donar already mentioned. being resisted a couple times can be death in the PoP tier2+ zones. Malo really really helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For your playstyle, go with malo and pox.  Use pox when soloing PoP mobs and even duo with the monk.  Once you have malo, you will use it on every PoP mob you fight :)<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
VoB, Avatar - nearly useless :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what donar said~<br />
<br />
Malo. I know, most people think it's just a raiding spell, but I use it every day, whether exp'ing or raiding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Malo, Malo, er what's the name of it ? Oh yeah Malo.<br />
<br />
I think everyone will agree that all the others are situational use spells. Where as Malo is truly game changing. You can use it all day every day.<br />
<br />
I got lucky and looted Malo at 57 and was a major reason for hitting 60 quickly.<br />
Malo turns the game around so much once you have it, it's insane.<br />
We all get the occaisional bounce on a slow sometimes and that bounce can be quite nerve wracking. Malo is like a big cuddly security blanket. Love it, hug it, use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Malo is great, and I use it on most everything I fight.  The one key thing a Shaman must do in a group or solo is get the mob quickly and reliably slowed, and Malo gives a lot of safety and predictability to that process.  Malo on incoming, no agro from Malo, then first slow almost always lands.  Easy for the cleric to get into a rhythm knowing slow is going to land.  And lets face it, the most common cause of death for a shaman in an exp group is the mob that is overagroed by multiple resisted slows.<br />
<br />
Solo, it is really helpful to have already landed a PR debuff because resisting Bane is all too common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Malo.  Same reasons.<br />
<br />
I'd say my 2nd most used spell from your list is Voice of the Berserker.  Nothing like 30 points of stackable AC.  I have it on ALL the time when I'm hunting, and frequently when I'm traveling a goodly ways.  I love seeing things swing and miss, and with my gear... I need all the oomph I can get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">PoP, PoP, PoP....bleh...there are more zones than PoP...A lot more...<br />
<br />
IMHO, the importance of spells are this as follows below--and if you get to choose which one you are able to get first...man, I really wish I were in your shoes---take spells as you can get them...they don't last long in the bazaar on my server...and the emporer in Seb nor any of the kunark dragons have ever taken any of my requests, SO if you could choose then  --&gt;  Torpor -&gt; Malo -&gt; Pox<br />
<br />
<br />
Malo is nice, but it isn't like this is a brand new &quot;line&quot; of spell.  Malosini works very well until you are able to find malo.  Only thing you can say about malo is that it is unresistable...so that may save you a little mana on the more resistant mobs...very very nice, but not phenomenal...because it isn't useful in every zone / situation...where I have seen Malo to really count is on Zek servers.  That's right...PvP...sigh...dying as it may be.<br />
<br />
Torpor will change you playstyle period.  I don't own a horse and I never sit down to med unless the cleric calls for a break.  I never run out of mana..and I use to be a huge KEI Crack Head...I no longer buy crack, and saving this money is going to pay for the Torpor spell I bought in just a few short months....You will be much more effective...you will be able to solo higher level mobs...you will use this spell in every zone /situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pox ---well what to say...its nice damage...SE please give us more of these type of spells...we are deserving...currently I myself don't see a huge push to level over 60/61 on a Zek server...we need more dots and much better DD's...</div></div><hr />
