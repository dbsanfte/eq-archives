<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, after 4 hours, and the 4th spectral courier, I got the student's log. Great. I also have 4 of the other required items. However, the first report, the &quot;personal diary page&quot; just did not drop, at all. Just a bad streak, or is this one rarer than the rest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rissell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A group of guildies and I (50 - 55) spent a while in CoM just xp'ing and killing reavers.  I got all of my reports and the books of Lord Ghiosk within a few hours time killing at 'the loop' outside of the building with the reavers, and inside as well.  Seemed like the priest's diary page was the rarest to me, and courier dropped the log on the first kill in the stables area (maybe we were just lucky, we got a jade reaver, too =P).   Ended up destroying several sets of the Ghiosk books and tons of the reports.  So, my advice to you is to take a good group to the loop/reavers area and just kill constantly, or even join in on a reaver raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been spending lots of time in CoM. The personal diary page drops often. I can't get that student log to drop, bad luck for me.  Near the temple, or at the stables might be the best place for these drops. I got all 5 of the reports near the temple my first day in CoM, maybe a couple of hours. Hope this helps...</div></div><hr />
