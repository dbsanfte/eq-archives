<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is my story,<br />
Several months back, I had a very good RL / EQ friend that was having some troubles....she was sick virtually all the time and was unable to do more than sit and type at small quiet camps while I did most of the work. She is a druid so she would do druid stuffs and dot a bit while I tanked and dotted and did shaman stuffs.<br />
It worked out great for us, and eventually she got better, but it was a tough road that nearly de-railed several times due to her illness and my occasional frustrations.<br />
The problem with this was that I was in a large (very uber now) raid guild and was expected to be on site and on hand for raids when FFA targets popped and expected to be around for various trials when PoP first came out. My guild had been very good to me, helping me with faction work in Velious, helping me with armor drops in WToV for my Kael quest armors and even providing me with my gems for said armors. BUT my friend was one of the people that introduced me to the joy of being a shaman, gave me my first guild tag back in my newbie days, heck even gave me my ubba Runed Totem Staff heheh....in short and plainly she is really what motivates a lot of my decisions about why I play and when I play. She really is THAT important to me.<br />
We were both in the raid guild together and were doing fine till she started getting ill, started making mistakes, and was unable to deal with the pressures of FFA targets, mobility that requires guild grouping, and didnt understand a lot of the higher end game simply because it didnt interest her. She was willing to stick around however because I enjoyed it, but was simply not up to the pressures it caused.<br />
So she eventually decided to /guildremove herself and I went on /anon and hid in small zones with little traffic, using varous alts to do my running and buying when needed/when I saw something cool I wanted. <br />
Eventually I was found and guildremoved, I didnt bother to explain my position, they wouldnt have understood I dont believe simply because they were only in it for the race pure and simple.<br />
<br />
Now all this being said, I am not upset because I think they were ticked at me for not helping (mind you they had several 60+ shamans at the time so I wasnt gimping them by not showing) I knew what the guild rules were and knew the risks I was taking by not going. They were perfectly within the guild charter for what they did and I accept that. <br />
My friend needed me, pure and simple, and where I am from, that is &gt; all but family needing you.<br />
<br />
But now I am lost, guildless and disoriented...my friend is much better now and still needs me around, but doesnt need me as much as a crutch, but I am at a loss to where to go from here....I dont have tons of friends now due to months spent duo with her and I dont want to go begging back to my old guild from a mixture of pride and simply because they have moved so far beyond me that I would be useless...they are doing ST, Tier 3 planes VT etc...I dont even have PoP flag 001.<br />
So I guess I am just looking for suggestions, ideas, /comfort whatever....any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do you mind restarting your characters?  If not then you might try picking a pair of characters that:<br />
<br />
1.  Complement each other well (a druid and shaman is not ideal).<br />
2.  Would form a good basis for a group and would be likely to attract other people LFG.  Overtime, as you level, that should develop into a solid group of friends.<br />
3.  Occasionally say ''Frooaak'<br />
<br />
Just a suggestion - it really depends on how much, and how soon, you want to get into the high level game and guild raids.  Perhaps we need to know a bit more about what you want to do.</div></div><hr />

Well, I am level 58 and have a near full set of my Kael armor, almost all my spells (few of the rare toys have eluded me) and have an army of alts that I can dip into if needed.<br />
I have seen a taste of the high end game, with ToV raids, SSra Temple rhags raids, various expiditions to the planes (Hate, Fear, Air all with no frikkin tear yet too /sigh) and have been present at Servitor of luclin, Vindi, Dain, etc raids, all of which were high end till PoP reared its ugly head.<br />
I am not saying that I want to get back into that now, just saying I havent got a clue as to where to go or what to do.<br />
I also have several other RL friends that play, but due to jobs/time constraints, kids, etc we rarely get to play as a team....we have a nice compliment for groups assuming were all online at once....at most due to RL considerations, jobs kids etc were all on at widely varied hours and times.<br />
What I want from the game now is a guild, preferably family oriented and friendly, but still capable of larger targets....maybe my epic and torpor and malo would be all I wanted and then I could whore myself out to the guild as needed /shrug.....am not really sure where to go to be quite honest.<br />
I LOVE the shaman class....I play it to perfection and have read/lurked on the crucible for a long time before I registered and have been told by many that I was a better shaman than all they had met...you never have to tell me when to rebuff, when to heal, when to manage aggro or when to root park....most shaman these days (new ones that havent heard of the Crucible) look like druids with kilts.....I simply enjoy the class more than any other.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well my friend all i can offer to you is this. I myself have had that problem ... and eventually my friend quit altogether, i did alot of soul searching and eventually removed from the guild i was in and joined with another, whom i had many friends in back from server split.  We are moving up these days killing bigger things, getter better equip. mobilizing faster for targets.  <br />
<br />
I Still do miss my friend, and wish her nothing but the best.  <br />
<br />
I think you should surpass your need to be in a Uber guild atm and find a nice family orientated one. Most the folks in my guild are adults although we sometimes dont act like it.  But never the less ...  we are a family and they are the best a shaman and a  person could ask for.  <br />
<br />
Go with your Heart my friend, it will lead you to your guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hi<br />
<br />
Im on emarr so i dont have direct knowledge, but on my server we have a number of reasonably family oriented/social guilds which are also at the same time capable of doing higher end content, although not with the frequency of the top tier guilds.<br />
<br />
I am in such a guild, although we are not really at the high end yet, having just started out in HoT and doing Tier 2-3 mobs.<br />
<br />
Ive found that by joining various pick up exp groups, you get to know a lot of other people and what guilds they are in. My guild has had a few people join us after they got into mainly guild only groups and who liked the fun banter and the good levels of skill.<br />
<br />
If i were you i would research as best you can by visiting the higher end guilds on your server, grouping with members, talking to them and asking questions. You should then be able to find a couple of social high endish guilds and then make a move toapply to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gulug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Avren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, first thing I think you need to do is decide what it is you want out of the game. Do you want to:<br />
<br />
1) Participate in high end encounters in a guild that raids constantly. Leaving you very little time for her.<br />
<br />
2) Be in a guild that is more casual about raiding, so that ill leave you time to spend with your friend. (Nice to hear she's doing better btw)<br />
<br />
3) She's more important to you then high end content, so you find a guild of folks you enjoy spending time with and hang out with her often.<br />
<br />
For me the answer would be number 2. I'm very lucky in that I'm in a guild that doing some really fun things at the moment, and although we aren't at the top we have a great time. The raid policy is such that if I want my free time I can have it and nobody will question why I'm not at the raid.  Most of us find that we have the most fun while we are taking out something together.<br />
<br />
Seems to me too many  folks put too much effort into turning eq into a job. Take a step back and enjoy the ride a bit. <br />
<br />
My 2 cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Easiest thing for the two of you to do would be to start grouping. Especially in Tier 1 planes, a 58+ druid and shaman make a nice core for a group. Shaman slows and backup heals, druid snares and covers main heals. You're flexible enouugh to add pretty much anyone to the group, if you manage to pick up a cleric, druid switches to offensive spells and backup heals. <br />
<br />
I think it would be the easiest way to meet people and try to find a guild that fits what you want to do. <br />
<br />
Best of luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with Thundar group in Tier 1 getting to know people.  Level 60 is the absolute min anyone will invite into a pickup group tier 2 and even then most want at least 61.  I am not sure how it is on your server but PoV was where I could see how the mid to high end guild people were.<br />
<br />
For douing suggestions.  I suggest you guys dou in PoV.  She can charm ravens and with your slow you guys will rip though the levels.<br />
<br />
Another question is do you want to join a guild with your friend.  That might modify some of your choices as well.  there are several guilds I am sure that have a large enough base to support both raiders and non-raiders.</div></div><hr />

So I guess I am just looking for suggestions, ideas, /comfort whatever....any ideas?<br />
<br />
<br />
You should get no /sympathy whatsoever.  You dug your own hole, so don't bother posting your sob story here.  You chose to HIDE and SNEAK around with guildtag off and with intent to HIDE from your guild.  Suggestion is for you and your friend to join another guild where they don't raid every day and kill uber mobs every day.  Maybe a guild where you feel you can communicate your feelings in and say...&quot;I'm not raiding today cause I don't feel like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
btw:  EQ is a game.  Glad your friend is feeling better.  But if your friend is so sick, maybe she should of taken time off from EQ to get better.  If you want to keep in touch, how about a regular email corrospondence or picking up the telephone.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quote<br />
I dont have tons of friends now due to months spent duo with her and I dont want to go begging back to my old guild from a mixture of pride....<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ is a game.  You chose to duo for months and not talk(?) or group with old friends?  Sounds like another choice of your own making.  Again no /sympathy.  Asking to rejoin a guild that you thought you couldn't communicate your feelings with? Don't you think that's not in your best interest?  If not, then ask.  Pride is a terrible thing.<br />

<br />
Visit your server message board.  Check out the guilds available to you.  Try to find someplace you (two) would be comfortable that way.<br />
<br />
You both may want to stick to being 60.  Skip PoP all together.  Find a nice small guild doing fun things in ToV and Luclin.  Enjoy chardok.  Get rich in Sebilis.  Exp in Ssra.  Learn tradeskills or do quests.  <br />
<br />
Find out why you want out of the game.</div></div><hr />

As for the original poster, why the hell would you be associated with such a militant guild if you didn't like their ways? I think guilds like that are the most idiotic bunch of social misfits in the world. Required raid attendance? Bah, sounds like a bunch of power hungry ugly teenagers who can't get some in RL.<br />
<br />
And you friend, if she was so sick she couldn't play EQ, she should be in the hospital, that is some really scary antics, too weak to do anything but push the keys? That isn't sick, thats near death.<br />
<br />
Relax and enjoy the game, find like minded individuals, define your goals. If you want uber raids and uber l33t loot, then you gotta get back on the horse and atend all them raids and follow a childish guild around, can't have a friendly family guild and do the military style kiddy guild thing too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Helfdane, I am not one usually for active recruiting, but you sound like just the type of person we want in the Silver Daggers.  Feel free to take a look at our homepage, our guild forum and our alliance forums.  Links are provided below.  We are a mid to large sized guild in an alliance.  We are not uber by any means.  We have a select few flagged for Tier 2 planes, and are just now breaking the surface on a lot of targets.  Cazic Thule and Innoruuk have fallen to us.  Vindi is our current target to kill, with Velketor and mobs like the Burrower close behind.  We had Vindi to 0% in our last encounter, but he refused to die.  30 raiders I believe.  :)<br />
<br />
As for what happened, I think you are very admirable for what you did and taking responsibility for your actions.  That type of attitude is uncommon these days.<br />

So, Ginkinn is &quot;mean&quot; but it's okay to call anyone in a guild with required raid attendance a &quot;power starved ugly teenager who can't get some in real life?&quot;<br />
<br />
It's getting to the point where your posts just aren't worth reading.  Blah blah blah uber guilds are the devil blah blah blah anyone that doesn't want to play exclusively in pre-Luclin zones are morally bankrupt blah blah blah.</div></div><hr />

A few friends recently started a new guild call Clan of the Dragonborn. We only have about 10 members but plan of having some fun soon... <br />

 yes, the guy was mean, and yes, I am right. I don't want no whores in my guild sounds mean to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any guild that kicks a member out for not attending raids, is, a turd guild. Losers, social misfits, yup. Period.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deal with it. Perhaps that is the norm now, well, good for you, god forbid somone in your guild gets cancer or something, POW!! out of the guild chump.<br />
<br />
ya, your cool.<br />
<br />
and what the hell do you mean anyone not wanting to play in pre-luclin zones is morally corrupt? I never said any such thing. Might wanna lay off the booze. Just because I like to play in them piss you off?<br />
<br />
<br />
I am all for Mill bashing, and sometimes, I even deserve it, but not here, I'll go a few rounds with you, hit me with your best. If all you can do is make crap up, well, good luck wench.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is, more and more people are accepting ass heads on a  power trip as the norm in EQ. I remember when there actually was nice, friendly guilds, but they get squeezed out by above mentioned dip**** guilds, which apparently, you approve of.<br />

<br />
making crap up too, gods, is this what the board has turned in to? Angry, pissed off people who snap at any mention of uber guilds being less then the ultimate? Are you so goddamned power tripped up you can't even see how idiotic your rules sound? Attend raids or else? Christ, is this the new Hitler youth?<br />

Thank god EQ isn't the real world, or people like you would be getting their asses kicked all over the place, just for being rude, obnoxious, and offensive.<br />

I apologize when I fly off the handle, and like I said, sometimes I deserve what I get, last week or so I blew up at Gart, and I let him know it was wrong, at least I can see stupid crap like that for what it is.<br />

now, there is probably a family oriented guild out there trying to attempt a semi-uber mob, you better run hurry and pimp them out of it.<br />

Millman has toned down over the years ... I miss the posts he used to make while wildly drunk.  BTW, his guide to playing EQ while drunk is a must read.<br />
<br />
Any PoV on uber guilds is a matter of perspective and priorities.  Some might think that drinking away years of your life is a waste of time.  Personally, I find both amusing, but then there's a great view from the cheap seats.<br />

On topic:<br />
While boards may offer guild links and a &quot;quick&quot; way to get guilded, I'd use those as preliminary research, then look them up in game, play with them, get to know them.  I can guarantee you that the quick way to gettign a guild is not the best way and will lead to more disatisfaction with the game.<br />
<br />
I'd look for a guild that has been around a while as well.  It's a sign of solid leadership which is critical in family guild with skills.</div></div><hr />

I agree whole-heartedly Tarthug.  I never wanted to seem like I was pushing for Helfdane to join.  Just offering information about other guilds out there.  Anyone that has applied to the Silver Daggers knows that our acceptance speed is slow.  Besides our thorough questionaire, we encourage the applicant to hunt with us before they are tagged.<br />
<br />
And from first glance, Helfdane appears to be the type we strive for in our guild.<br />
<br />
/shameless plug on<br />
Silver Daggers have been a guild on Karana since about 3 weeks after the game hit the shelves, with no interruptions or restructuring.  There are only a handful of guilds on Karana that can claim longer.  We've had our leadership change once the whole time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I stand by what I said.  Your obvious bias colors all of your posts to the point where they are nearly formulaic.   Yep, I'm in a high level raid guild currently.  That doesn't mean I don't respect how others decide to play.  You, however, have no respect for anyone who doesn't play exactly like you do.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;attacking you for no reason,&quot; that's pretty funny.  Just who were you meaning to attack when you compared members of guilds with required attendance to loser high school kids who can't get laid?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Helfdane:<br />

first you need to figure out what your priorities are - your friend, or the high end game?  once you figure that out, your path should reveal itself to you.<br />
<br />
if you'll take some advice though, dont worry about gear/high end raiding.  in the end it's really pointless IMO.  your friends are much more important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gloriana is normaly nothing but helpfull but millman's opinion of high end guilds is dead on.<br />
<br />
EQ is filling up with agresive ass hats.  I don't think Gloriana is one but the high end guilds are cramed full of them.  They stomp around Norath like it was empty without any reguard for those doing lower level content and without any respect.<br />
<br />
Resentment from that behavior is both reasonable and understandable.  The population is degenerating and more and more of the kind people that used to rome the lands of Norath are vanishing as the number of looooser high schools kids who can't get laid multiply by cloning themselves on extra boxes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normally rude, obnoxious, and offensive descriptors are based on words like “whores, turd, chump, piss, ass, dip**** guilds, pimp, stupid crap”.  What is incredulous is someone using them and then stating that someone needs to grow up simply because they were called being a hypocrite.</div></div><hr />

I think any real friend would have done the same... just without the exlusion of all of your OTHER friends. Helping someone pass a tough time is great, it's even admirable, but it sounds like you chose a path of seclusion, and from some of your actions it almost feels as if you wanted to be removed from the guild in which you were apart of.<br />
<br />
Now it seems you are bored, and would like to play on a different level again. Well, join another guild is my advice, and start over.<br />
<br />
As far as the uber guild bashing, I find it extremely amusing that those who accuse  ubers of being elitst *******s are doing a very good job at being not-so-elitst-*******s. Honestly, do you not see the irony and the hypocrisy?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, by trying to present yourself as &quot;ha, ubers suck, I rock, I'm better than all of them because they are all *******s and I'm a great person, yeah&quot; you are in fact completely and utterly failing to generate any sympathy and at the same time destroys any credibility you think you have.<br />
<br />
There's a very popular theory that states when someone, or something truely bothers you, then it is because you see a similar quality in yourself that you loath. <br />

You said yourself that she is the motivating factor on why you play. That being said, does it really matter what level of content you are doing? Where the game it is today small guilds are perfectly capable of doing lots of mobs. <br />
<br />
EQ used to be neat in that I think most people played as much for the fellowship as the accomplishments in game. I dunno if you can say that nowdays.  Like many poeple have said here, find out what you want out of the game and thatll make things more clear.</div></div><hr />

Heh, if you really want to go there then the same thing can also be said about Ginkinn, Gloriana and several other people in this thread (on both sides). <br />

Ginkinn did come across as an elitist a**hole and needed to be laughed at. If Millman used too broad of a brush at least it was in a good cause. :D</div></div><hr />

Since when is needlessly antagonizing people and being an over-sensitive, hypocritical baby and whining when you're called on being a dick a good cause?<br />
<br />
<br />
On the other side of the coin, the original poster apparently didn't have enough close friends in the guild to notice his behavior right off, and he never mentions that he talked to the leadership to explain his situation.  A lot of people in guilds don't give a **** about the guild, and are only in it for the loot they can get out of it.  Well, actually, that's the reason almost everyone is in a guild.  But there's a difference between only coming to raids when you can get loot, and coming to every raid you can when you're online, just so you can help the guild.<br />
<br />
My sympathies though, illness is a bitch.  Hope you find a good guild for your needs, and try to communicate odd circumstances like all this to the officers when you have to, not hide anon in a backwater zone.  Most officers are officers because they've shown themselves to be more levelheaded, understanding, and compromising than the average guildmember.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, my friend did explain her position to the guild leader and to one of the officers....she was told in no uncetain terms that if she wasnt able to go to raids that she should /guildremove now and stop whining about being sick.<br />
I saw the screen shots myself, so it happened.<br />
I dont personally have anything against uber guilds, never have never will, but I do have something in general against bad attitudes and people that just like to take a leak on somone elses parade.<br />
You know the type...the people that ridicule some lowbie auctioning WTS some Crusteacean Shell armor and shout or ooc that its junk.....people that outright KS lower levels just because they can (had that happen on Lodizal several times).<br />
I have several RL friends that play, together were a pretty nasty team, and have tackeled a lot of things that would scare people to death (RL and in game) but due to time constraints, RL obligations and the like, we rarely see each other on line and have to plan many weeks in advance to do something on line together.<br />
<br />
Now all this aside, as I said in my first post, I knew what I was doing when I was doing it, as did several people in my guild that I wouldnt exactly term friends, but at least they knew my capabilities and knew me well enough to ask me for my services. Yes I made a conscious choice to support my friend at the cost of a few others, and its a choice I would make again any time.<br />
I know how cripling an extended illness and the accompanying depression can be. I am an ER nurse by profession, I see suffering and illness on levels that most of you cant comprehend and I pray you never will.<br />
My whole intent was not to start a pissing contest over Uber vs non uber guilds, every play style is equally viable and I understand each....yes I am a frustrated gamer, yes I am looking for some direction and have really no idea where to go.<br />
My friend is better now and has settled into a nice guild that suits her speed, she has a cleric alt in Legions of Divine Light (for those on Karana that know of it) and likes the treatment and likes how they are in general....I find them friendly and they have good intentions, but they are a RP guild by large and I dont do RP well.<br />
They also have the requirement of being a cleric or a paladin (neither a class that I can personally tolerate to play) so I basically just tag along from time to time so I can show them shammie uberness :)<br />
I didnt mean to show that I was totally friendless, more to the fact I am just displaced and off center, if you dont understand what I mean by that, its not something that is easily explained, and I am trying to get back on center and on a path that I can enjoy again.<br />
I want to thank you for the words of support, and I even thank the people that were harsh and unfriendly, it takes nads to say things like that....but I was never a loot whore and never I repeat never took advantage of my situation in my former guild; I dont pack around my epic as proof of that and I dont have some very uber loot (well for me anyway) that I could have picked up simply by asking.<br />
Dont ever accuse me of being anything other than a good shaman and a better friend.</div></div><hr />

I've seen a few guild suggestions.... but I have one more for ya.  No... I'm not on your server... but most servers are like mine (Tarew Marr)... and have alliances made up of smaller guilds.  I'd suggest putting feelers out for those alliances... then finding out more about the guilds involved in them.  That way... you can HAVE your family-style guild, yet have the numbers to do the bigger targets as well.  I'm part of one of those alliances, and it's been one of the greatest experiences of my EQ life.  NO playtime requirement.... yet plenty of high-end type encounters to choose from... and a HUGE pool of friends to chat with in alliance chat, or group with when you're looking for some EXP.<br />

if their guild is a high level raiding guild and their charter says show up or don't let the door hit you on the way out, so be it. there are other people in that guild who seem to like it that way and it's their right to be that way. this doesn't mean they're bad people, though i wouldn't vote for them being the friendliest guild i've ever heard of either.<br />

<br />
as for the original guy... hmm what kind of guild is this!  very odd.  even the most hardcore guilds will reasonably have provisions for members to go inactive or leave the game for a while<br />
<br />
your getting booted is for the best, any situation where you feel you have to sneak around to do what your conscience dictates as opposed to being upfront indicates a bad thing.  it doesn't sound like a healthy situation.  this is a game... your time is your own, no matter how much you want to belong to the group and how much you may feel insecure and isolated at the moment, remember that at the end of the day.  no one owns your time online you dont have to feel guilty or sneak around because you did what you thought was right, or just plain felt like doing<br />
<br />
suck it up, try duoing with your friend until you both hit 61.  explore the game a little and try some camps.  another guild will come in time.  there 100000000000000000 people online and 100000000000000000-1 guilds.<br />

it's not a big deal... things will work out for you<br />

Ginkinn why look for advice when you already made your choice? You picked friendship over your guild, tho it seems you regret the decision. Seriously, what could anyone really say here? <br />
<br />
- If you want to raid, join a &quot;raid guild&quot; <br />
- If you want to duo all day, don't join a &quot;raid guild&quot; that requires mandatory mobilization for FFA mobs. It will make you unhappy. <br />
- If you like duo'ing and raiding now and then, join a &quot;family guild&quot; <br />
- Be careful tho that the &quot;family guild&quot; is really a &quot;wanna-be raid guild,&quot; in which case everyone is unhappy. <br />
<br />
The answers are as obvious as are the responses from the various parties.</div></div><hr />

You don't need to hold's Helfdane's hand PaPa TarThug.  He isn't some lowly n00bie dR00bie grennie shammie unawares of how to play EQ.<br />

If you want to give /sympathy to a guildmate who hides his tag and doesn't say why.  So be it.  If you choose to give /sympathy to someone who duos with a friend for MONTHS to the exclusion of others, then so be it.  Just don't be suprised when people don't remember you after a couple months because you disappeared.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you like happy endings, well EQ isn't always like that.  But if you NEED a happy feel good story...then here ya go.<br />
<br />
<br />
One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old, and the well needed to be covered up anyway, it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey. He invited all his neighbors to come over and help him. They each grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. <br />
<br />
At first, the donkey realized what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer looked down the well, and was astonished at what he saw. <br />
<br />
As every shovel of dirt hit his back, the donkey did something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbors continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed, as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off. <br />
<br />
The Moral: <br />
<br />
Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up! <br />
<br />
-----------------------------<br />
O.K., that's enough of that B.S. ... The donkey later came back, caught the farmer out in the field and kicked the heck out of him. Then he went over to each of his neighbors farms and kicked the heck out of them too for helping. <br />
<br />
The REAL Moral: <br />
<br />
When you try to cover your ass, it always comes back to get you. <br />

<br />
I just don't think I deserved it this time, all I said was that was mean, and it sounded it to me. I didn't even say it in a mean way.<br />
<br />
I do not know what gloriana meant with the not playing in pre expansion zones is morally corrupt, I play in pre expansion zones becuase untill a week or so ago, my computer couldnt handle new ones, and the old zones are uncrowded.<br />
<br />
As far as my views on uber guilds, I have seen, first hand, time and time again, them do truly despicable thingd. Harmonium and some other guild(pretorian legion?) all the time, would do underhanded crap. not allowing non-guildies to loot no drop quest items they didn't even need for instance. Trampling people over to race for Trak, monopolizing spawns and even putting it up on their website, that they intend to kill every mob, period.<br />
<br />
So, yes, the very top guilds, the militant ones, I loathe. They get things done, but 50 trained monkeys given the right gear and not having to work could do the same damn thing, isn't skill, is timing and play time.<br />
<br />
Think I am in the minority here? Nope. Probably 20 friends I know played EQ, 3 do now, number one reason they quit was because of being run over by uber guilds, pimped out of spawns, face it, it just isn't fun after the 400th time. We were even in a fairly powerful, friendly guild, no raid requirements, no merit system, just fun, and wwe got screwed over because we didn't play the ruthless, jerk off mentality games the ubers did.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, if somone gets offended by me, tough noogies. Ask yourself why you are offended, is it because I hit to close to the mark? If I didn't, it shouldn't offend you then, you might disagree, but shouldn't get all bent out of shape.<br />
<br />
I am the epitomy of the &quot;casual gamer&quot;. I work hard, have a relationship, other hobbies, and I play to have fun, when power hungry people intentionally ruin it(they do), then I post stories here.<br />
<br />
Drink, its friday!!<br />
<br />
P.S. I should clarify my defenition of &quot;uber guild&quot; I consider these the ones that have &quot;requirements&quot;, &quot;raid attendance manditory&quot;, &quot;merit systems&quot;(I believe in help those who need), and most importantly, those guilds that value phat loot more then their repuation and friendships. If you fall in to that category, so be it.<br />

I think I was offended because you said any guild with required raid attendance were a bunch of power hungry ugly kids who couldn't get laid.<br />
<br />
Considering my own guild (with required raid attendance if you're online) is mostly working adults, many with families; your comment didn't hit close to the mark at all.  I was offended by your gross over generalizations and rampant hostility.  Not to mention the hypocrisy of calling Ginkinn mean before taking your own cheap pot shot.<br />
<br />
Why shouldn't people get bent out of shape when they are continously insulted? It would be one thing if stated your opinion like you did in your most recent post, it's another to be egregiously insulting with stuff like &quot;power hungry ugly kids who can't get laid.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">One problem here is that we all have very limited experience of uber guilds: there's only a small number on any server and we can only base our opinions on those.  If the uber guilds on your particular server are bad ones you assume all uber-guilds are bad ones.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help that if you visit the websites of FoH, Afterlife, Triton etc., you are unlikely to be impressed if you are 15 years or older.  One peach phrase I read on one recently was 'I **** you not': wow, straight out of Platoon - the guy was talk 'tough speak dewd'.<br />
<br />
My first experience of the uber guild on my server was coming back to East Freeport and listening to 3 members of the 'Amber Knights' (the uber guild of that time) taking the piss out of the noobies.  Of course it was really just a few stupid kids saying 'look at me, look at me, I am so uber', but its not going to make me want to join them or respect them.

Well, required raid attendance. Hmm, what happens if you need to do something else that night? Kicked out of guild? That is really, really childish. What advantage does this give? What is so bad about missing a raid, or just not going because you don't feel like it? Ever wonder why uber guilds have so much strife, turnover, and splits?<br />
<br />
This is a GAME, is it not? I have never seen another GAME where people are told you play every single time I say, or you are kicked off the team.<br />
<br />
Gross over generalizations? Mabye, maybe not. Every shred of evidence, both experienced by me, friends, other guilds I have talked to, message boards, everything, points to one clear truth, the truly uber guilds, are selfish, greedy, and flat out ruthless.<br />
<br />
Ask yourself why malo, torpor, etc, are sold for such prices, because greed in EQ is the norm. I never had more then 3-4k plat, ever, because the second I got something good, I gave it away.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Not all powerful guilds are &quot;uber&quot;, some are powerful, but ultimately lose the &quot;race&quot; because they have morals.<br />
<br />
2. Every single &quot;uber&quot; guild I have heard of, like Afterlife for instance, limits people by class and level, with strict rules about raids/loot. Fine, but to me, and others like me, this is pure bologna, guilds should be about friends and fun. When you get this many militant people together, they don't care who they step on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Somone told me I was required to attend a raid, I would find out where they live, drive to their house, and shove their own monitor straight up their ass, then slap them for being a jerk. Then i would slap their parent's for having such a brat.<br />
<br />
What is next, a guild demanding a % of your income? Guild requiring acts of ruthlessness to prove yourself above the rest? Guilds actually quantifying &quot;Pimp&quot; skill as a requirement? Group sex?(good one I spose), cyanide kool-aid?<br />
<br />
<br />
I have seen it all, time, and time again. If you are in one of the jerk guilds, then you know it, if you aren't, then this isn't for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
The ONLY reason any of this even matters, is because in the quest fo phat l33t or whatever you call it, uber guilds step on people, and either do it intentionally, or are so full of their own stink they can't even smell what they are shoveling.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crusty,<br />
<br />
yuo could be right, perhaps I have had bad experiences, I grew up with Triton(Povar) and harmonium(Xev). But talking to and reading, I see many other guilds on other servers that seem to fit the exact same standards. Not all big or powerful guilds are bad, but the really &quot;best&quot; ones seem to be jerks, and not care about anything but themselves.<br />

This is unrealistically extreme even for most of the top guilds. The mandatory part is if you're online, you must come. Not &quot;hi, I know you're at school/work right now, but ss temple just repopped and you must leave class/quit job now and raid.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mills: &quot;What is so bad about missing a raid, or just not going because you don't feel like it?&quot;<br />

What part of this didn't you understand when you joined the guild? If you ap FoH, expect to raid and play alot. Yes, many guilds also require you play at certain hours when they raid, and yes mobilization may be mandatory but NO ONE is forcing you seek out and retain that guildtag.<br />

And 95 percent of the players of EQ can coexist with them now without ever getting trained etc because the top guilds are playing deep in PoP while the casual player to the no. 3-10 raid guilds on servers have their run of ST, ntov, ssra etc.<br />

I've found generoisty exists at all levels of the game, from the top players on down. You're viewing your server thru sh**-colored glasses if you honestly beleive that all 100 of the top 100 most &quot;uber&quot; players on each server are greedy jack@sses. Greed exists at all levels; as does generosity. Don't be so blind to think that just because a player is competitive that there's not another side to them. <br />
<br />
Mill: &quot;1. Not all powerful guilds are &quot;uber&quot;, some are powerful, but ultimately lose the &quot;race&quot; because they have morals.&quot;<br />
<br />
I kind of agree here. EQ's end game is ruthless. It's about timing spawns, crashing zones, showeq, guild spies and rapid mobilizaiton. The guilds that don't sit a guy in front of Tmax's spawn point for hours and hours probably don't kill Tmax.<br />
<br />
Mill: &quot;2. Every single &quot;uber&quot; guild I have heard of, like Afterlife for instance, limits people by class and level, with strict rules about raids/loot. Fine, but to me, and others like me, this is pure bologna. ... When you get this many militant people together, they don't care who they step on.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not in the top guild on Fennin. We're probably no. 5-6 atm, so I won't pretend to speak for anyone but myself and my experiences.<br />
<br />
Level requirements are in place for efficiency's sake. One level 65 rogue will be more efficient than 3 level 50s against high-end targets. As far as things like DKP/awarding, remember loot earned by a guild is to benefit a guild by improving its overall performance. Or it's given to the guild leader's RL girlfriend or something :)<br />
<br />
Mill: &quot;guilds should be about friends and fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is your opinion only. And frankly, most guilds are. And also, for some people, guild v. guild competition is fun. Myself included.<br />
<br />
Mill: &quot;Somone told me I was required to attend a raid, I would find out where they live, drive to their house, and shove their own monitor straight up their ass, then slap them for being a jerk. Then i would slap their parent's for having such a brat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lalala NO ONE ever forces ANYONE to join a guild where raiding is mandatory. You don't just log in one day, note that Triton follows your name and that it was unremovable.<br />
<br />
I have a thought. Let people play EQ HOW THEY WANT TO PLAY EQ.<br />
<br />
Mill: &quot;What is next, a guild demanding a % of your income? Guild requiring acts of ruthlessness to prove yourself above the rest? Guilds actually quantifying &quot;Pimp&quot; skill as a requirement? Group sex?(good one I spose), cyanide kool-aid?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thank you for the modest proposal Mr. Swift.<br />
<br />
Bleh, nothing more is even worth responding to. Seriously, you bandy about sweeping and wholly inaccurate generalizations as gospel truth. You obviously did not enjoy EQ, for whatever reason and I won't throw out similar generalizations and guesses as to why that is.<br />
<br />
Somehow, since April of 1999 existing as a part-time player (I'm 32 now, wife, kid, job), I continue to play and have fun. I play only to raid, and I have always found guilds who will tolerate my limited play. As a parttime player, I have helped kill/clear every SoV encounter from AoW on down, done SoL rares like Burrower, THO, Cursed, IV, and done PoP rares like AD and Xana. My gear isn't amazing but it's OK. I'm flagged for a bunch of zones. I'm working on my Emp key and expect to be in VT in six months if all goes well. At the same time, like you, I tend to give stuff away I don't need rather than sell it. According to your views, I don't exist.<br />
<br />
Let me assure you, I do.</div></div><hr />

Public is in NToV and ST and making headway towards heading to VT.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of great people in the public raiding channel, and the man who leads the majority of the raids, while he rules his raids with an iron fist, he succeeds.  It's nice to have that option of high end content without having to be in an uber guild.</div></div><hr />

You summed up my whole point for me. <br />
<br />
LET PEOPLE PLAY EQ HOW THEY WANT!!<br />
<br />
exactly. When I am hanging out wih my rusty hammer in rathe mts, I am playing how I want, and I am not forcing others to do anything,<br />
<br />
BUT&lt;<br />
<br />
 when local_uber_guild_101 decides to crash a raid, deny a spawn, be a jerk, yes they are playing how they want, but they are <br />
<br />
NOT ALLOWING OTHERS TO PLAY HOW THEY WANT.<br />
<br />
get it? My peon actions never, ever hurt anyone, but a powerful guild, stomping around the world pimping other people, does influence how they play. It is EQ design that did this.<br />
<br />
You sports argument was weak, if I have a real life problem, injury, etc, I could miss a game no problem, I know, I was a good high school athlete, when I had a death in the family, they didn't boot me off the team.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look, I have never hurt anyone in game, My guild has always been small and nice, we would back off a spawn rather then fighting over it.<br />
<br />
How many times has my play been altered though, by Johnny-g-Pimpy uber guild? 50? 100? 200?<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Prove to me how my play style hurts anyone, or alters a play style of somone.<br />
<br />
2. Refute that the antics of rare spawns and uber guilds does interfere with more casual gamers. Might be less now with expansions, but it did, and does happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
and last of all:<br />
<br />
3. If Vikings raided your town once a week, pillaged and looted, and your town didn't have the number of people to kick their ass, would it be a safe assumption, Vikings were jerks? If you were perfectly happy eating your bologna sandwich, and a Viking came up and stole it, wouldn't you be pissed off at Vikings? Sure some Vikings would stay on their boat, go fishing, whatever, but those damned Vikings killing and making you miserable sure would make an impression, wouldn't they? What if said Vikings cornered the market on bologna, by intercepting the Oscar Mayer truck everyday while you were at work, wouldn't that interfere with your chance at a bologna sandwich?<br />
<br />
above is silly, but works the same with uber guilds, just substitute a few wods above. Uber guild for vikings, phat l33t with bologna, Oscar Mayer truck with dragon_101<br />
<br />
<br />
Untill I see an uberguild act with honesty, friendliness, and tact, in my eyes, they suck. No phat loot can make them shiny and nice in my eyes.<br />

<br />
Look, I'm just here to have fun and hang out with my friends.  I would never join an uber guild for just that reason.  I'm not here to get the best loot, kill the most contested spawns.  That stuff is not fun to me.  The fun lies in my friends not the loot.  What makes you think you guys can beat the game anyway?  There's really nothing to beat except yourself, as you sacrifice real life time for time sitting in front of the computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">A fairly simple example of uber guild behavior was the habit of Promitian Order, Vaz.... to not use private raid chanels.

<br />
This kind of rude, arogent, thaugtless behavior was the norm not the exception.  The rest of ous where like the homless that where unworthy of any comon consideration and just ignored like we where invisable.</div></div><hr />

Post PoP this is becomming more rare. The top 2 or 3 guilds on the server will clash, but the rest of the world is devoid of them. I know we've actually worked with one of the top two guilds on Fennin on a mob lately. Frankly, in PoP there is a place where super-dedicated gamers can go and get good rewards, leaving VT, ssra, ntov, st, AR etc open. If you are in a family guild working on epics you'll have NO worries about uberguild01. If you are in a 24-30 person guild and you do Zlandi/Klandi/Vadyn/Vindi/DS/RC you'll have NO worries about uberguild01. If you are in a higher-end raiding guild and do KT/Yeli/AoW/ntov/ssra/shei/iv/burrower you'll STILL have no worries about uberguild01.<br />
<br />
There is so much raiding content now that the guild v. guild contests are between those at the same level. FoH isn't bum-rushing familyguild01 to VS.<br />
<br />
Mill: &quot;You sports argument was weak, if I have a real life problem, injury, etc, I could miss a game no problem, I know, I was a good high school athlete, when I had a death in the family, they didn't boot me off the team.&quot;<br />
<br />
I know a guy who took 3 months off EQ, misses like 75 percent of raids and he's still in the top guild on Fennin. He doesn't get much loot but scraps, but he's tagged and happy.<br />
<br />
Mill: &quot;Look, I have never hurt anyone in game, My guild has always been small and nice, we would back off a spawn rather then fighting over it. .. &lt;snip&gt;<br />
<br />
I agree and understand what you are saying, I'm just saying that we're reaching a point where there is actually approaching an acceptable level of content. My guild finds 2-5 things to kill every night. <br />
<br />
Mill: &quot;3. If Vikings raided your town once a week, pillaged and looted, and your town didn't have the number of people to kick their ass, would it be a safe assumption, Vikings were jerks?

<br />
How would I react to this? I'd run to Viking.com and post a rant of course!<br />
<br />
JK, I understand what you are getting at. :)<br />

It happens, but you just might not be there or be in the position to see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Kadira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">There are many different types of guilds.  If your charter requires you to attend X number of raids, then you are duty-bound to do so, at least as long as you wear the tag.  (In theory)  EQ is a game, and you should get the most out of the game as it applies to your personal situation.  <br />
<br />
One of my early guilds with my monk was a raid guild, and I was the defacto puller.  If I missed a raid, then all hell broke loose, was collected, and heaped on my head.  I respectfully responded to the officer's concerns, promised that it would never happen again, and promptly removed myself, even amid their protests.  <br />
<br />
My place is in family guilds, such as SG on Prexus.  We are not uber.  What I love about these types of guilds is this:<br />
<br />
Kadira:  Hey Cleric01 how goes it?<br />
Cleric01: Hey there!<br />
Kadira: We are forming up at CoM for a Reaver run, you coming?<br />
Cleric01: Nah, not feeling so well, think I'll log<br />
Kadira:  Okies, take care of you?<br />
Cleric01: Is Cleric02 there?<br />
Kadira:  Nah, he had a thing with his kids tonight<br />
Cleric01:  I guess I can come.<br />
Kadira: That would be great, but we do have four druids, and me.. what do I want with a silly cleric?<br />
Cleric01: LOL, okay, good luck, call me if you need rezzes, gonna grab a nap.. I'll check back later tonight<br />
Kadira: Okies<br />
<br />
-= 4 hours later =- <br />
<br />
Cleric01: How did or is raid going?<br />
Kadira:  LOL You don't want to know, but we did get Ranger01 her Reaver.<br />
Cleric01:  Yikes, lemme get a port to EJ<br />
Kadira: Rezzes are done, just me and the monk now farming<br />
Cleric01: Awesome, want a silly cleric?<br />
Kadira: C'mon sis!  Druid03 is coming back .. he in Nexus, he'll port ya in<br />
Cleric01:  See ya soon!<br />
<br />
In my old guild, that Cleric would have lost loot position and possibly been put on probation.  If a guild removes the fun aspect of EQ, what's the point in playing?  We are not making money at it, so if it is not fun, then it is not worth doing. <br />
<br />
I think a moderate sized Family type guild that has the strength to raid on occassion would be ideal for you and your friend.  :)<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
WORST POSSIBLE GUILDS<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
The Wannabe Guilds - God, I hate those.  The are guilds marching around calling themselves a &quot;family&quot; guild, while all they do is spend time lusting after T3 and T4 PoP runs, Ssra, etc.  <br />
<br />
I had a couple of friends in one of those, and they asked me to check out their website.  The charter looked good, so I starting lurking on their message boards.  There were a few amendments that caught my eye:<br />
<br />
Required Level:  50+  (Okay, no problem there)<br />
Required Keys: Seb, 7 ToFS, and others (Huh?  REQUIRED keys for a FAMILY guild?!?)<br />
Gear:  Epic or Pre-Epic within 3 fights (Pre-epic?  What have they been putting in THEIR kool-aid)<br />
Plat Reserve: 5K (A RESERVE?!?)<br />
<br />
I talked to my friends and told them that those were some of the most rediculous requirements I had ever heard of for such a small guild, whose average level was 45ish.  Only their leader and one other officer even HAD their epics.  <br />
<br />
My friends explained how the guild felt like they were treadmills.  They said people would join around level 30ish, get &quot;PL'd&quot; to 50 or so, then leave.  (Welcome to the real world.) I explained that their feeble attempts at &quot;requirements&quot; looked to me to be that they wanted raid leaders to join, not &quot;extend the family&quot;. <br />
<br />
A few days later, one of their officers sent me a tell after I handled pulling duties in Chardok for them.  <br />
<br />
The officer complimented my pulling and knowledge of the zone (Eq Atlas thank you), and asked me if I wanted to be tagged.<br />
<br />
I asked who are the regular pullers for the guild, and they told me they had a 51 SK and that was it.  I thanked the officer for the invite, but said that I was not really looking for a guild home at the time, but would be more than happy to join their raids. <br />
<br />
The cool thing was that they seemed to understand, and I lead and/or pulled many fun raids with them.   Never did join them.  <br />
<br />
In time, they split, and they still exist today, having decided to focus on the family aspect more than the raiding aspect of the game.  As of today, they can hold virtually any old world and kunark zone, and a darn good portion of the velious raid zones.  They have archived the silly requirements they once tried to implement as a &quot;reminder&quot; of when things went wrong.</div></div><hr />
