<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Darkzel, you requested my infoz, so below is my walkthrough on Stoicism. You can solo the first part, I know I did this in my late 40's and you are better equipt than I was in my late 40's. There's just tricks to A. getting to Dulak harbor safely and B. single pulling the drunken pirates and avoiding the wandering guards. I can show you that some time and maybe help you kill a few. I was lucky, I was with a group and LD'd and when I finally got back in my group had moved on, but there was a dead drunken pirate sitting there with the empty flask at my feet.<br />

Sto i cism:<br />
n 1. Indifference to pleasure or pain; impassiveness<br />
<br />
There is a miniature water elemental named &quot;An Impassive Sea Spirit&quot;. He is in Gunthak and is located under a flipped over sunken ship's hull at loc pos 695, neg 150. Enduring Breathe or an EB item is recommended. you say, 'Hail, an impassive sea spirit.' You say, 'I dare to learn.' An impassive sea spirit says, 'We will see... (blah blah) ...Bring me something empty that previously numbed feeling and therefore brought emptiness to it's possessor. You should not have to travel far.'<br />
<br />
There are drunken pirates near the entrance into Dulak Harbor. They randonly drop Empty Flask. Race: SHM. It takes about 20-40 kills to find a flask. There are 4 drunk spawns on the first row of houses on your right when you zone in. The adjacent Boardwalk strip has 2 or 3 more. Also 2 or 3 more in the houses in the middle (across from the large WHITE tavern).<br />
<br />
After handing in the flask, the spirit gives you A Clear Rock and asks &quot;Are you ready to become as impassive as the sea&quot;. Respond by saying &quot;I am as impassive as the sea&quot;. The text afterwards suggests that you need to kill small elements in the sea and return the essences to him. When you are ready for the challenge, simply give back the rock he just gave you.<br />
<br />
When you turn back in the 2nd rock, 2 elementals will trigger spawn and you have to get 2 drops (1 per elemental). Hand those into the Impassive Sea Spirit to get Spell: Stoicism. I did this with a level 65 cleric, mage, and shaman, a 45 Necro, and 53 Beastlord. It was a massive overkill. I'd say it could probably be done by a high level shaman by themselves with their pet fully buffed. Just watch agro because it's underwater and undwerwater interrupts suck.</div></div><hr />
