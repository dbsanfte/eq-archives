<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got my new level 24 spells, and from what I've heard, soloing only gets better from here on out. Currently, I'm trying to solo in LOIO, but it's a bit difficult for me. My spell line up in order are: Healing, Frenzy, SOW, Regen, Canab, Malise, Root, and Envenomed Breath. Is there something I should change? I don't really know how to solo with a shammy, and I really don't know where to solo where I'm at. The exp is really slow, and the loot is worse. Someone in my earlier post suggested I go to Echo Caverns, but after hunting in Pauldal Caverns from 15-24, I really don't want to go in any more dungeons, mainly because I don't know which spell line up I could use to solo in dungeons maps. Sorry if this post is a bit complicated and long, but I've been stuck on 24 for almost a week now, mainly just walking around trying to find a good spot to hunt. I also forgot to mention -  Can someone please give me a lot of good advice on HOW to solo? I really haven't soloed yet, and I don't want to turn into a group shammy. Thanks in advance. - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Seems to me like you've been a group Shaman up to this point. (nothing wrong with that except that your soloing skills really suffer as well as some vital stats). Your first order of business is to increase your defense skill, that is free AC. You also want to max your weapon skills (very vital for effective soloing). Unless you use a Root/Rot method (effective soloing technique - but makes me feel too much like a druid so I don't do it much). <br />
<br />
I soloed at 24 in LOIO, quite easily in fact. <br />
The spells I had memorized were (in order)<br />
Healing<br />
Root<br />
Walking Sleep<br />
Envenomed Breath<br />
Affliction<br />
Regeneration<br />
Cannibalize<br />
(I would then swap out the last slot for SoW or Gate)<br />
<br />
I would find a Mob and pull with Walking Sleep if resisted cast again, it is important to get the mob slowed, DoT it with Tainted (sometimes I cast Affliction too depending on the mob) and commence to poke the crap out of it with my spear.  The mob hitting you will cause your defense skill to raise...that's free AC. <br />
If your health gets a little low during the battle...root and back up, heal yourself. Usually I would only have to use Envenomed Breath as my only DoT, a slowed mob is much easier to handle, use Walking Sleep (you have it for a reason). Slow will become your most vital spell...use it, learn to love it ! <br />
I hunted at 2 spots in LOIO. One was at the pillars, I would find a spot on the shore and pull to it. Very safe way to pull, I have never (I repeat NEVER) died at that spot. I've only died in LOIO when I grouped inside the Sarnak fort. Second spot I found was outside the Sarnak fort, you can pull wandering Tigers, Gobbys, Sarnaks, Skeletons...I've never died there either. <br />
Another way to fight solo is use the Root/Rot technique. This is how I used Root/Rot......I pulled mob with Affliction, then root it. Cast Envenmoed Breath, re-root if necessary then cannibalize. When EB fades cast it again, re-root when needed. Watch the mob rot to death (that's the fun part). This is a very effective technique to use on mobs with alot of HP's. But your battle skills will  suffer as you won't be getting hit, so your defense skill will not raise. Neither will your weapon skills. So either choice is viable for a Shaman, the choice is yours. Find a basic technique and apply your own style to it. But get your Defense skill maxed it will help you to no end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see slow in there. You don't mention how you are soloing. Do you root rot or tank them? If you're tanking start slowing. That will reduce the damage you take during the fight and lessen down time.<br />
<br />
IMO if you are root rotting start tanking. You'll need the defensive skills you'll gain by doing so.<br />
<br />
What I did at that those levels was basically pull with slow, dot them, then whack on them with my centi warhammer. Reapply dot and heal myself as required. Soloing does get a lot better when you get a pet.<br />
<br />
The exp is really slow, and the loot is worse<br />
<br />
Exp outdoors sucks. There are some decent places. I think OOT and TD have decent zone exp modifers. I did most of 49 in OOT on seafuries pretty quickly anyway. Might want to look into these zones for things you can kill. If I recall correctly there is an island in TD that has some ape things (gorgas?) around your level or maybe a bit higher in TD. I didn't exp there so I'm not sure but I've seen it mentioned here a couple times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you grouped in Paludal from 15-24 I'd assume your defense skill is quite lacking at present. It maxes at 120 at L 24, and if you aren't at LEAST over 100 yet you need to work hard on raising it. The advice given by others already is very good, but it may not work terribly well until your defense skill is caught up (neither will mine). Nevertheless, keep at it, tank the mobs down, and get your defense skill caught up. It only gets harder to raise it later on. <br />
<br />
One other suggestion: put Frost Strike in your lineup. I'd use Stormrazor's suggested spel lineup, except swap in Frost Strike for Affliction. Frost Strike is not much less mana-efficient than Affliction, and does all the damage in one shot.  It's not good for root-rotting, obviously, but you want to tank to raise defense anyway. If your defense is really low, you'll need to nuke the mobs down while you tank them. You'll have a lot of downtime this way, but you'll be making positive exp and your defense skill will go up if you keep at it. <br />
<br />
Try to find low blues to work defense with. Start with slow, then Envenomed breath, then melee. Nuke and heal as needed. Root if you need to back off to heal up.  Time your SoW and keep it up at all times, in case things go badly and you need to run. If your defense is already caught up somehow, then this should be fairly easy. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are at a great spot levelwise to experiment with different playstyles.  You can die lots and it really won't set you back much at all.<br />
<br />
Your DoTs at 24 are really not abusive enough to take out a mob on their own so you will prolly want to throw in some nice Ice DD damage.  Try keeping Flash of Light in your line up as well because it can save your azz when a root breaks, your SoW drops, and you are LOM.  Your lower level slows are not impactful enough to waste a slot on while fighting outdoors and Frenzy is something I would trade out for another spell.<br />
<br />
Given some of the gear that shammies now have access to at low level, I would guess that melee below 34 is pretty viable, but I think you would be better off learning how to keep a mob out of reach till you level up a bit. <br />
<br />
Definitely spend some of your solo level time indoors to build skills and just switch up when you get bored.  The best gaming in EQ is in dungeons and zones where you can't just run away from a threat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the quick reply guys. My defense is almost maxed, as well as my piercing and my offense. When I was grouped in P Caverns I did a lot of tanking. Skills cap at 125 at level 24. Is slowing the mob really that important? I never really noticed a difference as they were still beating the crude out of me :). What I usually do when trying to solo is to root it, cast envenomed breath on it and wait until it's under half life or 1/4 of it's life, then I melee it. Thanks a bunch for the spell line up Storm, and thanks for the advice guys. - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Slowing the mob you are fighting is the #1 thing we are best at, it is VERY important.  I solo'd in loio with 3 different shaman through 15-30th level.  I never kited anything just slowed it, dotted it up and tanked it down.  Ive done this through most my eq career, which allowed me to max my defense at level 42 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Slowing is very important, it may not seem like it now because let's face it Walking Sleep isn't that great but, it's better than nothing. I tank Hill Giants, quite easily in fact. I was recently grouped with a Rogue and Ranger, and I was the main tank. I had more AC than the Ranger and more AC and HP's than the Rogue. I cast Togor's and would beat the snot out of a HG. Ranger was getting mad because he would try to taunt it off of me and wonder why I wasn't getting the smackdown laid on me. <br />
Regen+AC+Togors = DEAD Giant ! Slow is very important ! When you get a better Slow like Tagar's you'll notice a huge difference. <br />
Slow will allow you to tank mobs that scare melees ! I've been able to tank mobs at 42 that my 44 SK cannot because of Slow ! <br />
My 44 SK has more AC and HP's but yet gets a serious beating put on him by mobs my Shaman was tanking at 39. Slow makes a difference. Slowing is what makes a Shaman so vital to raids....Enchanters can slow but not nearly as good as a Shammy plus Slow generates aggro, ever seen an Enchanter get punched by a Kael giant ? They fold like a wet napkin ! Shaman are like Timex's...&quot;take a licking and keeps on ticking&quot;  You'll learn to love Slow, trust me as it will save your life and allow you to solo/tank things other classes can't ! <br />
<br />
DoT+melee will do more damage than just rooting+DoT. Root when you need to heal. When you get a pet, soloing will come much easier, soloing will also get easier once you have a better slow, like Tagars. <br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow, thanks for the great advice guys. I now have a much better understanding of how to solo and what to do. Thanks for the much needed advice and help :). - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Don't know what weapon you're using, but if you're soloing and using melee, having a good weapon will help A LOT at your level, since you can still hit the mobs.  I've seen centi warhammers on sale in the bazaar for 50-100 plat (more often 200-300).  Get a weapon with at least that good a ratio.  Possible cheap weapons:<br />
<br />
 - centi warhammer<br />
 - slime coated harpoon<br />
 - drakkel icegrinder<br />
<br />
Don't underestimate the value of having a better weapon.  If you deal out 30 percent extra damage during the fight with your weapon, it'll be just as good an improvement as slowing the mob so it does 30 percent less.<br />
<br />
 - Kazim</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>extra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">as far as weapons, i use a two hand blunt, but it doesn't really matter.  good that your defense is close to maxed.  the best place to work on defense is get another healer, and go to echo caverns, and hunt the needlites.  they hit VERY VERY fast, so your defense will max in a matter of minutes :)<br />
<br />
As far as 24-30, let me give you my advice on where i did it :)<br />
<br />
spell line up:<br />
<br />
walking sleep<br />
root<br />
malise<br />
e-breath<br />
affliction<br />
regeneration/swapped out with frenzy or other buffs<br />
cani<br />
gate<br />
snare necklace (duno if your a troll and have this or not, more on this later)<br />
<br />
.....<br />
<br />
go to the brute caves, in warsliks wood.  they are right outside the dalnir zone, there are two rooms.  one room has three brutes, one has two.  the zone into dalnir is close, if your sowed and something goes wrong it's about 10 seconds - 45 seconds away at worst, you'll never die.<br />
<br />
I pulled a brute with slow, then i would affliction and e-breath and root it.   Re-apply root, e-breath, as needed.  About the time the first e-breath would wear off i would run in and melee it until it died.<br />
<br />
you do NOT want to let these run.  they will warp through the wall, go under the world, and kill you.  GM's wont help.  i've been /bug reporting this every day forever and it's never going to get fixed, so make SURE they dont run.  if you have the snare necklace use it often, otherwise i suggest maybe keeping a DD memmed to finish them off quickly.</div></div><hr />
