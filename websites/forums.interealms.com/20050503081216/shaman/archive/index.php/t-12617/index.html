<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you haven't already seen it, go to www.everquest.com .<br />
<br />
There seems to be a new Iksar model. Dunno if this is for a new expansion or if they are re-doing the Luclin models. I thought I read somewhere before about SoE admitting that the luclin models were rushed, so maybe they are fixing them?<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it looks great. The texture quality seems to be lower than Luclin ones though. The only thing wrong with this model, IMO, is the face. It looks like a mask.  :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guess is its for EQ2.  I know Sony Online Entertainment too well to think they might do something that wouldn't provide immediate profit gratification.  Although I could conceivably see this being either a stormhammer feature, or a feature you only get if you buy their next expansion; something along those lines.  I'll shut up now, I might be giving them ideas :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My guess is its for EQ2.<br />
<br />
I doubt it. Even by EQ 1 standards the model texture seems to be pretty low quality. With EQ2 they're always boasting about their &quot;Brand new, state-of-the-art, super graphics engine&quot; lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bazoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EQ2 models are MUCH better than this, hopefully this is an upgrade to excisting models.<br />
<br />
I read how the new froglok models use less memory and cause less lag, simply because they had the proper time needed to finish it and optimize it.<br />
<br />
&quot;crosses fingers for new models&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
--- edit---<br />
<br />
Probably just the start of upgrading some of the armor, which they have talked about earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hullk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The new iksars for EQ 2 looked much better.  At the fan fair in Las Vegas, they used an iksar for the demo they ran, and it was quite different...<br />
<br />
Maybe it's another expansion that's about to be announced?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sardak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, is it just me or does the actual iksar himself not look as good as the current models.. especially the head. I really like the robe he is wearing, that looks great.<br />
<br />
If its another expansion I hope they take more time with it, I wasnt to impressed with LoY, it seemed rushed and lacking in content.<br />
<br />
If its EQ2, I hope they redo the model lol...<br />
<br />
If its free new models for the current EQ game available next patch... then woot! (this is what i hope it is)<br />
<br />
However... could it possibly just be Iksar for the PS2 version of everquest? I sure hope thats not it. With the vast majority of EQ users being PC users.. it would be VERY wrong to get peoples hopes up by putting that picture on www.everquest.com if it is indeed just a model for the PS2 version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice armour but the rest of the model is ugly.  Especially the head and hands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">looks much more like consept art to me =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darkoth Utgard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It could be a sample of the new armor graphics they are (supposedly) working on. That would be my guess.<br />
<br />

Lucid Chimera<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tranzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">not buying that expansion if that is what they are going to make mne look like..armour is nice but the actually body...ick...we Iskar look fine how we are now i think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm guessing NPC in a new expansion. The poly count looks really low, especially compared to some of the newer models.... I wouldn't rule out a PS2 expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My guess, crap we ain't going to see, or crap we will complain bout if we do see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyone else wonder if this might be VS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Is it just me or does that model have a strong Warhammer 40k, Games Workshop look to it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The armour itself looks nice in my opinion, as someone else said, vaguely 40k with a side helping of Morrowind.<br />
<br />
I could accept the 'rougher' base humanoid models if it meant having lots and lots of different armour looks instead of the 3 or 4 per race we have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It doesn't look anything like the pic of the EverQuest II Iksar I saw in CGW this month. I hope it's an expansion for EQOA. :)<br />
<br />
-Tok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">judging by the sharp changes in angles in it and poor texture quality , i would say its the console version.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's a pic of VS.  How many of us actually run our systems with all the new models on?  They can do all they want with EQ 1 graphics they want, but let's fix the stuff that already exists in the game and needs to be fixed before upgrading other things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">They updated the picture! Is it just me or does the dark elf woman look sorta WarCraft-ish? :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just got some information that I think may be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. If this is correct, then I don't think these models, or the armor are for EQ that we play. Here's a quote..<br />

<br />
It appears this is either for the new Real-Time Strategy game they are making, or the PS2 game they're making. I think it's the RTS EQ. Personnally, I don't think a RTS EQ game would be BAD, but I was really hoping for armor updates in EQ. :(<br />
<br />
I may get the RTS EQ game though, depending on a few things, especially if I have to pay to play like EQ is now. That would blow.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I wouldn't worry too much about the development of this game interfering with EQ proper.  Like EQOA and Starwars Galaxies, I'm sure this game won't be sharing developers with the EQ staff.  My guess is that these Rapid Eye Entertainment yahoos will be doing most of the work and somebody from Sony will just pop in every few months to make sure they aren't turning out an absolute piece of junk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Looks very much like WC3 stuff ....<br />
<br />
So long<br />
Nirtox</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yeah, that makes more sense. It's either an RTS, or they're developing an RPG in the Everquest world that will play more like Neverwinter Nights.<br />
<br />
.... EQ with plot?<br />
Naaaaaah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Leave the current new models but FOR GOD'S SAKE FIX THE DAMN ANIMATIONS THEY ARE ASSTASTIC.<br />
<br />
Everytime I see the 2hb motion I am just astounded they let them go live like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">/agree Krakster<br />
<br />
How hard can it be to replace the current 2hb animations with the 2hs animations, which, curiously enough, USE IDENTICAL MOVEMENT to what the 2hb should look like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Theres a new pic up at everquest.com. This time its a whole view, including the interface and it is indeed an RTS EQ. :) There's even a count down timer. It's at about 31 hours so far.</div></div><hr />
