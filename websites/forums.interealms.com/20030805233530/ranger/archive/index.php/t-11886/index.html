I'm tired of people over using name for the Lord of the Rings. :( <br />
<br />
More over it ticks me when people make characthers with the wrong race as the character was in the book.<br />
<br />
Even though most of the Races of the characthers in the book are easy to figure out, ex Legolas: Wood Elf, Frodo: Halfling.<br />
<br />
Now for those who dont know:<br />
Aragorn, Elrond, Arwen ARE Half Elves, NOT Wood Elves!:mad: <br />
<br />
This includes all varations of their names:<br />

<br />
Lets start with Elrond<br />
Direct qoute from the Quenta Sillmarillion: Chapter 24 Of the Voyage of Earendil and the War of Wrath<br />
“Bright Earendil as then lord of the people that dwelt nigh to Sirion’s mouths; and he took to wife Elwing to the fair, and she bore to him Elrond and Elros, who are called Helf-elven.”<br />
<br />
Boy, you must be confused! Betcha didn’t know the Elrond had a brother!<br />
<br />
Now if Elrond if a Half Elf, guess what? By default so is Arwen!<br />
<br />
Back to Elros, the first King of the Numenor, which descended to the Dunedain.<br />
Isildur, the Dunedain king that slew Sauron in the first battle for the ring, took the ring for him self and was slain in a river by a band of orcs that were tracking him after the victory, which lead the ring to be found by Golum, which lead to the Hobbit, but that’s getting off track.<br />
Aragorn is the 39th descendent from Isildur.<br />
<br />
So. Aragorn is a direct descendent of Elros (see quote above) it appears that Aragorn has Elven blood, no matter how diluted its still Elven blood, and anyone with Elven and Human blood is by definition a Half Elf.<br />
<br />
And yes, this means that Arwen is Aragorn’s great, great, great… aunt! Incest!<br />
<br />
As for Legolas, he is clearly not a Paladin (Paladins are rather bulky, loud and ungraceful, you try sneaking in a full set of plate armor), and Paladins are the only High Elven class to use bows.<br />
I think of him more as a Wood Elf Rogue.<br />
<br />
You have become better at Elven Lore (255)!<br />
Thanks for trying TeknoNurd, but I love a good challange!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Iluvitar Ar'Simaril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was just about to say that about Arwen and Aragorn... eww gross!<br />
<br />
Anyways, as far as high elves go, I'd consider Galadriel to be one, she is Noldorian. Plus she's been around since the awakening of the elves in the First Age, so she's probaly thee eldest in all Middle Earth. Only ones off hand who would be as old as she is would be her husband Celeborn. <br />
<br />
Well if you think about it Sauron is actually thee eldest 'being' considering he's of the Maiar(equivelent to an angel). However, it is also believed that the Istari, also known as the great Wizards were Maiar as well. They however did not walk Middle-Earth until the Third Age, so I guess they depending on how you look at it, not in running for the eldest. ... ... ... I'm running off topic here aren't I? Well since I'm on this post subject it would be interesting to know that the Bailrogs were most likely Maiar as well. Neat-o eh!?<br />
<br />
Anyways, so lets do the math here. If you consider Elrond's wife Celebrian to be full elf, which she is because she is from a pure 'high elf' blood line that would make Arwen a mutt so to speak. She would be 1/3 High Elf, 1/3 Elf,  and 1/3 Human. As far as her 'soul' is concerned she is elf. Forever ageless was she until she bound herself to Aragorn making her human, thus giving her the &quot;gift of man&quot;, death.<br />
<br />
Aragorn, as stated before is in a long line, Elronds nephew. Because Elros, being half human and half elf, he had the choice of either being counted amongst man or elf. He choose Human as you can probably deduct. Because he had been from elvish blood he was given a lengthened life of 500 years, from then on all his offsprings, offsprings and so on, and so forth were granted the same gift of long life. When we first meet Aragorn in LotR:FotR he was 87 years old. Looked his age didn't he ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shenlong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Legolas was a messenger from Thranduil's halls, he is a Wood Elf.  <br />
<br />
Also, just so you guys know, all the &quot;rangers&quot;, also called Dunedain, in LoTR were Half Elves.  Thats just what they called them.  They were all descendants of the Numenoreans, who actually also had part Maiar in them.<br />
<br />
BTW, where did you get that Arwen gave up her &quot;elf-hood&quot; (or whatever you wanna call it) when she bound herself to Aragorn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>clailya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dont have the simerillion on hand right now but i believe some where in there it says that when an elf gives thier hand to a mortal they shall also become mortal ... something of that sort paraphrased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shenlong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think you may be thinking of a special case.  Beren and Luthien.  Luthien chose to be mortal, even though she was born elf, so that she could be together with Beren forever.  You may be right, but I'm guessing that this is what you may be thinking of.  The Valar (Gods, pretty much)  actually gave her that choice, it wasn't automatic or anything...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>MadWarper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Who knew my thread would still so much intrest?<br />
<br />
Although, Illuvatar gave both Elrond and Elros judgement on their race, they were alowed to chose their destiny: eigther man or elf. <br />
This said, their blood was not purified, despite the path they chose.<br />
<br />
True to what you said, the Numeron life WAS long, but it shortened after the Numenor grew proud, weary of the visiting Eldar and became jealous of the Valar. Madness and disease set in after the ear of Ar-Pharazon was corrupted by Sauron.<br />
info from Akallabeth<br />
<br />
As for Arwen, if you consider Celebrian to be a full High Elf and Elrond to be Half Elf, thats <br />
1/2Elrond+1/2Celebrian=1/2 Half Elf+1/2 High Elf<br />
                                              1/4 Elf+1/4 Human+ 1/2 High Elf<br />
But I dont recall Tolkien ever saying the diffrense between Wood Elves and High Elves, only Elves and Dark Elves (please correct me if I am wrong, I'ld love to know which part of the book this is in). The only refrence I can think of is wether some elf is paler than another, which IMO doesnt change the race.<br />
<br />
I agree that her 'Soul' is that of elven, but allow me to reffer to D&amp;D, which is based heavily on LotR (and EQ is heavily based on D&amp;D and LotR), that any one with a drop of elven blood can equip Elven only items, i guess this refers to the soul of an elf allows them to wield the particular item.<br />
<br />
I dont belive that she gave up her elvish ways any more than Elrond gave up his humanistic features.<br />
<br />
As for the story of Beren the One Handed and his bride Luthien, no mere Valar (NOT GODS, i have read both the Silmarillion and the complete set of the Books of Lost Tales) has the power to reverse the gifts of Illuvatar. It was Manwe who released Luthien from her stay in the halls of Mandos to her second life with Beren, only after Illuvatar willed it so.<br />
<br />
As for Sauron being the oldest Being?!?<br />
I must pay respect to possibly the most powerful being, if not only the coolest person mentioned in the entire LotR trilorgy...<br />
Tom Bombadil!:cool: <br />
Saved Frodo's arse twice, strongly considered to protect the ring, was not able to be corrupted by the ring!<br />
What really ticked me off is that they left him out of the movie! :mad: I will forever hate The Fellowship of the Ring, just because of this! <br />
(Not that I woulndnt buy it, i'll just hate every second of it :rolleyes: )<br />
And for the wizards, Istari werent belived to be Maiar, they were (that is if take Tolkien's word as law, like me;) ). Who is say they didnt walk on midlle earth until the third age? Maiar like the Valar have the ability to travel as they wish, in any form.<br />
<br />
Boy, i didn't plan on the post being this long, but if made it this far, I promise that this will be the las bit.<br />
I'ld like to draw comparasion to the Ranger dieties to their Valar counter parts.<br />
EQ:<br />
Karana -live a nomadic lifestyle, travelling where the winds take them<br />
             -worship the life-giving power of the rain and respect the destructive force of a sandstorm or hurricane<br />
Tunare -appears as a very attractive older humanoid female wearing flowing robes and a crown of vines and leaves. Tunare is very protective of what she considers to be one of Her finest achievements, the good elf races of Norrath<br />
Valar:<br />
Manwe -his delight is in the winds and the clouds, and in all the regions of the air, from the heights th the depths, from the utmost borders of the Veil of Arada. All swift birds, strong of wing, he loves, and they come and go at his bidding<br />
Yavanna -the Giver of Fruits. She is the lover of all things that grow in the earth, and their countless forms she holds in her mind<br />
My conclusion: <br />
Karana=Manwe                Tunare=Yavanna<br />
Manwe is Lord of the Valar, and likewise Karana is Lord of EQ Dieties!<br />
While Tunare should be respected, I am as swift as a Bird, my Bow is my wing, and my arrows fly to Karana's bidding!<br />

In the Book of Lost Tales (Volume One) deals with a traveler on a great quest, who stops in a village for the night at the last house, on the last row. Anyway here he realizes thet this house is the only one in the village that is occupied with elves, and they have all sorts of nifty, crazy customs and powers (I'ld advise reading it), that night the elder tells a tale the resembles the Ainulindale. The next morninghe awakes and find his spirit for traveling has left him. He then askes the gardener about the 'gods', the gardner corrects him saying the the term 'gods' is an inaccurate 'human' term and that the Valar are not 'gods', and explains this by telling him the Valaquenta.<br />
Rember that the Silmarillion is written from an Elvish point of view.<br />

It's a pretty interesting read. You get the same story told to you with all of the strange name and race variations to the characters we're used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Iluvitar Ar'Simaril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Definition of Istari, taken from the official J.R.R Tolkien Dictionary - (Q,) Five (or more) beings sent to MIddle-earth by the Valar about TA 1000 to unite and consel the Free Peoples in their struggles against Sauron. They wer forbidden to dominate the peoples of MIddle-earth or to match Sauron's power with power. When Saruman, the greatest of Wizards, disobeyed this injunction, he was cast from the order and banished from Valinor. At the end of the Third Age the Istari passed from sight, for  with the fall of Sauron their work was done. Gandalf passed over Sea with the Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings, and the other surviving Istari may also have returned to the West.<br />
The Istari bor the forms of old Men, although they were vigorous and aged very sloly. They possessed great skill of body and mind; their powers were focused through their staffs. Each of the Istari had his own color and grade within the Order. Saruman the White was the eldest and Gandalf the Grey second. The other wer Radagast the Brown and several unamed, who dwelt far in the east.<br />
The Origins of the Istari are veiled. Professor Tolkien said that they were Valar &quot;of a sort.&quot; If Olorion the Maia can be equated with the name Olorin borne by Gandalf &quot;in his youth in the West,&quot; then the Istari were Maiar, a conclustion made plausible by the equality of the power wielded by Gandalf and the Balrog of Moria.<br />
<br />
There ya have it. Like I said, they may have been as stated by this.<br />
<br />
Now for God's. I think it would be in this order and correspondence to equal in terms of modern day biblical terms.<br />
<br />
Iluvitar- the God, he who was, is and always shall be.<br />
<br />
Ainur(singular Ainu)- Spirits who dwell with Iluvitar. No physical form but spiritual beings. Amongst them came the Valar. I'd pretty much say these would be like the holy spirit kinda sorta, maybe not!?<br />
<br />
Valar- those who choose to bring into being the Alaquonde, or the desire of Iluvitar. They are the watchers of Ea. I'd consider these to be more like Greek Mythological gods. They did at times intervene in the destiny of Ea.<br />
<br />
Maiar- the lesser of the Valar. They 'often' took worldy forms. Angels as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Iluvitar Ar'Simaril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Now for those who dont know: <br />
Aragorn, Elrond, Arwen ARE Half Elves, NOT Wood Elves!  <br />
<br />
Aragorn is a human you dumbass watch the movie more he is a human ranger but i agree with you they should hafto change theird names!:cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shenlong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Olorin - A Maia, one of the Istari (Wizards); see Mithrandir, Gandalf, and cf. The Two Towers IV 5: 'Olorin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten'. 30-I<br />
<br />
From the index of the Silmarillion.  So I think it's reasonable to assume that if one of the Istari was a Maia, that the other were too.<br />
<br />
Also, the names of the other 2 Istari were Alatar, and Pallando, I THINK.  I have a buch of cards from the old CCG, and they are the other 2 wizard cards.  I don't think they made stuff up for the cards, although its a possiblity.<br />
<br />
And ARAGORN ISN'T HUMAN...  I don't know which you are actually saying he is in your post (Iluvitar), but He's half-elf.  All of the Dunedain are.  He's Descended from Elros, a half-elf, therefore making him a half-elf...<br />
<br />
Besides, you shouldn't even try bringing that horrible movie into it... Heck, you shouldn't even be watching the stupid thing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Evenshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">.......get your Tolkien Elf lore straight people:(<br />
<br />
Legolas is the son of Thranduil who is king of the Wood-elves of Mirkwood forest, he's NOT one of Elrond's people in Rivendell, and though acting as a messenger to the council, he's certainly NOT a &quot;messenger&quot;.  Pure &quot;wood elf&quot;.   Keep reading and I'll explain where wood elves fit in.<br />
<br />
In the beginning, the elves split into the Eldar, who decided to make the journey to Valinor, and the Avari (&quot;unwilling&quot;) who never saw the light of the two trees, and never left middle earth.<br />
<br />
The Eldar who journeyed into the uttermost west from Cuivienen (the place of  their birth) were divided into three Kindreds. <br />
<br />
    The Vanyar or Fair elves, led by Ingwe, the &quot;most high lord&quot; of all the elves, is the first branch.  Once the Fair elves made it to Valinor, they never left it, save once, and thus you don't hear much about them at all.  If anyone would be considered &quot;high elves&quot; this is them.<br />
<br />
The next branch is the Noldor, or Deep elves, led by Finwe.  These are the elves most featured in Tolkien's stories.   Their tragedies and oaths and wars and tales make up the bulk of the Silmarillion. Galadriel is the highest born, and probably oldest remaining Noldorin elf in Middle earth at the time of LotR.  Tolkien doesn't say, but Elrond gathered into Rivendell most of the remaining Noldor in Middle Earth, some of great age.  Glorfindel, who meets Aragorn and the hobbits on the road (NOT Arwen, for those of you who have only seen the movie), has been to Valinor, and its possible, though never stated, that there may be Elves as old or older in Rivendell.  It is possible, though not likely, that any of them could be as old or older than Galadriel.  HOWEVER, she certainly has the highest blood.  She is a &quot;princess&quot; so to speak, of the royal house of the Noldor.     <br />
<br />
The third Kindred is the Teleri, or Sea-elves. Their two lords (there were a lot of them) were Elwe (later Elu Thingol, King of Doriath), and Olwe, who led the majority into the west.  Most of the Teleri made it to the Blessed realm eventually, but quite a few didn't and stayed in middle earth.  Those that stayed, of this kin, Elwe collected under his rule in the Kingdom of Doriath, and they became the Sindar, or Grey-elves.  Celeborn, husband of Galadriel and lord of Lorien, was of this folk, as are Thranduil, and his son Legolas.  They are elves that never made it to the blessed realm, but were willing to make most of the trip.  They are called Umanyar, a division of the Moriquendi (Elves of the Darkness).   <br />
<br />
Those elves who made it to Valinor, are known as Calaquendi, or Elves of the Light.   This has nothing whatsoever to do with the color of their skin, a la Drizzt, or DEs in EQ, but simply reflects that the elves that made it to Valinor saw the light of the two trees, before they were destroyed.  The elves left in middle earth are elves of the darkness, because they never saw light save the stars, till the Sun and the moon arose, after the fall of the trees.<br />
<br />
Confused yet:)?<br />
<br />
Thranduil's folk were referred to as wood elves because they lived in Mirkwood forest, not because of race.  They are related to Celeborn's people in Lorien, because both, originally, are Teleri.  <br />
<br />
Tolkien, technically, has no high elves.  If any reference is made to high elves, it merely refers to an Elf that has seen the light of Aman.  VERY few of these left in middle earth at the time of LotR. If you were to ask an elf :)  they would say that the high elves are the Vanyar.<br />
<br />
Eol IS referred to as a dark-elf.   I think this confuses people, but shouldn't, because all it means is that he is an elf that never left middle earth, and never wanted to. He's Moriquendi.<br />
<br />
Sigh, the Aragorn thing comes up so many times:(  Hes NOT a half elf.  Elrond, Arwen, and Elrond's two sons, are peredhil, or half elves.  They, and they alone, have the choice to live as an elf, or as a man.<br />
<br />
Aragorn, though, is NOT completely human.   As pointed out, his grandsire about 60 times removed is Elros - Elrond's brother, also a son of Elwing (elf) and Earendil (man).  Elros' choice was to live as a man, and he was the first ruler of Numenor, and the line of kings descended from him.  Thus he has a BIT of elven blood, but is human - just not completely human.<br />

Alatar and Pallando is correct.  They are mentioned once (Unfinished Tales?).  They went eastward, and no one knows what happened to them.<br />
<br />
The oldest ELF left in middle earth would be Cirdan the Shipright.   The oldest Maiar?  I doubt anyone knows, but Iarwain ben-adar is prolly the oldest constantly inhabiting middle earth, and I doubt its possible to argue Sauron is older or younger.<br />

<br />
This is contradictory... You just said &quot;he was a messenger, but he wasn't a messenger.&quot;...<br />
<br />
Plus, Aragorn is half-elf.  Elros was given a choice for him and his decendants to either have the gift of the Elfs, or the gift of the Humans.  When he chose the humans gift he didn't just suddenly become human.  He was still half elf, he just wasn't immortal, And was acttually closer to half elf than Elrond in DnD terms (Since in DnD half elfs aren't immortal, they just live longer than humans).  Though Technically, Aragorn may have been closer to 1/20 elf, if you use the DnD system (since tolkien never made a system of any sort), as long as you have any reasonable amount of elven blood in your veins, your half elf.<br />
<br />
You can disagree on the Aragorn part if you want, but the fact is he still has Elvish and Maiar and Mortal blood in him, and I would still call him a Half Elf.</div></div><hr />

In LotR (alone), Aragorn is presented as Human.  I accept this (even though other sources indicate he is ::gasp:: 1% Elf).  &quot;Ranger&quot; in LotR had a different meaning (by my reading of it) than an EQ &quot;Ranger&quot;.<br />
<br />
In LotR (Alone), Elrond and Arwen are presented as Elvish (I don't recall in my readings any mention of them being half-elvish).  I would liken them to 'High-Elves' only because this is how I viewed them from their descriptions.  There is really no distinction (racially) made between Elves in LotR as I recall.  Elves are Elves are Elves.<br />
<br />
I don't recall mention of Dark Elves (or Drow).  I do recall that Orcs were created to be an evil interpretation of Elves.<br />

<br />
You are very conveniently ignoring all the generations between Elros and Aragorn.  Have a look at the geneology sometime.  How long do you get to dilute elven blood, before he is considered human?  he's not even a 20th part.  Its a LONG list of kings he's descended from, all of whom married human women.  Take into account all the generations of the numenorean kings, then all the lords of Andunie, then all the dispossessed kings of Arnor, then tell me just how much elf blood he has.<br />
<br />
The fact however still remains, that the bloodline is there, and he is PART elf, if a very very very miniscule part.  <br />
<br />
The fact also remains, that in Tolkien's terms, he is NOT a half elf.  You can apply D&amp;D, or EQ, or Warhammer, or any system you want to it, and that fact still stands.   <br />
<br />
Tekno, unfortunately LotR doesn't stand in a vacuum, and in order to understand some of what is going on there, its pretty much a given that one has to read the Silmarillion.  This is not to say that one can't just read and enjoy LotR, but just that so many of the events and history related in LotR lead one back to the first and second ages.  Bloodlines and racial discussions are one of the ones its pretty much impossible to untangle without going to the Silmarillion.<br />
<br />
I did NOT say Drow, as once again thats bringing Dungeons and Dragons into Tolkien, something that is a mistake, since Tolkien predates D&amp;D by many years.  I said Dark-elves, or Moriquendi, and the only references to them are in the Silmarillion.<br />
<br />
There is certainly a distinction between Elves, all through LotR. The difference between Gildor and his people is explained. Contrast Gandalf's description of Glorfindel to Frodo, with Legolas - who has more power, and why?  Contrast Galadriel's power with Celeborn's.  Ever wonder why she has so much more power and craft than him?  Its not just the ring.  Its just that you can't really understand why they are different, or what you are seeing, without reading the greater tapestry of the Silmarillion.  <br />

That may have been what you meant, but it wasn't what you said.  Besides that, I didn't say he was simply a messenger and nothing more.  I was simply showing that he came from the halls of Thranduil, therefore being a wood elf.

Where does Tolkien define his version of a half elf?  I've never seen it, and if you can point me to it, I'll gladly say, you've been right all along.  But I've always considered him and all the Dunedain to be half elfs.  Especially since, I don't really think of humans living the 200+ years that he did...</div></div><hr />

    &quot;But when all was spoken, Manwe gave judgement, and he said: &quot;In this matter the power of doom is given to me.  The peril that he ventured for love of the Two kindreds shall not fall upon Earendil, nor shall it fall on Elwing his wife, who entered into peril for love of him;  but they shall not walk again ever among Elves or Men in the Outer Lands.  And this is my decree concerning them:  To Earendil, and to their sons, shall be given leave each to choose freely to which kindred their fates shall be joined, and under which kindred they shall be judged.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pq 249, &quot;of the voyage of Earendil&quot;, Silmarillion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Elros and Elrond his brother were descended from the three houses of the Edain, but in part also both from the Eldar and the Maiar; for Idril of Gondolin and Luthien daughter of Melian were their foremothers.  The Valar indeed may not withdraw the gift of death, which comes to Men from Iluvatar, but in the matter of the half-elven Iluvatar gave to them the judgement; and they judged that to the sons of Earendil should be given choice of their own destiny.  And Elrond chose to remain with the Firstborn, and to him the life of the Firstborn was granted.  But to Elros, who chose to be a king of Men, still a great span of years was allotted, many times that of the men of middle earth; and all his line, the kings and lords of the royal house, had long life even according to the measure of the Numenoreans.  But Elros lived 500 years, and ruled the Numenoreans four hundred years and ten.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pg 261, &quot;Akallabeth&quot;, Silmarillion<br />
<br />
Explains the long life rather well I thought.<br />
<br />
What I think you are forgetting, is that there aren't lots of half elves running around.  Beren and Luthien, their son Dior, and his daughter Elwing, and that line is finished.  Tuor and Idril Celebrindal, and their son Earendil.  Since Earendil and Elwing (as above)  are out of the picture, that leaves their children Elrond and Elros.  You are already aware of Elros choice, so any elven blood passed down from him, through the rulers of Numenor, is constantly diluted generation after generation - and its ONLY the rulers, no one else.   Thus the Dunedain have no elven blood at all, unless they married into that line, and Aragorn is the only one of that particular line that survives.<br />
<br />
Elrond's children have the choice of course, his two sons Elladan and Elrohir fight beside the Dunedain, but they are always &quot;the sons of Elrond&quot;, not Dunedain.<br />
<br />
Arwen makes her irrevocable choice to stay with Aragorn, and that line of half elves is done, because she chose to live as a mortal.  Her kids wont have the choice, because they aren't half elven.  They have elven BLOOD, but they aren't half Elven, according to Tolkien.<br />

<br />
 To Earendil, and to their sons, shall be given leave each to choose freely to which kindred their fates shall be joined, and under which kindred they shall be judged.&quot;<br />
<br />
To me this says, they got to choose wich gift they wanted.  The gift of immortality, or the gift of death.  Not that they got to choose if they wanted to be human or elf.  And yes, Elros living for 500 years does kind of explain the long life thing.  But you know why he lived that long?  Because he was HALF ELF.  I think if you still have enough elven blood in you that you can live to 200+ years old, I would still consider you half elven.<br />
<br />
I can accept the fact that I was wrong about the Dunedain all being half elf, but thats mostly because Aragorn is really the only Dunedain talked about extensively in all I've read.<br />
<br />
BTW, I have read the Slimarillion, The Hobbit, and the LoTR already.  In fact I just read those same 2 passage you quoted just the other day when looking up stuff for this thread.  I'm just looking for some definition by Tolkien as to what a half elf is.  Since you say  &quot;they aren't half Elven, according to Tolkien.&quot;, I'm just wondering where Tolkien actually defines half elfs.  I'm yet to see it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Dedolito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">&quot;but in the matter of the half-elven Iluvatar gave to them the judgement; and they judged that to the sons of Earendil should be given choice of their own destiny.

<br />
By that statement alone, a half-elf is defined by Tolken to be one who is given the choice to choose between eternal and mortal life.  Elros was given the gift of an extended life though he choose a mortal life, as were all his offspring of ruling caste (whom did not have the choice.  By the above definition of half-elf, those who can not choose are not half-elf).  This speaks to me as being more a gift bestowed on the line than the mere fact at having some elven blood in their veins.</div></div><hr />

Meaning they let the sons of Earendil choose what destiny thier whole line would have.  It doesn't say they let all half elfs choose thier destiney, it only says they gave that choice to the sons of Earendil.  Iluvatar let the Valar judge what destiny would befall the half elfs, and the Valar chose to let the sons of Earendil choose, not all half elfs, the sons of Earendil.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>TeknoNurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The Silmarillion is NOT part of the Lord of the Rings.  Lest you forget, the Silmarillion was not realease until some 20 years AFTER the LotR (40 years after the Hobbit).  The Silmarillion and the other 'authorities' were published after JRR Tolkien's death, were [supposedly] compiled from his notes by his son, added to and edited by his son.  JRR Tolkien was given 'authorship' to sell his sons books (There was no little controversy regarding this at the time).<br />
<br />
Until the Silmarillion, LotR did exist in a VOID of it's own, on it's own.  The histories you site where NOT important to the story of LotR.  Yes, events and people in previous ages were referenced and aluded to, but it was not imporant to the story of LotR that they be spelled out.<br />
<br />
Yes, Elves have different talents and abilities, it does not make them different 'races' of elves. By way of example, my brother and I have taken different paths in our lives, we do not resemble each other, we have vastly different skill sets, different outlooks on life, but that does not make us different 'races'.  I chalk up the differences in elves in LotR to environment, interest, and experience.<br />
<br />
Dark Elves are not mentioned in Lord of the Rings.  Period.<br />
<br />
Aragorn is Human in Lord of the Rings.  Period.<br />
<br />
Elrond and Arwen are Elves.  Period.<br />
<br />
So argue all you want about what JRR Tolkien's SON says about the history of LotR, I will accept and appreciate LotR as JRR Tolkien INTENDED it to be, on it's own.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Shenlong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Where did Evenshadow go?  I was actually having fun discussing Tolkien's work with him.  At least he could actually bring valid points to the table.<br />
<br />
Yes, The Silmarillion was compiled by Christopher.  It was still written by JRR Tolkien.  If you're interested in knowing more about Tolkiens world, instead of just that one story relating to it, yes The Silmarillion is important.  I personally like the whole world that Tolkien created, not just the story related in LoTR.  Yes, you can read LoTR and still get the same story with or without reading the other Tolkien books.  But not reading The Silmarillion is like not reading The Hobbit.  You will still get the same story from LoTR, but if you had read it, you would have a more complete understanding of the story.<br />
<br />
No, there aren't really different types of Elves in Tolkiens world.  But, he does call the Elves that live in Mirkwood, Wood Elfs.<br />
<br />
Aragorn = Half Elf.  (still not seen proof otherwise)<br />
<br />
Elrond = (Definetly) Half Elf<br />
<br />
Arwen = Dunno, haven't really thought about it, she doesn't <br />
                play that big of a role :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Evenshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">heh, sorry, RL, and &quot;breathing fresh air&quot; generally precludes me from poking around the internet too often during the day.<br />
<br />
The Arwen stuff is in Return of the King, Appendix A.<br />
<br />
&quot;When the Great Ring was unmade and the three were shorn of their power, then Elrond grew weary at last and forsook Middle-earth, never to return. But Arwen became as a mortal woman, and yet it was not her lot to die until all that she had gained was lost.&quot;<br />
<br />
She had the same choice to make as her father did.<br />
<br />
There's lots more there.<br />
<br />
Let me approach this from a different direction, which might make it clearer.  In Tolkien's world you are either an Elf, or a Man.  The death is the key here, and what happens after it, thus the above quote.  Elves are immortal, bound to the world, Men are not - no one knows what happens to them. <br />
<br />
The only grey area there, in all of Tolkiens writing, is the half-elven.  Thus they get to choose their fate, that of man, or elf, they don't get to fence-sit, cause that would screw up Iluvatar's scheme.<br />
<br />
Only those people who get to choose (Earendil, Elwing, Elrond, Elros, Elladan, Elrohir, Arwen) are the half-elves.  <br />
<br />
No one is arguing that Elven Blood doesn't exist in Elros line.  Just that after his choice, in all ways, his descendants are considered Men.<br />
<br />
Also, in order to be a half elf, it kind of requires that an Elf and a Man mate, how many times did this happen in Tolkien?  Beren and Luthien, Tuor and Idril, possibly one other case.   Makes the half elves pretty easy to track, cause every one of them is descended from these two matings.  <br />
<br />
In Aragorn's case, the Elven blood is diluted by about 23 generations in Numenor and then another 30 something in the north kingdom.  One can argue that Aragorn is half-elven all one wants, but considering that he died, and didn't get to make the choice that the Half-elven (his wife included) do; according to Tolkien, he is not.   I hope that makes it clearer.<br />
<br />
The only time Tolkien ever refers to Half elves, is in reference to Elrond and Elros.<br />
<br />
There is POSSIBLY one other case of Half elfness (:)), but it was only alluded to very briefly, was with a Sylvan elf and was never fleshed out at all.  <br />
<br />
Tekno, once again, LotR doesn't exist in a vacuum.  The Hobbit was published before it, and much of the Silmarillion was written prior to his writing LotR.  Much as you may like to think so, it doesn't stand alone, and Tolkien never intended it that way.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
In JRR Tolkien's mind, LotR definately was more.  Your assertion that JRR Tolkien never intended it (Hobbit and LotR) to stand on their own are not born out by fact.  JRR Tolkien did not publish anything related to LotR, therefore one can only surmise that WAS how he intended it.<br />
<br />
It is undoubtedly true that the notes that JRR Tolkien's SON published after his fathers death were created prior to LotR.  Obviously, LotR is very detailed and required extensive notes.  This being the case, why did not JRR publish them?  Because he did not intend they be published!  The published works were obviously intended to stand on their own (at least in the public domain) otherwise he would have published the additional works himself.<br />
<br />
Although C Tolkiens works are inspired of his father, may add to the world his father created, they are none-the-less not his fathers work.  For me, C's work lacked an undefinable spark that JRR's work contained. /shrug  By way of example, other authors have added to Asimov's Foundation series, have been ispired by Asimov, may add to the breadth of the Asimov's Empire, but they are not Asimov.  When one speaks of the Foundation Trilogy, one limits oneself to those books written by Asimov.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Shenlong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">OK, I never really read that appendix, planned on it, but for some reason never did...<br />
<br />
Relating to Aragorn, I see where your coming from.  BUT, it's never actually said that that is what determines if your half elf or not.  Besides that, I can't see how Arwen would be a half elf but not Aragorn.  Plus, how do you know that Aragorn didn't have the choice, and simply chose as his predecesors to remain as a King of men?  No matter what, I will probably always see Aragorn as half elf.  Since, like I said, if he had enough elven blood in him to live 200+ years (plus he apparently could have live longer, by reading that appendix), then I would still call him half elven.<br />
<br />
TeknoNurd, Tolkien never inteded for any of the books to be published.  I don't know what made him publish The Hobbit and LoTR, but he had originally just wrote them for fun or for stories to tell his son/grandson, something like that.  He didn't have time to publish anything other than what he did before he died, for various reasons, so you cannot just say that he didn't intend to.  He may very well have intended to and just didn't get the chance.  Also, Christopher did not write any of the stuff that he has published, JRR wrote everything.  He may have edited it, and added _slightly_ to it, but he did not write it.  It is still JRR's work.<br />
<br />
Thank YOU for listening :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Evenshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">...couple things here.   You say Tolkien didn't publish anything related to LotR, and yet where does that leave the Hobbit? <br />
<br />
Without the events in the Hobbit, it would be pretty much impossible to have LotR now, wouldn't it?<br />
<br />
I agree with what you are saying regarding Chris Tolkien's writing - he isn't a patch on his father.  What we are talking about isn't Chris Tolkien's writing however.<br />
<br />
In the Silmarillion, he acted as editor, choosing the versions of HIS FATHERS WRITING to put together.  It isn't Chris' work.  <br />
<br />
What you need to recall is that Tolkien was a major perfectionist and compulsive editor during his lifetime.  He continually re-wrote stories, and versions of stories, until he was happy with them.  What eventually became the Silmarillion was the framework of his world, but it was by no means complete, or perfect.  Hell, the poor guy had been working on his histories of Middle-earth for his entire life more or less.   A history is much harder to write well (so that it attracts people's interest) than a story about a finite timeperiod.   Heh, try it sometime, its hard.  Thus it wasn't published, but it is still his writing, and still his world.  Tolkien is one of those people you want to have a 200 year lifespan:)<br />
<br />
You say the Silmarillion should have no bearing on LotR, and yet in the appendices to LotR, the Silmarillion is mentioned:<br />
<br />
&quot;Of these things the full tale, and much else concerning Elves and Men is told in the Silmarillion&quot;  <br />
<br />
I'd say thats pretty darn good evidence that he intended to complete his historical work, and publish it.  Sadly, he ran out of time.  Also keep in mind that he was RELUCTANT to publish anything, or bring his stuff forth, until it was perfect - it was relatively unbroken ground at the time.<br />
<br />
I quit reading most of the published stuff a la Christopher Tolkien after Unfinished Tales was released, because, as you say, he isn't half the writer his father is.  It also appeared patently obvious that he was running out of stuff in semi-completed form done by his father, and was bringing out the writing exercises and the conceptual experiments.<br />
<br />
I understand that for a lot of people, the Silmarillion is hard to read, but you are robbing yourself of understanding much of what is happening in LotR, by not doing so.  <br />
<br />
Poking around in appendix A in LotR a bit ago, I came upon this quote, which may help the Half-elf stuff:<br />
<br />
&quot;The sons of Earendil were Elros and Elrond, the peredhil, or Half - Elven.  In them alone the line of the heroic chieftains of the Edain in the First age was preserved; and after the fall of Gil-Galad, the lineage of the High-Elven kings was also in Middle-earth only represented by their descendants.<br />
<br />
At the end of the First age the Valar gave to the Half-elven an irrevocable choice to which kindred they would belong.  Elrond chose to be of Elven-kind and became a master of wisdom. To him therefore was granted the same grace to those of the High Elves that still lingered in Middle-earth: that when weary at last of the mortal lands they could take ship from the Grey Havens and pass into the Uttermost West; and this grace continued after the change of the world.  But to the children of Elrond a choice was also appointed: to pass with him from the circles of the world; or if they remained, to become mortal and die in Middle-earth.  For Elrond, therefore, all chances of the War of the Ring were fraught with sorrow.&quot;<br />

Elvish name for middle earth (dont ask me if it's Sindarin or Quenya right now, I am going by memory cause my books are all the way in the bedroom right now and I am a lazy ranger this early in the morning)= enorrath. <br />
Anyhow, about this thing with Arwen making a choice...<br />
Not to give away the ending, but in RotK does she not give it to Frodo? There is one part-- she gives him a necklace, much like that random scene in the FotR movie with Aragorn... I thought that was sort of a representative of her immortality. Like here mate, I won't be needing this. Or maybe not but I swear I remember something like that...<br />
So her choice is not really much like her father's, is my point here.<br />
As for Legolas, he was rather acting as a messanger for his father. He didn't come there just for the council. He came to Rivendell (NOT his home, though I think someone already pointed that out) to tell them there that Gollum had escaped-- he had been held prisoner in Mirkwood before he escaped and was taken to Mordor. That's not in the movie, and I may have my timeline a bit messed up, but that's what he was doing there.<br />
I suppose Tharanduil knew he was in deep **** at that point, he thought &quot;Well better send the prince with this news-- Elrond HAS to be nice to him...&quot;<br />
Erm... it's early. I'm not quite awake...<br />
Anyhow there's my 2cp. Morning all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Evenshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">....this is beginning to get old.  What possible &quot;Choice&quot; could Aragorn have to make, since Elros his forebear made it for him?   After Elros made his decision to live as a man, all his descendants were.........wait for it..........Men.  They die, just like Aragorn, in appendix A.  ONLY the half Elven get a choice - as has been shown how many times now? See above again for who comes under the heading of Half-elven.<br />
<br />
You are getting into the realm of speculation, and yeah, its tempting to do it, but ultimately one can only go by what Tolkien chooses to reveal, otherwise......<br />
<br />
No, scratch that, anyone is free to believe whatever they want, even if Tolkien writes differently.  After all, he's only the author of the work - what does he know?<br />
<br />
Mezu:   Aye Arwen offers Frodo her place on the boat with Elrond, and gives him a &quot;white gem like a star that lay upon her breast hanging from a silver chain&quot;.   I think its more along the line of a gift to comfort him in a rough time than an actual official &quot;you get to go&quot; ticket, though I'd be hard pressed to prove that.  Who is going to deny the  ringbearers the solace of the Blessed realm, if they desire to go?  I imagine its a reward and a way of making up for what they have lost, all in one.<br />
<br />
The choice Arwen has is simple, yet profoundly sad - she and her brothers can sail to Aman with their father, and share in the life of the Eldar, or she can NOT go with him - and remain in middle-earth as a mortal, with her mortal husband, who will eventually die.  Really, the choice isn't actually hers, its more an extension of her father's fate. But she still must choose, due to her bloodline.  Call it the &quot;Elrond clause&quot;:)<br />
<br />
Ahh well.  I think I'm probably done here, unless someone says something stupidly outrageous. <br />
<br />
Evenshadow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Shenlong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">And since Elrond's children got that choice, wouldn't it make sense that Elros's children did too <br />
<br />
My point was, if Elrond's Children got THE choice (for being half elf), shouldn't Elros's Children also get that choice.  If that were true, then you can't truly say wether Aragorn had the choice or not, since it's not stated.  That was my point.  So, since there seems to be no clear cut answer, you go on beliving he's human, and I'll go on beliving he's Half Elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Beryllin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Weighing in a little:<br />
<br />
The gem Arwen gave Frodo was to comfort him, not a 'ticket', so to speak, to the Blessed Realm. After all, Bilbo went with Frodo, and no mention of him receiving such a gem.<br />
<br />
I suspect that if Elros's children had the choice of which Kindred to be counted as, it probably stopped at his children, (i.e. would not apply to his grandchildren, and Aragorn was many generations down the line.)<br />
<br />
I have always interpreted Tolkien's passage in Akallabeth to mean that the choice of Elrond made him Elven-kind, and the choice of Elros made him Human, therefor Aragorn is Human.<br />
<br />
I'm embarrassed to tell yas I don't have a copy of all the books handy atm, so I can look at it more closely. = )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Iluvitar Ar'Simaril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">PEREDHIL -(S.: 'half elven') Elros and Elfron, the two children of Earendil and Elwing. They were called the Peredhil because of their extremely mixed Adan and Eldarin blood. At the end of the First Age, the Peredhil were given the choice which race they wished to belong to. Elros chose to remain with the Edain, and he was given by the Valara life-span of many times that of lesser Men. Elrond became an Elven-lord or great power and wisdom. Elrond's children were also given the choice of which kindred they wished to belong to; the choice to be made when Elrond left Middle-earth. All three of his children chose mortality. Also called the Half-elven, a name which also refers the Earendil and Elwing.<br />
<br />
Someone asked for the definition, so there it is. Straight from the dictionary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Shenlong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">OK, one last point before I go...<br />
<br />
You can't really say wether Aragorn is Human or Half Elf as it's not actually stated out-right, and can be argued either way.<br />
<br />
There ya go, thats it, it's not been stated anywhere that Aragorn is in fact human or half elf.  I can live with that.  I just thought that maybe Evenshadow could prove me wrong, that was the only reason I continued this discussion this long.  I would in fact like to know one way or another, even if it turns out that I am wrong.  But, the fact that you suspect the choice would stop at Elros's children doesn't actually make it so.  It could have continued until the end of the line for all we know.  Again, it's never stated.<br />
<br />
There ya go, we still don't have an answer, but I'm done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Beryllin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Ok, how about this passage:<br />
<br />
'Fellowship of the Ring', from the chapter: 'The Ring goes South'<br />
<br />
Elrond speaking:<br />
<br />
'The Company of the Ring shall be Nine; and the Nine Walkers shall be set against the Nine Riders that are evil. With you and your faithful servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, and maybe the end of his labours.<br />
<br />
'For the rest, they shall represent the other Free Peoples of the World: Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Legolas shall be for the Elves; and Gimli son of Gloin for the Dwarves. They are willing to go at least to the passes of the Mountains, and maybe beyond. For men you shall have Aragorn son of Arathorn, for the Ring of Isildur concerns him closely.'<br />
<br />
Sounds like Elrond considered Aragorn a man, i.e. Human. I think Elrond would know. = )<br />
<br />
Edit: Misspelled Gimli, grrr. = )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Evenshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">....all you need to do is actually read, with an open mind.  Your entire Elros line of thought (given with no evidence whatsoever) is spurious.  <br />
<br />
As shown above (how many times?) the ONLY people who get a choice as to their fate are Elrond and Elros - as in deciding &quot;YES, I will die&quot; or &quot;NO I will go to Aman&quot;.  The Children are ruled by their parents choices, thus the children of Elrond get a choice TO GO WITH THEIR DAD OR NOT.  Thats it, thats all.  They share his doom.<br />
<br />
Earendil and Elwing have to decide as well, but since they are permanently confined to Aman, it really doesn't affect anything later on.<br />
<br />
The children of Elros also have to abide by their father's choice - and they get to die, because HE chose to.  If you DIE, and go beyond the world, you are a MAN.  Its not difficult to follow.<br />
<br />
How much plainer can I put it?<br />
<br />
Also, it seems to me I'm the only one to provide any evidence coming from Tolkien to support my views.  Show me any words wherein Tolkien even HINTS that the line of the Numenorean kings gets a choice between immortality and death, and I'll eat my words.  They get to choose WHEN THEY DIE but they still must die, as per Elros.  Happy reading:)<br />
<br />
<br />
Evenshadow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Beryllin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">If you read Akallabeth, it makes it very clear that the reason for the fall of Numenor was the jealousy of the leaders, who were jealous of the everlasting life of the Firstborn.<br />
<br />
That in itself makes them Men. If the children of Elros still had the option of which Kindred to choose, they wouldn't have had to make the totally foolish attempt to bring war to the Blessed Realm, they could have simply chosen to be numbered with the Firstborn. It is very clear that this option was no longer available to them, they were numbered with the Men.<br />
<br />
J. R. R. Tolkien wrote Akallabeth, though he didn't publish it. I don't see how any other alternative exists, but that Aragorn was a Man, not a Half-Elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Shenlong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">OK, it's been proven, though not by who I thought it would be proven by :) .  So, I'll admit now, I was wrong, Aragorn is counted as a mortal by Tolkien.  BUT, you must admit, he's also considered a Numenorian man.  Wich would generally translate to half elf in any other world.  If you were to compare Tolkiens work to DnD, Tolkiens Numenorians would relate to DnD's half elfs.  And so, I will always think of Aragorn as half elf, (even though I know that Tolkien considered him a man), and you can consider him a man :D .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now in respect on whether or not JRR wrote the Silmarillion...<br />
In the Foreword my copy's (written by Christopher) states that the beginings of the story line lay in JRR's notes dating back to 1917!<br />
&quot;On my father's death it fell to me to try to bring the work to publishable form.&quot;<br />
You could say that JRR made the pot, Christopher merely fired it up in the kiln. JRR made it, Christopher made it presentable.<br />
<br />
Now this is what I have been told by my friend's dad (one of those aging baby boomer hippie's that went gaga for the LotR when it was first published), he said that Tokien had devolped the story for the of the elven line of lore (that is from creation to the end of the third age, if not further) as a sort of never ending bed time story he told his kids, that he later rembered and wrote down (wish I had that type of memory).<br />
<br />
As mentioned, from the quote from FotR by Beryllin, that Aragorn represents humanity in the fellowship. How does Aragorn representing humans make him a mere human?<br />
Even if humanity dominates his gene pool.<br />
Aragorn will always be a Half Elf in my book, not matter who publishes it :)<br />
<br />
Iluvitar Ar'Simaril, you quote from a dictionary quite often. I only have to ask, who wrote this dictionary? I have a Tolkien beastiary, but I know that it was not written by JRR, Christopher or any Tolkien for that matter.<br />
<br />
And finally to TeknoNurd, <br />
I hope that you will read the Silmarillion. It may not be JRR's direct word of mouth, but I'ld prefer it over reading his tons of tons of notes.<br />
The LotR is able to stand alone, but was not ment to (and IMHO shouldn't). Until I read the Silmarillion, I ahd many questions that could be answered by LotR, (ex. What was a Balrog? There wasnt an adequate deffination any where in LotR.)<br />
I am sure that there are many hints to tales from the Silmarillion riddled through out LotR, but only one come to mind ATM, when the ring is finally destroyed, Sam make reffrence to how Frodo's plight will be sung about along with the Beren, the one handed thief (no doubt a reference to Beren and Luthien).<br />
I like think of the Silmarillion as a book-sized book report on the library of Tolkien's imagination.<br />

Just because he's representing men, doesn't mean he _has_ to be one.  But I guess it's about 99.99% sure that Tolkien did consider him to be man.  Though, like I said, he's still a Numenorean man.

<br />
Yes, he is descended from Numenorian ancestry, but so what? The choice of Elros is the important factor, and he chose to be Mankind. Making him a man. His descendants were bound by the choice he made. <br />
<br />
And, since Aragorn is a Tolkien character, and Tolkien wrote him as a Man, what he might or might not be in any other forum, medium, literature, etc, etc, is moot.<br />
<br />
Elvish blood? Of course, but Tolkien wrote Akallabeth in an unmistakable way, to show that the descendants of Elros were Men who became jealous of the everlasting life of the Elves, thus leading to the downfall of Numenor.<br />
<br />
Yes, there was Elvish blood in Aragorn, but the way Tolkien wrote the Akallabeth shows that the choice of the 2 sons made each a full member of the chosen race. i.e. Elrond was fully Elvish, Elros was fully Mankind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">shenlong... you're being stubborn to the point of idiocy.<br />
you're arguing that aragorn is half-elf by applying your own rules  to the world Tolkien created.  to present any sort of valid argument, you must operate by Tolkien's rules in Tolkien's world.  in his world, Aragorn is human.  the arguments here have clearly shown that.  in fact, in any reasonable world, Aragorn would be human.  assuming a low estimate of 50 generations between Aragorn and his closest elven ancestor, he is 8.882 x 10^-16 percent elf.<br />
just under 0.000000000000001%.  a far, far cry from 1/2.<br />
if you had a black ancestor 50 generations ago, with an entirely white ancestry other than one person, you would be absolutely indistinguishable from a white person.  actually, your ancestry would be almost indistinguishable about 5 generations down (1/32nd black).<br />
<br />
so essentially, your argument comes down to &quot;i believe Aragorn to be halfelf just because i want to, with no valid reasoning to back it up, and despite well-informed arguments to the contrary. you cannot convince me otherwise.&quot;  and honestly, this is no exaggeration at all.  take a good long look at your argument and you'll see.<br />

That right there took it to 99.99% proven for me.  Before that there was no concrete evidence, wich is what I was looking for.  The was only evidence based on assuptions, and peoples opinions.  <br />
<br />
I've already admitted that Tolkien considered him man.  In any other world though, Numenoreans would relate to half elfs.  If you were to create Aragorn in DnD he would most closely be represented by a half elf, not a man.  I state this because the original post was about people taking names from Tolkien and putting them on EQ characters.  So if you think about it, Aragorn would be closer to a half elf in EQ, I know he was a man in Tolkiens world, I'm talking about other worlds right now.<br />

After taking some considerable amount of time to re-read LotR, I have come to find facts to support the argument of Aragorn being Halfelven.<br />
<br />
The Silmarillion is NOT part of the Lord of the Rings.  Lest you forget, the Silmarillion was not realease until some 20 years AFTER the LotR (40 years after the Hobbit).  The Silmarillion and the other 'authorities' were published after JRR Tolkien's death, were [supposedly] compiled from his notes by his son, added to and edited by his son.  JRR Tolkien was given 'authorship' to sell his sons books (There was no little controversy regarding this at the time).<br />
<br />
Until the Silmarillion, LotR did exist in a VOID of it's own, on it's own.  The histories you site where NOT important to the story of LotR.  Yes, events and people in previous ages were referenced and aluded to, but it was not imporant to the story of LotR that they be spelled out.<br />
<br />
Fellowship of the Ring, Foreward <br />
This tale grew in telling, until it became a history of the Great War of the Ring and included many glimpses of the more anchient history the preceded it. It was begun soon after The Hobbit was written and befor its publication in 1937; but I did not go on with this sequel, for I wished first to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of elder days, which had then been taking shape for several years.<br />
<br />
Thus stated all information pulled from the Silmarillion and/or the Book of Lost Tales (which are the same thing) remains totally creditable, but to humor some of you I shall be stating facts from LotR itself.<br />
<br />
Fellowship of the Ring; Book I: Chapter #3 Three Is Company (page 93)<br />
'Rivendell!' said Frodo. 'Very good: I will go east, and make for Rivendell. I will take Sam to visit the Elves; he will be delighted.' He spoke lightly; but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the house of Elrond Halfelven, and breathe the air of that deep valley where many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace.<br />
<br />
Return of the King; Book V: Chapter #8 The Houses of Healing (page 153)<br />
Aragorn went first to Faramir, and then to Lady Eowyn, and last to Merry. When he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he sighed. 'Here I must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me,' he said. 'Would that Elrond were here, for he is the eldest of all our race, and has greater power.'<br />
<br />
First is the fact that Elrond is a Half Elf.<br />
Then Aragorn says point blank &quot;for he (Elrond) is the eldest of all our race&quot;.<br />
I cannot fathom how one might attempt to read what Aragorn says other  than him being eigther an Elf or a Half Elf, because we know Elrond not to be Human.<br />
<br />
Not to mention other &quot;men&quot; who were clearly Half Elves such as those of Dol Amroth.<br />
<br />
Return of the King; Book V: Chapter #4 The Siege of Gondor (page 107)<br />
For he (Imrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth) and his knights still held themselves like lords in whom the race of Numenor ran true. Men that saw them whispered saying: 'Belike the old tales speak well; there is Elvish blood in the viens of that folk,'<br />
<br />
Return of the King; Book V: Chapter #9 The Last Debate (page 163)<br />
At length they (Legolas and Gimli) came to the Prince Imrahil, and Legolas looked at him and bowed low; for he saw that here indeed was one who had elven-blood in his viens.<br />

<br />
My 2 cents : I'm a fan of the STORY contained in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and the three books that make up the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series. I am not a fan of the author himself, or of the world he created. I read the books for the enjoyment of the story presented and have no desire to pick it apart. For the majority of the story, Aragorn is presented as being of the race of Men. Having elven blood in his veins means to me that he is more than just a man, but I see no need to call him half-elf for it.<br />
<br />
I'd rather not see any of the names from LoTR used in EQ, however :<br />
If I see a character named Aragorn, I expect a human or half elf ranger.<br />
If I see a &quot;Legolas&quot; I expect a wood elf ranger or warrior (Tolkein never called Legolas a ranger, after all).<br />
Basically I agree with the original intent of the post. In my own words: if you're going to rip off a name from a book or movie, at least make the effort to get the context right.</div></div><hr />
