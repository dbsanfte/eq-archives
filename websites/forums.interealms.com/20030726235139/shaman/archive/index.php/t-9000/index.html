<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, here's my problem.<br />
<br />
I get 5 hours a night to play EQ.<br />
<br />
It's hard to find a decent group in PoP.  And I can only hit first tier planes<br />
<br />
I need 60 by thursday night<br />
<br />
I am lvl 58 1/2 now<br />
<br />
Katta solo won't do it.  Lucky if Katta provides 1 blue/hour<br />
<br />
Ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">10 hours to get through half of 58 and all of 59? Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not possible within the time frame you listed.  At 5hrs a day for 3 days is 15hrs.  5 yellow in a lvl, 5 blue in a yellow. 1 blue an hour over that time period is 15 blue, that's 3 yel.  You would ony be half a yel into 59.  <br />
<br />
If you could get 3 blue an hour  you might be able to pull it off. 3yel*15hr=45blue.  45blue/25 blue per lvl = 1.8 lvls.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Oops you said Thurs night.  Really not possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">5 hours a night is a problem.  I get 5 hours a night maybe one night a week.  Why in God's name do you HAVE to be 60 by Thursday?  Just curious.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd still try PoP zones if you want that kind of xp. Last night I had a hard time finding a group because so many shaman were on so I was real close to just logging off and trying again later. I was just ready to leave when I get an invite for a PoD group.<br />
<br />
Six hours later I had 3.5 yellow bubs of XP under my belt :) It was totally insane XP but omg I had so many near-death experiences it wasn't funny. Almost everything is yellow con and hits for 350+. Luckily I had a great druid healer watching my back and was kei'd for almost all the six hours.</div></div><hr />
