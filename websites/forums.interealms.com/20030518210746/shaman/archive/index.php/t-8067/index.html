<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok i was gone for a year and have recently come back to EQ about a month ago. I have updated alot of my old equip, just looking for a few suggestions/comments. I will try and raise my hp gear a bit. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time, be gentle heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From just looking at your Magelo and not knowing your budget, I'd say sell the Mask of War and get Crystal Spider Eyes or even better would be a Death Mask of the Elysians.<br />
<br />
Throw the Lodi on your back and get a Skull Marked Shield or a Bone Braced Buckler from The Grey. Even better would be to swap the Lodi for an Orb of the Infinite Void and get a Hiero Cloak. This might be hard to do now since Lodi doesn't seem to be so rare anymore. On Emarr at least, both the Lodi and OoIV used to go for 30K but the Lodi has now fallen to about 20K.<br />
<br />
Chitinous Belt is a cheap easy upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also, if you can't afford the heiro/ooiv combo, slap lodi on your back and buy a sarnak battle shield.<br />
<br />
Chitinous belt or spider fur.<br />
Talisman of Benevolence if you can swing it<br />
Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves<br />
<br />
Does that neck have a focus or something?  Resists are spiffy, but no hp makes a sad panda.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the reply guys. Im fairly happy with my equipment just trying to work on my hp a bit. I have a sarnak battleshield so i will put Lodi on my back and equip that.  Well any other suggestions are welcomed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mortz Spetakel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heres a nice bracer you might want to get<br />
