<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is this spell worth today??  I paid 3kpp for it the other nite because I was getting desperate to get any of the 8 or so spells I can use now but do not have.   Do you use it very often?  I tried it in Seb last nite when we had 3 or 4 and it seemed to work nicely, with no down side (other than the slow is 50 versus 75).<br />
<br />
Any comments or input??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Only been to juggs once since they adjusted spell drop rate, and got 3 copies of Tigir's...so I dont think it's that uncommon now.<br />
<br />
As for usefulness, it's nice to have, but I dont use it daily. Still use Turgur for most slowing, but it was cool to have it when I did the Shield of Bane Warding fight with 8 skels at once. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would load this if I were expecting a multipull fight, but we really don't have enough spell slots to keep it permanently up there.<br />
<br />
I like the spell very much, but it tends to draw all aggro to you for all the mobs that it has affected (or who resisted it).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its fairly situational I've found. The only problems I have with it are...figuring out that one odd mob that resisted and puting a turgur on him...sometimes hes easy to spot...sometimes not...not to mention it will only effects 4 mobs. It would be and awsome spell if it were PB. I basicly use it for....well, I dont usually use it to tell you the truth ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">*chuckle* My thoughts on Tigir's Insect?<br />
<br />
In one word...<br />
<br />
BANZAI!<br />
<br />
Using it in any serious raid situation will make you a favorite customer of the local Heal'nRez shop.  Even on MOBs softened with a Wind of Tashiana (from a suicidal 'chanter), the chances of it landing on all 4 possible targets are slim to nil. And we all know how much MOBs love you after they resist a slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kagbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really enjoy Tigir's :eek:   I use it mainly for exp grinds in Chardok when I know the warrior is bringing in 2-4, singles or named get turgur's.<br />
<br />
I keep it mem'd all the time mainly since I do xp about 80% of the time I play, and it's useful for pulling quickly to ae slow the trash on a big pull, then just remain standing to avoid any agro, start Cana 4'ing then have the cleric toss me a Celestial Elixir and I'll have Cana'd back the mana I used to cast plus some.  With the slow the cleric doesn't use any mana to heal the warrior really.  <br />
<br />
So in conclusion, Tigir's to me is king in the xp grind, and situational in raids, mainly for clearing.  Soon as i hit 60 (19 blues away!) I think Torpor will take it's permanant mem slot, and i'll swap group regen and tigirs out as needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ha ha! I'm 12 blues away. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">3k seems like quite a deal to me.  I think I payed 6k for mine.  I think it's very useful and cleanly worth it.<br />
<br />
This spell is the bomb.  It is perfect for when you are fighting blues that are dying too fast to warrant individual slows.  It is also great for stomping trains.  I use it extensively, and thus keep it memmed.<br />
<br />
The aggro it produces is actually a bonus, it works exceptionally well for the patented Shaman mez(TM).  Invison a small train of 6 or so mobs.  Cast Tigir's twice, or once and follow up with Turgor's on the remaining mobs.<br />
<br />
The aggro draws all the stragglers to you.  Leaving the rest of the group to deal with the mobs one at a time.  Drop epic dots on the stragglers as possible.  Keep them aggro on you with judicious application of the JBB.  Rest of the team picks them off one by one.  You may need a few heals, but no one else will, so what's the healer doing with their mana any ways?<br />

Rogue_01 &quot;Make that &quot;involuntary pull&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Only downside is keeping track of which mobs have been slowed and which have resisted.  One way to do this is to hit the escape key, clearing your target.  The unslowed mob is likely to hit you before the slowed mob, thus becoming your new target.<br />
<br />
It is a great tool for gaining control over multiple mobs.  It would be nice if it did not have a 4 mob limit, but even with that limitation it is handy.  Of course if they lifted the 4 limit we might actually have a role in AoE groups, but you can't have it all. =P<br />
<br />
I've used it extensively in Howling Stones, City of Mist, Chardok, KC, and The Grey.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Great for when your AE faction farming mobs that are in the 30s.<br />
<br />
It's like an AE taunt, cast it a couple times while my mage drops a couple big rain spells on them...usually keeps them off the mage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Chardok and OS Tigirs owns (especially when you get one of those omnipresent clusters that happens in the library in Chardok). Yes it will pull a lot of aggro on you so if you miss on a few big nasties in a group you will likely get pummeled. Ive also used this when im the puller for ae groups sometimes though I usually pull with some other spell ill drop Tigirs on mobs in camp while we are stacking them up. Helps the chanter not to evaporate too if a few resist mez you have a fair amount of aggro built up.<br />
<br />
Not sure on target limit I am retty sure its limited to 4 targets then occasionally it will seem like I can hit a 5th sometimes? Fun spell though when you can use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Celestin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Re: faction farming<br />
<br />
Just a heads up, there's actually special purpose code in Droga which prevents Tigir's from causing a faction hit.  Impossibly annoying...<br />
<br />
Tactics:<br />
<br />
This spell totally owns - especially if you've got AE Tash/Stun going off.  As I recall, it doesn't have a 4 mob cap but then again I cast this spell like it's going out of style when we get big pulls, so who the hell knows what's going on. :)  Basically, I retarget and recast continiously in AE groups because I can take the hits WAY better than tissue paper casters...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sine Snowray</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">4 mob limit.<br />
<br />
And in FG I get lotta ~75% resists from mutants, and ~25% resists from shroom. Haven't cast on bandits or fungusbeasts yet.<br />
<br />
I also find it very difficult on pulls of more than 4 mobs, to figure out which mobs didn't get slowed.<br />
<br />
The resisted mobs are easy, they start beating on me right away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">yub love the spell.  Like sisterli says, the resists on some mobs make it desirable....just run off and park the ones that are beating  on you in the corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i dont like it much, semi useful at times, but i find the 4 target limit to kill off most of what use i'd have for it, and getting one resist basically means you have to slow everything again since you'll have no idea which one isnt slowed.</div></div><hr />
