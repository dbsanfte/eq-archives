<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I bought EQ2 because the group that I hunted with in EQ, for almost 2 years, decided to try EQ2.  That was only last week when I installed EQ2, and I have not logged into EQ ever since.  <br />
<br />
I must admit that I logged into EQ2 to see what the hype was all about, and why everyone was raving about the graphics, etc.  I had to see it, and I was hooked after the tutorial.  The quest system is interesting.  No more writing stuff down, no more filling your bank with crap from 3 years ago, no more &quot;/say what bag?&quot;, &quot;/say what help?&quot;, etc.  I must say that it is easy to get immersed in EQ2, and it has managed to keep my interest so far.<br />
<br />
Someone just asked me today, when I would return to EQ.  I thought for some time, and said &quot;I don't know&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have played EQ for the last 4 years, and have always said that I had put so much time and &quot;investment&quot; (3 to 4 hours a night, level 70, 330AA+) into the game, the learning curve was steep, I've made many friends here, etc, etc.  I never thought it would be so easy to leave EQ for EQ2.<br />
<br />
I am level 14 now in EQ2, and I am really wondering what higher end content is like.  Is it going to be the same type of raiding, or something different that we can expect?<br />
<br />
The question is, will you return to EQ, and why?<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, because I was planning on retiring anyway. :)<br />
<br />
I had three accounts that I regularly played along with my fiancee's two accounts, totalling six 65+ characters with several hundred AA's and elemental+ raid gear.<br />
<br />
I had gotten really bored of EQ and was going to stop playing anyway.  EQ2 happened to come out at the right time. :)  If WoW had been out a few weeks earlier I might have tried that first and never touched EQ2, hard to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doubtful that I ever will return to EQ at this point. I might do some switching back and forth, but like a lot of others, my EQ1 guild is falling apart and has no plans of moving on to other games. Part of the guild left for more higher end, stable guilds, part left for EQ2, part left for WoW. Very few stayed on. We went from being a Time guild to leading Tier 2/3 open raids within about a month. There's nothing left in EQ for me for the most part. <br />
<br />
Even if there was, I think EQ2 has been designed so well, going back to EQ makes me feel like I'm trying to run through deep water or something. The pace in EQ2 is much faster and very addicting. After you get the hang of it, it's hard to go back. :)<br />
<br />
-Tok</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can't imagine ever going back to EQ now. If I get sick of EQ2, I'd just try WoW before going back to EQ. For that matter, I'd sooner go back to DAoC than go back to EQ. EQ2 is closer to DAoC than it is to EQ, and playing EQ2 has given me a new appreciation for DAoC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had already been retired from EQ1.<br />
<br />
So many good memories from that game. Was very fun, in fact, I wish I could go into the game in EQ1 and take a screenshot of my characters, and use them as a painting in EQ2. I'd even pay for a month just to activate the account for it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've been playing EQ 2 since launch, and I haven't logged in to play EQ Live since.   I was getting burnt out of EQ Live anyways.  With my schedule, it is hard to be active in a EST raiding guild if you live on the West Coast and work 9-5 type of job.<br />
<br />
There is so much to do in EQ 2 in which I doubt I will ever be bored from leveling, tradeskilling, or working on quests.  I do not have the strong desire to grind AAs or whatnot as I did in EQ Live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">was running 2-3 boxes with +65 characters on 4 accounts before EQ2, basically doing expo's and addy's by myself, if I wasn't raiding with the guild.  I really thought I'd resist EQ2, and initially wasn't going to buy it...I did, and I have logged on my EQ1 characters 2x for about 10 mins in the past month.  It's sad in a way, and I am still resisting the urge to cancel my EQ1 accounts.<br />
<br />
Currently, I'm nearly lvl 22, running one account, and usually have a decent xp group within 2 mins of going lfg.  I can keep a group alive as the single healer doing double arrow orange mobs, as long as everyone knows what they're doing and allows the MA to aggro and they assist.<br />
<br />
That's something a shaman could NOT do in EQ1.  I've thought about 2-boxing, but so far, I don't see the need.  Now, the second computer is loaded onto 3-4 screens of quests, maps, info, etc, and honestly, I'm having as good of time with the one character as I had in EQ. <br />
<br />
No, it's not high end game yet.  Perhaps, that's why I still have my EQ1 accounts active.  However, as long as we keep scaling so that we are legitimate healers throughout the content of the game, I doubt I'm going to be disappointed.<br />
<br />
I also like the fact that while I still yearn for the &quot;ding,&quot; I can log on and play for 20-60 mins, and do other things besides grouping to get xp.  We're probably one of the better solo'ers in the game (especially when you learn to use ho's), so xp is always available.  Quests are abundant, and can often be done quicky.  I haven't even begun to try tradeskills yet, which will offer even more opportunity.<br />
<br />
Summary - I believe I will eventually cancel my accounts in EQ1 in the next month or two.  Unless things really change, I doubt I will even play them until then.  My only real problem with EQ2 is the &quot;lotto&quot; so far.  Yes, I win at times, but it seems the highest level in the group wins more in my experience.  But, many groups are NBG, then FFA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>UloffBigkev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I cant see myself ever going back to EQ1. Atm I'm loving every second of EQ2. (and I just hit lvl 24 - defiler)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I completely agree.  Eq2 is so completely immersive I've been blown away by every single thing I've discovered an' seen...<br />
<br />
Quests, journal, group lotto, all quest drops for everyone in group, I can actually solo, tradeskills, graphics, fights, HO's, the birds in commonlands to ride on,  voice overs on npc's,  an' most importantly, drum roll please, emotes!  <br />
<br />
Male characters doing a full flourish has yet to not make meh giggle irl...<br />
<br />
I thought it would be incredibly tough to give up my darlin' Limneia I had spent so many years w/.  After a few hours in eq2 I never looked back....<br />
<br />
for everyone that thought SoE was gonna royally screw this one up,  I think they've amply been proven wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My guild broke few days before OoW came out. Most friends left to other servers or stopped playing EQ. There isn't much left in EQ that would bring back.<br />
<br />
In the moment I like EQ2. Yes, I like it with all the bugs and changes (beeing more crafter then defiler in the moment). Once I'm done with EQ2 I guess I will be done with MMORPGs too (at least I hope so)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Benedrill</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Has anyone done a comparison between the shaman class treatment on EQ I vs EQ II?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Has anyone done a comparison between the shaman class treatment on EQ I vs EQ II?<br />
This is kind of a lame question, but I'll bite anyway.<br />
<br />
The archetype approach to class building that SOE has taken in EQ2 is working out very well. So far, there hasn't been any extreme balance differences between classes/sub-classes within their respective archetypes. Your question really eqates to &quot;How is class balance&quot;? The answer is that it's done surprisingly well, SOE took a page from EQOA's approach to class balance and improved upon it a number of times over.<br />
<br />
Myself, I think Shaman are able to fill our role as Priests as well as Druids and Clerics. Read the Best Group Make up (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=25325) thread and I think you'll see that just about everyone is satisfied with the way Shaman have been balanced. There is no Holy Trinity.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'll bite too . . .<br />
<br />
There *is* no comparison between Shaman in EQ1 and EQ2.  None.  At.  All.<br />
<br />
Shaman in EQ2 have a well defined role which their given skill set enables them to fulfill properly.  We are Priests.  Healers.  We keep our group alive.  Any content.<br />
<br />
Are there some things that could stand to be improved?  Yes, certainly.  But all the classes in EQ2 are still feeling their way around.  Everyone is discovering what their particular class brings to the table - and what they don't.<br />
<br />
In EQLive, Shaman were a jack of all trades, good at many things, but excellent at none.  As the game progressed, that flexibility left Shaman more and more wondering what it was they were supposed to be doing.  Even Shaman couldn't always agree what their role was.<br />
<br />
Rest assured there is no such ambiguity in EQ2.  Shaman are healers, and they are VERY good at it.  They still have that utility, you won't start playing your Shaman and be lost, but they are definitely not second class citizens in the healing department any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Adding on to what sudedor said, as far as healers go we are fine in EQ2. I am having zero problem being the only group healer in Thundering Steppes on any mobs as long as its a decent group who can pay attention (having an ench helps as well...glad im friends with a few =). <br />
<br />
I have read a lot of people complaining that so much content is geared around having two healers but frankly im not seeing it. Sure, Im spamming spells through a lot of fights but Im rarely (if ever) below 50 mana so its all good. The biggest obstacle to being a successful (and only) healer in a group for me was just having the confidence to do it...gaining that confidence I learned a little more about my class and what I can do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think Benedrill is asking not about the comparison between classes, but about how Sony's CS and Devs treat the class.  Of course, EQ2 is really too new to answer fully but for now, Sony's CS and Devs for EQ2 have done well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, less and less reasons to return to EQ.  My friends have all cancelled their accounts, and even if I returned to EQ, I would have no one to play with.<br />
<br />
We have been progressing with EQ2, and currently at level 22.  The only downside to this game that I can see so far, is how you can &quot;accidently&quot; progress quicker than you want.  For example, I just read in an earlier post that to get the Adept1 Spectral Ward, I have to be level 13 or under, killing those rats or scarecrows... or maybe I'll have to spend a couple of days playing the mining lotto to win a rough coral (for the Adept3 version).  Finding a player to craft that for me is a totally different story.<br />
<br />
The other little annoyances in the game, I seem to be able to deal with them for now.  One of them are the really, really stupid names that players are allowed to have.  EQ2 does seem more lax when it comes to naming rules compared to EQ.<br />
<br />
For now, I can't see any reason to stick with EQ.  Most of what we asked for in EQ that they said was &quot;impossible to implement&quot; has been implented in EQ2.  <br />
<br />
One thing I don't understand yet is our &quot;slow&quot;.  Maybe I'm too low level to notice a difference now, but I've stopped casting it now, unless we're taking on a group of yellow ^ ^, but even then I'm too busy chain casting SW and healing to be able to slow the mobs.  What I like though, is the ability to cast detrimental effects on the target of the player you have targetted and vice versa when you have the mob targetted.  That's really nice. It helps to toss in a slow or a dot, or a heal whenever it's necessary without having to switch targets.<br />
<br />
Shaman/Mystic healing seems to be adequate for now.  I'm not sure what happens at higher levels, level 40+ or after the &quot;next expansion&quot;.   <br />
<br />
I guess what I really learnt from this experience is that it did not take much for me to drop from EQ to get started with another game (I never thought I would stop EQ).  If EQ2 goes south, it would be easier to switch to another game or stop playing online RPGs totally.<br />
<br />
I'll have to find a place to camp out in EQ for good.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes, you are awful early on to notice much difference with Slow, but then again, in EQLive, there really wasn't much noticeable when Drowsy was cast either.  We all seem to remember Turgur's effect, it was pronounced.  What we don't remember is the 50 levels that preceeded it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the other thing with Slow is that it ONLY affects the actual melee swings.  It does NOT affect Combat Arts!  This is very important to remember.  Slow is a little easier to see in terms of damage prevented AFTER the mob runs out of power.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Slow is best used against a single, very powerful target.  It is of almost zero worth in a fight against 4 or more targets.<br />
<br />
Slow isn't the game breaker it was in EQLive, don't expect it to be.  However, because of that, we can expect to be treated more equally as healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Shamans (Mystics/Defilers) in EQ2 are a whole new ballgame compared to EQ1.  The first time I went to TS, I was the only healer in the group.  I died a couple times, but eventually, the group got it together, the tank waited for me to ward him before he pulled, and things worked out fine.<br />
<br />
Shamans are probably one of the better soloing classes in EQ2, given our ability to heal ourselves.  By using HO's, orange con mobs are soloable, even though it says they will probably thump you good.  This is my experience, and I'm pretty well geared as a result of also being an upper level 20's jeweler.<br />
<br />
Bottom line - there are a few things about Shamans that stayed the same...we still have the buffs (although they are a little different), we still have the slow, we still have dots (not as many, though), and we're still pretty damn good soloers.  <br />
<br />
What we don't have (or at least I don't yet) no root, no invis, no pet to speak of, no canni, no regen (druids have this).<br />
<br />
BUT - we are viable healers in this game, and when you get a good group of consistent friends that see you know how to play the game, we can actually be THE preferred healer.  Once everyone learns to assist the MA, healing is not a problem.  Occasionally a caster will over nuke.  But the tanks have an aoe taunt spell that does a good job of keeping multiple mobs off the non-melees.<br />
<br />
I started tradeskilling a little late.  However, I'm liking it, and haven't really adventured much in the past two weeks.  It has also put over 2p in my bank during that time.  For those that don't understand, that's quite a bit of cash in this game at this point.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see is for SOE to eliminate the inability to buff people not in your group.  That used to be one of the things I enjoyed about EQ1...buffing someone as I was traveling, or buffing someone and refusing to take their plat that they got so accustomed to giving for buffs at the end of EQ1.<br />
<br />
I probably should, but haven't yet cancelled my eq1 accounts (4).  Maybe nostalgia, but I haven't had the heart to do it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When you think about it tho, there aren't really any buffs to cast on people outside your group.  Buffs now take concentration.<br />
<br />
Consider that the game is really built around the group dynamic.  Even within your group, if you get too far from the person running the buff it drops off.<br />
<br />
Don't panic EQ1 people, it may sound really strange but it plays VERY well in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yes, that's what I like about group only buffs.  No more buff beggars, no more selling of buffs for coin.<br />
<br />
We (my regular group) were in TS and SH, just me (mystic), guardian, dirge and monk, and we were taking down yellow ^ ^  group mobs.  Now that says alot about mystic healers.  I just hope that this trend continues for a long long time.<br />
<br />
All the little things in the game has made it &quot;easier&quot; to play.  The loot lotto does take the greedy ninjas out of the game, and speeds up the loot distribution process.  My only problem with that is sometimes it is hard to tell what a spell/skill/item is useable for which class.<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I agree, it is kinda hard sometimes to tell who a drop (specifically spells and skills) belongs to.<br />
<br />
All I know is anything that says Fetishisms I want.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bendarin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just a note on what I have found...   Each of the classes of Priests in the game heal in a different way.<br />
<br />
Shaman heal by casting a ward on a tank, this ward absorbs melee damage and prevents huge spikes of damage to tank.  This allows our so so heals to easily keep up in most situations.<br />
<br />
Druids heal by casting regen spells coupled with their healing spells.<br />
<br />
Clerics heal by casting a reactive heal on tanks (it activates and heals in response to attacks on the tank) and using the regular heals.<br />
<br />
Each priest class does it differently but all are viable.  If I had my druthers each group I was in would have 2 healers of different types for tougher encounters, works out very well and no one gets their toes stepped on!<br />
<br />
Back to EQ1?  No way.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Even if you had 2 shamans in your group, it would work well because the wards stack.  You just have to communicate to your fellow shaman what you're going to cast on your tank.<br />

<br />
No way - I quit as the GoD debacle bit and havent even looked at another MMPORG but saw my RL Bro playing - bought the DVD and have been hooked. <br />
<br />
My Defiler can kick out dps and keep the MT alive in almost any situation ( got to say though I have found a good chanter helps - even more so than EQ1 ).<br />
<br />
Best thing about game ( barring quests, guilds, TSing and a good exp grp ) - NO BUFF BEGGARS :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree for the most part, I don't look forward to when my chanter gets alacrity and breeze.  They are both single target, three minute duration buffs.  Breeze even has a 15 sec recast so you can't just buff a few players quickly between fights. :(</div></div><hr />
