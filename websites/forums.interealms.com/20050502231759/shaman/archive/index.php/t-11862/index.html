<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am in the process of making an easily accessible spreadsheet for current encounters in EQ.  Initially I was just looking to have what a mob is slowable by and what, if any, it mitigated slow at.  I decided to expand this to include stuff like if the mob flurries/rampages, AE, snareable/rootable, mezzable/charmable, noteable resists.<br />
<br />
For some this may not be hard to remember but when we are doing dozens of different encounters week in and week out it is hard for myself to remember which, if any, slow I need to be casting (call it old age I guess).  <br />
<br />
I am asking my guild to start joting down the needed info so that I can input it into Excel and thought that perhaps others outside my server/guild could use the info also.  <br />
<br />
I already have an example of what I will be doing posted on my personal web space and any help I could get from the shaman community would be greatly appreciated and I will make it accessible to all who would like to use it.<br />
<br />
The excel document can be found HERE (http://pages.preferred.com/~jmagan11/MOB%20DATA%20SHEET.xls) .  Please add info to this post or email me at EMAIL (jmagan11@yahoo.com) and I will add it to the spreadsheet.</div></div><hr />

Admittedly, Seredith really needs to update that list for PoP and some other encounters... but...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Souppuppy found the list I was just gonna post here myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.<br />
<br />
p.s. To the people actually responsable for the list, I again want to thank for the help they have provided me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That list is great and I had a copy of it at home beside my PC for a long time.  Its now so out of date that it it virtually useless to most guilds.  I also would like to add other info like mobs AE, melee abilities etc.  But hey if it doesnt interest you then by all means dont help out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are committed to keeping the list up to date and you incorporate all of the info from the old list, I'd support you 100% and give you a tongue bath. But I think you need to go ahead and make the list first. Let's see what you can do with it. If you build a good list, it'll snowball and be very popular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats what I would like to do and why I asked for help from whoever is willing.  I will add stuff as we kill them (I dont want to go entirely by memory as mine isnt that great).  I am jsut asking for the same from those willing.  Just as was done in the previous list as something is killed and confirmed post it and I will update it and keep it so.  I also would like to see other info added since many pop encounters no longer revolve around a MT and CH Rotation.  Split tanking adds and AE immediately come to mind as well as slow mitigation and having to choose between different slows (not too new on the latter though)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I may be a little late asking about this, but I thought that it no longer mattered WHICH slow you chose to cast (as in Torgor vs Turgur) because no matter what your slow will always be the best even if it is partially successful.  Why use a lower level slow at all if Turgur will still do a better job?  Someone enlighten me please I'm still not into the Tier 2 planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its not a matter of which slow to use on a mitigating mob but if the mob is MR, i.e. you have to use Grummus to slow it</div></div><hr />
