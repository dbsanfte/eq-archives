<br />
I was really frustrated and confused by the new objects in the LDoN on my frist few adventures. It seemed no matter what we did the damn things blew up and nearly killed us ;P. So i did a little research and I thought id share the info with you.<br />
<br />
There are 3 types of chests/boxes in the dungons:<br />
<br />
1) Mechanical - these are boxes/chests that can be sensed by bards/rogues, disarmed using the bard/rogue disarm traps skills, and picked using the bard/rogue pick lock skill. <br />
<br />
2) Magical - These are boxes/chests that can be sensedl/disarmed/and unlocked using the Wuggan's spell set used by Necros Mages and Enchanters. Also by the Xalirilan's spell set which can be used by Wizards.<br />
<br />
3) Cursed - These are boxes/chests that can be sensed/disarmed/and unlocked using the Reebo's line of spells useable by Necros Mages Druids and Shamen. As well as the Iony's line of spells useable by Clerics.<br />
<br />
So how do you know what kinda box you have got?<br />
<br />
Here is a rundown of what you should do when you encounter a box:<br />
<br />
The bard/rogue if you have one should Sense Traps. If the message says something like &quot;You cannot tell if the -object- is trapped&quot; then its either a Magical or Cursed Box and the bard/rogue should now leave it alone :P. However if he/she gets a message &quot;You cannot sense any traps&quot; Keep trying to sense traps until you get a &quot;You are certain that an -object- is not trapped&quot; Or &quot;You sense that an -object- is trapped&quot; If you get any of these messages the box is mechanical and should ONLY be touched by a bard/rogue.<br />
<br />
The Cleric/Druid/Shaman/Mage/or Necro should use their Augury spell for sensing cursed traps. You target the object and try to cast your Augury spell. If you get a message &quot;This only works on the cursed&quot; then the box is not cursed and you can leave it alone. If you can cast the spell, find out if its trapped or not.<br />
<br />
The Mage/Necro/Wizard/Enchanter if you have one should use their Augury spell to sense magical traps. I dont have this spell so not sure how the messages work but i assume its similar to the cursed one above. Again if you can cast the spell the box is magical and you should determine if the box is trapped or not before continuing.<br />
<br />
Great now we know what kinda box it is, now what?<br />
<br />
Mechanical - The bard/rogue should try to disarm the trap if the sensed one using their Disarm Traps button. If they sucessfully achieve this then they should try to pick the lock. This is tricky as we were used to picking locks using lockpicks. However this doesn't work in LDoN, you have to make a Pick Lock button similar to the Sense Traps button using the abilities menu. Have the object targeted and hit the Pick Lock button, pretty sure you still need picklocks in your inventory although they can be in a bag. If sucessful at doing this, approach the box and type /open with the box targeted. If you succeeded at everything else this should open the box, give you the &quot;Your party gains experience&quot; message and you can now loot the box like a corpse.<br />
<br />
Cursed - If your Augury spell sensed a cursed trap, use your Remove cursed trap spell to remove it. This spell requires a scrying stone. These can be bought from the Magus in the wayfarer's camps. The Greater Scrying Stone is a little over 17 pp. If you sucessfully remove the trap, use your open cursed locks spell to unlock the chest. If you sucessfully unlock the chest you may approach it type /open with the chest targeted and then loot the chest like a corpse once open.<br />
<br />
Magical - This is the same as cursed boxes except only int casters can open magical chests. Untrapping a magical chest also requires a scrying stone. Make sure you use /open to open the chest after detrapping and unlocking it with spells. Do not ever hit a chest as it can destroy whats inside.<br />
<br />
Now you know how to open chests/boxes ect. Unfortunately there is a bug right now that may prevent some members of a group from opening a chest/box for some reason. It may give you the message &quot;You cannot loot this corpse at this time&quot;. If this happens to you, try logging out and logging back in, this fixed the problem for me.<br />
<br />
Good Luck and have fun in LDoN!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This info is available in The Medicine Cabinet.  In fact, it looks like the same post  8)'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ups, :) didn't look at the cabinet.<br />
Seems like inter-forums bouncing post :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here's how I deal with them. <br />
<br />
1) Don't screw with any boxes or crates until you've finished your<br />
mission. <br />
<br />
2) Gate out before some knucklehead decides to screw with the boxes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>arfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have done a number of regular adventures and I have never gotten anything from a box or chest that was worth the trouble. I have never heard someone say they got something from a box or chest that was worth the trouble. <br />
<br />
Now a days we just get the adventure win and get out as fast as possible to get to another adventure. the only exception is when we know there is a named up and we sometimes will go for that. Otherwise we just don't waste the time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Chests can drop any regular mob loots from the dungeon.  So, they can drop augs, although I'm not sure if their chance to do so is any higher than a mob.  Also, they provide approximately the same xp as one of the mobs in the dungeon would have when successfully opened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shmokie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yesterday, in an adventure, I was all proud of myself for detecting a cursed chest, uncursing it, and unlocking it.  This was after we'd finished our mission, of course ;) .  The group got some xp, and inside was a +5 dex augment.  The cleric in the group won the roll on it, and promptly the 4 melees were bidding with her for it, offering 100pp-500pp for it...  Apparently it was at least slightly worthwhile to some people.  Now if it was worth the 180 adventure points that I spent on those 3 spells...  /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have heard of an improved dmg 3 aug dropping off a chest in MM... just a thought..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We as shaman should be the least affected by traps going off of all others except maybe Clerics. Though even them we have huge advantages over.  We have three spells that give us this advantage which are Disinfecting Aura, Blood of Nadox, and Remove Curse Spell (There are 3 Levels of this).  <br />
<br />
The Cheap way to open traps.<br />
1. Cast the Detect Trap Spell (Augry Spell) Will not set off traps if of the wrong type. Only small chance if you can affect it.<br />
2. This step would be where you cast your Disarm Trap Spell. If being cheep just skip it. (Requires a reagent 1-17pp depending on version of spell)<br />
3. Cast the Pick Lock Spell. (If you have not disarmed the trap then you WILL set it off.)<br />
4. Cast cure right after you have unlocked chest. &lt;Disinfecting Aura/Blood of Nadox&gt; of Remove Curse if the other cures don’t work after 4 casts. (Only really needed if you skipped step to to save money.)<br />
5. Type /Open or activate your Open Ability.<br />
6. Loot your chest (sometimes you have to have others in your group do so as there is a loot bug with chests some times.)</div></div><hr />
