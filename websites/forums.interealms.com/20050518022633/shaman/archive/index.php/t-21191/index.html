<br />
Why is there no pvp board?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good point. <br />
<br />
We need a place where us Zekers can take our whining about how much our class sucks, how useless we are, or how some other class outdoes us in every way, blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
You know you had it coming. <br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, I think the pvp community is better served if our threads stay in the General section, as often times there are nonZekers who read them and become interested in pvp that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This place is really active.  Probably the most active shaman board I can find, actually.<br />
<br />
This is the most active and serious shaman board for EQ yes.<br />
<br />
Although everyone here seems to be a level 65 bluebie shaman whining about how much their class sucks, how useless they are, or how some other class outdoes them in every way, blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
Because the shaman class is broken and needs to be fixed. That does not stop before mentioned blubies and myself to enjoy the game playing shaman.<br />
<br />
Why is there no pvp board?<br />
<br />
Becaues the class is also broken PVP-wise and what little needs to be said can be said in single threads. Thats my guess atleast, but i guess a moderator can answer better.<br />
<br />
Hi Asta btw, long time no see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't see how this is whining, just letting you know what the boards look like from a non 65 shaman who doesn't kill AI targets all day.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zekkers who try to degrade us &quot;bluebies&quot; are really an insult to those zekkers who really are nice people and not just a bunch of over-hormoned teenagers who feel that life is more fun being mean to everyone. EQ isn't a pvp game, wasn't meant to be, doesn't work well as one, and other than a few servers to placate those who feel the need to do it is largely ignored by sony.

<br />
<br />
Actually, from any person I've ever talked to on any pvp server they all generally laugh at people like you who actually find it fun killing AI mobs all day.  A DPS forum and a pvp forum aren't even close at all buddy, nice try though.<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ has never been nor will ever be a PVP friendly game. Start a UO account if you feel you are being overlooked.<br />
<br />
Haha, have you ever played UO?  Have you played it lately?  After playing games we have nowadays, it's impossible to get back into it.  Thanks for the suggestion, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
If i wanted fair PVP i would play a first person shooter or a good old game of chess or go.<br />
<br />
First person shooter games aren't fair at all.  Hello ping, hi framerate, hey hacks.  You obviously don't play FPS games.  Chess? Please, I am talking about a video game, why must you all trail off into stupid things?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shrink your sig please, Balthag.<br />
<br />
<br />
Haha if you guys aren't whining about your class being broken (btw have any of you ever visited other class boards? They all whine their class is broken.  Kind of funny, don't you think?), you're whining about stupid trivial bull****.<br />
<br />
Nevermind, I take my question back.  Even if there was a PVP board it'd be filled with you whining idiots, wouldn't be any use at all.<br />
<br />
Guess I found out the reason~ la</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree, Eq pvp is totally unbalanced.. Hi wizards necros and bards :P<br />
<br />
Shamans are far down the pecking order unless you wana pick on some lowbies or people with gear thats very below yours.<br />
And whats wrong with killing AI, at least its a challenge, not like shamans on Pvp vs most classes with same level of gear, you're just dead unless you run like a wuss..but whatever, if thats what your idea of fun is.<br />
<br />
Pvp is a minority, deal with it mate</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So you say EQ isnt subject to the same flaws? Besides, most games can be run on moderate systems, and usually you dont play with hackers. And for ping, youre a moron if you try to play and win with a high ping. From my point of view could i say the same: Obviously you dont play FPS games.<br />
<br />
Chess? Please, I am talking about a video game, why must you all trail off into stupid things?<br />
<br />
<br />
Never did you refer to videogames anywhere in your post (PVP means player versus player and can be applied to all competitive games), neither was it a response to you.<br />
<br />
But if you wish to feel flamed and call us stupid for things that are not 1) directed at you 2) meant as critique, feel free.<br />
<br />
you're whining about stupid trivial bull****.<br />
<br />
If you honestly say that the issues brought up on this forum is trivial bull**** then i one of two things must be true: 1) You are Verants dream customer 2) You dont have a clue.<br />
<br />
But when i think back its a viable question to ask why there is no forum for PVP, atleast it seems so when i try to think about it from your point of view.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, wait, you're ragging us for being 65, and on a blue server? Should we really CARE what the **** you think? You're not 65 like the majority of this board is, so you aren't going to be in the thick of most shaman balancing discussions. I'm retired, I try to stay away from replying to them as well, since I don't know how things are in current EQ.<br />
<br />
You're not 65, therefore in the minority.<br />
<br />
You're on a Zek, which is ALSO a minority here. Not ragging the good Zekkers, some of our best members are Zekkers (Asta, Vigdis, etc.). Just stating the fact.<br />
<br />
So you, in essence, are part of the smallest sect of the Crucible.<br />
<br />
Oh wait, one more, you're post count is what, 3?<br />
<br />
Not 65, Zekker, post count &lt;10.<br />
<br />
Now tell me once more...<br />
<br />
WHY the **** should we care what you have to say?</div></div><hr />

You forgot one Garf.<br />
<br />
Not old enough to drink legally, vote, or probably even drive a car. <br />
<br />
Most of the people who post here are adults. This guy, obviously, is not.</div></div><hr />

Don't automatically put him on my team, we don' want him, YOU take him :rolleyes:.<br />
<br />
I drive in a week, can't vote, and can't &lt;i&gt;legally&lt;/i&gt; drink. I waited 4 months for the permit though, so technically I was 16 in January, horrible decision.<br />
<br />
That stuff doesn't default me to the sub-21 retard crew. I've met adults who have raised the bar on stupidity - they're good for laughs, but not much more :(.<br />
<br />
You've got last pick this game, I'll take...hmm...that rock sitting over by the bench. Sionex is all yours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Leaving aside the ignorant bullcarp spouted by the original poster, and the flaming that resulted, the actual question of why no PvP section? is, in my opinion, valid.<br />
<br />
PvP is very much about learning, about tricks of the trade, about strategies, about dos and on'ts, and these are all different from what works with AI mobs. Blue servers can PvP too - it is just another aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
I am on a Zek Server (with Vigdis and Astaa, incidentally), and I am too ghetto to be any great shakes at PvP, even leaving aside the fact that Shaman are horribly underpowered in PvP - my gear and AA suck too much to be much of a threat, but I do my best...<br />
<br />
I find the added risk inherent in the PvP server ethos keeps the game more interesting for me...I don't claim to be better - I am sure if I played on a non-PvP server i would be in Plane of Time now, but PvP server is what works for me.<br />
<br />
If there was a PvP section it would, alas, be filled with posts complaining about how screwed shaman are in PvP. Which is a pity, because, although shaman are screwed in PvP, I wouldn't play any other class, and I am still happy to be on a PvP server...sound perverse? For sure, but thats the way it is.</div></div><hr />

But seeing as you guys are all 20+ and probably have kids and families to feed obviously you should be on the computer playing EQ 12 hours a day, right?<br />
<br />
Heh, whoever said I was a minority for not being level 65?  ***?  Are you a total idiot?  You think more than 50% of servers are level 65s? Hah.  Yeah my post count makes my whole question invalid.  Sorry I don't whine as much as you people.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway guys, I'm done with this forum, you're obviously all way too uptight.  If someone posts something other than &quot;**** our class sucks,&quot; you all jump at them.<br />
<br />
Enjoy hitting your cycle through npc target key while hitting your slow key.  God that must be fun for 12 hours a day~</div></div><hr />

<br />
This board can't cater to everyone.<br />
<br />
Actually, from any person I've ever talked to on any pvp server they all generally laugh at people like you who actually find it fun killing AI mobs all day.<br />
<br />
That's fine, but plenty of bluebies laugh at the pvp servers.  Who is the overwhelming majority again?<br />
<br />
Haha, have you ever played UO?  Have you played it lately?  After playing games we have nowadays, it's impossible to get back into it.  Thanks for the suggestion, though.<br />
<br />
Yes I have played it, no I wouldn't bother playing it now.  If it's so out of date, why do you still play EQ?<br />
<br />
First person shooter games aren't fair at all.  Hello ping, hi framerate, hey hacks.  You obviously don't play FPS games.  Chess? Please, I am talking about a video game, why must you all trail off into stupid things?<br />
<br />
In a non team FPS game everyone tends to have access to the same things.  Last time I checked, Shaman don't get manaburn.  If you die because of ping, improve it; framerate is the same and cheats shouldn’t factor at all since they aren’t meant to be in the game.<br />
<br />
Even if there was a PVP board it'd be filled with you whining idiots, wouldn't be any use at all.<br />
<br />
If there were to be a PVP board here it would be empty save a couple posters.  Wheeeee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">But seeing as you guys are all 20+ and probably have kids and families to feed obviously you should be on the computer playing EQ 12 hours a day, right?<br />
<br />
Quite a few posters here don't even play EQ anymore.  Your point?  Should YOU be playing EQ 12 hours a day or should you be studying or exercising or trying to grow a beard?<br />
<br />
Heh, whoever said I was a minority for not being level 65?  ***?  Are you a total idiot?  You think more than 50% of servers are level 65s? Hah.<br />
<br />
No matter what level you are, it's a minority, that should be fairly obvious.  No single level of player has a majority in EQ, but, the majority of active posters here are for sure 65.  <br />
<br />
Yeah my post count makes my whole question invalid.<br />
<br />
Not the question, but your post count combined with your attitude just makes your credability zero.  The question is a good one and has pretty much been answered.<br />
<br />
Enjoy hitting your cycle through npc target key while hitting your slow key.  God that must be fun for 12 hours a day~<br />
<br />
At least we now know for sure you don't play a Shaman if that's what you think a Shaman does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have to take your word on that :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
Hint: Gloriana is a moderator, so it's actually her responsibility to 'whine' about sigs and such, as you put it (it was a polite request though). Not that she needs any defense from others.<br />
<br />
...Chess? Please, I am talking about a video game, why must you all trail off into stupid things?...<br />
<br />
I think Vigdis made a serious and valid comment. As far as 'fair' and balanced PvP in games goes, chess and other board games rank pretty high (as both players have almost 100 percent equal tools to use). Most are aware that board games and video games are not the same, but thanks for the update.<br />
<br />
...Anyway guys, I'm done with this forum, ...<br />
<br />
I can't come up with any polite remark to that, so a simple 'Good bye' has to do it.</div></div><hr />

Ironically, if we did have a pvp section, not only would there be a ton of gems like this post, but it would also mirror the bitching and complaing you saw and loved on the rest of this board.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But, and this kills me, even if we did have a pvp section, it would not stop the blue players who have very little common sense from coming in and starting flames, and it would not stop the trolls, who should know better, from putting flameable material in the middle of their questions.</div></div><hr />
