<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This really isn't a rant or rave, more of a rhetorical question, though I guess anyone who's doing it or knows the actual answer can speak up anyway.<br />
<br />
What's with all the old posts popping up?  I mean, aside from the fact that it's slightly annoying to see months old posts pop up to the top, why did someone dig through all those posts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taamar Bladesworn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Because maybe thay hadn't read them before and didn't bother to read the date? Or maybe their brains work slow and they just came up with a response? Is it bad to answer rhetorical questions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">lets dig up one from 3 years ago:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoghan Blaidd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Occasionally someone doing a search will turn up an oldy that someone feels they could add some insight too.<br />
<br />
Or maybe people like Rounlin just put some innane comment in every post twice a day to up their post count LOL</div></div><hr />
