<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tullaian</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well the portals in PoK alone are worth it imo for any player especially a melee.. the rest of it probably wont do much for you till you level up some. A few quests in PoK are  also aimed at people your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lokriek</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can I get into PoK at my level?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tullaian</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes</div></div><hr />

And it makes traveling around the world SO much easier.  I would say yes its worth it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beohram</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Buying PoP also gives you access to the /raid command.  Not sure how much raiding (groups of 7 or more) you do at level 36, but why limit yourself.<br />
<br />
Besides, PoP is what, like 20 bucks?  For a game you will use for the next year+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">decairn</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For hunting, no, Pop isn't worth it, there's nothing for the under 50s.  For the clicky portals and possibly /raid sure it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just like everyone else said the portal throughout Norrath is well worth it... just don't try to explore the planes cause you will get slaughtered.</div></div><hr />

Just like everyone else said the portal throughout Norrath is well worth it... just don't try to explore the planes cause you will get slaughtered. <br />
<br />
you cannot activate the plane of tranquility portal if you are under level 46, so that won't be a problem.<br />
<br />
PoP gives you access to the ports and /raid and also lots of nice planar tradeskill recipies, if you are into that.<br />
<br />
worth it in my opinion, because it won't be tooo long until you are level 46 and can go with a guild to the planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kellaen</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is worth it for the tp services alone as stated above. I can't imagine how usefull this would have been when we were all leveling up in the past. Enjoy it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jalim</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, ports. ports, and more ports. The other reason, the raid feature. You get to split exp with all of the others raiding! I, of course haven't been able to use this feature yet as there are still SOME of those in my guild without PoP. If you are in my guild and are reading this, PLEASE get it, ASAP!  :D  With all the easy travel, between Luclin and PoP, I feel like an old man, you know, the one that says &quot;In MY day, we had to WALK everywhere, uphill, BOTH WAYS, and if you didn't like it, you had to PAY someone to move you around, and that was if you were LUCKY! And we LIKED it! We liked it fine!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lokriek</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went ahead and bought it.  Helped me out royally.  Got my level 29 spell and have been hunting a bit in OT.  <br />
<br />
Now when I get bored with OT hunting, I go to the outpost in OT and zone to PoK (where I have merchants and a bank, then take the zone to ButcherBlock where I can head to Kedge Keep for some soloing action.<br />
<br />
Well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Icye</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GOOD it is very nice free port hehehe<br />
 very nice<br />
<br />
I love it for ports alone hehe other stuff good also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eowyna</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the ports are so worth it.<br />
<br />
OT the ghetto that all bored 30~40's goto is ... a port <br />
<br />
Dreadlands the FV port is so very close<br />
<br />
Great Divide another port<br />
<br />
The nexus and Sahshir another port<br />
<br />
basically letts say you went to hunt in OT pre PoP<br />
<br />
you either take the spires down ( every 15 minutes ) then  run and  hope, or take a boat *snore*<br />
<br />
the old world has many many ports so if say you're doing an old world quest that makes you run all over the place it gets done very fast.<br />
<br />
Example gem gaunts<br />
<br />
you get your 4 scrolls then run to qeynos,then freeport, then qeynos, then Butcher Block prolly at level 25 ish quest<br />
<br />
no pop welcome to an entire evening of running,<br />
<br />
pop done in less than 30 minutes<br />
<br />
it's worth it just not to have to take the boats</div></div><hr />
