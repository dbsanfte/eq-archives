<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this has been discussed before a while back.  I’ve read Blargx’s thread on this a few times in fact.  But this is a HUGE decision for all level 60 Shaman, and some time has passed since then.  <br />
<br />
Currently I am 1 yellow into level 61.  I have Torpor &amp; Malo &amp; True Spirit, the main reason I leveled from 60.  I just achieved Canni V &amp; am progressing towards QB/SC/VP/ND/SCR/SCRM/SCM, in that order.  I am in a guild that raids about twice a week.  I solo or group with guildies the rest of the time.  I am not flagged for any tier 2 zones.  <br />
<br />
At level 61 I can still get some decent exp in non-POP zones.  For example I can get 15 to 20% aaxp points in FG in an hour.  I am satisfied with that.  That’s better than I’m getting in a full group pulling non-stop in PON from ZO2, though grouping is soooo much more enjoyable.  Sebilis, Akheva Ruins, Umbral Plains etc are still zones that have db to me &amp; are ok exp.<br />
<br />
Level 62 though is tempting.  Tnarg’s Mending is in the bank waiting to be scribed.  Seems to be a great healing spell for us.  Focus of Soul and Endurance of the Boar are ready too.  More HP is always a good thing.  I would no longer get those annoying “Your spell has not landed” or whatever it says because our other 62 Shaman has a spell already on that peep.  Being the highest level Shaman has its advantages.  I like being the primary slower on a raid.  Less resists.  A huge plus in HOT where I get pounded big time if my slow gets resisted.  <br />
<br />
BUT from what I’ve read here from a few people is, if I hit level 62, my future is sealed . . . POP zones.  If say I get flagged, and progress even further, 63 64 or 65, I am destined to only getting decent exp in a tier 2 POP zone.  I guess what I’m asking is that the case for you Shaman who have reached level 62 &amp; up?<br />
<br />
I’m leaning towards staying at 61 &amp; grinding away towards all those aaxp points I want.  But I’ve also read that the exp FLOWS in tier 2 zones, so I’m in a quandary.  Is BlargX right on the $$$$?  Hit levels 62 &amp; up &amp; your fate is sealed.  Blarg, thanks for your threads.  I enjoy reading them.  They are well thought out and very informative.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you guaranteed a flag if you go beyond 61?   Are you willing to pretty much paste yourself to PoP zones for the rest of the time you play this game?<br />
If so, level on up, champ.<br />
<br />
If, however, you don't have a sure-fire flagging method, and you're not willing to level to the point where exp is pathetic without that flag, and end up sitting in PoJ, trying to find people to pay to let you get flagged with them...<br />
Nope, not my idea of fun.  Flag first, 62+ after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well...it's not like you can't take a death or two and de-level if you are unhappy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are not flagged for PoV/PoS, do not get level 62 yet.<br />
<br />
If you get flagged for PoV/PoS, only level to 62 and beyond if you are at peace with the fact that you will only ever expect to get reasonably good XP in PoP or future expansions.<br />
<br />
It's pretty much that simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Level 65 Shaman here.<br />
<br />
This was my thought process:<br />
<br />
If you are finding that you have pretty ready access to ethereal parchments in your hunting, level up to 62 and stop. Then, if you are finding you have pretty ready access to spectral parchments in your hunting, level up to 64 and stop. Then, if you are finding that you have pretty ready access to Glyphed Runed Words in your hunting, level up to 65.<br />
<br />
I did not level up to 65 until I got flagged for Bastion of Thunder and started killing named giants who can drop Glyphed Runed Words.<br />
<br />
Regarding the experience thing:<br />
<br />
Exp in zones like Valor, Storms, BoT, and CoD is so much better than exp in any other zone - it does not matter whether you are level 60 or level 65. It does not matter whether Fungus Grove is dark blue, light blue, or green to you. Time spent exp-ing anywhere other than Tier 2-3 planes will seem like time wasted. You will only hunt for loot outside PoP, not exp.<br />
<br />
There are some decent spots in Tier 1, also. The Hobgoblin caves in Plane of Nightmare were a huge source of fantastic exp and Ethereal/Spectral Parchments for me. Take a strong group down there, though.<br />
<br />
Of course, the most important thing is to do what is fun for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shhh Ximix.  You're letting secrets out about the game!  Everyone knows there are no sources of spectrals pre-Tier 2 or 3!  Also, you have to be flagged to get decent exp in 63 and 64!   One tip that you left out is that only really uber DPS groups with 10 mages, 27 rogues, and a 9k hp warrior can pass the trials.  They certainly couldn't ever be passed by a Warrior, Paladin, Mage, Enchanter, Shaman, Cleric all levels 61 and 62.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>moosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would stay at 61 until I was at LEAST flagged for PoS and PoV.   There are very few places to get good exp at 63 or so in the first teir zones, other then the hobgoblin caves and spiders in PoN.<br />
<br />
Get all of your 61/62 spells and grind AA until you get flagged for storms and valor, then hit storms and work on your BoT key.  BoT is a good source of spectrals and occasional runes.  Once you get into BoT and CoD (via alternate quest) I'd go for 65. <br />
<br />
You are not pasted to PoP zones once you level, you can go back to older content and screw around but you definately wont be hitting an AA every 2 hours like you can in PoP. <br />
<br />
-Moosha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You'll get your aa's much faster in tier two zones than you will anywhere else regardless of level. In a relatively competent group in pov, for example, you should have an aa in two hours. There's no reason not to level to 63 at least so you can use sltw when there's no enchanter around.<br />
<br />
If you don't take the time to get flagged for pov/pos you'll feel sick once you finally do get there and see what you've been missing out on. Soloing is for suckers at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am in active raid guild and got my PoV/PoS flag from guild help 2nd days after get PoP; when I ding 65 in few weeks hunting at PoV, exp there is insane and shaman are very easy get group here<br />
<br />
well, I am now lvl65 and I wish I still stay at lvl60 :( . here is reason why I want stay at lvl60 for AA if I can do again :<br />
<br />
1, I got PoV/PoS flag, and other higher flag for good source of AA EXP, <br />
<br />
2, shaman are EASY get group everywhere, guild or pickup group regardless of level, just need malo/torpor/slow then you are as good as other lvl65 shaman; shaman and cleric are 2 most easy class to get group regardless of level/spell(chanter limit by mezz spell)<br />
<br />
3, spell issue, I don't have lvl65 spell and dont' think can get it soon; lvl63 64 spell can be ignore, don't really need it; lvl61 62 spell is nice, especial pet/heal/soul, but not really need it in exp group<br />
<br />
4, AA exp rate !!  at lvl65, I got one AA every 2-3 hours, if I am lvl60 then I can get AA at 2-3 time faster, which mean 1 AA each hour or faster; this can easily finish my &quot;AA goal&quot;; <br />
<br />
5, lvl65 isn't much difference from 65; I tank better vs green mob, I resist more mob's AE(there isn't much AE raid there, and most can hide); but slow seen still resist about same rate(don't notice on slow rate unless mob con blue and lower at lvl65)<br />
<br />
6, time !! level up form 60 to 65 is easy if you have PoV flag or higher; you can ding 65 under 1-2 weeks hunt there; but it take months to get those good AA; speed up your AA by 3x faster will save lots of your AA hunting time and you can rush to lvl65 easily when feel done with AA<br />
<br />
well, now I am lvl65 and try hard to get spectral parchment and rune, and get AA at same time. if I still lvl60, I would have 3x more AA than now and should finish all good shaman AA which feel lots better doing boring spectral/rune farming; I think you should stay at lvl60 if have PoV flag; or at lease stay at lvl62 untill done AA or untill own any lvl65 spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If the mob is blue to you dont you recieve the same AA rate at 65 or 60? Thought it was all based on level 51. If it is then being 60 or 65 shouldn't matter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hail,<br />
<br />
I really love these boards. :)  I just wish I could access them at work.  Darn gnomish governmental censors.<br />
<br />
I'm a blue into 61.  I only levelled past 60 after pressure from my guildleader.  He basically started cutting me off on all parchment drops since I was working AA and not exp.  The &quot;working on Canni5&quot; excuse doesn't cut the mustard anymore since I have it now. :p<br />
<br />
I recently negotiated some nice deals and obtained ALL my 61 spells.  Traded Focus of Souls for Truespirit even. :)<br />
<br />
I bought Tnarg's Mending for 600pp recently.  That's the only reason I see to get 62 before working AA again.  I have Talisman of Wrulan and Ancestral Guard in the bank already too.  Focus of Souls (since I traded mine away) was buyable for 2kpp yesterday in bazaar, but I passed...<br />
<br />
But the pressure is high to level.  I'm already in the top 10% of my guild as far as levels right now.  Most are low to upper 50's.  Only about a dozen of us are flagged PoV/PoS.  (I'm also flagged PoI factory).  I'm working on my single-group method Tier3 flags now.<br />
<br />
I like grouping with my friends in pre-PoP content.  At 60, OS and most of Luclin could still be decent exp while I was with friends.  I LOVE PoI for exp.  Would hate to see it go light blue right after dinging 62.<br />
<br />
So I've been really torn on whether to level up again or work those really useful AA like QB, MGB, SCR, SCRM, ND, VP, etc.<br />
<br />
This thread has helped me make my decision.  I'm going to split AA/exp until I'm just short of 62, and concentrate on AA after that.  Once alot more of my guild family are flagged PoV/PoS, or I get flagged Tier3, I'll look at the situation again.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;I’ve also read that the exp FLOWS in tier 2 zones&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, it does.  But, it flows just as well at 60 or 61 as at 62 or 65.  I made 9 AA points in one day in POS at level 60 -- that should be some indication of how life does not suck in the lowest 60's in tier 2.  It's true that if people want a shaman, they want one, period.  If you're 60 or 65, it won't matter.  At that point in the game, the skill and alertness and general adaptability and ability to perform under stress of a person matter more than their level, in general, so you won't be letting anyone down -- at least in experience groups.  If your guild panics that you can't reapply slow in time because there's another higher level shaman, it might be a different story.  But for experience groups, I never seem to run short of people complimenting me at 60(I'm temporarily 61 to PL a twink faster) and begging me to stay up all night instead of go to sleep and keep my job, so it's not like being in the low 60's is a real handicap.<br />
<br />
If you don't have torpor, I can see Tnarg's Mending being reason enough to get 62 for a lot of people.  But if you do have torpor, that doesn't apply.  If you don't...well, it's a big decision to screw yourself out of old world content so thoroughly by hitting 62.  Frankly, sometimes soloing IS fun, and sometimes most people don't want to group.  If you're 61, you can do both in many places; if you're 60, you can do both all over the place.  But if you don't have torpor, soloing is pretty darn hard in comparison, to say the least, so 62 could be beckoning strongly to some....<br />
<br />
P.S. -- here comes a tangent that may or may not apply to you or to whoever.  But I think it could be very relevant to some.<br />
<br />
EQWindows is not impermissible under the EULA anymore(and it's free).  I got a warrior to level 51 in 29 hours.  He helps me get experience faster already (just like my bot monk did), and duoing with a bot is both much safer and much more fun than soloing.  It's a way to learn another class (to a certain extent anyway) without real fear of failure, and adds a lot of variety to the camps you can do and places you can go.  Why not think about trying it?  As you can see by my 29 hours figure for level 51, the pay-off doesn't take long; heck you can start grouping with them at 40 if you're 60 or 61(my 61 pally friend is botting with his 40 shaman right now). <br />
<br />
Now, if you stay in the lowest part of the 60's, both you and a bot will have plenty of places to experience throughout the world, and plenty of money camps you can do.  That's how I pulled a few hundred K plat out of Umbral Plains.  <br />
<br />
I bring this up because I think it is a very real benefit to staying lower level.  If you BOTH can get experience in the same zone(whether or not you are flagged), then you can have a very profitable alliance with a second account that you own.  Anytime you want, if not grouping, you can solo AND duo.  It really, really helps you get money and variety and try new and different things.  I very much enjoyed playing my monk as a single when I got bored with my shaman -- I actually leveled him to 57 entirely as a single before I had even tried EQW.  I'm sure at some point I will play my warrior as a single too.  He may or may not ever get flagged for much of anything, but as long as my shaman is low 60's, he and the warrior can both rack up AA points in a variety of ways in a variety of places -- grouped, duoing, or even with one of us outside the group and letting the other get all the experience, if that's what I'm in the mood for.<br />
<br />
If you hit 65 with the shaman, you're not going to enjoy botting a 60 bot much; it will seem worthless for your shaman to get no experience, just to get the bot experience.  You would want to get them both experience at the same time, I'm sure.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I know you may not have a second account.  But heck, the bank slots alone LOL -- I have four post-50 characters now and 12 mules almost completely filled with quest crap, tradeskill garbage, etc.  It's really nice having a second account, and you can play them on a single computer if you want to.  You don't even need DSL or cable to do it.  <br />
<br />
Something else to consider.  I know if I couldn't duo sometimes with my bot, the game would have gotten old for me a very long time ago indeed.  A second account really adds longevity to a game like this.<br />
<br />
Good luck with whatever you decide, Jrvrebi.  <br />
<br />
And thanks for the kind words as well.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Some of this almost sounds like people are racing to 65 to be able bitch and moan about how few zones are available to them or how its too easy for others to get there too.<br />
<br />
Remember to have fun too. If you are just looking to get fast exp without any real reason behind it you will probably harm your enjoyment sooner or later. So what if the exp you are getting is half or a quarter of what you could max get in PoP - if you have fun thats far more important.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It makes no sense to stay at 60 to me.<br />
<br />
Exp in PoP makes exping anywhere else a waste.  If you just don't want or care about exp, then ok.  <br />
<br />
If this game leaves no options for a certain percent of people who do level, then there's no point anyway.  I don't play to spin my wheels aimlessly.  Hopefully that will change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The only valid reasons that I can see for not leveling to 62 if you are getting ethereal parchments/spells is<br />
<br />
1) You want to finish up a very important aaxp ability, like Canni5 first. This is a temporary issue - finish up Canni5, and then level up to scribe your spells.<br />
<br />
2) You want to stay close to your friends/guild/normal hunting partners in level. I can understanding not wanting to outlevel them too much, since that may mean that the camps they enjoy are light blue to you. Help them get caught up to you, and then you can all level to 62 together.<br />
<br />
Staying at level 60 forever because you can't stand the thought of leaving Sebillis/Velks/FG seems ill concieved to me.<br />
<br />
Spectral parchments should drive whether you level above 62 or not. I would suggest that you come up with a viable means of getting your 63-64 spells before leveling all the way to 64. Likewise, try to get yourself flagged for PoV, PoS, CoD, and (best of all) BoT.<br />
<br />
Once you are hunting in zones like BoT, you will want to be level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A reason to stay at 60 or 61 would be if what Shamam posted is true.  You can make aaxp much faster at 60 or 61 in a tier 2 zone than at 65.  MekuDeku's asks a good question.  Can anyone answer it that knows?<br />
<br />
Please correct me if I am wrong.If the mob is blue to you dont you recieve the same AA rate at 65 or 60? Thought it was all based on level 51. If it is then being 60 or 65 shouldn't matter.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When my slows and molisinia's land on a mob, they land as a level 65 vs mob level, not a level 60.  Do 5 levels make a big difference?  sure they do.  Also, I do have more mana and HP's at that level.  Do those 5 levels mean a lot?  Ask my guild when I Quiesce the MA during a fight or MGB Fo7 them all during a raid.  <br />
<br />
I came into PoP with level 60 and not a hell of a lot of AA's.  I now have 75 AA's, with every ability that was on my 'A list.'  Before PoP, I had found that the AA exp in Luclin was crawling slowly and now it's shooting forward like a drunk n00b nome race!  <br />
<br />
If you want to do tier 1 things, stay level 60-62.  If you want to do tier 2/3 things, then camp the trials NONSTOP until you get your flag and progress.  Don't tell me about how bad exp outside of PoP is bad for a level 65.  I wouldn't go back to SoL to exp at level 60 now anyway.......  Would You?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if they couldnt see their stats do you think they would know if you had used Focus of the Seventh or Khuras Focusing? If your MA is always under 99 hps (the difference between the 2 buffs) on your raids I am impressed. Almost all our 61+ spells are teeny tiny incremental improvements that noone will be able to tell the difference between if they cant see the stats.<br />
<br />
Your point about resists I agree with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get more exp-per-mob for killing mobs that are close to your level. So, if you are killing level 60 spiders in Valor, you will get  more alt-exp per spider at 60 than you will at 65.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER - at 65, you should have the ability to kill spiders faster, more efficiently, and with less risk than at 60. It should approximately balance out.<br />
<br />
This has always been true with EQ, level 1-60. It is the difference between killing higher level mobs slowly and killing lower level dark blue mobs more quickly and efficiently.<br />
<br />
PLUS, at 65 you can move on to hunting level 63-64 giants in BoT effectively for exp. At 65, I am able to duo these with a 65 warrior with no downtime and minimal risk. If we could duo these at all at 60 (doubtful), it would be very risky with more downtime and rezzes required, etc. I can assure you that nothing I saw from 1-64 provides alt-exp as rapidly as hunting in Bastion of Thunder at 65.<br />
<br />
I really think you are being narrowminded if you can only see the more-exp-per-kill side of this equation, and are missing the balancing factors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Shamam is right.  He can get exp faster by being a lvl 60 shaman in valor in a group of strong lvl 65s.<br />
<br />
Shamam is wrong.  He could not get 3x the exp.  He could get about 20% more (assuming his additional slow resists and other missing spells wouldn't slow down the group kill rate one bit).  To see why, look at:<br />
<br />
http://eq.straylight.com/exp.php<br />
<br />
You will see that there is a huge loss of exp (half, in fact) as you start killing mobs more than 5 levels below you.  You can also see that there is a slight benefit to killing mobs closer to or even higher level than you - about 5% per (your - mob) level.<br />
<br />
If you can get spectrals, there is no reason not to ding 64.  If you sometimes group without a bard or chanter, there is no reason not to ding 63 (the 60% haste spell will increase your melees DPS by 5% over celerity at least).<br />
<br />
For a rogue or monk, it is more tempting to stay at lvl 61 or 63, because they do not see anywhere near a 5% increase in damage per level (more like 5% from 60 to 65).  Likewise, a caster without access to spectral or runes is probably not seeing a 5% increase in power per level.<br />
<br />
If your guild is in fact making serious progress toward new and harder targets, you should ding 65 so that you can get gear upgrades that make you (and your guild groups) strong enough to make up the lost exp.<br />
<br />
In summary: you don't gain that much exp (in valor) by staying 60,61,62.  At least get 63, and maybe 65.  Everything you fight will be within the 5 level cutoff.  You will have a harder time finding groups at lower levels (because people know you are mooching), and, more importantly, you will not contribute quite as much to your group.  Don't hold back!<br />
<br />
I would get can5 before leaving 63, unless you have spectral/rune access.<br />
<br />
Shaman spectral spells are actually not that great (especially with the 4 str/dex booby prizes).  The rune spells are amazing.</div></div><hr />
