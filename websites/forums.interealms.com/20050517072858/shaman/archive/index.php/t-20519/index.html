END EDIT<br />
<br />
So...  can anyone who has SEEN this spell drop please comment on where they saw it?  I'm not looking for hearsay (ie: heard it drops in location X) but only actual confirmed sightings.<br />
<br />
It may still be in sewers, and just be a rare drop (wouldnt be the first time a shaman spell was a rare drop) or it may be incredibly common and I'm just not lucky.  I'm starting to wonder if different trials drop different spells.<br />
<br />
Either way, after a week of farming those flies I'm inclined to ask here if people are actually seeing this thing drop, and where.<br />
<br />
If you mention seeing the flies drop a spell other than the ones I've listed, I'll update the list above as well (useful for those of us that play alts).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Search is your friend... I've posted where I got my copy from several times already, some in nasty long threads, others in simple ones asking the exact same thing... <br />

Search is apparently not my friend.  When I used it, it turned up dead thread after dead thread (likely becuase of the board move).<br />
<br />
Also, you posted where you got Plague Of Daluda, not where you got Daluda's Mending.  There is no reason to think that the drop table has not been changed several times since &quot;several weeks before it was changed&quot; (the spell).<br />
<br />
As a final note, one person saying where they got it is not as useful as 20 people saying where they got it.  And if those 20 people all post in the same thread, its useful for poeple who... here it comes... use search.<br />
<br />
As I said in my original post, I'm also interested in what other spells drop from the flies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haven't seen a shaman spell from the flies yet, but in addition to some that you have listed, we have gotten:<br />

I've not logged in for a couple days but as of Monday night no shaman in our guild has this spell yet.  There is a paladin who has it, but he got it when it was a DR DoT off of the final named in the first Sewer trial.  I've also done a good bit of sewer runs chasing after spells and have yet to see Daluda's drop.  <br />
<br />
Someone mentioned Hexxt Gkon in Ferubi as a source for spells but he never popped the night we ran through there.  The named Elites can also drop spells, we got a Berserker one though. :(<br />

Also, you posted where you got Plague Of Daluda, not where you got Daluda's Mending. <br />
I got the spell Plague of Daluda about 8 days before the change was made live on the servers. We should know that PoD was changed into DM, and knowing better, I was assuming that SoE wouldn't (all of a sudden) change the complete loot drops of mobs that had the PoD spell before hand. It seems gut wrenching if SoE did that, I can see the Abysmal Spell troll Hatem saying now.... &quot;Damn the gods... they (shaman) B&amp;M (Bitch &amp; Moan) to change their spell from a DoT to a healing.... well curse them, we'll make it a more common drop from just about any mob so they can shut the hell up&quot;.<br />

I personally looted my copy of Daluda's Mending off a trash mob during the vxed mountain trial. I'm sorry I don't recall which it was, but if you recall the trial, you stand at the first platform and pull something like 70-80 mobs and then start marching NE to the npc room for the hail and flag. It was here at this first platform off one of those trash mobs.<br />
<br />
I had an *extraordinary* day helping get a friend flagged in vxed: we killed Umbicki, the named cragbeast, and I looted Balance of the Nihil. About 20 minutes later we killed a trash mob that had a copy of Daluda's Mending. As the only shaman in the group I was given both by the group (woot). <br />
<br />
Given the stage of the trial, it had to be a pooka, noc, cragbeast, hynid, stonemite or golem, one of those, sorry I can't recall which! The funny thing is, I'd camped the Sledge Eating Fly in lair for weeks and never got a single SHM spell drop (many others, tho). One day I decide to help a friend get flagged and I loot TWO SHM spells out of the blue. There's probably a moral to this story somewhere but I forgot it along with the exact trash mob that dropped DM.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My usual GoD group (Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter, Druid, Bard, and myself) has been spending every off-night and most post-raid nights in GoD. Yesterday we were flagging the Cleric, the Enchanter, and the Druid (different Druid and Enchanter than usual, Cleric died before the hail MoB last time) and spent our time at zin clearing nameds to get loot for friends and alts. Umbiki dropped both Mage spells, a Ranger heal, and the Beastlord DoT our first hour, the next time we pulled him he dropped Daluda's Mending. Chavoor did not drop a single spell for us. As we cleared up to hail the NPC, Umbiki spawned again and dropped Balance of the Nihil. <br />
<br />
These were the first spells we had actually seen in this expansion, despite having gone through many, many expeditions and their nameds.</div></div><hr />

Not sure which messages the two of you are referring to but I'll repeat: I got my Balance of the Nihil from the named cragbeast Umbiki, and later in the same vxed expedition, got Daluda's Mending from a trash mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Although very, very rare spells do drop from trash MoBs. I've logged over 200 hours in GoD, and we recieved the Druid nuke off of a Hynid the night before last. I wouldn't count on it happening all too often, but it does happen.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Correction, I went back over my logs and it was a Berserker Tome that dropped from a trash MoB. The Druid Nuke came from Chavoor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yesterday, I joined a guild group to farm the first two named in Vxed for spells. (Umbiki is one, I think the other is Chavoor the Trickster).<br />
<br />
The first time, Umbiki dropped a bard song. We actually had a bard in the group too! I had to go not long after that, but the group carried on. They got a cleric spell for the cleric.<br />
<br />
Then, shortly after I got back online, they had Daluda's Mending drop and let me come loot it. It dropped from the named that wasn't Umbiki, it looked like a pooka so I'm pretty sure that it was Chavoor - but I can't remember the name from looting it.<br />
<br />
Seems silly to go farm zones we're past for spells, but I guess there's always been some of that anyway.<br />
<br />
I still have an SK spell in the bank from Umbiki, in case they ever become droppable.</div></div><hr />

In case anyone is interested, this is the list of which spells seem to go together. All of the first list would drop off the first mobs along with Balance and the second list should go with Daluda's.<br />

<br />
I'm finding that my lists are getting more and more different as some info gets added one place and some the other so starting a new thread in spells.  Will try to keep checking the old threads but in order to compile all the info in one place I'll be making updates there.</div></div><hr />

You missed my contribution on Daluda's. I looted the new heal from a trash mob in vxed within the same expedition that a Balance of the Nihil was found on Umbiki. Might have been something about the random seed for our expedition, but it sure was one hell of a productive expedition. <br />
<br />
Don't know if I told the rest of the story here, but I was trying to get a cleric friend flagged and just as we were hailing the npc for the win I got a call from my guildmates that they had a tear for me in Fear that I could loot if I could get there in 6 minutes before it rotted. You've never seen these Barbarian legs move so fast ... looted it with 30 seconds to spare.<br />

<br />
Didn't miss it I just wasn't sure how to put trash mobs into a list of named mobs.  It isn't something people can find on track or whatever but it is really good to know that there could be a small chance of dropping from anything in the zone. <br />
<br />
Is odd that there haven't been more reports though - I'm wondering if maybe the trash mob is really a named that didn't have a obvious name... kinda like Kyv Hunter vs a kyv hunter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">More info for Jenina:<br />
<br />
The sewers (etc) spells are now dropping rarely from named in Kod'Taz, the same mobs that have a chance to drop Taelosian Geomancy Stones for Breath of Trushar and other class spells/discs.<br />
<br />
I personally saw Balance of the Nihil drop from Pixtt Battlestrategist and I've seen the enchanter spell, Madness of Ikkibi drop from Hynid Howler. I've not seen more than 1 spell from any class, so I can't say whether the drops are random from any named or have some sort of pattern.<br />
<br />
At any rate, this is a good thing, it means that people who've done the trials don't need to go back and farm them to get spells. Though I did get a couple of nice upgrades for my ranger while we did that, and I doubt I'll ever get him Kod'Taz flagged, so it has its downsides. :)</div></div><hr />

It also appears they nerfed down the rate at which Sludge-Eating Flies pop near the entrance of the Trapped Ones expedition.  I haven't seen spells drop from KT named mobs yet, only runes and augments.  I have seen named mobs in Ikkinz raids drop runes though.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I still think they should make two of the spells purchasable since they're not a huge upgrade for any class.  If they made Balance of the Nihil and Daluda's Mending available on a vendor (and so on for each class), more people would probably buy GoD.  I think shamans got a good deal with spell upgrades in comparison to most other classes.  Balance of the Nihil (good for tagging and pulling), Daluda's and Trushar are now permanently on all my spell lists.  Our Ancient spell is by far the best upgrade even if it still eludes everyone for now.</div></div><hr />

Well I got Dualda's mending off one of the other named in Kod'taz so they can both at least drop in that zone. Balance still eludes me tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An update. When I logged on earlier this week my guild asked me if I needed Daluda's Mending because it had dropped from a Named in Kod'Taz. I told them I already had it and recommended they give it to one of the other Shamans on the team (who was deliriously excited)! They didn't say which it was, but I know that this group farmeds the various nameds that wander through KT.<br />
