<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vividshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">we should include a screenshot for the page, with description beside each of 4 components.<br />
<br />
http://eqshaman.com/guides/cann2.html<br />
<br />
with the description whether its a NODROP or not.<br />
<br />
just thought this might help with the noobs like myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry I didn't take any screenshots, but since I just did the quest last week it's all still pretty fresh in my head.  <br />
<br />
All 4 items are Lore, the Shaman Powder and the Strange Ochre Clay are both tradable, the other two are No Drop of course.<br />
<br />
Diamonds:  Too easy, no further explanation nesecarry.<br />
<br />
Clay:  I've seen it for sale in the bazaar for 500p (LMAO!), but I bought mine off a vendor in Cabilis for 5 gold and some change. YMMV<br />
<br />
Bone Chips: You don't have to go very far into KC to loot these, but if you've never been there before go to www.eqatlas.com/atlas and get a map before you head in, it's not someplace you want to get lost in at lvl 39.<br />
<br />
Powder:  Hang out in Traks Teeth and kill stuff at the zone entrance (almost everything is dark blue and decent exp)  untill a group shows up to farm Sebilis keys.  99.9% of the time they will have a ranger, druid, or both to track the Hunter/Forager.  Offer your services as a buffer/slower in exchange for the shaman powder.  My group only killed one Yun Shaman, and i also got a free Sebilis key too. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have all the components, except the bone chips that I am MQ'ing with a friend. I'll take screenshots and send them in. Great Idea btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just wondering if me an iksar monk and invis into shammy guild thing in FV and then sneak behind the quest NPC and hand in the bone chips then my shaman friend hands in the other 3 things, just wondering if sneak faction will be enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I completed the quest with the Great Oowomp in TD glowering at me dubiously.  Since sneak brings your faction up to indiferent, it should be more than sufficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Greyish Bone Chips (Bones of Obulus) is the only item that is No Drop. It's MQ-able though.<br />
<br />
The reward scoll is not Lore and not No Drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">don't MQ the scroll it isn't nodrop, just have your monk do the whole thing and give it to the shaman.</div></div><hr />
