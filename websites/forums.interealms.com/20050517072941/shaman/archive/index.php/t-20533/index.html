<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, and Magician pets needed to be more uber because of class balancing.  Apparently Necro and Bst Lords did too, even though Bst Lord pets have been nice for a long time.  Maybe we couldn't get an upgrade to our pets because of our &quot;slow&quot; :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Uh....  why *would* the upgrade our pets?  I mean, come on.  They're talking about the efffect of focii on pets.  We a) have no such focii and b) are not a class that is dependent on our pet.  <br />
<br />
As it was, the focii were pretty useless to begin with so this is a good change for the affected classes.  Not everything has to be about the shaman.  <br />
<br />
Grats mages, grats necromancers, grats beastlords, and move on...  this change has absolutely 0 effect on us (which is fine).</div></div><hr />

No, you are so uber that you don't need help.  What do you think you are, a Beastlord or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope we are not beastloards but they seem to have almost all the skills of Shaman and kick ass pets to. Pretty soon if it keeps up, shaman will be a thing of the past because beastloards will do everything as well as we do. Will maybe not stat buffs or DOT but the way the game is headed who needs stat buffs or DOTS.</div></div><hr />

Mages needed some attention to their pets at the top end, they have done for several expansions now.  Grats to the mages.<br />
<br />
All IMO</div></div><hr />

Necro and mage pets of course, were still better, but at least a shaman pet wasn't just seen as a &quot;companion&quot; toy like today.      <br />
<br />
I don't know what the difference between companion and a pet is; especially when beastlord pets are called warders... so I guess beastlords aren't a pet class then. *boggles*<br />
<br />
Anyway, time has changed, and our pet is completely worthless, even as a &quot;DoT&quot; simply because it can't hit a mob these days worth a crap unless you were killing much older content.  I would love SOE just to remove the whole damn line and upgrade our other areas.</div></div><hr />

yeah. seems like the same crowd as before when we started to try get some updates on our heals. &quot;I saw _uebershamanxyz solo _3expasionsagomob! shamans are overpowerd!&quot;<br />
<br />
I have given up on dogdog 2 years ago. Sometimes he may help me farm greens for tradeskills and I pull him out in groups to have something to spend my time on. <br />
<br />
Actually, having those focus effects affect our pets would not make the slightest difference in balance but it could add to &quot;The Fun Factor&quot;.</div></div><hr />

my pets before could hit for near full on most mobs around my level at the time. and they could take alot more hit before they died. now i dont really want that much improvement but i would expect my level 58 coning pet to be abale to hit for near full on most mobs i meet, and not mainly miss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Buffs, items, and positioning make puppy a worthwhile contribution to dps.  Having him on the back of a mob makes a significant difference and mine regularly does 30-35ish dps (mage procs not included) vs tier3 and lower PoP mobs and over 40 vs ldon easy and lower (solc, chardokb, luclin, etc).  This is with SLtW, FA, Focus, 2x61+ mage summoned weapons, mage summoned belt, mage summoned mask.<br />
<br />
As for the pet upgrades, we are not a pet class and have no pet foci.  I wouldn't expect an upgrade to our &quot;pet.&quot;<br />
<br />
What I would like though is to have that stupid recast time removed from ours though.  It's not like we are chaining dogdog :)</div></div><hr />

All that being said, it would be nice to have him innately dual wield, and it would also be nice if the various pet foci had &gt;ALL&lt; pet casting classes on them, heck might even make that be-damned druid bear slightly useful instead of a lag-inducing spam-o-matic cutsie &quot;fozzy&quot; that all the female druids love and emote on like crazy.<br />
I am not a pet class, but if your gonna bother giving me a pet, at least make it dual wield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would watch 10 miss followed by a hit or two and then another 10 misses I dont know how many times. and these are the LB Mobs.<br />
<br />
Do I want a Tank for a Pet? Sure it would be nice. But I would like a Pet that can hold Aggro, Hit most of the time on Dark Blue Cons. And be able to take a little more pounding from a mob. And I hope that does not sound like Tank Pet?</div></div><hr />

I can't speak for your pet, but mine hits for max a high percentage of the time, certainly way more than my warrior does, which suggests that pet melee is more like 58 npc melee than 58 pc melee. I usually have SLTW, soul and Daiku (not sure if this helps or not) on him as standard buffs, and use him as a timer for FA. FA makes a big difference btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I dont have a problem with our pet not being able to tank. But does anyone really think beastlords needed an upgrade. Call it class envy or whatever you like but come on guys enough is enough. If sony keeps it up, beastlords will soon become the most powerful class in the game. Will come to think about it they my already be.<br />
<br />
The reason we have slow casting times crap DD huge mana costs and so on is so called uber slow and cann. Well in case Sony has not noticed Beastlords can slow, tank, have a great pet, buff as well or better then us and can even heal themselfs. <br />

I have to agree with you but I guess you have not heard we are uber. We can solo Dragons in three expaintion old content, we can slow, heal, cann and dot. The problem is as everyone all ready knows we are an endurance class in a game that has completly changed. The name of the game now is burst healing and dammage both of witch we suck at. I hope they look at it but as I have said before I wont hold my breath.</div></div><hr />

there was a time when dogdog was a pet.  and it was called the Vision.  and, yes in those glorious days we were beastlords in the full bloom of our youth<br />

Actualy we DO have a pet focus spell, but it is in need of a upgrade to be useful again is all.<br />
<br />
Like i said, up till level 60 most of us used dog dog as a tank. Im sorry he is a pet.  Companion is just a label on one of the spells, he is our pet and we are a pet class. No we arent as strong as a mage or a BST, but  we have a pet lol. It doesnt get any plainer then that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does that mean?<br />
<br />
At one time, long ago while the developer of the beastlord was probably still in high-school, a shaman pet could be considered true damage it dealt to old world mobs.  I used it alot then.  It was cool to have and show off.  It made an impactive contribution, meaning it was a genuine source of damage.   Today, and for some time now, it's not so.  They are now frail doggies that nip the heals of your target, missing more than hitting.  I can melee five times better than it.  When tanking it cannot take the hits long, unless you want to keep pumping healing on it, which you'd be better off using the mana for a nuke or dot that would do more justifiable damage.  The pet isn't even a &quot;free dot.&quot;  You have to spend mana to cast it and buff it, which again it's better off using the mana for other things.<br />
<br />
Having that said, I don't really care for our pets.  They aren't that useful except for farming greens.  I'd rather just have the entire line removed for something useful.  It just irks me when people say we were never a pet class, because yes in fact, we were at one point.  Verant at the time with Kunark and Velious, could have easily taken a route to inflate our pet line, but when Luclin was introduced they decided to go another route with a new class with a pet that is their main draw.  Which is just how it is and we have to cope.</div></div><hr />

The 61 shaman pet &quot;can' duel wield, but only with weapons fed to it. Its a 58 warrior, warriors get duel wield at like level 17 or something (been a while since I played a low level warrior). The 41 sk pet &quot;does&quot; duel wield without feeding it weapons. WHats wrong with this picture?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our pets are quite handy/powerful in lower levels, but you cannot use them to tank for you in PoP or GoD (With the exception of some yard trash or PoJ maybe).  If you want a better pet, give up your chain armor and put on some silk, otherwise....think about what you are asking for.  <br />

Kind of strange way for a non-pet class, ya know.<br />

Our pet is lvl 58 mob, which hits like a damn newbie. Doesn't matter what buff and gear you give to it, it will NEVER hit over 60 points per pop. What the...

<br />
Reread the patch.  It only affects 61+ pets that are summoned with a focii (ldon prism, vt gloves, time focus, etc..)<br />
<br />
That means shaman, enchanters, and druids get no love.  Only the -true- pet classes will benefit from this change which are magician, necromancer and beastlords.  Yeah, bst are hybrids.  So?  That doesn't mean they can't be a pet class.<br />
<br />
And hell no, a shaman is not an actual pet class even though we can summon one.  Until ~2 years ago you couldn't even give the pet weapons.  Don't give me crap about how they (companions) could contribute to DPS pre-kunark.  They didn't, much like now.  It has always been a minor dot used in lieu of our other abilities.<br />
<br />
I admit that the shm class is currently in need of help.  I didn't level my shaman (no PL, one account) just to shelve him because the game has pushed him into obscurity.  However, I can see the wisdom of allowing the 3 classes that have traditionally had powerful pets to keep that unique status.<br />
<br />
At most I'd support dogdog getting a 500HP boost, innate dual weild and a small bonus to attack.  As far as an improved taunt, cast root, problem solved.  As a necro my 65 pet can't taunt a thing off me after I snare or slow and drop a couple dots even with /pet taunt on.  If it could there's no way necros could aggro kite.<br />
<br />
Btw, I find /pet hold and /pet suspend to be very useful.  I suppose that depends entirely upon the individual player.<br />
