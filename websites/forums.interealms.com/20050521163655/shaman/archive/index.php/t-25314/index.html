<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Virulence</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was grouped in Wall of Slaughter for a pretty good while today and noticed most of the mobs that we fought on the NC side of the zone were now 'mostly slowed' other than the named. I haven't grouped in WoS for a while, but was this changed in the recent patch or is it just me? It seems like the last time I was in a steady group there, most of the trash was only 'partially slowed' with the occasional 'mostly' here and there.<br />
<br />
Also, if slows were adjusted (again) in OoW, are there any other zones that were made easier to slow in? I was in RCoD the other day and the camp I was at was still just partial slows.<br />
<br />
(as an aside, finally managed to ding 70 in my WoS group today. yay! heh)</div></div><hr />

Yer its just you :).<br />
Since the reintroduction of mitigation (after they removed it for a week) the mobs at South Wall (as we call it on BB) apart from the named have all been &quot;mostly&quot; slowable.<br />
