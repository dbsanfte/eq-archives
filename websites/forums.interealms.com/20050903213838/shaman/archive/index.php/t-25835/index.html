<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When i lvled my pally up into STV doing the hunter quests I got a ton of leather and cloth stuff to drop. Didn't need it of course. Dont remember much Mail at all. <br />
<br />
So now that I'm lvling a rogue who is just getting into there my last 5 drops have been decent mail drops. Not a stich of leather lol. <br />
<br />
Not a big deal just funny as the last 30 seconds two mail drops happened. In my bags are a plate , helm , chest , wrist and a belt. <br />
<br />
Id almost put money i get one more Mail drop before i quit soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know this is far from an important thread so wasnt really expecting much in reply. Just funny my wife came home from work and played for an hour before bed. She is a plate class and wouldn't you know it she got some decent leather boots to drop. <br />
<br />
We'll just keep having to trick the game and swap each others drops!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know what you mean -<br />
My druid is 48 now, and cannot get any decent leather to drop.  Chain and cloth, occasional plate, but nothing much for leather.<br />
<br />
Maraudon instance yielded a minor upgrade to my pants (about 6 more ac and some more int, losing some sta in the process).  Mail was dropping a lot, with the shaman and hunter disdaining it as they had better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hahahha, all the stinking leather we ever see is druid stuff!!!!<br />
<br />
I am all auction house equipped :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I never really noticed.  I know I have felt the same pain in WoW that I had felt in the earlier days of EQ, where other than kunark, there was almost nothing to wear on your legs.  It wasn't till I raided HoT that I upgraded my Jar Jar pants.  Leg drops in WoW are a little scarce.</div></div><hr />
