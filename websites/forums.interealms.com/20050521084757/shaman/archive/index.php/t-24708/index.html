The small group I play with doesn't have CC (other than me :p ) and I am main healer.</div></div><hr />

Click for each type of rune, and it tells what mobs/zones drop it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I stated in an earlier thread I was trioing a spot in NC last night with 2 mages where two named spawn that can both drop runes for level 66-68 spells.<br />
<br />
Also, I was in another spot in NC a couple nights ago in NC where the Massive Bazu spawns. I had only a Druid and Mage with me and I thought the Bazu was just regular trash and despite being quite suprised to find out otherwise the 3 of us managed to take him down. He ended up dropping a very very nice druid belt along with a level 68 rune. <br />
<br />
Your other option is getting an expedition in DS but get someone under 68 to get it for you so you get the easier versions. Named in there drop level 66-67 runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nameds in DS expeditions drops 66-68 runes, verified by myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GheffGutterbrains</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Named in DS didnt drop runes(26 named 0 runes.. lotsa crap loots) when I got a lvl63/64 person to start my two box farmage... Named did drop runes when I got a lvl67-70 to start it..<br />
<br />
Other thing to note.. mobs hit like wimps and did not mitigate with the 63/64.. but they hit alot harder with 67-70 requester.<br />
<br />
Will try with a 65/66 requester when I can..</div></div><hr />

Since myself and the group I play with are all 66, I'd be very interested in what you find when you request the expedition with a 65/66.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I haven't done a level 66 dungeon since the first week of OoW. In those dungeons the named seemed to drop only level 66-67 runes.<br />
<br />
In the level 68+ ones they dropped 66-68 runes.<br />
<br />
Not sure if the lower level ones were nerfed though.</div></div><hr />

They drop runes with a 66 requester but I do not know which levels. Had a 66 rune drop from the murkglider caves just a couple days ago (after the aggro &quot;fix&quot;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for the feedback !! =) I haven't had a spell upgrade since PoP. he he.<br />
<br />
It seems like the Dranik instances are the way to go. Our group is usually me (66 shm) a WAR 63, and other odd folks who are bored.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I am wrong, but melee can use the runes for Disc's as well?<br />
<br />
Also, how do you start and instance?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go to the Grand Historian in Dranik's Scar and say &quot;trials&quot; to him.<br />
<br />
Expedition window will pop open and a pink line will be on your compass pointing to which of the 3 caves your zone in is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">actually you say &quot;what caves?&quot;, not trials.</div></div><hr />

Which part of &quot;verified by myself&quot; did you not believe? I've personally looted a 68 rune in a 66 dungeon, since I got the dungeon, I boxed in it, and I looted the runes - so far I've gotten 1 66, 2 67 and 1 68 rune this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">KK, some feedback, and by the way, Shummn is correct.  Requested an expedition (I'm level 66) with a group that ranged from 62 (clr) to 70 (SK).  Just hailed and said &quot;caves,&quot; got the murkglider hive (furthest cave entrance North).  Had guys in group who knew which npc's were the ph's, but since we all wanted the exp, we just killed our way back and forth between the ph's hoping to spawn a named.<br />
<br />
In 2.5 hrs we only got 2 named, but got 4 nice drops, one rune from each, a lesser (67) and a muramite (68), a stick of fury, and an engraved war totem (nice range item).  Also got a pristine murk skin (4-6k in bazaar), discordant dust (junk), some random gems, total split at end was around 2,600pp.<br />
<br />
The exp was pretty good, got 26% regular exp.  Again, not there to burn thru the mobs or cherry pick the named, just our own private zone for &quot;normal&quot; hunting.  Was fun if repetetive after a couple of hours.  I can easily see how people will stay in these things all day.  Given the time, we would have all stayed in the expedition until we each got a &quot;nice&quot; drop from one of the named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Seems more runes drop in the 68+ requested instances...  We can get 3-4 in a standard session.<br />
<br />
I got in a pickup DS instance last Saturday and the person who requested it was level 67 and we had 15 straight PHs over 4 hours and not a single named mob until the final spawn, and that named did not drop a rune.  Was rather frustrating.</div></div><hr />

You didn't specify which level dungeon you were in in your first post.<br />

Darn :) You're forgiven ;) <br />
You could've checked my magelo though, as I am a slacker you will see that I am only 67  :p</div></div><hr />
