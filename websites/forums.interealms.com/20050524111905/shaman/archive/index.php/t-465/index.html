<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reddimnd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What do you all be willing to pay for the PoA shoulder quest piece &quot;Light Damask Mantle?&quot;  This is one of the best shoulder pieces for shaman, and the mantle is very rare form the boss mob of one of the middle isle.  I believe it was Isle 5 or 6.<br />
<br />
I was asking around today some of the level 60 shamans on Povar, and was told 100K.  Does this sound fair?  Would you be willing to pay that much for the rare quest piece?  I don't think I would be, but I also want to pay less for stuff then what everyone else says it is worth.  hehe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmmm I would never pay that much for that.  100k is alot of money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For that as a reward?  Not a chance.  The resists are nice, and handy to have, but nowhere near worth 100k IMO.  AC is pretty low too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Reddimnd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">So what would you all be willing to pay for one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jallail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Given the resists and high Wis allowing you to pump AC/HP on some other pieces, plus figuring in the rarity/difficulty of attaining the item, I wouldn't put it less than 10k. Even that may be low.  On the other hand, there are alot of things I can see myself using that plat for. It's all in YOUR wants/needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">5k... I know this is low but this would basically either be for bragging rights... or to save me from swapping gear out during raids.  AC stinks, I already have too much wis as it is, resists are equivalent to IGS, and less than a summoned blankie.  That's what I might pay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i would save that 100k and shell out 10-20k for IGS. higher ac , and what shaman needs real high wisdom with cann?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">IGS are barb only IIRC =)  Maybe kitties too, I don't remember.  so that's at least 3 shaman races that can't use them.<br />
<br />
I can't see paying more than 10 - 15k for these, and that wouldn't even be for something used all the time.  Sucks the piece for it is a real rare drop, that drives the price up even further on a mediocre item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got the fairy hide mantle a looong time ago on a 2 day PoA raid when we were getting parts for warrior and mage epics.<br />
<br />
It is mediocre..I didn't even know the parts were so rare.  I happened to be in the middle of the raid, and looked up PoA quests on my other computer.  Saw the items needed, asked guild if anyone had seen the pieces the past 2 days, and luckily enough they had em.<br />
<br />
Ironically I got IGS like 2 days later and never used  fairy hide again..still in the bank.<br />
<br />
But, uh..100k for that? It's not that great at all. I certainly wouldn't call it &quot;one of the best shaman shoulder pieces.&quot; If you're not a barb, just spend a couple of K on a dragonwing mantle.<br />
<br />
I'm waiting to see if you say you're joking about spending 100k to get a 9 AC shoulder piece with mediocre stats?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gigor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">For the non-barb shamans out there, this is a pretty nice item to have since i know for a fact ogres cannot wear IGS (passed on 2 of them sadly).  But as for fairy-hide mantle being worth 100k ... not a snowballs chance.  5-10k max just for the sake of not having to spend the time in sky for it is bout all id say its worth, and if your a barb just get IGS and forget about em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Mine is relegated to my resist kit and I wear one of the dragonhide ones which I paid 6k for and imo it's a superior every day wear item so I wouldnt pay any more than that for the Fairy Hide.<br />
<br />
Oh and if you do get one be careful about right clicking on it to check stats, the pet is insta-cast /</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't think I would pay anything for that mantle.  As a barb, IGS are better resist gear and there are several other, in my opinion, superior shoulder items available.<br />
<br />
Like dragon mantles, or death watchers shroud, to name a few easy ones.<br />
<br />
No hp or sta = 2 thumbs down for me.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tattered mantle gets a bad rap, but AC 12, 20hp 10 DR really isn't bad.<br />
<br />
I'm missing this same piece myself, and tried to buy it.  No one ever responded.  Killed the Spiroc Lord 7 times, and he never dropped it.  The Guardian about 4 times, Gorgalasek, Keeper of the Souls, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Keep in mind there's an IGS equivalent in Chardok that's small/large races.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather something like that or a Deathshroud of the Elysians than the PoA mantle.  <br />
<br />
I'd pay maybe 5k for it... but no way in a million years would I even consider paying 100k for it, you can get MUCH better shoulder items for 100k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heh I have the quest piece in the bank, never bothered to turn it into the final piece. IGS is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Have IGS, have the light damask mantle and another of the quest pieces in the bank . . . don't have the phosphoric globe . . . would consider MQing it for cash to another shaman if they can get the phosphoric globe. <br />
Damask mantle dropped from Spiroc lord . . . quite a rare drop, we killed him like 20 times and saw it once, i looted.  Got IGS before I could secure a phosphoric globe tho, so stopped trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The &quot;light demask mantle&quot; is really the common part due to the way the lord can be farmed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I MQ'd mine to Aktunka for free I think. I had IGS already, and would never use the fairy hide mantle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">And I thank you very very much for it, Jing :)<br />
<br />
I started with 86 base wisdom so the wisdom boost and the resists were what attracted me to this shoulder item. Since I am a troll I can't use the IGS so that was out. And the dragon mantles are typically going for around 40k area last I saw. More than I wanted to pay for that at the time. Anyhow, it is not a bad piece, but I certainly would not pay anywhere near 100k. Its worth is nowhere even close to that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Heh, I would not MQ it for anything.  I did the turn-in &quot;as intended&quot; to the correct mob and some freakish bug ate my reward.  Had primary inventory slot open and the whole 9 yards.  GM said &quot;Sorry, we can't do anything for you with air quests&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>DvenMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">100K !<br />
<br />
Maybe 5-10k depending on server economy.<br />
Thats outrageous</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">In the last few weeks i went by some guild's trade boards on my server and a few others,  checking spell prices etc.<br />
the price of a lot of the air quest items were shocking, most were is the 60k range even for some of the gimp items.</div></div><hr />
