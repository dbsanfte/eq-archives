Sony CS sucks.  Always has and always will.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'm shocked you're shocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually i have never really had a problem with their cs. i used to petition.....a while of time passes... i get answered... and if the gm can i get helped... if they couldnt help, i emailed the gm... couple days. and i was fixed (most of the time) but the new cs window reminds me of calling the phone company because your haveing problems with your phone, and it takes you 2 FLIPPIN HOURS  to actually talk to someone.. not a machine.. imo the cs window is nothing more then a ....&quot;if your annoyed with your service....PRESS 1 now&quot; set up<br />
<br />
real issue is i would really like my aa's fixed or points refunded</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do think there should be a mechanism where once a {insert time period here} you can &quot;un-learn&quot; a particular AA and receive the points back.<br />
<br />
Certainly some skills (DC for example) are getting a tad outdated and with the raising of the level cap to 70, the ability to perma-charm a level 46 MOB has lost some of its allure.<br />
<br />
Same thing with the stat bonus ones. While at the time it was important I raised certain stats, with new and improved equipment (IMAGINE THAT ! ME A NON-RAIDER WANTING NEW AND IMPROVED PIXELS) those AA's could be better spent elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">im not asking for a &quot;unlearn&quot; ablility, i earned the points for sc5...and spent them... but after the last big patch, my sc5 is now sc3 again(with all the points being still used) <br />
<br />
what im saying is SC5 aa is really sc3 for a lot more aa points.. its broken they have replied to me and told me some aa's are broken because of the last patch... and that they are &quot;looking into it&quot;... i dont want to unlearn aa's i just want the ones i have to FUGGIN WORK RIGHT<br />
<br />
i usually dont complain and go with the flow of the game...i dont concern myself that cleric heal better or druids get better heals then us or that our dps does nt do diddly in short fights blah blah blah... but what i cant stand is that when i earn something in the game , and it works the way its discribed...after adding MORE to the game, the stuff i earned doesnt work anymore... thats just a big pile of BS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ryoz, they have actually made the AAs &quot;toggleable.&quot; There is now an option to have both a hotkey for Spirit Call and Advanced Spirit Call. Go to the AA window and make a separate hotkey for Advanced Spirit Call.<br />
<br />
The hotkeys run off the same timer (can't have 8 pets out) but it's nice to have options. (do I want to do a lot of damage with 3 super proccing dogs or do I want 5 dogs interrupting and pushing?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SC5 is NOT BROKEN - in fact, it's fixed, so cheer up.<br />
<br />
With the latest patch you can now choose between using the 5 pets with spirit call 3, or the pets from advanced spirit call.<br />
<br />
Just make separate hotkeys for SC3 and ASC2, and use the one you want, when you want. Note: they are on the same timer.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>takk the silent one</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think AA is screwy period..... I started to run out of decent things to put AA in so I decided why not... lets have a second forte.  Most of our high level dots are conjuration (plus spear of torment) so why not do conjuration... in a  5 or 6 mins I put in a few DoTs, used spear of torment then the group decided to move (invis).....  One guess what my second forte became.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That's your own fault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Unless they changed it you can still reset all your specs through the ruby turn in quest in the Temple of Solusek Ro, located in Lavastorm.<br />
<br />
Once reset cast until alt is 51+ then conj 51+ as those 2 will now qualify to go above the cap.<br />
<br />
I'm uncertain as to how determining primary and secondary would work with the AA, but to be safe I would then additionally be sure that alt is the first spec to go 100+ and force itself into the primary spec position.<br />
<br />
That should reset your specs to what you wish...and considering how much we cast alt spells it would take little time to regain your spec caps.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
