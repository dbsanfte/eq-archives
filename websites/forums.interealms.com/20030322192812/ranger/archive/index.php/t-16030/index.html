<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trakken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a friend who said theyd try to sol jaeil for  me if we could get down there easy. So i figure use the tactic of kill the mage, FD their ass down to a safe point and have the monk or rogue or whatever we use use an essence emerald to rez em. Then coth and smack the crap out jaeil. My question is, 1. Could a 65 mage do it ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Anlashok Entilzha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How is this Mage going to turn in your Shiny Tin Bowl, or are you both going to die and get a drag down?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there are roamers in Jaeil's tunnel, and at least one of them is a rock golem, beware.<br />
and yes, turning the bowl requires at least indiff, maybe a rogue can do it, tho i doubt a rogue can get the bowl *shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He's going to have the mage  CotH him down, so the mage or rogue doesn't need to turn in the bowl.<br />
<br />
As for whether the mage can solo Jaeil with pet, I'd guess so, but there is another spawn or two in the area. I'm not sure how tough those uber pets are, so can't be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I bet the mage could probably do it.  But you will get roamers that you'll either need to clear beforehand, or deal with as they walk by.  Were you going to have a monk use a Rez stick to rez the mage?  Or try to have a necro FD his way down and rez the mage?  <br />
<br />
The way I've seen this kind of thing work is to place a cleric in the pool with the bridge over it in the tunnel from the undead tower down to Yael/Nortlav.  If you get in the corner of the pool you wont aggro anything.  The mage gets killed, and drug down to the cleric by a Brell Rogue mule.  Cleric rezes the mage, and mage CoH's everyone down.  Then just fight up the tunnel, past undead tower to Jaeil.  This way the number of mobs you need to kill is probably 20 or less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Heilos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just fight to Jaeil, its not that hard...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just my 2 copper here, but I have witnessed a 65 mage pet vs the 65 bst lord pet; all they did was buff them as they normally do when solo...the bst lord pet ownzd the mage pet.<br />
As always YMMV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brumla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmm rock golem could be banished maybe ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Muvandog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Monks and rogues can't use essence emeralds, you'd need a necro for that.  They could use the Vox staff tho, if you have one and want to use up a charge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tolian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just fight down.  Its a joke getting to Jaeil these days, especially if this mage really is 'uber' like you're saying.  Also, you can now safely jump into Yael's pit from Paineel and live, if your encumbrance is low enough.  I've done it many times since PoP came out.  I think there was a change to falling damage or something to that effect.  Its like a 4 or 500 dmg fall, and there's only a couple eles, 1 fiend, and a golem when you land.  Not too much to handle really.  Good luck to ya tho  :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Araya Le'Bon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think jaeil is a corpse camping mob...ie if you aggro him and pull him he will just sit in the new spot and not return home.   This would make it very easy for a monk worth his salt to pull him at least to the point of no return(pit drop off).  Monk could then get CoTH or die or gate or something and come back in and finish the pull.<br />
<br />
I have pulled mobs that corpse camp from the chardok bank to the zone in like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grimmace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just before J's pool room is a little landing.  Every time I have killed him we have pulled him up to there.  Never had a roamer.  Course we cleared the pool room first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Jaeil the Wretched does return back to his spawn point if agroed. It takes maybe 5 minutes tho. On a raid there a month or so ago, a bard accidently agored him while we were killing a wanderer and the chanter mem-blurred him. and we waitied around hoping hed go back to spawn and sit down and he did.<br />
<br />
Im NOT sure about Jaeil the Insane. To find out, youd have to wipe to him i suppose, and if you wipe to Jaeil, you dont deserve Swifty. Go play gems. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Calador Stormblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Funny thing, a friend of mine was trying to catch up to a raid with his guild that was already past the city. They had decided to have him run down till he died then have their rogue drag him the rest of the way to the group for a rez.  My friend, having never been past the drop off asked me to run his character (57 shaman) down as I know the hole pretty well.  I sowed and invised, and took off, ran all the way through the city and downt he tunnel to the guild (the tunnel was clear) without ever agroing a mob, I camped him out just to be safe.  I didn't think it was possible, and probably was a fluke.</div></div><hr />
