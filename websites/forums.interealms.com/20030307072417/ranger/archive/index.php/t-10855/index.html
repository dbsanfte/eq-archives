<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foxx Firethorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Foxx Firethorn was born on July 23rd, on the cusp of Cancer and Leo, a green-eyed red-haired healthy Elven baby. Son of Xian; a mighty Warrior, and Talia; a powerfull Druidess, they brought their baby up in the beautiful forest home Kelethin. As soon as he learned to crawl their son was a handful, crawling around in just a leaf and his family amulet, getting into trouble and annoying pixies. One brilliant summer day, Talia and Xian decided to go visit a friend in Butcherblock, and show their son the ocean for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember my Mother's warm smile and laughter, my Father's proud eyes as he looked at me and held me over the water with his strong arms. The ocean was sparkling with the sunset, as waves of water crashed around my feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
We went to make the journey home when night began to fall, however something happened that night, that I recall naught of. That night we never made it home, and I was alone in the wild, except for the eyes piercing through the darkness.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My new parents were warm and furry, at night they covered over me like a living blanket. I had been found and raised by foxes, cared for as if I was their own child. I lived with them for a time, learning about the intricate balance of nature, of prey and predator, of life. Eventually though I would have to leave my home, my family, as I grew from toddler to child of seven cycles.<br />
<br />
It was a cool misty morning in the forest, when my fox parents led me out into a clearing near a path. In the distance I spotted a stranger, clad in some unusual fur (I knew not of clothes then) and holding a sort of long branch. He was new and strange to me, yet something about him very familiar. The traveler glanced about and noticed me, giving me a strange look as he said something that I could faintly recall hearing before, yet could not understand.<br />
<br />
When I didnt respond, he slowly started walking towards me, so I took afew steps back and let out a loud defensive &quot;Yip!&quot;. The stranger stopped in his tracks for a moment, then continued and quickened his pace. Looking back to my parents for support, I saw they were already in the edge of the forest, sitting and watching. Enough! I started running back towards them, but was swiftly grabbed by the man and picked up. He said afew more words shaking his head as he made his way to the path with me slung across his shoulder, kicking, biting, and barking. I let out a long sad whine as I looked at my parents one last time, and noticed a tear in my mothers eye.<br />

Well thats the first half of Foxx Firethorn's beginning, I've written and re-written to the best I could, hopefully you enjoyed it. Any critisicm or comments would be appreciated, and I can get to work on the second half, where he gets his first name and discovers his last, mis-adventures in trying to be made civilized and clothed, and coming to be a Ranger.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Foxx Firethorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ehe Im working on that, but first I need to finish this half, its just a rough draft. I think I need to put in some more detail on the surroundings, his parents, add in a paragraph or two about something that happens while he's living with his parents. It's bad to go from toddler to seven years in a paragraph, but eh its a rough draft.</div></div><hr />
