<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Do yall always have KEI in groups?  <br />
<br />
I was in a group Saturday that I group with pretty frequently in LDoN.  I made the mistake of mentioning halfway through the adventure that I didn't have KEI.  <br />
<br />
They got pretty upset and demanded that I always get a fresh KEI before doing an adventure with them, despite the fact that I had just finished 3 consecutive adventures the day before without having KEI.  <br />
<br />
I always figured one of the advantages of playing a shammy was that I wasn't dependent upon KEI.    The only time I ever got KEI leveling up was if there was a MGB and it happened to hit me.  I never wanted to be dependent upon it, should I be now?  Am I just playing wrongly because I am not taking advantage of the fact that KEI exists?  It isn't that I turn it down when grouped with a chanter, I just don't go and seek it out when I don't have it.  I guess it is an advantage that I could have but don't always, so in that way I guess I am not playing as efficiently as I could be.  On the other hand, I don't have to stop what I am doing and go hunt for KEI this way either.<br />
<br />
Opinions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Because of our superior mana regen ability other folks just cannot understand our lack of adiction to KEI.  It may make things a bit easier but I can't see that big of difference to a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If its working for you without KEI then you needn't worry about it. <br />
<br />
What KEI does is give you a deeper mana pool and make you canni less.  It makes it easier for a shaman.  For many other caster classes, its almost a necessity to have some form of mana regen in an adventure because they have no other way to get mana back and to keep up the kill pace they need to get mana back as quickly as possible. <br />
<br />
On the other hand....ever have an adventure you lost by 5 seconds?  I have.  Would kei have helped you kill fast enough to make up that five seconds?  It probably would :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont NEED KEI, but I wont turn it down, and if I'm in PoK and have the time I'll grab it just because it helps.  It does help a great deal in LDoN though. The groups I usually get into pull really, really fast, and there just isn't enough time to cannabalize.  On the other hand I can survive any fast pulling group without it. I'm just weird and don't like to see my mana bar fall below 50%, :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">KEI's always nice and I generally will get it before heading of for xp somewhere.

<br />
Now that statement is just silly.<br />
<br />
As others have said, KEI in not required for a shaman.  I’ve played a druid to 51st level and believe me there’s a world of difference playing with and without KEI.  But as shaman we can canni our manna back.  It can be a lot of work to do so before we get canni five, but it’s certainly workable.  And if you function perfectly well without KEI, as you seem to have been doing, I see no reason why you should donate for it against your will.  <br />
<br />
That having been said, I always get KEI before grouping and especially before joining an adventure.  And I usually try to get a fresh KEI between adventures if we are going to have some down time getting new group members.  KEI makes my job much easier, which in turn makes playing my character more enjoyable.  For me that’s worth the effort and cost of seeking out an enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I never buy it.  I've got friends who buy a fresh one each and every time we do anything but I'm already making mages rich enough on Xegony with my pet kit purchases, someone else can support the chanters  :p   I don't feel that I need it anyway.  It's nice, I enjoy the heck out of it when I have it, but I'm a shaman, not some wiener dr00d!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Is it?<br />
<br />
I could perform my shamanly duties without equipment, I've done it in the past when I had to for cr, etc.<br />
<br />
It's easier with gear...you are not playing to your fullest if you are not using all of the tools available to you, ie equipment and to a lesser extent kei. It is lazy to not bother getting it before you head out with your character. You are not performing to your fullest for your group or yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hate being naked, nothing more frustrating than sitting naked in PoK and finding out that you can't cast fo7 due to insufficient mana - with a full bar.<br />
I like KEI/C5 'cause I'm lazy, it saves a couple of can4 casts a minute.  But I rarely run low enough in mana during experience groups that I consider it essential for the group efficiency to get one for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nah, it's not lazy.  It's called, &quot;I'm a shaman with Cann5, I guess I'll work a little harder and Cann a few more times for that mana.&quot;  I'm not going to feel bad for my poor wittle gwoupy because I'm missing a KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You are not playing to your fullest if you are not using all of the tools available to you ... to a lesser extent kei ... It is lazy to not bother getting it before you head out with your character. You are not performing to your fullest for your group or yourself.<br />
<br />
I'm a wisdom junkie, I'll admit that. While I'd love to make Tordail a tanking shaman, three just isn't much space for that sort of thing in the groups I get. /shrug ... I can handle adds, no problem, and that is satisfying. At any rate, I fail to see how KEI is a necessity. With Form of the Great Bear I'm at somewhere in my 250's wisdom-wise, and it's not a problem for me to cannibalize mid-fight. With or without KEI, I can empty spell after spell into a mob ... aye, it puts a dent my mana pool, but it's not the sort of thing that makes me particularly antsy. I love a good Clarity, no matter what level, and there's a beastlord spell whose name escapes me at the moment that's also great for mana regen. But ... Cannibalize ... mana regen ... /shrug<br />
<br />
Not having a KEI does not mean we're not performing to our fullest for our group or ourselves, not at all. Are you slowing what your puller brings you? Are you helping slow-peel adds? Are you keeping up with spot-heals (in some cases, a full Secondary Heal)? Then KEI or not, you are fulfilling the duties that are expected of you. <br />
<br />
Lazy? Nope. There are times between adventures we barely leave ourselves time to sell, split, and refresh buffs before heading back in ... KEI, when I get it, always wears roughly halfway through the second adventure (if it's not an extended version). Yep, like someone said a couple of posts ago ... KEI will probably help you win when you've got that 5 seconds left as opposed to being KEI-less ... but I never have had a problem operating KEI-less and have been known to take on a third and fourth adventure KEI-less rather than hit the group with the downtime required to go grab KEI and fully rebuff the group. <br />
<br />
If there's KEI around, sure, I'll take it. Heck, why not? But I don't actively seek it out ... and if you've been operating KEI-less with no problems thus far, well more power to you. <br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah, I know. <br />

<br />
I don't have Can V yet, so I like having a deeper mana pool and a quicker mana regen to augment canni IV.<br />
<br />
But I don't DEPEND on KEI.  When KEI drops, I simply alter my style to take having to canni a bit more into account, that's all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Lazy? Heh by that token it is lazy not to get BSS also, or mage kit for pets, or hell 9/symbol instead of virtue, or the BL mana regen buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At 53 I find I'm fairly miserable if I don't have KEI.  I guess I suck.  I also do almost all LDoN where the pace is very fast, I'm casting big slows on every single critter, and I'm casting all kinds of other spells constantly.  I find I need KEI AND canni constantly to keep up.  I did LDoN once without KEI and it was pure hell...the server happened to die and we got booted and I was actually sort of glad it happened to end my misery.<br />
<br />
I also never got canni2 and I'm nearly to canni3...I still cann1 til I have carpal even with KEI.  Maybe once I hit higher levels and have canni5 and torpor+ I'll feel less inclined to have KEI, but probably not.  It's hard to turn down faster mana regen and a bigger mana pool - since I'm all about casting spells.<br />
<br />
Now, I could get by without KEI, but I would have to cast a lot less spells than I normally do...and I like casting spells.  I would also probably have to go with a lesser slow to conserve mana for the LDoN pacing...which is what I used to do preKEI levels (and at those levels most critters were far less deadly and died so fast my biggest slow was overkill at that point).  Pretty much everyone I group with for LDoN pickup groups uses KEI if they can...you want to reduce/eliminate med breaks if you want to finish most of the time.<br />
<br />
So, I get a fresh KEI before every LDoN run unless I know I have super extended KEI and just finished a quick one.  I also get KEI before I hit the planes (on the rare occasions I go) - but I happen to do planes groups with some friends and one of has a KEI enabled chanter that delivers.<br />
<br />
Heck, if possible I like to have KEI, beastcrack, regrowth, and canni constanly so I can be floating in mana and be able to toss some DDs to raise my evocation skill in addition to everything else I do.  :P<br />
<br />
To each his own.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Funny thread because this is one of my pet peeves.  KEI is nice.  I wont EVER go out of my way to get it.  But if I'm passing by and someone is casting I'll take some.  Here is what I saw different in LDoN w/ and w/o KEI.  With KEI my mana never dropped below 80 unless it was a terrible pull.  W/O KEI my mana never dropped below 60 unless it was a terrible pull.  Mind you Im backup healing...slowing incoming mobs and the adds...root parking mobs if we have no chanter...Dotting when a single is in camp.  As long as you know how to Canni dance...you'll be fine and it sounds like ya do.  The whole time that I'm in the dungeon I'm Canni dancing.  <br />
<br />
For those that dont do it (the canni dance..no lauging...ive seen alot of people my level that havent a clue) here is how it works.<br />
<br />
Cast Canni...sit...wait for mana bar tick..stand...cast....sit and wait again...stand...cast...etc.<br />
<br />
Fairly easy to do...extremely fast mana regen.  <br />

<br />
It's more mana.  If you cannot figure out what to do with more mana, you need help (hint: nuke harder or pull faster).  I usually fight with ft12, mc3, emp shawl effect, and KEI (in addition to whatever I can get from my group, if I have one).  I use canni 5 as it pops and canni 4 religiously.  <br />
<br />
And you know what?  I never have a problem finding ways to spend all that mana.  You could triple my mana regeneration and I would still be able to use more.<br />
<br />
The &quot;work harder&quot; explanation entirely misses the point.  You can work just as hard clicking that canni button with the KEI icon in your buff window as you can without it there.  Its still a lot more mana and, contrary to some of the fantasizers on this board, shamans are in fact a casting class.  <br />
<br />
It usually takes me all of 2 minutes and 100pp to get a 3+ hour KEI.  The effect is well worth several times that.</div></div><hr />

hehe, I dont' remember the last time I've actually canni &quot;danced&quot;.<br />
<br />
I never bother with KEI / VoQ unless I'm in a raid and someone casts it on me.  (Neither do I complain when I glance up and see that I have it, but it's just not a big enough issue with me).<br />
<br />
I also find myself cann'ing at full-health a lot and catch myself there.  It's funny, it's almost like in slow motion - I glance up and see I'm at full health so I whack cann - then notice I'm full mana too.<br />
<br />
This is most normal exp groups with me slowing, dotting, backup heals, root-parking, or whatever as needed.  I don't remember the last time I've sat down to med - or sat down in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well said, Uggok.  I find it ironic that shamans are known for their mana regen yet will not pickup a KEI to increase it even more.  <br />
<br />
I'm also a bit mystified by the mana regen vs. mana pool argument.  mana regen is great over the long term, but when i have to cast several spells RIGHT NOW, i need a lot of mana RIGHT NOW, not after i've had a chance to cannibalize it.  <br />
<br />
I understand that hps are very important to shamans, but to me a mana pool of 3000 mana with 2000 hps is better than 2000 mana with 3000hps (as is obvious from my magelo profile).  Cannibalization certainly requires X hps in order to use it without dying or getting frenzy aggro, but Stoicism/Torpor/Quiessence all heal a fixed number of hps for fixed amount of mana.  That means for X hps cannibalized, you spend Y mana healing and net Z mana, all of which (X, Y, Z) are fixed irrespective of the size of your hp pool.  The actual values will only vary from shaman to shaman based on their natural regen rate.  <br />
<br />
Having said all that, could someone give me a good explanation of why hps &gt; wis?  I don't see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">It's more mana.

Bingo. Even with bard/beastlord/pot9/voq/ft 4 plus my own canni 4/5, I could easily use more mana if I could regen it faster(I've had all of that before and still wished for more mana to help kill things faster or lessen the strain on clerics for faster/multiple pulls).<br />
<br />
There is no such thing as too much mana regen, I stand by my previous statement. If you are not using all of the tools available you are being -lazy- and not playing your class to its fullest, and letting yourself and your group down by doing so.<br />
<br />
If you were grouped with a cleric who never got kei and slowed the group down because of it would you group with them in the future? I know I wouldn't...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Fateholder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Snapdragon, to answer your question about didnt anyone kill anything before KEI the answer is yes but they didnt have to fight 500+ hitting quaders in Planes.  All they had to do was handly Kunark Velious and Luclin wimps.  PoP added lvls, spells and a whole new range of high hitting mobs.<br />
<br />
that said, after my necro i can only play fast mana regaining classes or classes with no need for mana at all(melees, bards, shaman , necro basically) and it pisses me off when cleric makes whole group wait.  They gotta do what they gotta do, i just wish everyone was has efficient has us lol.</div></div><hr />

I love doing damage in groups, and KEI really helps with me having the mana to do significant damage.  Plus, unlike necro mana-regen, it stacks with our self mana regen.  So why would you ever turn it down?  I guess me not having a ton of FT may also make a difference here.  I only sit at 5 FT otherwise, and tho I've maxed helpful AA's and have a ManaPresIV item, it's still nice to have a KEI.  I'll get a 9 too if possible heh.  And then invite a beastlord!

<br />
Several reasons, but the 2 best ones that I think make 3k hps/2k mana a much better balance than 2k hps / 3k mana.<br />
<br />
1) When grping/raiding etc its  likely that another class will be able to throw a cpl heals your way, but only a cpl classes can 'infuse' you with mana (SK's and Necros are the 2 that spring to mind).  More HPs = more the other people in the grp can help you (indirecty) with your mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) You can take more damage from mobs (obviously).  I've died plenty of times with my blue bar half full...but never the red bar. :)<br />
<br />
I only recently acquired Canni 5, and it does make quite a difference when I'm buffed with Virt (puts me at ~4400 hps) compared to when I'm self buffed.  I wish I could hit 4k selfbuffed, that would be nice.</div></div><hr />

Unlike many other classes we can function perfectly effectivly without that mind candy, however we will function better with it.  More mana = can do more things, or can slack off on Canning for lesser carpal tunnel syndrome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I messed around with canni dancing a little, but hardly seems worth while to me, maybe I just didn't try it enough to notice the difference. I chain cast canni 3 most of the time, when I get to 60-75% health depending on what hp buffs I have, i'll cast stoicism or get chealed if group has cleric and start over. I usually hover around 60% mana, when casting malosi, slow and a dot or nuke on every mob.<br />
<br />
I do own a drogmar though, so in outdoor zones the mana does flow quite a bit better.</div></div><hr />

In LDON, time is the critical factor.  Time spent casting canni, kraggs, torpor for mana is time you could have used to throw an extra nuke if you had KEI.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I've died plenty of times with my blue bar half full...but never the red bar. :)<br />
<br />
I've died twice with my red bar at about 35%.  Both were on a failed CoD flagging event when I was mobbed by about 115 level 60ish skeletons that were popping in pairs when people died.  I think i took about 40k damage in 0.01s.  :D <br />
<br />
If you take a 2k nuke every 3 minutes you want more HPs than wis.<br />
<br />
That doesn't follow.  It just says that hps are important, which is true.  It doesn't say they're more important than Wisdom period, and has no bearing on hps&gt;wis in terms of mana pool or regeneration, which is the context where I typically see the comparison.<br />
<br />
When grping/raiding etc its likely that another class will be able to throw a cpl heals your way<br />
<br />
I try to avoid this since I don't want to take mana from the rest of my group.  It does happen and but is not dependent on the number of hps I have.  A_healer_27 notices I'm at 60% (of 3k or 5k they don't care) and swings a heal my way.<br />
<br />
The only situation seems to be cannibalization and there the bar seems to be about 3.5k hps is the desired number, which is a fair amount.  But I can give myself ~7-800hps or so with self buffs (Focus + stamina buffs) and typically have some sort of cleric buff, Virtue or otherwise.  Even with just Temperance (800hps), that puts me in the 3200hp range with my current (admittely mediocre) equipment.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I don't want to belabor the point.  The debate I'm really targeting is mana regen vs. mana pool.  Mana regen is fixed where as mana pool can be increased thru Wis (and +mana items).  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
OK, I just think this is silly.  Clerics don't have anywhere near the mana regen I do, so the comparison is invalid to begin with.  I don't ask if people have KEI and certainly wouldn't demand that they get it.  If they weren't able to keep up with the healing needs I would notice and maybe not group with them again - if there are clerics who can heal effectively without KEI, I don't really care if they have it or not.  I *can* keep up with healing/slowing/dotting/nuking/rooting without KEI, so I think it is out of line for someone to insist/demand that I get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">For me, it depends on the zone I'm going to and my group make up.<br />
<br />
Seems like most of my LDoN groups lately have been 4 melees, a cleric, and me. If I know the group is going to be like this, I usually grab a KEI - it just makes it easier to keep all the tanks fully buffed, slow, CC with root, and backup heal. Also, with lots of melees, you don't have a lot of burst DPS, so it allows me to toss nukes in once in awhile to help out.<br />
<br />
But most of the time, I usually don't bother with it unless it's free. Especially if I'm in a PoP group, I usually stay at 70% mana or more because I can use my horse.<br />

Really? You don't think other classes can notice the difference between you without kei and a shaman just like you that is making the group run more smoothly because they have kei?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know someone usually snags me within 5 minutes of 1ogging on to do something, and really that is good enough for me.  <br />
<br />
As far as your question goes, I don't know, I could take a poll.  But I doubt it.  Since we had just run 3 successful adventures when I didn't have KEI, and the only reason it came up was because I happened to mention it, and then the big freakout occurred, it seems that they didn't have a problem with my performance, just the fact that I had no KEI.  <br />
<br />
I enjoy not being dependent on KEI and I'm glad I can be effective without it.    I'm not sure what the purpose of being the class with the best mana regen capabilities if we are hamstrung by constantly having to have KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Thats just the thing.  There isnt a single class that NEEDS KEI.  So many have become soo dependent on it its just sick.  You can be mana efficient and still do your job effectively without KEI.  People have been killing mobs w/o KEI for years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">KEI increases your mana regen, no matter how many times you cann, KEI still will give you extra mana on top, extra mana to nuke, heal, buff quicker, or just not worry about canning as much.  The only times i really dont get KEI are when im going to a raid (get VoQ there) or the stuff im fighting is very trivial.<br />
<br />
most of the time i wont leave a group to get KEI tho, i will look for an enc in zone and buy one for the group or get one for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Bjorgn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I also do almost all LDoN where the pace is very fast, I'm casting big slows on every single critter, and I'm casting all kinds of other spells constantly.  I find I need KEI AND canni constantly to keep up.  I did LDoN once without KEI and it was pure hell...<br />
<br />
I also never got canni2 and I'm nearly to canni3...I still cann1 til I have carpal even with KEI.  <br />

Hey man, I only quoted some of your post so everyone didn't have to read the whole thing again. <br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
Nowhere does it say you have to use your Best slow, Best Haste, Best Resist Debuff, Best Melee Debuff.  Don't feel like you are shortchanging your group if you're using your second best slow or second best haste! Sometimes its just more mana efficient (like sans KEI situations).<br />
 <br />
I was in your situation at one point without Canni 2 and almost to Canni 3. Just tough it out. In LDoN the mobs are dropping so fast sometimes its not even worth slowing unless there is more than one mob. Next time you are in an adventure and its all single pulls, try not slowing and dropping Stoic on the tank when the mob is at 20 percent or tossing another heal on him. Odds are the Cleric is CHing anyway so what difference does it make if he is CHing from 50 or 30 percent tank health. <br />
<br />
Before the flames start...This is totally geared towards LDoN situations and we all realize you can't get away with that in most PoP situations =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I think its great you learned how to play without using KEI. If your group is yelling at you for not getting it, your group is just being unreasonable. Now maybe they are unhappy with you because your not able to handle the load, maybe your missing slows and such, I don't know. If your able to perform all your shaman duties without KEI, no one has the right to complain.<br />
I find that I still need to have KEI in LDoN missions though, the pace is simply too fast to rely on canni alone. Of course if anyone I was grouped with told me I was lazy or irresponsible for not having it, I would tell them to tend to their own business and let me tend to mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I think no one denies that there is an advantage to having KEI.  The question is whether or not it adversely affects your group if you don't.  I like a KEI, just like anyone else; it means I can do more (nuke/heal etc) with less effort.  Without it, I have to work harder, and be a bit more economical with my mana.  In fast killing groups (LDoN, PoP) I do feel the pinch without it, as I don't contribute as much as I'd like; however, in most cases, my contribution to kill rates is unseen (only lvl 1 SCF, and how many people do you know who pay attention to the 'mob xxx's skin melts' message enough to turn around and ask why you're not nuking as much.<br />
<br />
So long as I'm always busy, throwing the odd nuke here and there as mana permits, healing, slowing, buffing, no one I've ever grouped with cares. I'm sure if I started asking for med breaks there'd be hell to pay though.  :D <br />
<br />
So, back to the point of the original post, I won't go out of my way to get it.  If I'm heading off to solo or duo with my girlfriend, sure, I like to grab it, it'll last the first 3-4 hours of our killing time, but once it wears off / is dispelled, neither of us will stop to go get another.  I don't *have* to get one before going into LDoN or PoP - if someone gives it to me, I'm grateful, but that's it.  For the lower level shaman, it's a different story - lack of canni 4 / 5 really hurts, and KEI is a godsend.  Whether you have to have it though, well, that all depends on your own feelings going into a group/adventure.<br />
<br />
P.S. As my magelo probably shows, I lean towards the 'balanced mana and hps' method - I don't care how fast I can regen mana, there are times when I want my mana, and I want it now, not a few (possibly deadly) canni's away.  I always try to keep FM, and a larger mana pool means that when the proverbial hits the fan, I have the reserves to do whatever is necessary; sometimes, you just can't stop to canni between heals/slows/CC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">KEI, for a shaman with Canni V, is certainly not necessary for you to do your job. <br />
<br />
But do you want to just &quot;do your job&quot; or do you want to excel, and add all you can to the group? <br />
<br />
If its the latter then you should get a kei, and instead of hitting canni IV you can cast an extra rain, dot or nuke and help out the group dps a bit, or help out with heals so the druid has more mana for their rather more effective nukes, or the cleric can add in some of their rather decent dps vs undead.<br />
<br />
I don't always go in with KEI either - I like the fact I can get by just fine without it and some days I just want to take it easy. In general I will get a kei where I can, if that means porting to pok and paying for it even - but I won't wait around just because I can't find anyone casting it, nor will I pay to refresh a kei before an adventure if I know its got 30 mins+ left on it still.<br />
<br />
Do as you like, but I wouldnt' be surprised if some people get a little upset because you may be perceived to not be adding everything you can to the group. At the end of the day though, any group who won't accept you on that basis is silly - the skill of the player is far more significant.</div></div><hr />
