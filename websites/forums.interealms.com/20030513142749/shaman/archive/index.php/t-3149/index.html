<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Edit : bah had to convert all pics to links<br />
<br />
Well this forum was looking rather bare so I thought I'd post something I posted on our private guild board a long time ago when I first retired.<br />
<br />
<br />
In a fit of drunken mischief on Saturday night I decided that I could'nt be bothered to do anything strenuous and sick of all the spam floating about in dreadlands I decided to see just how stupid peope can be.<br />
<br />
One of my alts, Kareoke, is a 50 Bard.<br />
<br />
First I activated my Iksar Illusion mask, put on my Shade silk robe, Dizok Wristsnapper and went barefisted in the other hand, I also removed my SS legs and boots and helm to look more monkeyesque.<br />
<br />
I is monky ! (http://www.mechamonkey.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Pics/everquest/Karemonk/karemonk.jpg) <br />
<br />
Then it was time to get some work, youll notice imediately that I have l33t tanking skills (well I was missing lots of armor) thus adding to my monk disguise ;p<br />
<br />
45 Monk LFG (http://www.mechamonkey.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Pics/everquest/Karemonk/45monklfg.jpg)<br />
<br />
I was then chosen to be puller the only problem being we had no sower, no problem as I had 49 selos to fire off and as there was another bard in the group I took a chance that they wouldnt realise, they didnt ;p<br />
<br />
Jboots? (http://www.mechamonkey.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Pics/everquest/Karemonk/jboots.jpg)<br />
<br />
Finally it was time <br />
<br />
INC! (http://www.mechamonkey.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Pics/everquest/Karemonk/inc.jpg)<br />
<br />
Thenn it was time to impress the group with my l33t damage , fear the powah of Bard Tanking !<br />
<br />
Phear my ub3r DPS (http://www.mechamonkey.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Pics/everquest/Karemonk/l33tdamage.jpg)<br />
<br />
To help with the illusion , I kept hitting the Instill Doubt button for the animation, unfortunately it went off with an alarming regularity and we ended up chasing things all over he place, oops...<br />
<br />
Oops ID works (http://www.mechamonkey.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Pics/everquest/Karemonk/id.jpg)<br />
<br />
I also had the dreaded 'You feel like you are about to look like yourself again' message so I had to nip round the corner and dont he disguise again , I told em it was a long pull....<br />
<br />
umm long pull honest (http://www.mechamonkey.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Pics/everquest/Karemonk/longpull.jpg)<br />
<br />
This went on for an hour and not one person guessed , I even swapped to a seb croaking dirk !! at one point and started doing the odd pulse of Verses of victory claiming it was an effect on my robe (AC 6 , uber!), still not a single question, one of them even inspected me and said 'nice stuff' /boggle.<br />
I was also actually complimented at one point on how much damage I was doing, I assusre you I was not :)   <br />
<br />
No idiots were actually harmed in the making of this post and it all ended happily, I did'nt have the heart to confess in the end, they were nice people :)  <br />
<br />
Ahh bless (http://www.mechamonkey.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/Pics/everquest/Karemonk/thanks.jpg)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>media_junkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well I know when a monk uses Instill Doubt it has a kick part to it, so maybe the bard instill doubt does also.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />

When peeps see me casting spells I just tell them it is the Clickable effect of my armour.<br />
<br />
The only time it doesn't work is when partying with peeps who have been playing for a good while, or when I get asked to pull something with a Bow.<br />
<br />
2 years and 4 months to get to 52, I must go close to being the slowest levelling Shaman around.<br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eldril Mystwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Has anybody seen/remember seeing the Barbarian Shammy/Rogue. A Similar Story where a Barb Shammy pretended to be a rogue in KC. He even roleplayed so much as to let groupmembers die when he could have easily healed. He Asked for haste and even attempted to help CR...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I can see this happening easily.  I turn off the damage done by others to help with lag.  I am an inny worshiping troll and have a one shot rechargable halfling illusion mask.  I have sat around the oasis hasting people telling them that druids get haste spells in PoP.  I'll tell you what, that little mask sure does make a difference when you need to pass by goodies and you don't want to rely on invis when it seems to drop at the worst times.</div></div><hr />
