<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I spent my usual few hours in the sebilis emperor room trying to get some spells for cash and an odd thing happened...<br />
<br />
spawn 1: PH<br />
spawn 2: Emperor Chottal - drops pox! - hastily scribed this haven't seen it in 4 months of camping Emperor<br />
spawn 3: Emperor Chottal - drops torpor! - at this point I'm thinking this is nothing too unusual as I've had back to back Emperors)<br />
spawn 4: Emperor Chottal - drops torpor again! - not only have I never seen 3 emperors in a row I've never seen 2 torpors<br />
spawn 5: Emperor Chottal - drops torpor for the third time! - at his point I'm freaking out wondering what the hell is happening<br />
spawn 6: Emperor Chottal - drops pox again! - ok I have now lost the plot<br />
spawn 7: PH<br />
spawn 8: PH - I left with my bounty and got some real nice equipment upgrades!<br />
<br />
If that was randomness I'll eat my hat, could this have been some kind of wierd bug? Anyone else seen shaman spell drop rates up?</div></div><hr />

I was in on a Sev kill at the weekend, didn't drop one shammy spell - 2 wizzy ones and 3 cleric, plus the necro walking death one. Grrr. One day I'll get malo.....one day.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">torpor is worth a hell of alot more then those legs.<br />
<br />
with that bounty would easily be able to get malo and those legs<br />
<br />
<br />
btw ... i hate you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We dropped Sev last week and he dropped Malo and 2 copies of VoB.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ultrazach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Actually, there may have been an increase in drops because over the weekend I saw three copies of Pox being sold and two Torps on Cazic Thule.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A recent patch announced changes to drop rates for beastlord spirit of snow and spirit of flame. I doubt they'd do the same for us and not say something - unless there was a mistake. <br />
<br />
I suspect its all pure chance - we know what the random number generator is like :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
A guildmate of mine snagged one of those copies of Torpor.  He now owes his soul and firstborn child to some very generous guildies. ;)<br />
<br />
 I didn't even try, as I'm still in debt from buying Malo a week or so ago...two copies of Malo up on the same vendor, it was like the Indy 500 to get the money together before they were gone!<br />
<br />
Gee, with his Torpor and my Malo we almost equal &quot;one&quot; real 60+ shaman! :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But yes, I think either alot of people got really lucky, or there was a freak occurance of shaman drops off dragons these last couple weeks.  Two Malo's and two Torpor's up for sale is highly highly unusual.<br />
<br />
Gratz...oh and I hate you! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">ugh..... i hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate j00 ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">kiled gore few days ago...2x pox + total crap<br />
was very cool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm going to go against everyone elses response and say congratulations!  I've killed the Emp in Seb 40+ times, 20+ GWs, Chardok Royals 5-6 times, and Gore twice.  Only thing I have to show is Avatar which I really don't care much about.  I bought Malo for 60k, got lucky and found Pox for 5k.  Last week my guild killed Talendor while I was at work.  Being the only shaman in the guild you'd think I might get it but they gave it to a non guildee shaman who was present.  It was probably best anyway since I had been planning to leave the guild for about two weeks anyway.  Still kind of drove me nuts though.  On second thought, after reviewing my luck, I hate you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Farina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">over the weekend i saw 2 copies of torpor on xegony one for 100k and the other for 175k still up for sale.  i also saw 3 copies of malo up for 100k each from 3 different people. not sure if it is just a coincidence or more shammy spells are dropping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bexar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You should have hit Vegas with that kind of luck, you would have probably come home a rich Shammy. By the way, I too hate you!!:p :p :p :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Lets see, 1 copy of torpor in 9 months(for the whole guild), VS 3 copies of tropor in one night(for just you), erm, I hate joo too :) But congrats anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Eh, I need to pharm more cash for Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Valael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">So uh, am I nuts or was he soloing this camp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I solo'd Emp at 60 with no Torpor or Malo. Was rough but is doable. Just kept him slowed and rooted. When he is rooted he wont summon you because pet is in melee range. Always had to keep gate up because sometimes the skellies outside the Emp room come through that door which can make things get ugly really fast.<br />
<br />
Always make sure to have a quick way to kill him because if he gates you might want to gate or camp. I was lucky and camped everytime. Dog kept him busy until I got out. Didnt seem his skellie guards attacked my pet in there.<br />
<br />
Now at 62 it is a joke how easy he is. Plus I have Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Still gots no Malo...<br />
<br />
But went to hunt GW's in SF and we pulled first one. Killed, I opened the corpse and saw 2 scrolls and some words on it. Howered my cursor over the first spell and it said: Spell: Torpor... I couldn't believe my eyes, I had to loot it, check it again, scribe and check it yet again. Another day, we pulled in GW again and killed it. Opened the corpse and.. Pox of Bertoxxulous on it! Handy, what can I say.<br />
<br />
But still need some missing 59 spells and Malo and heck, Avatar too. I hate empty slots in the book...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I still dont have Malo or Pox, but I did find Voice in the bazaar yesterday for 800 plats. One step closer to finishing my Kunark spellbook...how many years later?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">He is trivial to solo at 62, I used to kill him duo with a 60 necro for snare now I just solo him and keep below 2 bubs of health which stops him running and gating. I camped him last night for 6 hours and got one vendor buyable beastlord spell, things are back to normal hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">yep , i hate you.<br />
<br />
<br />
62 and no torpor or malo .... going on 9 months now... i need to quit spending money and just save for malos and Quiss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If they did change anything, I'm sure this recent patch will put a stop to that.<br />
<br />
I still hate you.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">A January 30 (or was it 31) Sontalak kill netted us:<br />
<br />
SHM/59 Talisman of the Raptor (x2)<br />
SHM/59 Pox of Bertoxxulous<br />
SHM/60 Avatar<br />
SHM/60 Malo<br />
<br />
Possibly the drops have been tweaked.  That's a lot of shaman spells (from one mob).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I have been camping emp last two days. Someone said they got malo off him 2 nights ago. I was about 20 minutes too late to claim the camp that night. I did get him this morning and he dropped bane for me to sell. I am gonna try to get the camp for several hours tonight and see how it goes. Grats on your luck with torpor. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">For the first time in months, I saw another copy of Torpor go up in the bazaar.  Dropped every last coin I had on it.  Maybe the drop rate has increased some...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">One torpor drop and I would congratulate you.<br />
Two torpor drops and I would congratulate you and say what a lucky bastard you were.<br />
Three torpor drops and all I want to do is KEEELLL you.<br />

<br />
<br />

Grats anyway, you lucky *bleeping bleep bleeping bleep bleep bleep* :)</div></div><hr />
