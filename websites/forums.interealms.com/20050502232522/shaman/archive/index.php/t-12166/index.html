<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yett21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is my first post on the boards and I just wanted to say hi and a few things about myself.  My name is jeff and I have started a froglock shaman on the terris-thule server earlier today :) .  I concider myself the worst type of noob right now... I played EQ since day 1 and had (have) a 63lvl ranger and 55lvl healer..(along with soem lvl 50 characters on my account that family members left there.  But i have not played in about 2 years and have been off in other realms (DAoC and SB beta).  I haven't cared for the other games in about 4 months and have stopped most of my mmorpg playing and have just been having fun with rts like warcraft 3.  For a month now My uncle and a few real good online friends from terris-thule (baldore-pali.. kinin-healer) have been talking me into coming back and playing again.  They all caught me in a good mood the other day and i decided to rejoin my old realm.<br />
<br />
the good:<br />
I am going to be here for a while...nothing else seems to hold the intrest eq did for me and i have a lot of friends that have made me feel real welcome a few hours ago.  I have decided to start a new froglock shammy named Rathh to compliment my friends characters and am hoping this board is a good place to start learning about them<br />
<br />
the bad:(and some good)<br />
Like i said i am the worst noob...an ex-player.  I know stuff from just after velious and am stuck in everything. the controls feel weird since my other games and it is more fustrating knowing things like they were and not realizing they changed.  Also re-learning all the commands and economy is going to be a challenge along with all the new zones, features, etc.<br />
<br />
Sorry for taking up this post but I just wanted to say hi and got a little carried away.  Anyway, if any of you are in terris-thule look me up and say hi... the rest of you, I await posting with u and learning the ins and outs of this class and new eq I will be experiencing.<br />

Gimme a tell, in game, sometime.  I'm usually on from 9-12 (pm) est.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Congratulations on your return.  I think you’ll enjoy playing a shaman.  Since you’ve played both a ranger and a cleric you’ve seen both sides of the fence, as it were.  Some people who have played warrior types have a problem getting used to the casting and meding and casting and meding that spell casters have to do in groups.  One of the great things about being a shaman is that you can solo or you can group.  I spent my first 38 levels soloing and have been grouping every since.  My poor combat skills have suffered, but I’ve been having a great time, so what the heck.  You said that you were creating a shaman to group with your friends, which is a great thing, but I would also recommend soloing some as well.  They are distinct skills and learning to do both will serve you well.<br />
<br />
Welcome back.</div></div><hr />
