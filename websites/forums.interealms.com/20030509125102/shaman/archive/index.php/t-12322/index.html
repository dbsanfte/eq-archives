<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am 55 and about to get my 4th aa. I am not in a ubah guild that does ToV or halls or any of the flag PoP zones. I am pretty much soloing every time I'm on. I only get to play maybe 2 hours a day 3 days a week....so time limits me from getting into guild raids cause the time I play is when most sleep. <br />
<br />
<br />
I was just wondering what would benifit me more....wis or hp(sta)....I know most go for innate run but I can not see myself doing anything that would not allow me to sow myself...like a dungeon zone. <br />
<br />
<br />
So if anyone has any suggestions or knows what i ma talking about it would be nice. I can get 1 aa point every 5 hours soloing. So I get 1 maybe 2 a week so far. As I said time is my enemy.<br />
<br />
Oops almost forgot...my first 3 aa's are spent in regen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Run 3. Seriously. If you ever do happen to be in a dungeon, whether just farming plat or aftually guilded / grouped in there, it'll be great. Also good for CR's when you don't have your furry boots.<br />
<br />
I think you'll get around 50 HP from maxing out your AA stamina. In other words, it's better to just wait for Natural Durability. Might also want to look into improved metabolism, if you're like me and too lazy to bother buying food and water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I spent my first 3 points in run 3 while I was milking seafuries for cash. Then decided I wanted the Baron title at 55 and spent those 3 on regen. There are several great exp spots that are in indoor zones that you may want to use, and run 3 will save your butt.<br />
<br />
Small thread hijack: While we do get more HP from raising our stamina, I've noticed it's barely half the amount of HP added that my Warrior one level lower than my Shaman gets. Warrior gets just over 250 from Riotous health, and Shaman gets about 135, so while stamina is always good to buff, the small addition you get with spending an Aa point on it really doesn't seem worth all the effort inmy opinion.<br />
<br />
Good hunting</div></div><hr />

Run Speed is pretty much the way to go.  I spent my first 3 in regen and am putting the next ones in run speed.  It's too useful not to spend them there.  After that you'll probably want metabolism or wisdom (if you're a troll like me), if you still want to increase the general skills.  More than likely, you'll start spending/saving for the archetype skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go run 3, then move on to get canni V.. you don't want to spend more than 6 points in general until at least canni v.. and run 3 is a must because you eventually you will want to start doing a lot of dungeons and won't want to put points into general.. you'll see that you need 3 pts for something, you save up 2 and you look at your innate run.. and go grr I wish I had put it in that earlier.. just a thought tho.. I think an aa is too good to spend on consuming less food.. =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I will put the rest of my aa in innate run then....thanks for all your replies everyone. Just need to some how find time for a guild. I would love to do raids and get keys. I don't even have Seb key yet! <br />

<br />
thanks all<br />
