<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Badz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can a group made up of 55 shaman, 55 warrior, 56 ranger and 52 druid be able to hunt in the Kael area?<br />
<br />
I was thinking that we would start in the bank area and move from there.  We are hoping to get some armor quest drops and improve COV faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You should be able to hunt in the bank area.  I don't think I'd try the arena if i was you though ;-)<br />
<br />
I don't know how mana intensive the healing would be without a complete heal for the warrior. It probably depends on how good his gear is (ie how well he's mitigating damage).<br />
<br />
The guys that drop thurg chain by the bank area are red at 45.  I'm not sure what actual level they are though.  I could land poison based nukes and dots on them though :-)</div></div><hr />
