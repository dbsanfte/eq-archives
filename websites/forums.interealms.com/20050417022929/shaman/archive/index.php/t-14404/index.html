<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mrcatfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">okay, I've read the posts on the different places to get xp...<br />
I'm currently doing the giant fort in Burning Woods...currently,<br />
I get ~one AA per week at 2 hours of play time per night<br />
<br />
is that good for xp?  I mean some people are saying 1 blue bubble<br />
per 2 hours is good...yikes...I get about 1-2 yellow bubble per 2<br />
hours (depending on the pops...wish i could get Ancients all the time :rolleyes:)<br />
<br />
at this rate, I figure I'd still be doing Burning Woods a year from<br />
now at 54, since I plan on farming all the AA I can from there...that's<br />
no very comforting... :( <br />
<br />
Would joining a raid guild change things? I haven't grouped much...and<br />
the times that I did group, the groups sucked...<br />
<br />
I'm seriously thinking about focusing on other things at this point...like<br />
getting a life  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the 1 blue per hour bit is for normal exp, not AA.<br />
try highkeep or katta. <br />
if you dont mind grouping, go to poj, pon , pod , poi(you will have to group here)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to Dulak and camp at the edge of the Dandolak Dock. it's a nice safe spot no mobs wander there that will agro you. Pull Oceancrashers on the pier and Shadys from the Warehouse and the Gnome Arcitiect. You should be able to make 1% normal exp every 2-3 kills which are pretty  fast kills. faster if you got a jbb or epic. Oceancrashers drop BD's, Diamonds, Rust encrusted bracers, and other gems. The Gnome drops BD's, Diamonds and other gems. Shadys drops the Medals for brotherhood charm and assorted gems. I usually seem to make about 600-800pp an hour to hour and a half at this spot. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask</div></div><hr />
