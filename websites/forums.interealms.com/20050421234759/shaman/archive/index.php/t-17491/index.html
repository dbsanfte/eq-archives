<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been huntin the hounds in WW for the 8th shawl quest.  Normally I just avoid the Ice Burrowers but some days they are so thick I acn't efficiently hunt the hounds.   Has any shaman come up with a workable solo tactic against these?  <br />

I'd say your best bet is to find a Druid working on their shawl and work together - they can track, you can help them kill; they snare, you DoT the hell out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They're not too bad, although they do have high resists.  I basically treat them like any WW dragon, except that I'll throw in a cripple on them, whereas I don't bother crippling dragons.  And that's one nasty sig :D</div></div><hr />
