<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's assuming you can even ever find any of these pieces for sale.  I have searched for so many months and finally gave up.  I know of no Iksar smiths with high enough skill on my server to even attempt these pieces.  Good luck to you  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know people who can make it.. just wondering if it's worth it to spend the money on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Been asking around my server for a while, dont think there is a grandmaster Iksar smith.  The bracer, belt, and I think the mask/shoulders had decent stats also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm probably going to try for an ODS so skipping out on the shoulders.  For the price the legs/bracer/belt.. just wondering if they are worth the price or if there are equally good droppable pieces that people will sell for cheaper..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depends on the price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd wear belt and maybe bracer if the price was right (im a terrible skinflint).<br />
<br />
A better buyable belt would be Mith Girdle - very expensive! <br />
Similar bracer - Barbed Rubicite - affordable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The new PoP chain while even harder to get looks much better than this stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm on old models (nice horsie ;)) so looks don't matter to much.. except for the helm.. I want the skelly look dammit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've made a few of these pieces for myself.  The bracers are nice resist gear, having ac, hp and mana along with the resists, and some of the other pieces are nice hp/mana gear if nothing else.  I don't know that I would pay more than cost of materials for them myself since there are other as good or better items out there in the market.  Unfortunately, that means you're not likely to find a smith willing to spend time making them (they are a pain in the tail to make - lots of sub-combines, which fail more than they should.) <br />
<br />
To get an idea of the costs of materials involved, each of the items takes 1 to 3 Blue Diamonds per attempt (prices vary per server).  The blue diamonds have to be powdered, and this combine fails more than it should based on the trivial level of the combine, so extra blue diamonds are involved to cover those.  There are a couple of other sub-combines to make the parts, which can fail, but are more annoying than expensive.  Also, each attempt requires one Scale Temper, which needs Iksar Blood to make - this stuff only seems to drop from the Iksar Necros in Sebilis, and not terribly commonly at that.  Generally, you will find more Blue Diamonds for sale in the Bazaar than Iksar Blood.  Finally, at 250 smithing skill, the success rate is roughly 50%, so double the costs of materials to get the final total. <br />
<br />
The visible pieces are mustard-yellow chain, as well, so no bonus value for style.  If I had the money to burn on all the blue diamonds involved, however, I'd be tempted to make a full visible suit just to see how many people I could inspire to claw their eyes out  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd have to vote No.  There is not a single piece in the set that I could not find a better alternative, and usually for less or better money.</div></div><hr />
