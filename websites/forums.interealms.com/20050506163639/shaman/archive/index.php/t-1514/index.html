<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I never did the shawl quests, but some guildies of mine have.<br />
This is what happened when one of them tried to do the quest.   Maybe this is old news, but I thought it was worthy of mentioning.<br />
<br />
Here is the account of Valaen a cleric in my guild.<br />
<br />
I hand my 7th Shawl to Loremaster Borannin. <br />
<br />
[Wed May 08 12:31:22 2002] Loremaster Borannin says 'Incredible! Never before has an outlander been skilled and determined enough to craft our sacred rune. You are now worthy of the Dain’s most perilous task. You should seek an audience with the Dain immediately. Show him your Runed Prayer Shawl; he will give you the task that has been prepared for you. If the Dain is away show your Shawl to Chamberlain Krystorf and he will call for him.'<br />
<br />
[Wed May 08 12:32:17 2002] You have entered Icewell Keep.<br />
<br />
I hand my 7th Shawl to the Dain, who is up. <br />
<br />
[Wed May 08 12:32:59 2002] Dain Frostreaver IV seems to stare right into your soul with his one good eye. A chill runs down your spine.<br />
[Wed May 08 12:32:59 2002] Chamberlain Krystorf says 'I'm afraid you have yet to prove yerself worthy of speaking with the Dain, Coldain. I suggest you talk with our warriors in the Easternwastes, particularly Garadain Glacierbane.'<br />
<br />
I begin to twitch. I check my inventory. I have no 7th shawl or any quest materials. <br />
<br />
[Wed May 08 12:33:08 2002] Dain Frostreaver IV looks your way apprehensively -- what would you like your tombstone to say?<br />
<br />

-------------------------------------<br />
A conversation with a guide follows but there are no answers to be had, other than it appears to be a faction problem and that he needs to talk to the server GM.<br />
<br />
Even though it says to hand your shawl to the Dain, if you aren't ally faction - don't try it, or at least wait and see.<br />

<br />
That thread  has info that suggests that the problem is the Dain isnt really up - that it's a one use Dain that can only accept one hand in and eats all subsequent hand ins...<br />
<br />
No word on whether or not his shawl will be restored by the GM.   <br />
