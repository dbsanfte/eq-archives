<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to set up a DKP system for my Lineage2 clan.  This will be a tradeskill type DKP system.  Where if you put in raw materials, and you gain points by doing that.  Then after that you can use points to buy a crafted item made from the raw materials.  I know it is nothing like Everquest in terms of way of getting in items but i was looking for a template to do this.  Google didn't show anything i could use, thnx in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My guild uses a betting system in EQ. Everyone's merits are public, bidding on items takes place in guildchat. Most simple system for Time Investment in -&gt; Loot Out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've always done bidding.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We use DKP system with fixed prices and ppl interested in an item /random their max DKP,  highest roll wins. Since we have hardcore &amp; casual raiders that allows everyone to get a chance of an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

Most guilds I have seen have as part of their DKP policy and bid fixing has a penalty ranging from loosing all the points earned on the current raid times 2 or 3 to having your DKP account zeroed. Rigging bids can be spotted if you watch for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree, Benadan... we have a bidding system and rules against bid-rigging.  Seems to have worked pretty well so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Saffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Our system is quite simple.  Each raid you attend you get a certain amount of points.  When loot drops, the person who asks for it with the most points gets it.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure anyone who was caught bid fixing in my guild would get the immidiate boot. <br />
<br />
There is a big difference between the systems though. The &quot;Loot has a price, whoever wants that has the most current points wins&quot; method works on the trickle down economics theory, where eventually you will get enough of an item that the less active members will be able to get one too. Bidding basically allows for anyone to get any item at any time. The drawback here is that the guy who plays twice a month can come in, score something large, then not play much anymore, thereby de-valueing the drop for the guild overall. Personally, I do not think one is better than the other. In both cases, a person is being rewarded for participating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes, a guy who doesn't play much can come in and score a nice item... but it will blow all the points he has earned for a long time previously, and those points will be a long time recovering.  The active raiders will recover their points quicker and percentagewise will still get the majority of the good equipment, as they should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">DKP is usually the fairest way to go. Eliminates the biase that too many people show. They can claim to trying to benefit the guild and that, but other folks who have put in the time and effort deserve a fair chance at things.<br />
<br />
Set amounts for the items, is my favorite method, but after that, is when it gets scary. If it's random, people with luck like mine are pretty hosed. Not sure how it would be best. Maybe tracking who had gone the longest without a item, among all the people interested? But finding a fast way to do that would be a serious pain.<br />
<br />
/shrug There's no one great way, there's just those that are less headache for the people incharge of it vs the people that have to work within it's rules vs those that can suckle up the best.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Houndhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Our guild uses a bidding system as well. The thought we had was a person will pay what it is worth to them. There was some dissention from the fans of the fixed price crowd, but all in all it's worked well. frequent raiders get the best gear first but on subsequent raids the more casual people have ample opportunity to get stuff too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zazra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmmm just wondering.  For guilds that use a strict Dkp system how do you deal with loots that &quot;probably should go to a specific class/person&quot;.  Prime example would be a Blade of War.  If this is your guild's first RZ kill, would a Ranger with most Dkp points be able to take the blade?  <br />
Other loots come to mind as well, with bard instrument and rogue backstab mods.  <br />
<br />
Just wondering what other guilds do =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">We have a limited merit system for specific items. For example, Warriors only get EB weapons. The warrior with the highest &quot;qualifications&quot; (combination of AA, current gear, raid attendance, etc) gets the BoW for a set price. We also did this with the Invis mask from VT, but in a different way. Only Clerics and Paladins were allowed to bid on it, since they are the only class listed without the ability to self-invis. Even after the item was replaced for a Cleric or Paladin, it would always have HUGE value for the click alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">When I was in a hardcore raiding guild, the GL/RL put together a list (not public) detailing in what order the Warriors would be awarded the high-agro weapons, if present when they dropped. We also had minimum prices for stuff like Ornate Drops. Everything else was just plain open bidding. <br />
<br />
I let two ornate chain tunic patterns go to Rogues for 950 and 900 dkp, then next time one dropped I got it for 300. As the only Shaman present in NToV one time, I got the Shield of Wurms for 10 dkp; next raid, others bid it up to like 600. /shrug I liked it fine.<br />
<br />
Current guild uses open bidding alone, so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My guild uses a total loss system. For every raid you get a point. If clearing takes an hour or more you get a point for that. When an item drops you need to have 6 points or more to bid  major upgrade on it. Bids are taken in private and the one with the highest points win. They then loose all their points. Some items are limited to who can bid, bard mod items, backstab items, EB items, things like that. Once all the proper classes have those items then they are open to all the other classes. With the exception in time where everything is open to anyone who could use it. We also have our system set up where folks can take a minor upgrade on an item and only spend 5 points. So if no one claims major the item drops down to minor. Here is a chance for folks with no points to put it for it if it is a major upgrade. Its also a choice for those who only go up maybe 10 hitpoints or so to claim minor. When telling the loot master your name for minor you link the item your replacing. If its a major upgrade and you have points your informed to either take it major or drop out. Its then randomed to those who put in minor and they loose 5 points. If they dont have any points they loose nothing. <br />
<br />
Its a fair system and we haven't had any problems with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">EDIT: Doh, Asthore is in my guild.  What she said...lol...<br />
<br />
Our guild uses a Full loss DKP system, which is like most other DKP systems in that each boss mob/raid event is worth a set # of points.  Loot is then given to the person with the highest # of accumulated points.  Once loot is won, your points go back to zero.  There is no bidding.  There is no points decay.  This ensures even the casuals eventually receive good items while still maintaining that the people that raid the most get the best/most gear...<br />
<br />
Another benefit to this method is less items rot than with traditional DKP systems, tho I cannot remember why at this particular moment (not enough coffee yet...lol...).<br />
<br />
We also try to limit certain specific items to classes that can benefit from them the most, IE EB items go to warriors first, Fire focus items go to the people that have fire based spells, etc...<br />
<br />
This seems to work pretty well for us and many people coming from other DKP systems think this one is the best ever...<br />

Let the ranger have it. If he wants to blow a pile of DKP for a weapon he does not really want to have, let him. If he does it just to spite the warriors the problem is not him getting the BoW, it is him being in your guild.</div></div><hr />
