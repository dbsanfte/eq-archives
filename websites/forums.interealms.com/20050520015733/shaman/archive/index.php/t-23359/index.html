Best regards Zuuke,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, just spells that have a buff icon. This does include Torpor/Q/Breath of Trushar though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zuuke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice! :)</div></div><hr />

But NOTE!! Quick Buff 3 WILL NOT provide any extra haste for the HoTs, so dont bother with it. Just get QB2 for max AAable buff-haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's *IF* you have some sort of spell haste/beneficial spell haste focus item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zuuke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, so CB5 QB2 and MGB, what is the other most important aas for a shaman?, just got CB5 working on mgb atm what else? that shamans guild cant live without... that willhelp on raids etc, ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">RC3 is a raid shm must have</div></div><hr />

<br />
RC3?, =) dont know all the short turms yet ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Radiant Cure</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Radiant Cure is an ANY shaman must have. Solo? Definitely. Raid? Yup. Group? Certainly. No question, one of the best &quot;bangs for the buck&quot; there is in the way of AA. Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">beyond rc1,  you are not looking at much gain unless you raid content that it's really needed in. I can think of very few. <br />
<br />
If you just barely got canni 5, then you need ND3, SCM3 in either order, then RC1, LR5. From there it's your choice.. obvious ones are raider/grouper to get scrm/scr3/mgb/scs, soloer get crit dot3, lots of dungeons, run5/suspend minion.. but the first few are must haves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">VP 1 (2 and 3 are even better though)<br />
SCR and SCRM (makes your buffs last longer, and with our buffs being so short duration (72 minute average) it helps alot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are lots of threads about the AA path for shaman of all styles of play, from &quot;mostly solo, never raid&quot; to mostly group, raid sometimes&quot; to &quot;mosty raid, rarely solo&quot; styles. <br />
<br />
Some of my favs:<br />
<br />
VP3 - the bomb for both soloing and grouping. At level 3, it will last 5 seconds longer than the refresh time, meaning when it lights up, the mob will break in 5 seconds. Many times you need to de-buff disease for the full time, but Mal Decay is a simple spell to get, casts fast, and is un-resistable. <br />
<br />
LR5 - Very noticable differene in the times I get hit when summoned. Sometimes on &quot;lesser&quot; raids I like to play a game with my group called &quot;Lets see who can get summoned first&quot;. heh. Nothing like having a quadding mob miss 3 of 4 some rounds cause you have LR5<br />
<br />
ND3 - Hitpoints = good, especially with canni 5. You DO NOT want to have Canni 5 put you into &quot;low health aggro&quot; if you can at all help it. Also, naked, with self buffs and ND3, I can canni 5 and not die! THATS a bonus by itself, cause you can have lots of fun freaking people out at your bind point by going to 1% heh. <br />
<br />
SCRM - longer buffs means less memming and re-memming.<br />
<br />
RC3 - nasty thins like Malo, Tash, and most poisons and disease stuff can be cured with this wonderful AA. The trees in Earth, for example, have REALLY brutal snare thing. I have saved TONS of pullers by running out near them and RCing the snare off before the tree catches up and waxes them.<br />
<br />
MGB - as a raider, this is a must. Most raid level guilds require it, as well they should. I really wish we had more than 1 buff to use it on these days though (well 2, since I am playing in areas where we generally MGB ToT as well as Focus). It should be fixed to work on Shrink, with a confirm box like TL, and I wish it worked on Blood of Nadox. We really have nothing &quot;Battle Friendly&quot; to MGB currently, but it looks like OOW is giving us something. I do know that you can almost NEVER have too many druids on a raid vs big AE bosses, because SotW is SO froakin amazing. And the more BLs who can Paragon can REALLY bring back the HPs and Mana when a raid is on the edge. Those 2 MGBs alone can make or break some events. <br />
<br />
I know I forgot a bunch, but these ones are cool. Another cool one, believe it or not, is Innate metabolism 3. Food lasts forever, and since there aer so many cool +stat foods (I use Misty Picnics and Kaladim Constitutionals) it saves you a ton of cash and time, not to mention a couple inventory slots. No need to carry more than 1 stack of each, since it lasts so long. And if you use a mount its EXTREMELY noticable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">scrm is one I considered a must, since I rarely had a use for mgb I got that one first, nothing like 50% extension on quiesence when you solo a ton and its very very nice in groups as well. that and quick buff (also for Quiesence) are quite the shaman aa's for better safer exp in the long run.</div></div><hr />
