I have no idea why yall are having problems i run on a very old computer and the website works fine for me and at my library in town, and it works for most of my guildmates.  It could be the music i play and you don't have windows media player &quot;that came with your computer &quot;<br />
And no teacher,  i can not hack through others computers by them looking at my website or whatever that last comment was.   Idknow the site is cool if you ask me, sorry you can't see it =(,  I just wanted to show my work and maybe you would enjoy it.   Try it on internet explorer if you want i've had alot tell me it works fine for them . Sorry , thanks again. <br />
