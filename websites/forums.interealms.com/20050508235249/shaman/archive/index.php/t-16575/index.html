<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
After last nights fiasco, I lost my first adventure.  Still pissed about it, but when I look back on it, it's amazing the group make up versus some other groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
Won with:<br />
65 shaman<br />
65 cleric<br />
65 cleric<br />
65 druid<br />
64 paladin<br />
65 enchanter<br />
<br />
<br />
Lost with:<br />
65 shaman (me)<br />
64 cleric<br />
65 Warrior<br />
65 rogue<br />
64 rogue<br />
65 magician<br />
<br />
<br />
How we lost with the group there is amazing, but, when the cleric doesn't start heals til 25% and you get a elixir, you know what happens.<br />
<br />
What unlikely groups have you won with?<br />
<br />
Check this group out:<br />
Won with:<br />
65 shaman<br />
65 ranger<br />
65 cleric<br />
65 enchanter<br />
64 rogue<br />
<br />
yep only 5, the 65 tank couldn't enter the zone.  Ranger tanked and we still won.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Assassinate mission, cleric went linkdead on zoning in, and we won (though only 10 minutes to spare) with:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Bard<br />
Warrior<br />
Ranger<br />
Wizard<br />
<br />
I haven't lost yet, but the closest I've come to it has been:<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
Druid<br />
Shaman<br />
Enchanter<br />
Cleric<br />
Magician<br />
<br />
Not enough DPS. No idea why they invited me to the group since they already had two healers and an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Fastest group was:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
Druid<br />
Shadow Knight<br />
Bard<br />
Magician<br />
Ranger<br />
<br />
A lot of it just has to do with the quality of the players.<br />
<br />
I'm still waiting for six beastlords to get together and rip through a &quot;kill X mobs&quot; mission in 15-20 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Bard had to repatch for 25min and Ranger went LD for 10 min on a Collection mission. We had to bust ass to catchup but still managed with 15 min left to go :)</div></div><hr />

61 shaman<br />

<br />
Lost with the first group 1 due to missing getting the last mob killed (which had the last part we needed) by 20 seconds :(  Would have had it if the warrior/shaman/chanter/cleric crew hadn't of had a mass LD at their house.<br />
<br />
BTW in every adventure I've been on, we have had the bard pull, I pull the mob off with slow, warrior takes mob from me, bard pulls second as soon as I slow the first, I pull second off with slow and tank it while he stabs it in the back... as soon as the warrior kills the first one, bard pulls again.  We set up mini camps throughout the crawl.  We usually end up finishing at least 30 minutes ahead of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Last night we had...<br />

58 Necro<br />
<br />
MT's were the Mage pet and Scooby. I had to re-summon my pooch about 3 or 4 times especially on multiple pulls where he couldn't stay alive long enough till the adds were mezzed.<br />
<br />
The group was amazing. Mind you the level 59 and 58 brought down the difficulty. Once we got the hang of it we weren't having any problems. Did a rescue mission and finished it off with about 30 mins to spare.<br />
<br />
I pulled with maloed, slowed all adds and broke them with VS. Tanked till I could root them and tanked any non-rootable mobs if the pets couldn't snag aggro. It also helped a lot that we were in Takish where the mobs are summoned. Mage and Druid were having a field day. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
65 Sham, Cle, Ran, Enc, War, Wiz<br />

All in ssra level gear. Finish most in 60-90 Minutes. Not suprisingly, that one loss was in the only group I didn't put together. Guildie invites me to a group thats mostly non guildies. I will not do anymore LDoN groups with pickup people. Learned that lesson in Beta and seen enough horror stories since luanch to reaffirm that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Well I have about 54 wins already and really only 2 losses (a few more on the initial day where folks couldn't get in the zones I won't count, lol).<br />
<br />
All sorts of groups have been good.  Traditonal with a cleric and a tank are so easy I want to puke but everyone is too chicken to do hard ones.  Fastest I have to admit was me (shaman) 3 mages, beastlord, necro - pet power, lol.<br />
<br />
Real loss#1 we only had 5 to start with because someone bugged out early and then our tank went LD and never came back.  That left us with our beastlord tanking, me (shaman), mage, and enchanter.  It was a boss kill and we were doing fine until final mob when the beastlord (and I still don't get this) got stuck underworld and was a no show for the rest of the fight.  Ok, I jump in and boss mob is at about 50% and I have Q on and I am healing myself like crazy so I'm in no real danger.  Ok, our mage overnukes and gets wasted so its me and the chanter.  The chanter is nuking like crazy and keeping the extras mezed and im still tanking (but no dps, just trying to stay alive since im getting summoned when i try to root and do some damage.  Ok, chanter runs out of mana and I'm still tanking - if you want to call it that since I'm not puting out any damage to speak of.  Mob is at 9% and there is not a darn thing I can do - I know I'm toast but the mob can't kill me (lol) and every time I try to root and mem gate I get summoned back.  So we play that game for a few more minutes the timer runs out and I finally give up, put my arms in the air and say kill me.<br />
<br />
Real loss #2 - Frickin collect mission.  We ruled and couldn't find enough.  Last collect for me.<br />

was very fast, i hardly had to heal at all heh, so i went full offensive.  we added a sk for the next 2 we did and made even quicker work of it.  I think we spent longer waiting for the adventure merchant to let us have a new mission then we did in the dungeons :)</div></div><hr />

Yep thats it only 3 and was a collection we won with 2 minutes left on timer.<br />
Warrior and cleric we had couldnt zone in.  Warrior logged out and never came back.  Cleric stayed at entrance so technically we had 4 in group but only 3 in zone.  Was chaotic to say the least.  Last few mobs had like no mana left burned the dog swarm and was hoping so much for 2 more pieces to drop.  We were amazed that they actually did.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">When I first started doing adventures I was leary who I grouped with. I demanded at least a second AA title.<br />
<br />
As time went on, my demands went lower.. now I just dont care.. as long as I have SOME DPS in the group I'm fine. <br />
<br />
If our puller is waiting for the mob to be dead before pulling again.. I start pulling. A shaman can pull very well here with some practice<br />
<br />
Necro's mages, wizards can put out some serious damage... everything else is just filler</div></div><hr />

Last night our cleric went LD within the first 10 minutes of a collection in Tak, I ended up dying due to having virtue dispelled and doing canni5 right as bardmez broke, and we still won with 2 minutes to spare (whew).<br />
It was:<br />
Shaman<br />
SK<br />
Monk<br />
Bard<br />
Wizard<br />
<br />
Today a cleric went LD before we had even begun a slaughter and won with:<br />
Shaman<br />
Paladin<br />
Druid<br />
Necro<br />
Rogue<br />
<br />
Then on the next adventure the rogue went LD on an assassinate about half way through, and we won with:<br />
Shaman<br />
Warrior<br />
Necro<br />
Beast<br />
Cleric<br />
<br />
So far I am 27-1 with groups that I have formed and 1-3 with pick up groups. Working hard to hit 1150 in Everfrost :)<br />
<br />
Real loss #2 - Frickin collect mission. We ruled and couldn't find enough. Last collect for me.<br />
We lost one of those because we too, could not find any other mobs and we were short by one!  I don't mind these though if it's with a guild group, but if it is a pick up, or one I form of random friends and new people, we generally do slaughter (super easy) or assassination.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Khrent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hehe best group we I have had so far is kind of a non-traditional one.  Consists of:<br />

Wizard (62)<br />
Cleric (65)<br />

First it started out that the warrior was pulling and he would only get singles and the other warrior didn't want to pull.  I had pulled here before and knew I could again so I went out and pulled.  Usually got 3-4 mobs each pull.  Easy way to pull is to tag one with slow run through the camp so the other 2-3 agro on the warrior then pull each one of them off with slow so you know which are and aren't.  We didn't have less than 3 mobs in camp at a time and cleric/druid didn't drop below 50m.  Everyone in the group was saying how much fun they were having with so many mobs to kill.  Ended up with 20 minutes left because the drops started to get bad at the end but we cleared most of the zone but stopped after we finished the quest because no named were up.  Usually when we had three in camp both warriors would get on one and the cleric would help out one of the warriors or if one was a cleric he would OT that one with stuns.  Worked very well!  Seems the non-traditional groups kind of thrive in this enviroment.  No real need for a chanter beyond c3 since usually there is no more than 4 mobs per pull which can be rooted if you get in trouble, unless a mob gates then you'll have to succor and run back which did happen to us once.  Also shaman with c3 can heal well in these zones.  Many times without cann5 and most of the time without c3(don't bother getting it) I have healed with Tnargs Mending/Kraggs Mending and done fine.<br />

Quite interesting. IMHO Enchanters are the Kings of Ldon dungeons. Lets say &quot;well-played Enchanters from players who have a clue&quot;. Looks like you so far met only the clueless species.<br />
<br />
Yesterday i had was in Deeper Guk with an Enchantress who was on top of her game. (Group was Shm, Enc, Pal, Rng, Dru, Mag)<br />
She not only controlled the mobs, she also totally controlled the group and also a charmed mob. The rest of the group were servants for the tactic she provided. While we killed a mob she already went ahead, pacified rooms and mezzed the next target. In the moment our mob was dead, her charmed mob went immediately to the new target. We only had to follow that pet. After 55 minutes we were done with the mission...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Back to the topic:<br />
My best group was: Enc, Sk, Rng, Shm (me). Only four, all seasoned L 65 players and used to group with each other. We were not able to find a suitable healer so we decided to give it a try. After intense 65 minutes in Ruj we had finished out kill mission.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The rest of group was bard, nec, pal, sk and we finished the slaughter mission in 51 minutes with 4ppl, pulled usually 3 at once, sometimes 4. Also did a group of 5 with nec x2/mnk/pal/brd/dru and finished in around 25 minutes.</div></div><hr />
