Malo for sale by soandso..53k!<br />
Malos for sale by someone else....30k!<br />
<br />
is this the norm now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tahlan Trouble'Maker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malo is a much rarer spell still.  Any rune turned in for lvl 65 shaman spell has a 1 in 5 chance of being Malos.  You will see that Malo sells for alot higher on most servers.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">not on the seventh hammer at least<br />
<br />
malo 40k<br />
malos 80k or so<br />
<br />
if malos is that much cheaper, just get to 65 and get it, it is a much better spell imo (lowers resists about 20% more than malo)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Owwiefixer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Depending on the encounters you get involved in, having both Malo and Malos may be critical.<br />
<br />
In situations where you are the only slower and there are multiple adds of hard to slow mobs, having both loaded is pretty routine.  Due to the extremely long recast time on Malos (10 seconds!), having both memmed can be handy when trying to slow a whole bunch of mobs.  With any form of spell haste, you can have the first mob malos+turgurs, then be standing around for what seems like an eternity waiting for Malos to refresh.  If you have them both (and memmed), a quick Malo + turg can help chain slows for those rough situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Still doesnt change the fact that Malo is still very expensive and hard to find.  Whereas Malos, the same spell only 5 levels higher, is almost freaking common now.  Kind of makes the whole &quot;should I level to 65?&quot; debate pointless ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually I have been wondering lately if I was going to worry about getting malos. Got malo at 60, love it &amp; thought I would just follow up a malo with malosinia when I get it for those longer &amp; tougher mobs.<br />
<br />
Never thought of having malo &amp; malos both loaded for chain debuffing. Malos still isn't at the top of my list of needed spells but certainly considering it more seriously now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Malos was changed to 5 sec cast (same as malo) a long time ago ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well.....<br />
on the 7th Hammer, you dont have that choice.  You get Malo and Torpor and your probably gonna have them for a long time.  All 65 spells  are NEVER in the bazaar.  I take that back, Fo7th = 195k down from 225k 3 days before.  Same with the other spells.  If you have the ability to buy for under that, I envy you.<br />
<br />
Runes =  HA!  yea right.    On the 7th noone is even in Time yet.   The easiet place for runes to be won is BoT  tower minis.     With guilds out there like [insert your typical zerg guild here]   and others who strive to KS  its almost impossible.<br />
Every time Im camping a named, I HAVE TO, repeat HAVE TO,   acumen myself and gaurd any possible way in.   They WILL  rush the room invis and KS.  It is the most disgusting display of character I know.  Basically I know it will be quite awhile till I can receive my 65 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Owwiefixer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Never actually sat with a stopwatch and timed it, but Malos- after casting this, then landing a turgurs.. you sit there and wait, and wait, and wait- nearly an eternity while Mob 2,3 and 4 are still beating on you and your healers.<br />
<br />
As per Lucy's, CastersRealm and everwhere else, it does list the recast time as 10 seconds:<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3395&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
And this feels just about right for how long after landing + slow the spell gem is locked/inactive.  Having Malo then loaded for fast chain is critical.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping drop rates for Malo components will improve from the addition of that new Kunark zone (Veskar).  The loot tables for existing zones just simply do not drop the components to help relieve Malo spell economy and the normal spell drop rate is as rare as it's always been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Malo and Malos are the same cast and recast times - 5 seconds cast, 10 seconds recast.<br />
<br />
I can see why people would sometimes mem both - it's a tactic I hadn't thought of, but will bear in mind if I ever reach 65 and get Malos. :)</div></div><hr />

Malo goes for about 50k while malos is being sold around 20k.........   65 spells are just more common.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">On the rathe here are the prices I have seen<br />

Malos 120k(only seen this once)<br />
Malo 40-50k(a few times)<br />
Quiescense 75k-100k<br />
Ferine Avatar 65k-100k<br />
Blood of Saryn 80k-100k<br />
Fo7 75k-100k<br />
<br />
Also I've only rolled on a rune once and I have killed the bot named(gantru, oreen, laef etc) at least 20 times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Gald Im not on some of those servers<br />

on Prexus<br />
malos 20k, blood 20k, q 40k, focus 30k, fa 25k<br />
malo 20-30k, torpor 20-40k<br />
<br />
more money than I had ever spent before on something, but was able to purchase q, focus and fa and won a rune that turned in for blood.  malos never on top of my list since I already had malo.  and they were up for sale for long periods of time (most dropped dramatically as well after the first couple weeks from around 80k).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">On Fennin<br />
Malo.. 30kish <br />
Malos 15kish <br />
(seen 2 copies sit for sale at 15k for the last week now and no one is buying)<br />
<br />
I recently got the idea to mem both malo AND malos on raids when we were pulling multiples and it works out quite well. Waiting for malos to refresh so I could get the 3 other mobs was driving me crazy. Now with malo/malos both memmed its a piece of cake.. cast malos, cast malo, cast malos..no waiting for refresh, works well.</div></div><hr />

No one can relate to our misery I guess.   <br />
<br />
The only people I can imagine to have it worse is the rush-to-65 players on Stromm.......now those guys got it bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion if you are the only slower for some adds of hard to slow mobs, your turgurs is going to be unlit while malos is up because you will cast malos, followed by turgurs (resist lets say) then malos is back up and you're waiting for turgurs.. in cases like this I'd say a bard and chanter should be debuffing + mages if they expect you to slow a few HARD to slow mobs... then again I don't have much experience slowing prepop. get Malosinia because mages are usually very late on their debuffs =] and forget malos imo until you get some of the better level 65 spells (if you have malo) like Fo7 for mgbing and Quiescence for just being a god =]</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well malo still lets you get to 65 a LOT easier than w/o it. and AA flows a lot faster at 60 than 65, so malo would be a tremendous help. Of course you can only stay 60 if you are not going to be slowing at raids or if you are the highest shaman..</div></div><hr />

OMG that sucks for you I can't imagine being on a server like that. It also means that if you can get into a nice guild you will be UBER in no time.. you probably get all the elementals to youself? not too bad if you can commit a bit of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">On the 7th noone is even in Time yet.<br />
<br />
This is hardly shocking. There are what, 5 or 6 guilds across all servers in Time?<br />
<br />
The easiet place for runes to be won is BoT tower minis.<br />
<br />
Speaking on a server basis, the easiest place for runes are the elemental planes. Now that there are (well, were, one of them disbanded recently) 3 guilds in elementals on Luclin, rune spells have started showing up in the bazaar for human prices.<br />
<br />
Best example I found thus far;<br />
Spell: Avatar - 40000p<br />
Spell: Ferine Avatar - 35000p<br />
<br />
The bazaar is wierd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">and AA flows a lot faster at 60 than 65, .  <br />
<br />
I fail to see how anyone can make this claim.  it's harder to get into a group at 60.  It's harder to slow mobs.  You get more resists, not as many hp, not as much mana, 60 is all around inferior to being 65.  Last saturday morning I got 2.5 AA in 3 hours in a pickup BoT group.  Sure if you were 60 in the same group, you might have gotten 3 aa in that same time, but you would have had a lot more trouble killing mobs that fast (I didn't bother to malos a lot, just took resists as they came, I was chain pulling too fast).  Not to mention at 60, you'd actually have to do the bot flag now (not that it's hard), and probably sit around for quite a while to get in a group that good.  If I want a group, I've got one within 20 minutes, tops.  Usually more like 2-3.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are what, 5 or 6 guilds across all servers in Time?<br />
I'd say at least a dozen, maybe 15 or 16.<br />
<br />
Now that there are ... 3 guilds in elementals on Luclin<br />
<br />
Heh that'd be nice for the uberguilds on the Nameless.  We had 5 guilds in elementals 4 months ago, and then 2 of them both fully /movelogged when Maelin opened.  Since then we're back up to 4 guilds in elementals.  Nice side though, level 65 spells are plentiful and not too expensive.  Q prolly still goes for 75-100 because it's awesome, but all the rest are under 50, and have been for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I never paid more for a spell than 8k so I dont even look at how messed up prices are on 60 and 65 spells.<br />
<br />
To get most of the rarest 50-60 spells I use research, check the bazaar everyday and get components. Malo components costed me about 3k (though a guildie got me a copy from his research, in return I gave him my components) than I got Levitation and Everlasting through research.<br />
<br />
As for 65 spells, ive lost more rolls on Runes in past 2 months than I ever seen Avatar, Malo and Torpor drop  :mad:</div></div><hr />
