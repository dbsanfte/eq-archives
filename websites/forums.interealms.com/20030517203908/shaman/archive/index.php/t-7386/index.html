<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know after the whole pal cavs cycle im wondering where to go next. I heard from other shammy buddies that echo caverns are good if i solo the Needlites. Just looking for some other input to where i can go at 25. I would prefer solo because i have little time to get into a group :( . <br />
<br />
Many thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 24 I was sick of Paludal, so I headed over to Echo.  There, I solo'd the Needlites and bogling scouts that are on the way to the Needlite room.  <br />
<br />
The Boglings are fairly standard, just like any mob.  Often times they will drop a LORE weapon that vendor sells for 4pp.  Nice cash for mid twenties.  Problem is they're lore.  There's 3 different types of weapons, so if you get a set of all 3 its best to run back to SH and sell.<br />
<br />
The Needlites are a different story.  They hit crazy fast.  Best strategy is to root and nuke/DoT.  When root breaks, pray that you can channel another root.  These guys are great exp, each kill giving me 3% exp.  They will often drop needlite parts which sell for 2pp, also nice cash.  You can single pull the first 5 needlites, but the last 2 will always be a pair pull (for me at least.)<br />
<br />
After a while the Needlite queen will pop.  I find her easier than the regular needlites, even though I think she's level 27.  She hits a bit harder, but much slower.  Just root and nuke her down.  She'll drop either a nice caster back piece or a so so piercer each time.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just dinged 27, and I'm getting bored with this zone, so I'm not sure what to do.  I might stay for one more level just for the cash, or I might move onto the caves in WW.  Who knows!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to the Brutes in Warslisk Woods. In the cave in the NW corner of the zone. Five spawns, all of them are non social and should be high blue to yellow to you. As long as you're the only one there, easy exp. Especially easy to get to if you have PoP. Take the port to the Overthere (SoW up and watch for the Cliff Golem) and jaunt over to WW.<br />
<br />
Ramma, you should head to Dawnshroud peaks, just outside the Sanctus Seru zone. Oddles of Lightcrawlers that are high blue to even. The trick (and why most people avoid them) is that they can blind you. I've had a couple of close calls, but I made 3/4 of my lvl 28 here in about and hour and a half. Each kill gives about 3/4 of a blue bubble. Don't let the blindness scare you. You just have to get good and blind rooting ;). Oh, and make your pulls to the wall.<br />
<br />
[edit] There is pretty much zero loot off the lightcrawlers. So if you're cash-light, maybe not an option</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nustrimus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Once you zone into overthere using pop, whats the safest way to get to ww?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First, print out a map from EQAtlas (http://www.eqatlas.com) if you aren't familiar with the zone. Chart a course ESE from the PoP book portal, and head right there while SoW'ed up. Keep an eye out for things the might aggro on you, but for the most part the wandering spawns are very spread out.<br />
<br />
Also worth noting, don't go looking for the Cliff Golem that guards the evil area if you aren't an evil race (Iksar are KoS to it as well I believe). The thing will kick your ass before you can say &quot;mama&quot; and it often nestles close the the wall at the entrance as part of it's patrol. So if you're moving that way, it can aggro on you before you see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pzakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When in Echo you should not need to zone to sell the lore items. There are vendors in Echo you can sell to. The vendors are on the secret side of Echo through a secret wall. When entering from SH behind the Soulbounder just go straight and make a right. Click on what looks like to be a unmovable wall and it should open just like a door.</div></div><hr />
