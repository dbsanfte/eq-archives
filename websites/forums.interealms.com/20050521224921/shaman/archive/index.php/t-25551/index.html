<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For about the last week, I swear that I have been drinking much faster than I should be.<br />
<br />
I have Innate Metabolism 3 and last night alone I drank 3 of my &quot;Taleosian Black Ginseng Tea&quot; when it used to be rare to drink even one of them.<br />
<br />
Is it just me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I burned through about 5 foraged waters from time (miraculous drinks) in the time that I should have only had 1 or 2. It does seem like drinks are going away much faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does using a mount still affect food/drink usage? That could casue that if so...though I dont know why your food would get used more slowly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I've had a horse for the last 2 years, and I haven't been using the horse any more than usual.<br />
<br />
If anything I've been using the horse less.<br />
<br />
I'm really thinking that maybe Innate Metabolism isn't working or maybe the type of drink isn't being factored in (e.g. a miraculous drink being treated the same as a Pod of Water).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I cannot say that i have personaly noticed any change in my drink consumption . However if a bunch of people post here that there seems to be a change of some kind I will submit that feedback through the channels open to me .<br />
However I will hold off untill there are more people posting with the feeling that a problem indeed exits :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Have you taken into account the zone(s) you are in when you observe this?<br />
<br />
As I understand it, there are zone modifiers to how fast food and/or drink is consumed.  The theory is that &quot;hot&quot; zones require you to consume more drink (a la a Desert environment), while cold zones require more food be consumed (I guess to be converted to body heat for you warm-blooded softskins.)<br />
<br />
Please note: I'm just asking so if/when this gets kicked up to a developer, we can tell them that we have already taken this into account.  Coming from a support background, I know how easy it is for someone who is overworked (or just plain bad at handling support issues) to latch onto a quick answer and say that this is the cause and everything is working &quot;As intended&quot; without actually putting in the effort to make sure that it is indeed the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was sitting in PoK on Monday night, for about an hour, hour and a half.  Someone had given me 20 water flasks after I'd said &quot;Afk, thirsty&quot;, I think that was on Sunday sometime.  They were still in the first open slot, way above my long lasting drink, I think I have the Tea.  Anyways, From Sunday night, to monday night, I evidently drank 12 of those waters, and the only other zone I'd been in was Dranik's  for maybe 30 minutes.  No other hunting, not on my horse.  I logged in last night for about 20 minutes, and by the time I logged out, I'd gone from 8 waters to 4.  That's s quite a bit for even me.  Before that, I think it was Friday, I noticed that my Tea was getting low, and I'd just bought 20 in the Bazaar.  From Wednesday night to Friday night, I drank 6 of my teas.  I think I might have used my horse on Wednesday night, but not Thursday.  But that's still a larger amount than I'm used to.  Usually if I get 20 of the long lasting drinks, even taking in using a horse, 20 Teas last me over a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For some reason I was under the impression that innate metabolism did not affect drink consumption, only food. Most likely just a misunderstanding of mine tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've noticed that my shammy eats and drinks much more than my monk.  Neither have any AAs towards reducing food consumption, and the shaman is rarely on her horse.  I suspect that having dogdog up adds to food consumption.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>scarnage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Lately I've been drinking more drinks than I have been eating food.   By this I mean that if i buy a stack of water and a stack of food, I run out of water first...  I've never really paid attn to how fast I go through these things normally, but they have always ran out at the same time in the past. I DO have innate metab 3, and I do have a mount, but other than the zone climate theory I can't see why I'd run out of water first.<br />
<br />
Anyone think of any other variables? If not, I could just leave my toon logged in while at work for 3 days -- one day in everfrost, one day in nro, and another in nexus  -- record the consumption...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You'd think with use of Canni, food consumption would be innately lowered, neh? ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm... I just had an interesting thought...<br />
<br />
Perhaps the AA skill Innate Metabolism is only supposed to affect food (as some have mentioned in this thread), but up until recently perhaps it was affecting both food and drink?  And maybe it was &quot;fixed&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">From http://interealms.com/shaman/guides/aa-chart.html :<br />
<br />
Innate Metabolism  	<br />
1 point  	<br />
3  (ranks)<br />
<br />
This ability grants a dramatic decrease in the amount of food and drink you consume. You will consume 10% less at rank 1, 25% less at rank 2 and 50% less at rank 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm, nevermind my theory then.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I double checked my aa list shows only food is affected. Is it definetely supposed to work for drink?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well, I've gone through a full stack of Fizzlecutter drink since I started this topic, and that's only 3 nights of raiding (approximately 4 hours each night).<br />
<br />
That seems unusual to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I haven't noticed any increase in drink consumption my self. Aren't there racial benefeits/penalties too? I seem to remember something about Vah Shir having a high metabolism.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Vah Shir consume food and drink faster than other races, in case that has any bearing on this.</div></div><hr />

Gunderson, awesome sig.  Gonna have to track down Arieltha and deliver compliments to the source I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">My miraculous meals and miraculous drinks are being consumed at exactly the same rate. (I do not have Metab AA, I don't use my horse a lot, and I don't spend much time in Oasis/Ro).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I noticed on my shaman (no metabolism AAs), that he 'seems' to be going through a lot more Fizzlecutters and fish rolls then normal.  Have had to fill him back up more often then I am used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm..innate metabo3, and Ive had the same stack of Misty thicket and Kaladim Constitutional for almost 3 weeks now.  Last night was the first night that I didnt log in for a long time though, and I usually get 3-4 hours playtime in a night.</div></div><hr />
