<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dimitri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey, i 2box a 53 sham and 61 monk atm.  Basically best place I findis chardok zone in.  I do bout 11-12spawns or so a cycle, so maybe 33ish an hour?  I get bout a yellow under an hour or around an hour if people bother me and screw with my spawn timing, PLing of course.  <br />
<br />
Was recently reading the forums and heard bout  hhk and katta guards.....think those would be better palces to pl?<br />
<br />
Keeping in mind that I use herald telcha to keep mobs from running which allows me to fd the mob when it is at bout 5% health and jbb it once for xp.<br />
<br />
Side note:<br />
Think I could duo in pog if I got bored?  Thought those pogs fubar things up and make it too hard to duo there?</div></div><hr />
