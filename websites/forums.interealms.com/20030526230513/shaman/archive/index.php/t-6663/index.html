<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What are your guesses as to which spells will be vendor bought and which will be dropped and how rare, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm excited about the new spells and the possibility of getting spells that are bettert than the stupid rare drops from Kunark. But I am also afraid that only the single target buffs, one heal and the pet will be vendor sold and the rest will be just as damn rare and hard to get as Torpor, Malo, Pox, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nah, I'm really hoping they'll mix things up a bit and we'll see Malos and Quiescence on Vendors and our single target stat buffs as ultra-rare mob drops that folks try to sell back to us for 100k each.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahhh, dare to dream :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, don't be surprised to see the &quot;slightly altered&quot; malo and torpor clones to be somewhat common. I say that because they really aren't much more powerful then the current versions. <br />
<br />
I'm betting it's the offensive based spells they make rare, cause let's face it, Shamans are already one of the more powerful defensive classes in the game. Most end game Shamans would love to have more offensive power. And of course, the idea is to keep people playing as long as possible.....<br />
<br />
Just my guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One more note I'll add to this though. They better make spells obtainable by nearly everyone, more in line with Kunark and Velious, rather then Luclin. If they repeat their Luclin mistake of making some spells drop off mobs most of us can't kill, then there will be a problem :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I dont find the luclin spells hard to get because of kills, its because they drop from 1 mob each and rare at that =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman have it easy for luclin spells. Kurnak spells are far worse for us to try and get.<br />
<br />
If you think we have our luclin spells you should check out wizzys. Thier best nuke drops only from the emp, currently the hardest mob killed in game. Nuke behind that drops from like 2 different mobs.<br />
<br />
Shaman's worst luclin spell is the amazing group acumen or Primal essence which both happen to be of the same mob which can be gotten to and killed with a single group. Hardly compairs to the difficulty of getting a spell drop off the emp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">*ahem* Remove Greater Curse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, we do have it easy on Luclin spells. But we also don't get any powerful spells in the Luclin expansion. Talk to some other classes who get worthwhile or powerful spells, (Wizards, Beastlords) and you'll find the problem with drops. Most spells that were viewed as &quot;powerful&quot; are hard to come by in Luclin.<br />
<br />
My fault for not being clear. Was a general knock on specific spells, not a knock on Shaman spells in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If VP was set up as a regular keyed zone that you could gate/TP out of most of us would prolly have all of our RoK drop spells.  Velious shaman spell drops are not even an issue and really should have been the model for all drop spells to come.  Luclin drops are just plain stupid and worse than RoK drops by far.<br />
<br />
At least Malo/Torpor etc. rarely drop off of several mobs in several zones across Kunark and Velious.  RGC is a rare item drop off of a highly contested mob, PE/AoDK drop off of a single, keyed mob, EB is a ridiculously rare drop off of a single mob, and Lev is also a single mob drop.<br />
<br />
I predict PoP will be a copy of the Luclin model where you need to kill a specific mob in a specific zone to have a random chance of getting the spell you want.  The spells you need to solo or do an average group in seb/velks/ssra already are or will be available for purchase.<br />
<br />
PoP, just like Luclin, will have Higher-end guilds getting the rare drop spells and other players will not.  The playing field is not supposed to be equal and if you don't have the backing of a good guild you will NEVER get all of your spells plain and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I get tired of hearing that if your not in some uber guild you WILL NOT GET YOUR SPELLS. <br />
<br />
This is why uber guilds create that &quot;me too&quot; mentality where a band of people busting their collective asses to make a great fun guild that works well with every one get crapped on at the moment somebody feels they can only get from an uber guild. <br />
<br />
And what do they have to offer an uber guild? Nothing really. They become a number of the rank in file that does not effect what said uber guild is doing, nor if / when they leave said uber will that change what said guild was doing. <br />
<br />
<br />
To screw people out of spells they deserve and can better serve a loyal smaller guild with just because they are not in an uber guild is just disgusting and has created a massive imbalance in a game VI is always &quot;trying to keep balanced&quot; NO OTHER GAME punishes its players in such a way. <br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From what i've seen so far, it appears that most spells will be quested for.  NPC's in Plane of Knowledge are hitting to that fact.... plus they don't have any 60+ spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Innatook</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Anyone found the 55 group shrink spell yet? Supposed to be bought in Halas, but can't seem to locate it there.</div></div><hr />

*ahem* Remove Greater Curse? <br />
<br />
Yeah so? Since when is rhag 1 compairable to the emp or the cursed? Worst part about GRC is soo many people can use it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>oneyebarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah nice to have a pet shrink spell at 19 when we don't get pets then lol. did they nerf the regular shrink where it won't work on pets again? didn't think about trying it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Pet Shrink is even a spell!?!  Who came up with that one? :p<br />
<br />
Why not Group Summon Food or Group Assiduos Vision?  Mebe if the pet spell changed the color or my wolf it would be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Although it's been a while since I tried it, but doesn't our normal shrink work on pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kalda_Lanys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes normal shrink works on pets. I had not heard of this spell or really care. <br />
<br />
Hopefully someone will find other spells and share any info. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">It's funny. I often double shrink myself when I'm on my horse, out of respect for my groupmates and to remove the horses head from my view. Then I am only slightly taller than my dog, but my dog is &quot;bigger&quot;.<br />
<br />
I hope tiny companion will bring my dog down to &quot;tiny battlecat&quot; size :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I bought it for the heck of it. It shrinks your pet to about the size of a giant rat. Looks like a chihuahua standing next my ogreness. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a small guild of close friends that worried when higher levels began leaving us for uber guilds in order to get good gear and equipment.  Even the most loyal members began to lament that they would probably never get their epic.  So we joined an alliance. We still have our small close guild, but also have sister guilds with whom we mostly raid.  We have our own guild bylaws and customs, and then when with our alliance we have raiding/pvp guidelines we all adhere to.  Works well for the most part.</div></div><hr />

In the Plane of Knowledge, in the Library are spell vendors for all the classes. If you face west to enter the Library from a bridge, the Shaman vendors are inside on your right on the main floor. There are 5 vendors with the name Mystic, and they sell standard level 1-44 Shaman spells, plus 4 new PoP spells.<br />
<br />
Mystic Abomin (70, 980, 0), otter shaman, sells:<br />
19 Tiny Companion (no drop) -- seems identical to Shrink, except that it's pet only and shrinks 50% vs 34%.<br />
49 Shock of Venom (no drop) -- 460 Poison DD, 230 mana, 3.9 cast time, conj<br />
Compare to 44 Blast of Poison -- 400 Poison DD, 200 mana, 4.5 cast time, conj<br />
Compare to 44 Blizzard Blast -- 430 Cold DD, 200 mana, 5.3 cast time, evoc<br />
54 Blast of Venom (no drop) -- 680 Poison DD, 340 mana, 3.9 cast time, conj<br />
