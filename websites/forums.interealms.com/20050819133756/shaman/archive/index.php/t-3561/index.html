<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Alchemist_CC_2001</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am creating a new Shaman. Race I haven't decided yet but so far I have some equipment:<br />
<br />
Chipped Velium Amulet~ 4 str 30 HP<br />
Cougar Claw Earring x2<br />
Moonstone Ring <br />
Stained Cloth Mask 20hp/20mana<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
Items I am going to possiably buy<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
65mana/HP necklace<br />
30mana/hp ring<br />
Charred Guardian Shield<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
Ok, well I have 3k to spend. That is not including buying the above items. Please suggest what items you would buy. If I make a Barbarian I know about that imbued armor stuff. Thanks for any advice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd trade in the cougar claw earrings for 2ac/35hp/25mana jeweler made ones.  BS electrum I think..<br />
<br />
Clay guardian shield instead of the char guard.<br />
<br />
If I was you, I'd see if I could pick up a rune etched icewurm fang cheap, and just fill in the rest with cheap stuff (banded if you had to).  For low lvls, not much gear will help you as much.  Baring that, I'd get the hp/mana jewelery and then start filling out slots with rygorr/totemic/scaled mystic/seb scale armor as race/pp permit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Alchemist_CC_2001</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok thanks for the advice. Do you know how much the Rune Etched Icewurm Fang is? I play on Prexus so items are usually cheaper then other servers. <br />
<br />
So far I am buying<br />
-----------------------<br />
65mana/HP necklace<br />
Clay Guardian Shield<br />
either x2 65 HP rings or x2 30hp/mana rings <br />
Rygorr or Totemic<br />
Rune Etched Icewurm Fang if I can get one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice. now the big question. What race should I make? Lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I played a barb shaman to 54, got bored, played some alts, then switched to vah shir shaman when luclin came out.  I like cats  =)  If I was starting over, I'd be a troll probably.  It doesn't matter al that much, play what makes you happy.<br />
<br />
The rune etched icewurm fang is about 3-4k on Povar, but then group regrowth was selling for 10k tonight(that's what, 1-2k on other servers?  =P )</div></div><hr />

<br />
(here's a snippet I typed in the 10k thread)<br />
<br />
If you're starting out fresh with 10k, you basically want to decide on one or two nice items and filling out the rest of your spots with something serviceable. First you need to decide on your big items... and while AC, HP, and WIS are all nice, they're not your most important stat. <br />
<br />
Your most important stats are Regeneration and Mana-free damage. Think about it, the more mana you have, the more time it takes you to med it back... you are looking for a way to get your mana back faster- and that's what regen is all about. <br />
<br />
Here are my recommendations: <br />
<br />
1. Get an iksar regen BP. 5 hp/tick = 3000 hp/hour = 1500 mana/hour (if you're a cannibalizing fiend.) <br />
<br />
2. If you spend plan on spending a lot of time outdoors, get a horse. Get the cheapest horse, and turn the models OFF. Turning the models off allows you to cast SoW on yourself without it being overwritten by the horse speed effect (and you don't have to look at a horse-head all the time.) While on a horse, if you are standing still and not auto-attacking, you are medding. Even while standing. Even while casting. The ability to med while standing/casting is huge. <br />
<br />
3. When you hit level 35 (and if you can find a reasonably priced one) get a fungi staff. They definitely have limitations (they snare you, the effect needs to be reapplied every 5 minutes, and it doesn't stack with regen spells) - but it's mana-free Regrowth... 9000 hp/hour = 4500 mana/hour. Stacks with the iksar regen BP or fungi tunic, too. <br />
<br />
4. Your longer-term items are (of course) the JBB and fungi tunic. <br />
<br />
For now, you'll probably just want the iksar BP. For the rest of spots, here's what I recommend: <br />
<br />
Get the cheap Jaundiced Bone pieces where available (helm, gloves, arms, boots- each a few hundred pp and great AC.) <br />
<br />
Get some 6 AC/65 HP rings- a steal for the money. <br />
<br />
Get a Black Alloy Medallion - stats are pretty good, it's cheap (couple hundred PP) and it will make every spell you cast under level 45 cost 10% less mana. That's a good thing. <br />
<br />
Get an Arctic Wyvern Mask - nice balance of AC and WIS with the mask for a few hundred pp. <br />
<br />
Get a Clay Guardian Shield (Ac 25, +50 HP) - a few hundred pp, and it will last you a long time. <br />
<br />
For remaining spots, grab totemic or ry'gorr. <br />
<br />
Since you'll be tanking your way through the first few levels, a nice weapon will help you out. You'll want to keep both piercing and your blunt skills trained, and make sure to keep your defense skill maxed as you level. As a piercer, the slime covered harpoon is nice (10 dmg, 25 dly, +5 wis, +10 mana) - fast and it can go in your range spot when you're not using it. For a blunt weapon, grab a smoldering brand (9 dmg, 22 dly, procs a minor fire DD at level 1- great &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;twink&lt;/font&gt; weapon.) Both should set you back just a few hundred pp. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and good hunting!</div></div><hr />
