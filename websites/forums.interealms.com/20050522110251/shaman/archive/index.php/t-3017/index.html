<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lornick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What if I told you I could design a zone with absolutely NO camps, NO trains, NO corpse recovery. What if I also told you I could make that same zone a.) easy to find groups b.) easy and quick to find mobs c.) challenging but fun d.) fast paced ? Am I high on crack? Maybe, but I still have a great idea for a dungeon design. *take notes Verant* <br />
<br />
The magic of this zone is a basic concept I like to refer to as &quot;segments&quot;. Picture this if you will... a series of &quot;one way walls&quot;. As you approach the wall from one side it will appear semi-transparent, but if you walk through it and look back it will be solid. If you can't grasp this concept re-read that first part until you do or the rest of this might as well be written in a long since forgotten language. A segment is an area between 2 of these &quot;one way walls&quot;. Now in every segment there are a set number of spawns. I'm thinking the magic number should be around 30, one which will be named. Now pay attention because this is why it will be impossible to camp named mobs. Enemy mobs will not respawn until all the player characters have left that segment. Once all the players have left that segment all the mobs in it will respawn instantly. In this fashion a group will have to continually move forward leaving the segment behind them free for another group to come clear. Between every 3 segments or so will contain a teleport gem back to the zone in. <br />
<br />
The zone will be basically designed like a tree. Think of the segments as branches. The zone in is the trunk. As you climb the tree you'll reach forks where your group can chose different paths. The higher you get the harder the mobs are. <br />
<br />
You could design a zone like this for any given level range, but I have the high end crowd in mind. To zone in you will need to have completed a key quest. But this isn't just a quest for another lame key wasting good space in your backpack. The quest giving NPC will only talk to characters 55+. The key quest will be fun and linear. In other words you won't be able to collect items for this quest out of order like the vast majority of non-sense quests in EQ. There will be absolutely NO bottlenecks for the quest. Any mobs that need to be killed will be trigger spawns and can be killed with no more than one group. In order to enforce a linear quests, the NPC's will only give you the next part of the quest if you've handed them an item required for completing the last part of the quest. I would like to make this class specific to spread the people out more, but I know this is completely beyond VI's capabilty. They would no doubt make some class quests much harder than others or so on. I'm thinking this should take the average 55+ player around 6hr play time to complete the quest. The &quot;key&quot; will be a necklace, ring, or other item that will have a nice balance of stats so it's worth wearing with the effect of self gate to the dungeon entrance. This will make grouping extremely easy because anyone who has the key has the ability to get there very quickly. Cast time will be long so it can't be abused by non-casting classes. (around 45 second cast time). This key will be soulbound. <br />
<br />
I went over why there could be no trains or camping earlier. Groups will have to constantly move forward through the segments. Now I'll go over the no corpse recovery statement. At the zone in there will be a beneficial NPC ghost, cleric, or some such thing that will summon your corpse to them the second you die. This is important for a few reasons. Death will be a bigger deal to your group because they can't just rez you on the spot. They'll either have to fight their way forward with one less person. Succor, or use their new keys to gate out. If there are no clerics in zone willing to rez you, the cleric NPC will rez you for a standard 250pp. <br />
<br />
I said earlier that named mobs will basically always be up in every segment. In order to keep items from being brought onto the server too quickly named mobs will only rarely drop nice items. The closer/easier to get to named mobs will drop items around 20percent of the time. The deeper named mobs will drop higher quality items maybe up to 75 percent of the time. The majority of the items will be no drop and either all all, or broken into larger categories like melee/priests/int casters so there is less of a chance for items to rot. (in other words, very few class specific items unless they are sellable) <br />
<br />
Between every 3 segments there will be a small segment I'll refer to as a waypoint. This way point will divide off into 2 or 3 more segments for groups to choose from. It will also contain a teleport gem back to the zone in. In this way point will also be a No Drop item that spawns on a platform, altar or some such thing. This No Drop item will respawn almost instantly after being picked up by a player. It will essentially be a &quot;save point&quot;. You will need to bring it along with your key to a NPC at the zone in. You turn in both items and the NPC will give you a slightly upgraded key (an extra +5hp, 2ac, +1 stat, etc.). At the zone in will be a number of color coordinated teleport stones to the waypoints throughout the zone. After you've upgraded your key you'll be able to teleport back to that way point in the dungeon. This is important so that players can go adventure in the part of the dungeon that is challenging and fun for them. It also keeps players from entering segments that there is already another group in. CoH would obviously not be possible in this zone. Otherwise it would be too easy for players to pick up the way point no drop items, and get around the death summon corpse thing. <br />
<br />
I'd like to see these series of segments have different environments as well. One series would be underwater, another in a cave, another in a temple like setting and so on. At the end of the dungeon will be a zone into a high end dungeon with a similar theme. <br />
<br />
This would be a raid dungeon that could support multiple raiding guilds AT THE SAME TIME. Like the dungeon that leads into it, the loot rules and such would be the same. The thing that keeps a guild from just farming this zone is that they'd have to spend a significant amount of time fighting their way to the boss mobs. Death would be a huge deal for these raids. Bodies would be summoned to zone in for this zone as well, so if key members of your raid die you'd have to start all over. Only the greatest of guilds could ever make it to the Zone Boss mob intact enough to kill him. And even this would probably be a rare thing as it would take many hours to even reach him. Of course the risk would be worth the reward. Such a daunting task would require insane loot. The endless challenge and loot would keep guilds coming back for a long time to come. The most important part is that guilds wouldn't have a reason to cause grief to each other in this zone. There would be different routes to take equally rewarding bosses. And the mobs would ALWAYS be up, so there is no need to rush in before another guild to beat them to the kill. I know theres someone who's thinking.. hey... why don't these guilds just leave one player in each segment so if their players die they can just run all the way back to their guild. Here's why, unlike the previous zone designed for groups this one will respawn the mobs in it 20minutes after the segment boss dies... so obviously this would be a bad idea. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I spent alot of time thinking of this idea. If anyone sees some glaring flaws in my thinking or has constructive thoughts of their own please share them. I'll post this in a few other forums through out the net so maybe VI catches wind of this and uses it in some future downloadable zone  Hey, I can dream right? Feel free to share my ideas with anyone, just give me my credit  <br />

<br />
Wouldn't it be easier to just have a new dungeon spawn if a group wishes (like I hear they are planning for PoP, or they already have in Anarchy Online)? Something like you get a key from a NPC, click on something, then zone into a new dungeon that is identical, but all yours?<br />
<br />

Couple questions/comments:<br />

<br />
What happens when I start working my way through the dungeon, and a group in front of me is stalled in segment 3?<br />
<br />
If my group enters a segment that already has someone in it, do the monsters respawn when they leave, or when *everybody* leaves? <br />
<br />
<br />
'This will make grouping extremely easy because anyone who has the key has the ability to get there very quickly'<br />
Getting to the zone has nothing to do with ease of grouping.  It's getting out when you arrive and discover you're the only one in the zone.  Unless this dungeon was placed off of the nexus it would still be empty.<br />
<br />
Some parts of this are good, other parts are good but unrealistic.</div></div><hr />

(Risk vs. Reward.)<br />
<br />
IE: Take a look at Cazic Thule. It's a difficult zone, yet the rewards are definently scaled for it. More zones like that with scaled difficulty, and you'll have people there constantly.<br />
<br />
Siren's Grotto might be the opposite: a more difficult zone with very little reward for your effort. That's why it is almost always empty!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make the loot average, so it doesnt matter how much gets out? Make the encounters terribly hard, so few get the ph4t L00t? Make the drop rates suck?<br />
<br />
Who knows. It is all speculation at this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You want a camp free dungeon? Easy.<br />
<br />
Make a large dungeon that has several linear branches, similar to sebilis but bigger. Have one central collecting point like the seb zone in that has several different branches leading from it. <br />
<br />
The big thing is to make the spawn time for mobs about an hour. People will be forced to move to find new spawns. Because of that, the designers can design encounters instead of camps. If each branch takes about an hour to move through, the balance of spawntime to content used is perfect. If there are a total of 5 branches, the zone can support up to 30 people at once without fighting over spawns if it is designed for each branch to hold one xp group.<br />
<br />
One of the things I hear VI is doing in PoP is using virtual zones. A single group gets ported into a zone that is created on demand. If another group wants to fight in that same zone, they get ported into a copy of the same zone. This will allow VI to create truely challenging one group encounters with rewards to match. Because of the way the zone is set up, no one can overpower an encounter by bringing more than one group. I think that is a very good idea. It would be nice if they had something similiar for a single person encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Huggem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Boss mob is Cow King. <br />
<br />
Just how sure are you? A Cow Queen would make more sense. Although cow king sounds good.<br />
<br />
And how about the evil, dreaded and feared Farmer Bob? He can drop top notch stuff like Shovel of Doom and Bob's Smelly Shirt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Lornick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bahimiron- hahaha, you're right that first paragraph does kinda come off like an infomercial.  I apologize for that, it really wasn't my intent.  It's kinda like when someone gets a brand new lodizal shield and they think it's so cool, then someone comes along and tells them their shield looks like a trash can lid and they can never look at their great shield the same again...<br />
<br />
Gorre- Yeah, that concept of a group having their very own dungeon could be really great if done properly.  I hope your right about it coming with Planes of Power.<br />
<br />
snapdragn-Couple questions/comments: <br />
Melees will never get the ability to gate. Even to gate to the entrance of this dungeon. <br />
**Rangers RoK breastplate does have self gate effect to ranger guild in Greater Faydark.  There are also all all potions with various gate effects, like Thurgadin self gate potion.  (It's no drop and lore, but pretty easy to make with proper tradeskills).  Anyway, careful with the word never, there is almost always an exception.  By making the cast time so long I think such an effect could be entered into the game with out destroying class balance.<br />
<br />
What happens when I start working my way through the dungeon, and a group in front of me is stalled in segment 3? <br />
**I've thought of this.  Your group could either wait till they have completed that section, or your group could gate back to the entrance and use one of the waypoint in zone teleports to go to a different location in the dungeon and take a different path.<br />
<br />
If my group enters a segment that already has someone in it, do the monsters respawn when they leave, or when *everybody* leaves? <br />
** The monsters will respawn when *everybody* leaves.  This does leave the potential for grief players to cause problems by just sitting in a segment to keep others from hunting there.  A possible solution to this would be to have a death squad of mobs appear next to any PC sitting in an empty segment after xx minutes pass.  Or just report to GM and go on to the next segment.<br />
<br />
Jentriken Aspenbark-there are lots of mini dungeons. splitpaw, runnyeye, befallen, kaesora, droga, dalnir. <br />
guess what. NO ONE GOES THERE<br />
**Those are some of my favorite places to go, mostly because the zones are typically empty.  In fact I think you just painted the path I went through my levels =P (though not in that order).  The main reason most of those zone remain empty is they are pretty difficult to get to. (ok, runneye and befallen are pretty easy to get to)  Plus I think the average EQ player has little imagination and will take the path of least resistance to lvl60.<br />
<br />
Grizlor-The closest thing to this man's dream is the reality that is Howling Stones<br />
**I love Howling Stones, it's one of my all time favorite zones.  I've also heard my dream zone compared to Tower of Frozen Shadows.  There are alot of pretty huge differences though.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm running low in time.  I'll try to post replies to some of the other comments at a later time.  Thanks for posting your opinions =)<br />
Lornick Warwind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Personally, I think if you put in more random drops off regular mobs (to give people more of a reason to go there) and maybe tweaked that &quot;respawn when everyone leaves&quot; feature to be more practical, I think you have a good idea here.<br />
Also, dunno about the rezzing mob at the entrance.  At first, it would be cool to people only because it's so different and new.  But after a while, it would just get annoying.  Maybe tweak that idea so that only a lower level rez will work on them (like a lvl 39 rez or something), so there is a trade-off for being able to rez yet still continue where you left off.<br />
<br />
Just please don't make it too much like Howling Stones, I really do not like that zone.<br />
You are forced to go through the n00b segments and collect all the keys before getting to the good stuff (which is always being farmed).<br />
<br />
Otherwise, tho, I think that's a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lornick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Deian-If a group loses 2 or 3 members but survives, they can't rez the dead people because the bodies are at zone. They now have to send the cleric back to rez them instead of just continuing on. How is that a good thing? <br />
**In all reality, death isn't that common for the average group. (I said average... not crappy =P)  My reason for trying to include it was to make death more of a penalty to the group with out making corpse runs difficult.  If a couple people in your group die, everyone just succors or uses self gate to zone in pick up and rez dead party members then use a way point to the closest place where they left off.  It really wouldn't be that big of a deal when you think about it, but it would make getting through to the end of the dungeon and killing segment bosses more of an accomplishment.<br />
<br />
What's to stop the group from camping in/out to repopulate the segment to keep camping it?<br />
**Thanks for bringing this up.  You almost put a cramp in my plans, but I've thought of a simple solution.  If you camp out anywhere in the dungeon you will respawn at the zone entrance.  <br />
<br />
Graal the Dorf-The big thing is to make the spawn time for mobs about an hour<br />
**The thing is with this idea, people would still camp named stuff if respawn was an hour.  People spend vast amount of time camping mobs for the stuff they really want.  My objective was to find a way to FORCE people to move without making acquiring items people want impossible.<br />
<br />
Juujuu-Wow. What an unrealistic zone. Let's try to have some semblance of a basis in reality?<br />
**How is this an impossible zone to create?  I'd like to think it's balanced.  Granted, it would take quite a bit of work on VI programmers part, but other than that why is this so impossible to do?<br />
<br />
Rodahn-dunno about the rezzing mob at the entrance<br />
** Try not to get too wrapped up in this idea.  The thing is, you don't HAVE to use the NPC for a rez.  This is meant to be a convenience to the non-rezzing classes who happen to be playing at 03:30 in the morning.  The 250pp was a price I came up with in order to keep money in the clerics pocket.  After all why bother to pay a cleric if it was so simple to just pay 50 or 100pp to an NPC?<br />
<br />
Just please don't make it too much like Howling Stones, I really do not like that zone<br />
**hehehe, you write that as if I'm a VI programmer currently working on this project =P  These are just ideas I have floating around in my brain that I wanted to share with the EQ world.  I really like Howling Stones btw, I powered up a rogue on second account largely in part so I could go there whenever I wanted =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ahhhh ok I see now.  You mean you have the option of allowing NPC to do it or being rezzed where you died.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I like this idea alot, just need to figure out ways to keep people from exploiting, like the others mentioned.<br />
<br />
Your camping and returning to zone feature may be a bit bad.  This can make a group auto succor whenever needed if they have 30 seconds to spare, and also, how would it handle those that go LD? As if they camped?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lornick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Loradenn- Your camping and returning to zone feature may be a bit bad.

** Remember, the key quest you complete to get in the zone has a 45sec self gate cast to the zone entrance.  I never wanted getting to the zone entrance to be a difficult thing.  If it's faster for your group to camp out, then reload into EQ at the zone in and then regroup so be it.  I simply can't think of another way to keep players from exploiting, or camping a segment boss by logging out.  Yes, Link Death would be treated as logging off which has the unfortunate side effect of screwing your group =(.  Please bear in mind though, that there are many waypoints through out the zone, and as long as you've been to one before you can get to it again from the zone in.  This should make regrouping (using quest key) and getting at least close to where you left off not a terribly difficult thing.<br />
