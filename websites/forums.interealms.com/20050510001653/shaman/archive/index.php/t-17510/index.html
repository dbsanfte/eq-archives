<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Prescott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Folks I am looking for a little guidance here.<br />
<br />
Since LDoN came out we shaman got a handy new spell  in the shrew line.  Shrew is = to run 3.  The question is now that LDoN is here and I have both shrew spells do you think I might as well skip run 3 and go for some thing else or is it still Regen 3 then run 3 ??<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">RS3 is always there.  It can never be dispelled and can never wear off.  <br />
<br />
Shrew, while nice, still eats up a buff slot, and can still be dispelled.  If you are running from something indoors and your shrew wears off, you are dead.<br />
<br />
If you dont want to get rs3, at least get rs1.  With that you can still outrun *most* mobs, and then you can spend the other points somewhere else.  My suggestion would be to go ahead and get RS3 though.  Its worth it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Run3 is definitely best general AA still. It provides permanent high run speed (slihtly faster than shrew) that won't wear off in awkward places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As far as i see it Shrew is only to be used in certain occasions before you come of level high enough to get Run Speed 3.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, get run3 and spend the points on something else. I forget what level pack shrew is, but it is most likely geared toward folks low enough level they cant work on aa's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">more importantly, tell your FRIENDS to get Run3.  Its a PITA when everyone has run3 except 2 people in the grp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With the current spells available to us I feel that run three is mostly a convenience AA.  Once you buy it you never have to worry about speed buffing yourself again. You days of running across Norrath in slow motion like something from a bad dream are over forever.  For me, something that makes my life in Norrath that much more enjoyable every minute I’m in game is well worth three AA points.  <br />
<br />
If you don’t mind having to keep SoW or Shrew memorized all the time and having to stop and cast it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again, every time it runs out then perhaps you could spend those points better elsewhere.  But some day chances are your spell is going to run out just as a mob decides you would make a tasty snack and your going to end up dead.  At that point you might want to rethink the value of spending three points on run three.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Saldaora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Regardless of responses above, I'm not doing run3 first.<br />
<br />
I'm the monk of a shammie monk pairing so I always have shrew on in ldon.  I'm focussing on first aid instead.  It'll allow me to heal party members and turn into a mana battery to accelerate downtime (usually happens once) in our dungeons (we do a wizard-druid-druid-shammie-chanter-monk group usually).<br />
<br />
Shammie might get run, dunno, might be best to get regen since I'm not getting run right away anyways.<br />
<br />
Once first aid is out of the way, then perhaps regen/run.<br />
<br />
I'm with you tho, don't see the point of run speed with shrew.  And I don't care if it drops at the wrong time, odds are small, and death happens, big deal :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Im lazy and a man of convenience, there is no way on earth I would buy a spell that I could do innately without having to think about it, much less sit down, exchange spells, stand up, cast it, sit down and remem a different spell, just makes my head hurt thinking about doing that to myself.  For the same reason, SCRM was the next AA I went for after CannV.<br />
<br />
Can I say screw shrew?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I didn't even bother buying pack shrew ;) <br />

I can see shrew being a boon to pre-aa people though.</div></div><hr />

Trying to convince the level 65 ranger in my group with 90000000 AA's that RS3 is faster and he needs to quit his moaning for the stupid thing.  Shrew sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Onte, <br />
<br />
I hope that ranger wasn't asking you to cast it on him? <br />
<br />
If he was, tell him to get off his lazy ebay ass and go buy the single target ranger shrew in ruj for 72 points, or the pack shrew in Miraguls for 200 points.<br />
<br />
Then he can do what he wants.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In a group with THREE healers you are worried about training a skill that will provide a pittance of healing 'power'?  One of your healers is a shaman, so unless the shaman is incredibly lazy, mana is not a problem, ESPECIALLY because one of your group is an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Id be curious to know your level.  I'm going out on a limb and saying you are probably pre 55 because you feel that first aid could truly be usefull.   (I'm actually guessing you are lower than that, but Im trying to be nice)  Snap was right, there are few things as annoying as trying to get somewhere where sow isnt an option and having to wait for people to catch up because they dont have RS3.  There is a reason that 98% of the magelos that you look at have trained at least ONE point into runSpeed, and its NOT because shrew is a new spell.  Its because RunSpeed is a very very usefull ability and worth spending the time to get.<br />
<br />
(And if your shaman partner does get runspeed, guess how fast he is going to become annoyed with you for pestering him for shrew.  I imagine that it will take about 2 days.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A monk without Run3 is in a world of hurt. There ae still places in the game where monks are solid pullers, and Run3 is a godsend for any puller. Being smacked from behind and stunned for even a second or two can be fatal when mobs are swinging away for 900+ a pop. <br />
<br />
Shrew will replace run3... right up until it fades midpull, or is dispelled midpull (I've seen pullers lose 12 buffs on one pull in Guk). <br />
<br />
As far as patching people up goes, First Aid isn't going to help you much. You can already bandage them up to 70%, if you feel like having your friends carry around enough bandages to heal five or six thousand hit points: as a monk, you won't be able to carry enough. I honestly don't see getting First Aid at all, unless you're shooting for Critical Mend early on. If that's the route you're taking, then yeah, you need First Aid, but I'd heartily reccomend taking a different path at that point. Thirty-three AAs is a hefty price to pay for an ability that amount to a 1500 hit point heal every six minutes... one that may not even work.<br />
<br />
As a comparison, you could get Combat Agility 3, Lightning Reflexes 5, and Natural Durability 2 instead. I'd submit that you'll save your healers more mana that way in the long run than you ever will be bandaging them after a fight goes poorly.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts on the issue...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Have the other class boards shut down recently or something? It seems that the experienced shaman here are spending more time educating other classes than doing anything else? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It's a whopping 3 points. Even in the worst group ever, it MIGHT take an afternoon. I can't think of a good reason not to get run 3. Besides, it's not like there are so many other amazing options in general...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My husband (real life), after AA came out, had this brilliant idea to earn his 3 for First Aid.  The man plays to the beat of a different drummer, in all honesty, but he soon recognized that when wifey-poo (me) isn't around, he's got to pay for his sow and without the sow, he's dead.  He also realized pretty quickly, while we were hunting in an outdoor zone, the sow tends to pop while in the middle of a pull, while wifey-poo is 6,000 yards away and OOR.  His first three AA went to RS and he was not at all reluctant about it.  It's worth it.  When you're able to really grind xp in Tier1 and Tier2, then other stuff later, you'll see how quickly the AA's come, or at least see the potential for how quickly they will come to you and you'll understand that you will not have to be so choosy and reluctant to spend 3 points.  Get them, you'll kiss yourself.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I did Regen first but RS was my next.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, reminds me of that story about the two guys who get cornered by a cheetah... (Quite how they manage this is a whole other story!)<br />
<br />
One man whips out his running shoes (handy, huh?) and starts limbering up. His friend says &quot;Why are you bothering, that thing can easily outrun you?&quot;<br />
<br />
To which the man replies &quot;I only need to outrun you!&quot;</div></div><hr />

First Aid is intensely useful if you solo as monk.<br />
My monk has run3 and bind wound3 as his first 6 skills.<br />
I have had zero desire to change what skills he bought.<br />
Only as my monk is approaching level 60 and needing to group to get ok xp is where it wouldn't be as useful.<br />
<br />
One thing though...<br />
A monk can definately carry enough bandages.<br />
My monk carries 8400 bandaids with him.<br />
<br />
1 Gauze Press has 20 charges.<br />
Each charge summons 20 bandaids.<br />
Each recharged gauze press will summon 400 bandages.<br />
A stack of 20 batteries will recharge the gauze press 20 times, giving you 21 total recharges including the original.<br />
21 total recharges * 400 bandages is 8400 bandages.<br />
And all I need to hold them is ONE inventory slot for a toolbox, and TWO slots in bags for the press and the stack of batteries (the summoned bandages can fit in the toolbox after recharges).<br />
What was that about not having the inventory space to carry the bandages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Why would you keep Sow memmed?<br />
As a Shaman my clicky boots from my Epic have sat in my inventory in place of a bag, one touch Sow.<br />

You youngsters...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I used to run around with sow memmed always for myself and groupmates, so I really didn't mind sowing people who asked while I was traveling.  Now I gotta mem it, wait for it to refresh, then cast it, cause I haven't bothered pulling it out for myself or groupmates cause everyone has RS3 and are normally happy with that.  Billy gets memmed infrequently.</div></div><hr />
