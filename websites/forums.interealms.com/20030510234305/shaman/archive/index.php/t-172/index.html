<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I still havent got my 8th, and was meleeing with the 7th yesterday, and i found out the proc is broken :p  typical verant. once it procs you get the message &quot;Item is out of charges,&quot; indicating while its listed as a combat effect, they mistakenly put it on a right click effect, but since its combat, with no charges from that, it wont proc. pretty funny stuff. i emailed verant and submitted it as a bug in game... still no word on fixing it though. ah well, ill have my 8th soon enough though, hopefully, so no big worry :)  still a bit upsetting they didnt check if it worked before putting it in though :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">haw, figures.  Try to put some notes in on the 8th stacking problems as well if you do any more feedbacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sorsisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">oh? whats the stacking issue with the 8th?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">doesn't stack with focus (probably HoS too, haven't tried).  Pretty much 100% useless unless you're casting it on your clerics or enchanters &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ption of purity doesnt even stack with Focus right now, really sucks to when trying to kill Arch Lich :( Of course Verant and there infinite wisdom wont do jack about it since we arent bards or monks.</div></div><hr />
