<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah if you were going to use key need to get penkeeper to drop the bronze key i think it is. Also think i had to put the key in the right spot and hit U to get the gate to open. I didnt use the shrink because i got one of the other keys he dropped and messed clearing other mobs so gated to the top and came down again and penkeeper was up. Dropped the bronze key the next time and i think i invised and went in that way.</div></div><hr />

Use Shrink. Dat all .. Shrink, if you dont already have the Bronze key. It's the best way to get to him.</div></div><hr />
