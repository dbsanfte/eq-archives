Its been renamed to Segway but the thing that gets me is the Atlanta PD is buying several at about 9K a pop to see about using them for certain police jobs.<br />
<br />
Now here is the thing that I have yet to figure out about this device.<br />
<br />
Its got an estimated 15 mile range for 1 battery charge which takes 6 hours to recharge.  Its got a top speed of 15 MPH and further more it makes the user stand up still so that they are still having to place strain on their knees and legs.  I JUST DON&quot;T SEE THE ADVANTAGE HERE.<br />
<br />
Especially when you consider the BIKE.  A Bike has unlimited range with no silly batteries to recharge.  A Bike can easily attain 15 MPHs and faster if need be.  A Bike also allows the rider to sit down occasionally give his legs and knees a break.  And lastly Bikes dont cost 9K a pop.<br />
<br />
At any rate I think Atlanta has too much money to spend on their PD and they need to transfer that money to say Houston where our infamously stupid Mayor Brown can blow it away on something more worthwhile like yet ANOTHER construction project that will NEVER be finished while he is mayor :D<br />

The sad thing is is that Atlanta is in a major budget crunch.  Mayor Shirley Franklin was handed a mess when Mayor Bill Campbell left office.  Fortunately, 6 of the pogo sticks with wheels were donated.  <br />
<br />
I pity the police officers that draw this duty.  It has to be worse than desk duty.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The advantage comes when the criminals fall over laughing when they see a cop chasing them on one of these.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment about the jackassery of the city government spending THAT much money (which likely could field another patrol officer).  Its moronic.<br />
<br />
but..<br />
<br />
How does this have anything to do with the &quot;cops getting lazier&quot;?  I can asure you, the fellas that are going to get stuck with these things (and most likely I can see them in service with parking meter enforcement type positions - which aren't &quot;police officers&quot;) think its moronic as well.<br />
<br />
We've discussed in other threads how the folks who serve our country in the armed forces deserve a bit more respect for performing a thankless job.<br />
<br />
Let's also keep in mind the men and women who work in all of the police (and fire) departments who risk their lives every single day for YOU.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I don't disagree with the sentiment of your post - the title could have been better thought out though.<br />
<br />
Thanks for listening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then my apologies Saldrin.<br />
<br />
I actually have a fair amount of respect for policemen and women who actually do their job and for that I thank them.<br />
<br />
However cop corruption and cop laziness is something that is covered WAY to often and is WAY more common then their counterparts at Fire Departments and the Military.<br />
<br />
Firstly let me say that my title was not aimed at the decent cops who do a good job and do in fact put their lives on the line.<br />
<br />
However I have PERSONALLY seen and met several cops who use that badge as a brow beating tool and who shriek away from real police work when it actually has to be done.<br />
<br />
In fact due to one lazy and fat policeman's inaction one of my highschool friends is dead.  So unfit cops are something that has hit a little close to home.<br />
<br />
So while I chuckle partly at articles like this its also a reminder to me of firstly corrupt public spending on devices that have obviously no merit, and which further excerabate the unfittness of the Police Force and further more encourages that very same unfittness.<br />
<br />
I at least thank you that as a cop you see crap like this device for what it really is, an embarassment, and waste of funds, but frankly I don't need a lesson in showing respect.<br />
<br />
When I see good cops I let em know (and I've been forunate to know personally a few) and when I see bad cops (or for that matter bad crap in the Fire Department or Armed Services) I call it for what it is.. crap.<br />
<br />
In otherwords I don't brownnose people due to what &quot;special&quot; service they claim to be performing... I congratulate a job well done to people who deserve it and show contempt for people who don't do their jobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saldrin Pathwarden</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are there police officers who are jackasses? Yes.  <br />
<br />
Are there police officers who abuse their authority? Yes.<br />
<br />
Are there police officers who are, in fact, criminals? Yes.<br />
<br />
Are there hundreds of thousands of police officers who quietly go about their job every day, protecting our safety and property who aren't abusive, lazy or who fit any of the &quot;fat, dumb and lazy&quot; cop stereotype?<br />
<br />
Absolutely.<br />
<br />
However, even a &quot;lazy&quot; cop - when he puts on a uniform in the morning - voluntarily makes himself a target for deadly violence.  There are elements in society who don't care that the person in the uniform has a little baby girl at home, or is late on his car payment, or is trying to take night classes to find a &quot;better&quot; line of work.<br />
<br />
They want to kill them - for no other reason than they wear a badge.<br />
<br />
I'm not asking for anyone to kiss a cops ass for breakfast, but folks need to not let a bad instance when &quot;that cop with an attitude&quot; did something they didn't like become the way they view all police officers.  Unfortunately, that's what most folks do.<br />
<br />
Perpetuating the stereotype of the &quot;fat, lazy, donut eating pig&quot; is all part of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly does this device promote laziness?<br />
<br />
I'm going to guess from your comments above that you and I agree it does.<br />
<br />
Secondly do cops have a stereotypical image of being lazy.<br />
<br />
Again I think its safe to say they do.<br />
<br />
Thirdly do a significant number of cops actually fit that Stereotype?<br />
<br />
We may be in disagreement here but in the places I've lived most Cops are not the physical specimens one would associate with fitness.<br />
<br />
More over...<br />
<br />
but folks need to not let a bad instance when &quot;that cop with an attitude&quot; did something they didn't like become the way they view all police officers <br />
<br />
Well aside from the standard attitude problems that every other citizen has experienced I actually got to experience a cop who in fact DID NOT DO THEIR JOB and let a friend DIE.<br />
<br />
Or did you miss that?<br />
<br />
So perhaps rightly or wrongly I will always hold cops in a little closer light not because they gave me some trouble but because they failed their job and a life close to me was loss.<br />
<br />
More over while you hear of stupid spending problems in the military and silly fireman issues the one repetitive theme I get on the news and private sources OFTENTIMES from inside the police organization itself is about corruption and laziness.<br />
<br />
So perhaps while we shouldn't be promoting stereotypes the police shouldn't be promoting them either and to be honest the Cops give themselves more bad press than any average citizen does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saldrin Pathwarden</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;All black people are criminals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All irish are drunks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All mexicans are lazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Appalachian people are stupid&quot;<br />
<br />
The above are all stereotypes.<br />
<br />
One can find examples proving all of the above.  There are blacks who are criminals.  There are irish folk with alcohol problems.<br />
<br />
Does that make them true?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Is it wrong to apply those stereotypes to the aforementioned groups of people? <br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
So why then, is it appropriate to apply wide sweeping generalizations and stereotypes to people WHO VOLUNTARILY PLACE THEIR LIVES IN DANGER TO PROTECT YOU!?!?<br />
<br />
Or did you miss THAT?<br />
<br />
I didn't miss your example about your friend at all.  However,  without having more than one side (which is obviously biased - no insult to you, but your opinion is biased) of the case, I'm not going to comment on it.  I can't comment on it, in all fairness to you or to the officer involved.<br />
<br />
Your last post here is full of the attitudes that I'm talking about and your attitude is a HUGE disservice to the HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of police officers - the VAST MAJORITY of police officers who DO NOT fit that sterotype.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolyn</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a stereotype that is associated with police officers that often represents them as being fat, lazy, stupid, donut eating, coffee drinking denzins of the public pay roll.  Fortunately, it is a vastly misrepresented stereotype.<br />
<br />
I have to agree that there are cops out there who are a lazy, there are some who are corrupt and abuse their authority, but compared to the majority of police, they are a very small number indeed. <br />
<br />
One corrupt police officer though can tarnish the reputation of an entire Department and even in some cases the entire profession.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that you had a horrible experience with law enforcement Telumehtar.<br />
<br />
Next time you read an article in the press regarding alleged police corruption or misconduct, remember that is usually &quot;alleged&quot;.  It seems perfectly acceptable by society to crucify a police officer in the media before an investigation is conducted or the results of that investigation revealed.<br />
<br />
Hold us (consequently I am a police officer) up to the light. Scrutinize us, check up on us, hell, get out with your local agency and do a ride-along and see what the officers in your area put up with on a day to day basis.  I hold myself and the officers who work for me to very high standards, but like anything else, it's difficult to judge me until you have walked in my shoes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as news stories about corrupt cops, sure it happens, but everytime a cop is caught doing something wrong, it makes the national news.  Can you think of another profession that has to live up to that?<br />
<br />
I could never be a police officer because I think alot of the laws they have to enforce are wrong.  I do have respect for them, though, because they keep our society from descending into chaos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This Segway thing though is a blatant and somewhat funny abuse of the public funding of the PD.  More over it promotes the VERY stereotypes Saldrin seems to be in a huff about and its the Atlanta PD that is promoting it.<br />
<br />
And lastly anyone who can't laugh at themselves when they deserved to be laughed at (and this Segway personal transport issue is a perfect example) has other issues to be addressed.<br />
<br />
I don't know what sort of work related problems Saldrin may have but his defensiveness on a subject such as the above indicates to me that perhaps I hit a chord a little to close for his comfort.<br />
<br />
In this particular incident I'm calling the crap for what it is.<br />
<br />
If there is a cop story which has a something to be commended then I'll gladly throw in my commendation as they will deserve it.<br />
<br />
Moreover I've had several amiable encounters with cops as well so no I don't just use a stereotype to base my opinions of cops on.  I've got enough exposure to them both good and bad to form my own opinion.<br />
<br />
I base just about everything in life on merit and this little scooter thing has none in terms of uses for the PD that a bike couldn't do just as well if not outright better.  And so yeah I'm going to poke fun at it, as SATIRE is quite often a legal way to show contempt for stupid ideas and well if you've study SATIRE at all it happens to use a LARGE dose of stereotypes to push its message along.  But I suppose any sunday morning cartoonist or editor should be jailed for using Stereotypes now.<br />
<br />
I mean hell I'm a Houstonian and I poke fun at my own city in the same message.  Does that mean I'm disrespectful of myself?  No it means I'm laid back enough to poke fun at me and my fellow Houstonians about a stupid choice in mayor we picked.<br />
<br />
Laugh a little Saldrin.. you will live longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I also say that having a Segway would be a blast. LOL. My Department doesn't have that kind of money though, I have a hard enough time just getting ammunition for training.<br />
<br />
But, and this is something to look into, some grants allow for the funding of goofy programs like this. I'd be interested in where the money came from. It may not be an abuse of public funds, could be a grant for that specific purpose.</div></div><hr />

  And lastly Bikes dont cost 9K a pop. <br />
<br />
Actually the bikes the Police departments use do cost pretty damn close to that.  There are safety concerns for the bikes they use as well as the custom equipment that they need.  I really do feel sorry for the poor saps that get this duty.  They will get laughed at (Especially by co-workers)<br />
<br />
As far as your attitude towards cops without knowing the exact circumstances surrounding your friends death it is hard to say weather or not the Officer is at fault.  But it would be interesting to hear it.<br />
<br />
I am not a Cop but at one time I considered it for a career.  I worked retail loss prevention for 6 years while I was prepariing for that career.  A lot of my Old co-workers are now Police Officers with many different departments in the area.  None of these people are &quot;Lazy, Fat, or Corrupt&quot;  They are honest hardworking people that I have trusted and would trust again my life to.  Two of my friends were involved in a shooting where the &quot;Victim's&quot; family tried to use racism as cause.  Of course the media repeats this and now my two good friends, with wives and families are considered racists by anyone that watches the TV.  They are not Racists and are both back at work after the shooting was justified.  As a matter of fact one of them (Who was my boss) use to to question why we were following people of different races.  He would ask what reason beside that person being black,asian etc.. are you following them.  If you didn't have a good reason you would get chewed.<br />
<br />
Before anyone shoots there mouths off about cops you do really need to look at it from their point of view.  I go on ride alongs with my friends all the time and I am glad that I got a break into the computer industry and didn't go into that line of work.  I guess I have done my share of jumping into windows of moving cars, fighting with disgusting drug addicts and punk little kids.  Give them a break!  They too are human beings and they have the toughest job around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolyn</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bikes my Department uses costs $1100 a piece and that's fully outfitted. Another $350 for uniforms and special equipment for the officer and that's a total of $1450 per unit.  That's a far cry cheaper than the 9k that was quoted for the Segways.<br />
<br />
Here, bike duty is actually requested. During the summer it's fun and the peeps we are after don't pay much attention to bikes (unlike a fully marked squad car) and you can get right on top of people before they ever know you are there. :)<br />
<br />
If other officers are making fun of the ones on bikes, they obviously don't see the advantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My sense of humour is rather well developed, and you can ask my wonderful finacee how often I engage in self deprecating humor about my baldness, my job, my dog and my life in general.<br />
<br />
Reread my initial post.  There's no ire in it whatsoever.  Simply pointing out that in YOUR initial post, I read little that had any connection whatsoever with the title you chose for the thread.<br />
<br />
In response, I recieved what appears to be rather emotionally charged speech in support of your improper stereotyping of the men and women in law enforcement.  Due, apparently, to your perception that a police officer caused the death of a friend (which, Drexel appropriately pointed out - unless the officer killed him - the officer isn't responsible for his death).<br />
<br />
So yes, when met with ire and contempt, I responded similarly.<br />
<br />
I'm 35 years old.  I've been involved in law enforcement in one capacity or another since I was 21 years old.  The things you see as a police officer are hard.  Worse than most would ever want to be exposed to.  You have absolutely no idea.<br />
<br />
So now, you try and make it seem that *I* have some sort of personal issue, because my hackles were raised when met with histrionic, contempt-filled speech?  Interesting that.<br />
<br />
You've promoted various mean sprited stereotypes about literally hundreds of thousands of professional men and women - stereotypes that are largely unjustifiable.<br />
<br />
If  you applied similar stereotypes to other demographic groups in society - minority races for example,  you'd immediately be labeled a racist and condemned (rightly so).<br />
<br />
Yet, here you perpetuate negative stereotypes about an entire profession based on what you deem as negative encounters with a miniscule percentile of police officers.<br />
<br />
There may have been an attempt at satire in your thread title, however there was none whatsoever in your lambasting of police officers.<br />
<br />
I'll laugh a lot and will live quite a long time thanks, and I certainly don't need your condescension to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valeska</div><div class="date">04-24-2002, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can assure you he laughs quite a lot- however I see no reason he has to laugh &quot;at himself&quot; over someone else's insult. In the same way I wouldn't expect someone to laugh at racist jokes directed at them. <br />
Hell, if you were a cop perhaps you would understand but lets get this straight- you're not. Am I right? So what is your job? I for one would like to know, since it's now about personal attacks.<br />
Oh, and and if you've had &quot;several encounters with cops&quot; you're probably doing something illegal. <br />
Anyhow getting back to base, I don't see how this scooter thing is in any way related to laziness... isn't operating one of these just as much work as driving a car? You even have to stand up! And as I see it, it's gonna be used for traffic cops- after all, I can't see one going fast enough to chase someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what is your job?<br />
None of your business and further more if perhaps you actually participated in these boards rather than be a 6 post troll you might know what I do.<br />
<br />
Oh, and and if you've had &quot;several encounters with cops&quot; you're probably doing something illegal. <br />
<br />
The fact is I have done illegal activities on par that would probably would've ended my normal life and landed me behidn bars for the rest of my years however I was good enough (and certainly lucky enough) not to get caught and eventually wise up and leave that path (and in fact encouraged people going down that path to leave it with me).  However EVERY encounter I've had with a cop with the exception of a traffic ticket has been me or my friends calling them for help or to report trouble.<br />
<br />
The exact story I refer to when I mention a cop let my friend die is like this:<br />
<br />
My friends and I are out at a neighborhood pool.  Some stupid  as hell drunks are out cruising in their suped up mudding truck and driving all over the road and into people's yards.   Just as they turn the bend down one street we see a cop car drive by.  We wave him down and tell em about the drunks in a truck.<br />
<br />
He pretty much blew us off several times pulled over into the pool parking lot and started to eat his hamburger.  Later that night my friends and I learned that a school mate and friend who was walking up to the pool had been hit and left to bleed to death on the side of the road by those very same drunks.<br />
<br />
Had the cop DONE HIS GODDAM job and pursued those drunken bastages my friend might still be around.<br />
<br />
(which is obviously biased - no insult to you, but your opinion is biased) <br />
<br />
And well for my opinion the police review board happened to agree with me and expelled this sad excuse for a cop from the force.  So please don't just shrug me off as some sort of emotionally attached biased story teller.  I've had friends do stupid stuff and they were dear to me but the consequences of their actions were their own.<br />
<br />
This particular friend however might be around had a cop done his duty.  No the cop didn't directly kill him.  But the cop's inaction allowed one crime (drunken driving) to turn into a worse crime (manslaughter I believe).<br />
<br />
Saldrin as far as personal attacks go I believe it was you who came into this thread and posted the first &quot;huffy&quot; post.  Up until you showed up and started preaching about respect and getting upset about a commonly used icon of humor, this thread was lighthearted and satirical about what in my opinion is an abuse of public funds.<br />
<br />
As far as stereotyping goes you did a little yourself.  You stereotyped me as some disrespecting punk due to the title I used.  But had you actually known me and known what I've done you would know that I give money to police funds(and I don't even want the little sticker for my car to get out of tickets) and I've helped out at a few police functions and lastly there are individual cops I know and respect greatly cause they do their job well.<br />
<br />
But oddly enough its the very same cops I've been around at functions and in other daily life that make &quot;lazy cop jokes&quot; and they themselves are cops.  So forgive me if I upset your sense of pride but the cops I know were laid back enough to have a laugh at a stereotype.<br />
<br />
And lazy cop isn't even in the same ballpark as racist jokes so don't even bring that up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saldrin Pathwarden</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;Six Post Troll&quot;, Tel, is my RL fiancee - who has just started a Ranger and just started perusing the Glade.<br />
<br />
Chock up another stereotype.  Perhaps if you paid more attention to the Glade instead of trying to come up with &quot;satirical&quot; ways to impune an entire profession of people - you'd have seen our posts.<br />
<br />
I read the story you linked in your initial post.  Why didn't you entitle the thread &quot;Electrical Power Employees Get Lazier&quot; ?  The information about the Police Department obtaining some of these things to test doesn't even come into play until the last half of the article. It states that they're looking into possible uses for the Segway scooter in areas like parks and airports (which may actually be a decent use for the silly thing).<br />
<br />
The main users it seems are going to be members of the &quot;Ambassador Force&quot;, which engages in assisting tourist and street cleaning (according to the article).   Funding for the project isn't coming from the city of Atlanta or the Atlanta Police Department - but the &quot;Atlanta Regional Commission&quot; - a multi-county entity.<br />
<br />
On what are you basing your claim that its the police department who is pushing for this device?  It certainly doesn't state that in the article you're basing this thread on.<br />
<br />
Did you actually READ the article, or did you look at the pictures and automatically draw your conclusion that it was the &quot;cops&quot; who were getting &quot;lazier&quot;?  If you did in fact read the article - why then did you not mention the wastefulness of the power company and the &quot;Ambassador Force&quot; for buying these contraptions - instead of simply focusing on the Police Department.<br />
<br />
The fact that you chose to post in the manner you did, shows me little if any satire involved - a crutch I note you only used to substantiate this thread after you were put on the defensive by several posters here.  <br />
<br />
As far as your story about your friend - I'm sure that would have been all over the news - please link me to the story.  If in fact the incident occurred the way you say it did,  then the officer involved would likely not only have been fired, but most likely would have been prosecuted criminally and the department would have suffered heavily in the resulting civil lawsuit.  You don't mention these - and it adds an air of dubiousness to your story.<br />
<br />
As to your contention that I somehow personally attacked you in my first post - I did no such thing.  Get over yourself.  More importantly, stop trying to turn this around like this whole discussion is based on some sort of fault in my emotional and/or psychological makeup.  The fact is your message was wrong, it was put forth poorly and you were called on it not only by me - but a number of other posters<br />
<br />
And an unsubstantiated attack on any group of people - whether based on their race or class or yes - even based on their profession is wrong.  Sorry you don't see it that way - you seem to be the only one here who doesn't though.<br />

Tel, you are the most level headed and wise person I have seen on these boards, so I found it odd that you insulted someone based on their post count. I have a newfound respect for you now that I know you've gotten away with crime though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The incident with the cop happened almost 7 years ago in a small town outside Houston.  The likelyhood of me finding an article at this time is pretty slim.<br />
<br />
Furthermore Saldrin I could give a flip less about your feelings on the issue of stereotypes especially when you yourself came into the thread using em and oh hey as a cop you folks use em to make initial assessments on the job.<br />
<br />
Racial profiling?  Style of dress?  Looking at a type of car?  Letting crying women get out of a ticket?<br />
You may personally avoid using stereotypes but cops in general make pretty excessive use of them and normally I defend them in using it as it can be a helpful tool (look at crime rates in NY go down under Guiliani when he implemented statistical profiling).<br />
<br />
As far as your fiancee well at this point in time she is troll.  She wasn't coming in here to comment on her own merit she came in here looking to add another attacking voice to yours.  As far as I'm concerned this disagreement is between you and me and everyone else can butt out and that includes the troll.<br />
<br />
She wants to comment on the article fine.  She wants to show her disagreement with my use of stereotypes fine.  But when she starts asking me to provide personal information so she can turn around and try insulting me then she is a troll.  And frankly with 6 total posts even my scanning of the main forums would've resulted in a high likelyhood that I wouldn't have seen her.<br />
<br />
And as far as &quot;on the defensive?&quot;...  hardly.  I've stated these are a waste of public funds.  The Electric companies are private businesses so they can spend their money however they want and its their own head if the go under.<br />
<br />
The ambassador service I knew nothing about their financial sources so I chose to ignore them and likely since they are not in any way going to be involved in pursuits and instead are going to be giving tours this tool might make sense for them.  <br />
<br />
However the police I do know where the money comes from and its tax money which is something we as citizens shoud be vocal about.  Personally I'd rather see them flop in Atalanta so it won't be brought up here in Houston where our ever so corrupt mayor has a nasty habit of buying stuff Houston doesn't need.<br />
<br />
I mean lets see here...  using a little rounding here to make it easy but 10 units(I think I remember reading they wanted 9) of the $9K waste of electronics  would be 90K.  Now I don't know the cost of a cop cruiser but I would place a guess that the average cop cruiser being a crown victoria with modifcations would cost around 25K considering what this website (http://www.copcars.net/newcrownvic.htm) says which I can't confirm as official or not.<br />
<br />
And I'm going to assume the $1450 price mentioned above is accurate so now lets see how we can work this out budgetwise.<br />
<br />
I could get 3 cruisers for a nice 75K leaving me an 15K which I can split into 10 bike units.<br />
<br />
So essentially instead of fielding just 9 inferior Segway units I'm now going to be able to field 3 Cruisers and 10 bike units.<br />
<br />
I think its getting pretty damn obvious that these are a waste of time resources and money.  Top that off with the fact that these are electronic and probably fairly fragile when it comes to things like impacts, water, temp, and other environemental factors then we have not only an inital waste of 90K but even more waste purchasing replacement parts for these which chances are since they use a complex 5 gyroscopic system is going to require specialized technicians which will cost even more to fix and they will have to either be shipped to these techs or the techs will have to be flown in which is even more money wasted... I could keep going here but I think you get the idea.<br />
<br />
So now I have this monstrosity of a budget item sitting in front of me as a citizen and I want to stop it.  Damn straight I'm going to use every tool available to me to make sure its frowned upon and made fun of.  That is how programs get axed.<br />
More over on the stereotyping I've had cop friends crack jokes on the very same stereotype.  So I have to ask is it ok for Cops to use the stereotype in jokes and stories but not average citizens?<br />
<br />
And since I know cops who use those same cop stereotypes in their jobs including an old soccer coach who was a detective and my uncle who is a cop (soon to be detective) who thinks its ok to use then why the hell shouldn't I use them?  Its not like I'm poking fun at someone's race which is an attribute that can't be changed or controlled I'm poking fun at a profession and specifically a bad part of that profession.<br />
<br />
If anything I would think that having that stereotype around would be helping the police force since its such a bad thing to be nobody will want to be it.<br />
<br />
Its kinda the same way we make fun of scientists.  They are bright and intelligent individuals but hey it doesn't stop the jokes about em.<br />
<br />
Or computer folks.  They jokingly refer to themselves as geeks and the world makes geek jokes about em.<br />
<br />
Or construction workers.  They don't all have butt cracks showing but I think just about everyone has seen 1 or 2 who do have em.<br />
<br />
Or how about lawyers.  Again they provide useful... err well maybe not but still they get all kinds of jokes.<br />
<br />
Or plastic surgeons... they get kidded about not being &quot;real&quot; doctors.<br />
<br />
Or dentists, pilots, secretaries, interns, lumberjacks, park rangers, pick a profession and tell me where there ISN'T a stereotype that we have not used.<br />
<br />
Jobs more than race or religion have the biggest impact on what people's personalities are like.<br />
<br />
I got an ex-army grunt in the office with me and he exudes Army gruntiness and I love having him around as it cracks me up and livens the place up.<br />
<br />
My old coach exuded that cop feel.  And showed in his coaching.<br />
<br />
My science teachers in college exuded the scientific feel and even when I played chess against them I could see their minds ticking away scientifically at the problem on the board (even had one guy write down every move of a game so he could feed it into this program he wrote to analiyze things)<br />
<br />
Yes on a very personal level they can be very different from each other but Cops can often tell when they meet other cops.<br />
<br />
Army grunts can tell when they meet other army grunts.<br />
<br />
Doctors with doctors, computer guys with computer guys.<br />
<br />
So when it comes to occupations, Stereotypes are probably one of the MORE accurate places they are in use.  Partly because the stereotypes identify with aspects of the job and often that job rubs off onto the personality of the person.<br />
<br />
Furthermore I used the negative cop stereotype for what I perceive as a negative cop budget item.  I also have a positive cop stereotype in my head as well and as much as its based off hollywood portrayals its also based off of real life encounters with those who wear the uniform well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only a user myself 5 times I probably got several people in my school hooked on Acid for life.<br />
<br />
Some of the bad things that happened to various friends of mine...<br />
<br />
One guy walked to his neighbor's house shot the woman stole her TV walked right back into his house (nextdoor) plugged it in and watched it til the cops showed up.  Jail for the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
5 friends committed suicide in various forms ranging from purposeful gunshots to the head to playing Russian Rulet(sp?) to overdosing on drugs to getting killed by other drug dealers/buyers/police who busted the scene (of which I don't blame the cops at all).<br />
<br />
And finally on my last &quot;trip&quot; (the one that made me realize I needed to get out) I was walking around the mall with my best friend and we were frying our balls off with the stuff we got and as we walked around we got into a bad argument.  He and I both turned each other and in my mind my thought was &quot;How fast can I kill this person&quot; and I was already sizing him up for an attack when a car's headlight shoned over us and snapped us out of it.<br />
<br />
At that point I pretty much stopped spending time with that group of friends and concentrated on soccer and my job and school.<br />
<br />
I still talk to a few of them on occasion when I go shoot pool at Sharkey's but all of them are drifters now without a source of steady income and hooked on drugs and I think steadily dying as they keep getting thinner each time I see them.  Meanwhile I'm done with college holding down a nice job and making enough money that I can actually look at buying a house soon.<br />
<br />
Trust me Vader I know first hand its not worth it.  And I have not even shared the more graphic or violent things I've seen or been a part of.  <br />
<br />
Sure drugs are fun and sure you can make some money and have some serious power over people if you know what you are doing but it can all come to a VERY sudden halt when you least expect it or you can get hooked on the wrong thing and fade like dying a ember.</div></div><hr />

The way you act on this board, always made me think of you like this smart, wise, force that was never wrong. This new (old rather) side of you is very interesting and intriguing.<br />
<br />
EDIT: When I initially made my first paragraph, I said uzis, then changed it because he never mentioned uzis, though I always pictured drug dealers as carrying uzis, cause it's a widely known fact that they're badass. Changing it back cause now he mentioned illegal weapons, and we all know that means UZI!</div></div><hr />

As for my old life... Experience is the best and harshest teacher and frankly I hope I never have to deal with that kind of thing again.<br />
<br />
(as a side note its that same street experience and exposure to illegal gun use that also has me heavily opposed to gun control laws.  If more people had had guns I doubt I or my friends would've gotten away with so much and to be honest I'd be dead but probably rightfully so)</div></div><hr />

<br />
THINGS TO NEVER SAY TO A COP... <br />
 <br />
1. I can't reach my license unless you hold my beer. (OK in Texas) <br />
2. Sorry, Officer, I didn't realize my radar detector wasn't plugged in. <br />
3.Aren't you the guy from the Village People? <br />
4. Hey, you must've been doin' about 125 mph to keep up with me. Good job! <br />
5. Are You Andy or Barney? <br />
6. I thought you had to be in relatively good physical condition to be a police officer. <br />
7. You're not gonna check the trunk, are you? <br />
8. I pay your salary! <br />
9. Gee, Officer! That's terrific. The last officer only gave me a warning, too!  <br />
10. Do you know why you pulled me over? Okay, just so one of us does.<br />
11. I was trying to keep up with traffic. Yes, I know there are no other cars around. That's how far ahead of me they are. <br />
12. When the Officer says &quot;Gee Son....Your eyes look red, have you been drinking?&quot; You probably shouldn't respond with,&quot;Gee Officer your eyes look glazed, have you been eating doughnuts?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Actually the bikes the Police departments use do cost pretty damn close to that.  There are safety concerns for the bikes they use as well as the custom equipment that they need.  I really do feel sorry for the poor saps that get this duty.  They will get laughed at (Especially by co-workers) <br />
Police Organizations don't do their own R&amp;D for bikes, they use whats out there already. The whole spirit of cycling these days is to build it stronger, stiffer, and lighter so the general market has them covered. Where I'm at (Tucson) cops bikes would cost a private citizen no more than probably $1800. Any special equipment they have would just be gear the dept would already have. I guarantee you whats already in the market is way better than what P.D.'s could come up with. <br />
<br />
The bike cops where I'm at ride Cannondale frames with a headshock and usually have a mix of LX and XT components. A full XT component group would run you in the range of about 700 I think. My mountain bike waaaaaaaay out-classes cop bikes.<br />
<br />
For the record, I personally don't like cops. I've been bullied by them and made to feel like the criminal when I was the victim. I know there are good cops out there but from what I can tell, they're all too busy letting chicks get off without a traffic ticket, at least in Tucson anyway.</div></div><hr />

Well my info is about 5 years old. But when I did the cost analysis for my employer on two bike sets for security we looked at EXACTLY what the local police department had.  The cost was $6000+ each. (Don't have acces to the exact number)  I don't know **** about bikes but that is what the department quoted us.  And no they don't do their own RD there are a couple of companies that specialize in it.  Perhaps nowadays the regular bikes have caught up with the standards.  <br />
<br />
One thing that was cool with looking at these is I got to try out a bike that the City of Woodinville in WA bought.  The had little motors on them that you could hit to haul ass up hills.  Damn thos things were cool!!</div></div><hr />

Oh, and and if you've had &quot;several encounters with cops&quot; you're probably doing something illegal. <br />
Well, talk about a blanket statement.<br />
<br />
I've had &quot;several encounters with cops&quot; and I've never done anything more illegal than break the speed limit - and that is infrequent.<br />
<br />
I met one Boulder detective who left me afraid of police for several years. He stalked me and my then-fiance, staked out our work and our apartment, called at all hours of the night, executed an illegal search of our apartment, and generally made life in Boulder hell for the two of us for four months, until we finally hired a lawyer who got him to stop. You see, he was sleeping with my finace's ex-girlfriend, and the two of them really tried to get us.<br />
<br />
Before that, I had weekly contact with police officers. My father was police commissioner of the town where we lived. Every Wednesday, an officer would stop by our house and drop off the police report for the week. Depending on which officer, he would sometimes come in for a cup of coffee and a snack. The chief of police lived in the house behind us, and his kids played with my brother almost every day. You would have thought that all those years of happy, healthy contact with police officers would have outweighed only four months with a corrupt officer, but somehow it didn't. By the time we moved out of Boulder, I was even scared of my home-town police who used to sit at my dining room table eating cookies.<br />
<br />
Only a few cops are lazy and/or corrupt, while most are in the job to actually help people, but somehow the bad leaves a much more definate impression than the good.</div></div><hr />

Part of the reason that I have little tolerance for police who don't live up to the standards expected of the public is that affects opinions like Screeling's.<br />
<br />
There isn't any possible way that he could have met every cop in Tucson, much less the state of Arizona or the US.   Yet his opinion of all police officers are tainted by his interaction with just a few.<br />
<br />
Feel fortunate that as a police officer I don't subscribe to that same philosophy, I would have to hate everyone.<br />
<br />
I filled out the purchase order for the bikes my Department uses and they cost $1100/each, fully equipped.  Maybe we're just frugal shoppers. ;)</div></div><hr />

Sort of like the &quot;blanket statement&quot; that sparked this entire debate - &quot;And cops get lazier&quot;.  The implication being that all police officers, everywehere are lazy, we all know they're lazy, and this contraption will just make them lazier than we already know they are.<br />

Well until that impression is gone so to will that stereotype remain and continue to be used... by non-cops as well as cops.<br />
<br />
And frankly at least here in Houston and the surrounding areas the bad impression seems pretty strong.<br />
<br />
When you got people like my wife who are afraid to pull over til she gets to a well lit and highly trafficed parking lot when the blue and red lights are flashing behind her because of several stories of cops raping women on little used roads.<br />
<br />
Or other news stories of cops holding women hostage in hotel rooms raping them til they then haul em off to jail for some minor infraction.<br />
<br />
Or cops who are off duty pulling their gun on folks in a bar over a disagreement or some foul language <br />
<br />
Or our famous reporter Marvin Zendler doing news reports on Police funding abuse and police avoiding crime ridden areas cause their afraid to do their job then that stigma of &quot;lazy cop&quot; will remain.<br />

Is it any wonder that there is an inherant distrust and dislike of police officers?<br />
<br />
Unless police organizations can start policing themselves over abusive employees then the public will continue to distrust and dislike them and make fun of them.<br />
<br />
Too often down here though we hear stories of cops getting let off with a slap on the wrist for something that an average citizen would've been jailed for.<br />
<br />
Sorry Saldrin I respect cops(well the good ones) for what they do but I don't trust them simply cause they have a badge.  And more over it seems lately cops are more interested in helping themselves than they are in helping the citizen they've sworn to protect.</div></div><hr />

I WANT a police force that is above disrepute(sp?).<br />

I WANT a police force that I can count on and that runs efficiently and makes good use of the funds we provide them.<br />

That is why I brought the whole Segway thing up in the first place.  The idea of blowing money on these things is silly in this profession.<br />

And furthermore the use of those Segway's promote the very Stereotype that Saldrin hates.<br />

Well until that impression is gone so to will that stereotype remain and continue to be used... by non-cops as well as cops.<br />
<br />
And frankly at least here in Houston and the surrounding areas the bad impression seems pretty strong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Post examples.  Link me stories showing how the every police officer in every police department in the greater Houston area is lazy, stupid, corrupt or deserving of any of the accusations you're throwing out here.  Link me stories showing me where the majority of police officers in the majority of police departments in the greater Houston area are stupid, lazy, corrupt or deserving of any of the accusations you're spewing here.   I want to see examples.  Since the &quot;problem&quot; is as rampant as you describe it should be fairly easy for you to give factual data to support your clains.<br />
<br />
You can't do it.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because your assertions are completely gratuitous<br />
<br />
<br />
When you got people like my wife who are afraid to pull over til she gets to a well lit and highly trafficed parking lot when the blue and red lights are flashing behind her because of several stories of cops raping women on little used roads<br />
<br />
Or other news stories of cops holding women hostage in hotel rooms raping them til they then haul em off to jail for some minor infraction.<br />
<br />
Or cops who are off duty pulling their gun on folks in a bar over a disagreement or some foul language<br />
<br />
Post me links.  Show me how if indeed these events have taken place, that you can in any way rightfully ascribe your negative opinion to every single police officer nationwide.<br />
<br />
You can't. (at least you can't and not come off sounding ignorant)<br />
<br />
I agree with Tolyn in that you need to contact your local police department, find out if they have a ride along program, or a citizen police academy, and enroll. <br />
<br />
Or our famous reporter Marvin Zendler doing news reports on Police funding abuse and police avoiding crime ridden areas cause their afraid to do their job then that stigma of &quot;lazy cop&quot; will remain.<br />
<br />
Tell me how the funding for a police department, provided by a separate governmental body makes the individual police officers &quot;corrupt&quot;?<br />
<br />
It doesn't.<br />
<br />
Unless police organizations can start policing themselves over abusive employees then the public will continue to distrust and dislike them and make fun of them.<br />
<br />
Police officers and police agencies are under closer scrutiny now than at any time.  Police hiring standards are higher now than they have ever been.  Tell me then what else needs to be done?  Are corrupt or abusive police officers, when caught, not disciplined - up to and including dismissal and/or criminal and civil trials?  They are.<br />
<br />
Too often down here though we hear stories of cops getting let off with a slap on the wrist for something that an average citizen would've been jailed for.<br />
<br />
Again, link me factual articles.  &quot;Stories&quot; are exactly that - &quot;stories&quot;.  Show me something to back up your claim that ALL police officers are corrupt, lazy, ignorant or otherwise incapable of doing their job.  Post me a link to articles showing where the majority of police officers, all over the United States are as you make them out to be.  <br />
<br />
You can't.<br />
<br />
Sorry Saldrin I respect cops(well the good ones) for what they do but I don't trust them simply cause they have a badge.  And more over it seems lately cops are more interested in helping themselves than they are in helping the citizen they've sworn to protect. <br />
<br />
No, you don't have any respect.  If you did, you'd know better than to impune every single police officer across the country for the conduct of a a few.<br />
<br />
&quot;And moreover it seems&quot; ?  Post me links.  Show me facts to support your assertions.  Gratuitous accusations have no merit.  The only thing you've shown in your posts are exactly that - gratuitous assertions based on unfounded opinions. <br />
<br />
.</div></div><hr />

No Tolyn if your a good cop stick it out and make the force better.<br />
<br />
Just realize you got an uphill battle in the arena of public opinion.<br />
<br />
For me personally I WANT a police force I can trust my wife or child with.<br />
<br />
I WANT a police force that is above disrepute(sp?).<br />
<br />
I WANT a police force that I can count on and that runs efficiently and makes good use of the funds we provide them.<br />
<br />
That is why I brought the whole Segway thing up in the first place.  The idea of blowing money on these things is silly in this profession.<br />
<br />
And furthermore the use of those Segway's promote the very Stereotype that Saldrin hates.<br />
<br />
I mean when my friends at the office read the article and glance at the photographs their reactions were all the same. &quot; What the hell?  Cops need to walk more as it is.  Why are we going to start rolling em around?&quot;<br />
<br />
So rather than Saldrin taking up an attitude with me perhaps he should really be taking up an attitude with the Atlanta PD for considering such an assanine device in this field. <br />
<br />
Again, did you READ the article, or just look at the pictures?<br />
<br />
In the CNN article, and in a related article on MSN - nowhere was it stated that the police department is paying for these things, or that the police department wanted them to begin with.  A thrid party, multi-county governmental agency is fudning the project.  This is NOT the police department doing this.  You continue to intentionally ignore this point to further your own misleading assertions.  <br />
<br />
The police department's use of the things is being TESTED for VERY LIMITED uses.  Some of which, when you actually READ the article - may have merit.  Note: &quot;may&quot; being one of the key words here -  &quot;testing&quot; being the other.<br />
<br />
Nowhere in these articles does it state that these things are going to be general issue to police officers anywhere who normally work on a walking or bicycle type beat.<br />
<br />
Therefore - no - it doesn't support your opinion that &quot;cops&quot; are lazy.<br />
<br />
Show me an article where the FOP president in the area is, or has lobbied demanding the issue of Segway scooters to the police department because the officers are complaining that they have to walk.   If that were the case, your opinion may have merit.  Unfortunately for you - the &quot;proof&quot; you've posted just doesn't hold up to scrutiny.</div></div><hr />

I said the impression police officers have promoted (whether purposefully or accidental) has been that they are.  Its an impression i.e. not the real thing i.e. an image presented from a partial or blurred source.<br />
<br />
More over you want sources that indicate police abuse and why a growing number of the public distrusts police?<br />
<br />
Try this:  policeabuse.org (http://www.policeabuse.org/index1.html)<br />
<br />
Its amazing how many stories just on the front of cops dropping charges or not showing up for court when they hear that they were taped.  Seem a little fishy?<br />
<br />
Though Marvin Zendler and other reporters have done more recent investigations which have founded police corruption the one that made Zendler's career was the bust of the &quot;Best little whore house in Texas&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not only did the cops there know about the whore house the Sherrif was dating the proprietress of the establishment and receiving other &quot;favors&quot; for it.<br />
<br />
As far as the cop raping a woman in her hotel room that happened about two weeks ago however HoustonChronicle.com has a subscription fee for their archives so I can't reaccess the story which I first saw on TV.<br />
<br />
Sandlin the reports of police abuse are nothing new.  Don't act like they somehow don't exist.  And furthermore don't put words into my mouth and claim that I said ALL cops are like this.<br />
<br />
I think through this ENTIRE thread I've said good cops have my respect and bad cops don't and ALL cops I'm distrustful of due to the few but impacting bad cops.<br />
<br />
You have what I'm assuming is a fellow cop from Oregon saying the same thing.<br />
<br />
You have Myrea a housewife relating her experience and perceptions.<br />
<br />
So it isn't just my word on this.  There is a large PERCEPTION whether its right or wrong that cops are to be distrusted.<br />
<br />
Normally I'm jumping hoops all over the place defending them.  Just ask Kullaas when he and I get into over it &quot;Rights being restricted&quot; during this terrorist thing.<br />
<br />
I don't see why you feel the need to bring what is appearing to me a pompous defensive voice to a subject meant to be partially lighthearted and partially aimed at stopping public waste.<br />
<br />
And you have totally failed to address ANY of my arguments about the usage of Stereotyping in relation to Jobs in general or the fact that other COPS have used the EXACT same stereotype I used.<br />
<br />
Nor have you addressed my argument that Cops USE Stereotyping in their line of work to assess a situation.<br />
<br />
Cmon Saldrin I've got several arguments sitting there to be rebuffed.  You don't need to go out and make up things I didn't say.<br />
<br />
So I have to ask you are cops special in that they can make fun of cop stereotypes but average citizens can't?<br />
<br />
If that is what you think then I guess it shouldn't surprise me as I've had experiences with cops who think they are above the average citizen.<br />
<br />
In otherwords get off your high horse cause I seriously doubt your blameless or even remorseful over using stereotypes yourself.  Especially since so much cop work is about scoping out &quot;potential&quot; problems based upon PRECONCIEVED ideas.</div></div><hr />

I said the impression police officers have promoted (whether purposefully or accidental) has been that they are.  Its an impression i.e. not the real thing i.e. an image presented from a partial or blurred source.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that you're talking out of both sides of your mouth.  You make a &quot;concession&quot; and then you take it right back.  When you say things like &quot;the impression police officers have promoted you're making a wide sweeping generalization that impunes all police officers.  When you say things like that, the impression created is that you are in fact, impuning ALL police officers.  If that isn't your intent - be more careful with the language you choose.<br />
<br />
More over you want sources that indicate police abuse and why a growing number of the public distrusts police?<br />
<br />
Try this:  policeabuse.org (http://www.policeabuse.org/index1.html)<br />
<br />
Its amazing how many stories just on the front of cops dropping charges or not showing up for court when they hear that they were taped.  Seem a little fishy?<br />
<br />
I've never said that there weren't police officers who were corrupt,  or who were indeed &quot;fat, dumb and stupid&quot;.  My point is, what percentage of the population of police officers at large do these cases represent?  Can we say &quot;miniscule&quot;?<br />
<br />
I'll go back to my previous example,  there are many examples of african-americans who commit crimes. Does that mean that its justifiable to label all, or most blacks as criminals that we should be afraid of?  I think we both agree that it doesn't.  Why then is it Ok to do the same to the hundreds of thousands of police officers nationwide who go about their jobs earnestly every day?  It doesn't.<br />
<br />
That is my issue with you.   <br />
<br />
Though Marvin Zendler and other reporters have done more recent investigations which have founded police corruption the one that made Zendler's career was the bust of the &quot;Best little whore house in Texas&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not only did the cops there know about the whore house the Sherrif was dating the proprietress of the establishment and receiving other &quot;favors&quot; for it.<br />
<br />
As far as the cop raping a woman in her hotel room that happened about two weeks ago however HoustonChronicle.com has a subscription fee for their archives so I can't reaccess the story which I first saw on TV.<br />
<br />
Again, justify for me how this incident impunes the work, for example,  of any of the New York City police officers who died trying to save people in the World Trade Center?  <br />
<br />
What you're doing by asserting the opinions you have is a huge disservice to their memories, and an equally huge disservice to those who work in law enforcement nationwide who do their jobs honestly and earnestly every single day.<br />
<br />
That is my problem with your opinions in this thread.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Sandlin the reports of police abuse are nothing new.  Don't act like they somehow don't exist.  And furthermore don't put words into my mouth and claim that I said ALL cops are like this.<br />
<br />
Show me where I've said that abuse in law enforcement doesn't exist?  Show me where I've said that corruption in law enforcement agencies doesn't exist?<br />
<br />
I haven't<br />
<br />
What I've stated ad nauseam is that the percentage of the whole of law enforcement officers nationwide is miniscule, and that its improper and unjust to malign the whole for the actions of a few.<br />
<br />
As for putting words in your mouth - I've done no such thing.  I've let you do all your speaking for you - I don't need to help.  For example:<br />
<br />
I think through this ENTIRE thread I've said good cops have my respect and bad cops don't and ALL cops I'm distrustful of due to the few but impacting bad cops.<br />
<br />
Here we have you, again, talking out of both sides of your mouth.  You claim first that &quot;good cops have your respect&quot;, but then turn right around and say that you're going to hold &quot;ALL&quot; cops accountable for the actions of a few.  I'm presuming that &quot;ALL&quot; includes the ones you deem as &quot;good&quot;.  /boggle<br />
<br />
You have what I'm assuming is a fellow cop from Oregon saying the same thing.<br />
<br />
You have Myrea a housewife relating her experience and perceptions.<br />
<br />
So it isn't just my word on this.  There is a large PERCEPTION whether its right or wrong that cops are to be distrusted.<br />
<br />
What I see Tolyn saying is that while there are bad cops out there, the number is few and that one shouldn't apply those stereotypes to police officers in general.  He admits that people DO do that and is frustrated by it.  Not to &quot;put words in his mouth&quot;, but that's the impression.<br />
<br />
I see Myrea relating one bad incident with an individual police officer, then relating others that are positiive.  She concludes by saying:  &quot;Only a few cops are lazy and/or corrupt, while most are in the job to actually help people, but somehow the bad leaves a much more definate impression than the good.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't see her trying to justify the fact that its ok to impugn &quot;all&quot; police officers over the actions of a few.  <br />
<br />
Normally I'm jumping hoops all over the place defending them.  Just ask Kullaas when he and I get into over it &quot;Rights being restricted&quot; during this terrorist thing.<br />
<br />
I don't see why you feel the need to bring what is appearing to me a pompous defensive voice to a subject meant to be partially lighthearted and partially aimed at stopping public waste.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that police officers are people too then, and that they have rights as well.  Including a right to not be judged a certain way based on the actions of a few people.<br />
<br />
And you have totally failed to address ANY of my arguments about the usage of Stereotyping in relation to Jobs in general or the fact that other COPS have used the EXACT same stereotype I used.<br />
<br />
Nor have you addressed my argument that Cops USE Stereotyping in their line of work to assess a situation.<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can find a copy of a paper I wrote for a college english course a few years ago.  The topic I chose was a condemnation of  &quot;racial profiling&quot;.  This was before the topic was even being discussed in the news.  When I find it (got an A by the way ;)), I'll copy it here for your perusal.  Nowhere will you find a more staunch supporter of peoples' civil rights than with me. <br />
<br />
Cmon Saldrin I've got several arguments sitting there to be rebuffed.  You don't need to go out and make up things I didn't say.<br />
<br />
Again, I've not made up anything you've said.  You've made it perfectly clear that you have a distinct double standard when it comes to your opinions about police officers.  I don't need to &quot;make up things&quot; for you.<br />
<br />
As to your various &quot;arguments&quot;, I'm not addressing them because they're not relevant to my point.  That being, again, that its not proper to judge any group of people, based on the actions of a few.  That applies to any group based on race, religion, class, ethnic background or profession.<br />
<br />
So I have to ask you are cops special in that they can make fun of cop stereotypes but average citizens can't?<br />
<br />
If that is what you think then I guess it shouldn't surprise me as I've had experiences with cops who think they are above the average citizen.<br />
<br />
See my comment above.  Yet again we have you ascribing qualities to me based on your preconcieved prejudices.  <br />
<br />
In otherwords get off your high horse cause I seriously doubt your blameless or even remorseful over using stereotypes yourself.  Especially since so much cop work is about scoping out &quot;potential&quot; problems based upon PRECONCIEVED ideas. <br />
<br />
I'll get off mine, when you get off yours.  You say I'm &quot;putting words in your mouth&quot; and then you have the unmitigated gall to accuse me of improprieties on the job?  Who exactly sir, the **** do you think you are?  You don't know me, you don't know my work.  This is a perfect example of my point.  You assume certain attitudes and behaviours of me and then you even have the gall to imply improper conduct my part?  Then to take it a step further to assume that when I do (allegedly) engage in such conduct I'm &quot;remorseless&quot;??????<br />
<br />
I'll thank you to retract that one until you've ridden with me in a cruiser and watched me do my job.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: and, again, just to clarify - as I stated previously I am not currently employed as an active police officer.  I was from 1988 to 1993 and am now working as a police dispatcher, working on getting back out there on the street.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fine then I'll get off my high horse.<br />
<br />
But I'll continue to use Stereotypes and I'll continue to distrust cops and your attitude here has done little to gain that trust.<br />
<br />
You call me a liar (heard that before when dealing with a cop and it later cost me my friend and that cop his job)  and you plant false testimony in your arguments claiming I say things I didn't (again nothing surprising there).<br />
<br />
Seems to me that the very things you don't want cops to be known for you yourself are guilty of even in an off duty forum.<br />
<br />
So you can bugger off for all I care cause your a part of the problem.  Even if you don't actively engage in these bad activities you seem all to eager to flambast people who want to hold the cops accountable for bad practices and ignore the bad facets of the force.<br />
<br />
Your so hung up on your image and ego that you can't see the original intent of this thread for what it was.  It was a satire poking fun at a program that is wasteful using an icon people would relate to (like satires do) to try and polarize people against this sort of thing.<br />
<br />
But hey I'm showing Anti-cop sentiment by stopping the you all from getting useless toy.<br />
<br />
I need to be put down and put in line.<br />
<br />
Get lost Saldrin... its the ones who cry loudest about respect for a position they hold that deserve the least respect.<br />
<br />
Note I don't see too many people siding with you on this save your troll fiancee so it obviously must not be all that big a deal that I happened to use this particular stereotype this time.  Maybe its because they too have had or seen the very same stereotype that was presented.<br />
<br />
You claim its not widespread in the force but just about everyone I know has had some story of a lazy cop or a cop convention at a donut store or a Bubba cop with the beer belly shades and cowboy hat(probably different stereotype in other states but I think you get the idea).<br />
<br />
More over with stories of cops planting evidence, being abusive and corrupt becoming more common in the media how ELSE is the public supposed to react?<br />
<br />
Why SHOULD we trust you?  Your just another human, subject to the same desires and greed everybody else is.  Why should we trust you?  <br />
<br />
Especially since your armed and the average person isn't.  You have the ability to force your will on people and we have no way of responding.  Your unchecked.  Your dangerous.<br />
<br />
And while 99% of cops might be decent good folks 1%(and I would wager that is a low estimate) are bad.<br />
<br />
That means a 1 in 100 chance that you will meet a bad cop, and over the course of a lifetime I'd say people will deal with cops probably around 10 to 20 times average so if we picked the low end of that...<br />
<br />
10 people averaging 10 encounters = 100 encounters over a lifetime and 1% of that means it will land on 1 out of every 10 people's encounters which means 1 out of 10 people  may be affected by a bad cop.<br />
<br />
Its kinda like getting zeros in school.<br />
<br />
You can have 2 tests scored at 100% and 1 test scored at 0% and you still fail the class.<br />
<br />
That negative impact hurts doesn't it?  <br />
<br />
So instead of wasting your energy on me in these boards why don't you try doing something to correct the problems in the force since YOU probably more than anyone else on this board except fellow cops have a better chance of affecting change than us.</div></div><hr />

You need to reread the thread though, you'll see people supporting exactly what I'm saying.<br />

So yeah, I'll go on and do my job as best I can and judge people as individuals.  You go on and perpetuate your prejudices.<br />

Just next time you, or one of your famliy is in trouble and needs help - don't call those horrible police officers that you can't trust.<br />

Sorry if you're too blinded by your own anti-police rhetoric to see that as fair.<br />
<br />
Of course, YOU could always try and &quot;make a difference&quot; to right the &quot;wrongs&quot; you see everywhere and become a police officer yourself.  <br />

Well my info is about 5 years old. But when I did the cost analysis for my employer on two bike sets for security we looked at EXACTLY what the local police department had.  The cost was $6000+ each. (Don't have acces to the exact number)  I don't know **** about bikes but that is what the department quoted us.  And no they don't do their own RD there are a couple of companies that specialize in it.  Perhaps nowadays the regular bikes have caught up with the standards. <br />
Thats insane. My current mountain bike I've spent only about $2600 on and its quite a bit higher quality than cop bikes in Tucson. Those quotes must have been for full suspension titanium frames, full XTR drivetrain (which it is the highest), and just about every over-priced component on the market. The technology is a little cheaper these days, but even 5 years ago, I'd be hard-pressed to spend a full $6000 on my dream mountain bike. That had to have been full retail price on EVERY component on the bike.<br />

<br />
I wasn't going to add to this thread, lurkers always fear getting flamed, but I would like to let it be known that I support Saldrin's point of view.  Intentionally perpetuating an incorrect (for the vast majority of police officers) stereotype is something I feel is wrong.<br />
<br />
I would just like to add I have nothing but respect for the men and women of law enforcement. They put their lives on the line for us. (even the one who gave me a ticket a few months back :))</div></div><hr />

We have Telu in the red corner, somehow working in the fact that a bad cop lost his job and got your friend killed, in the &quot;You called me a liar&quot; sentence.<br />

but on the other hand if everyone was nice to each other cops wouldnt be needed anyways<br />
<br />
let he who is without sin cast the first stone or in other words if you have ever used a dumb blonde joke or a drunken irishman joke or looked a teenager listening to his discman and thought to yourself lazy bum stupid punk or whatever then you have no reason to attack people saying that they are stereotyping espetially when the original idea of the thread was simply from a humor point of view<br />
<br />
the thing I find funny about this article is that if a cop on one of these has to chase a fleeing suspect he will have to leave his scooter behind and somone will probably steal it. <br />
<br />
seriously though theres no point in flaming one another even if telumehtar had said that cops are lazy bums and he had ment it.<br />
<br />
call me a troll a lurker a rabid squirrel whatever I just dont see the point in so much pointless flaming of each other<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caan</div><div class="date">04-30-2002, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off I want to say that I am not entirely anti-cop.   I have met and dealt with many cops who have helped my family and I and an instance where thanks to a cop my friends and I were let off with a warning instead of jail time.<br />
<br />
The problem with the arguement that the cop is making is saying that only a small percentage of cops are corrupt.   This is very true and there is no evidence to disprove this but the fact that most people will come in contact with a cop say maybe 5 times(just a random number) and the chance that you will come in contact with a corrupt cop or one who even bends the truth a bit is a decent chance.   This in itself isn't a horrible thing but the fact that cops have so much power is where the problem lies.   A cop can have you arrested or let people off that do commit crimes that are dangerous easily, which can chance your life forever.<br />
<br />
My personal experience with cops has been a somewhat positive one mainly from the fact that my friends and I haven't been caught doing anything illegal.   But even with this in mind I can think of many times were a cop's decision could have easily ruined someone's life that was totally innocent.   Here are a few examples of this.<br />
<br />
The first is during a soccer game we had a particularly bad ref that allowed someone on my team to get kicked a couple times in the face and he did nothing about it.   This led to an arguement between the ref and a friend's father on the team who was a cop.   The ref was an idiot and attempted to use his power of being a ref to make my teammate's father back down.   Unfortunantly for the ref this kid's father was a cop and to deal with this situation the cop simply pulled his gun out of the car and basically said something to the effect of &quot;who has the power now&quot;.   Luckily the arguement stopped there as park officials and parents got into the arguement but this situation could have been worse.   This cop obviously abused his power and should have been punished for it, since any normal citizen that pulls a gun on someone will get in trouble with the law when reported.   Instead of the cop getting in trouble his buddies laughed about it and dropped all the charges.<br />
<br />
Another incident is of a friend's brother who has been stopped for a DUI 2 times now and I am sure will be stopped many more times.   He is obviously a threat on the road since he drives drunk and continues to drive drunk but instead of him recieving a punishment he just paid the cops off both times.   The worst he had to do was spend a night in jail because his parents were mad and would not pay off the cop till the next day.   Of course none of this is on his record so he has been let off scot free.<br />
<br />
I know of many incidents very similar to the ones above but don't really want to type them out.   These have all happened as a typical teenager who has relatively calm frineds.   None of us have been arrested and we tend to participate in very little illegal activity.  So if someone else tries to make the point that well I am just someone who is doing something to get in trouble that is not true at all.    The only time I have even talked to a cop due to a wrongdoing is for my speeding ticket and the stealing incident at the mall which I didn't have anything to do, just guilty by association.<br />
<br />
Also I think it is ironic that the cop on this thread(sorry didn't remember your name) is talking about generalizations.   I have many friends who are not white and know many adults who have never fit the typical description of normal and believe me they are much more likely to get questioned by a cop, and I have witnessed this many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually folks Saldrin and I let this drop and basically shook hands and made up.<br />
<br />
We both agreed we were pigheaded, stubborn, and hyper-sensitive and we both agreed that we probably took this to the most extreme absurdity.<br />
<br />
Do I think all cops are bad or lazy?  No<br />
Do I think some are?  Yes<br />
<br />
Have I had personal experiences with bad cops that has tainted them in my mind somewhat.  Yup<br />
<br />
Have I had good experiences with cops that force me to give them the benefit of a doubt?  Yes (including Saldrin here on this thread).<br />
<br />
Do I think stereotypes are a bad thing?  In some cases yes but in most not really.  Saldrin would obviously disagree but differences are what make us all unique.<br />
<br />
At any rate Saldrin and I in another thread decided to pretty much let this one slide so don't hype it up more than your thinking cause to be honest I'm going to wager that Saldrin and I probably come out more on the same side of things than on opposite sides.  Only time and flame wars will tell.</div></div><hr />
