<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To those who know me (and even those who don't),<br />
<br />
The time has come for me to leave the world of Norrath. For the past 2-½ years I have logged in to play EQ almost every day. I have immersed myself into its content and tried to learn every nuance of the characters that I chose to play. Some may say that I was obsessed with EQ and perhaps they are right. I never considered myself addicted to the game but did often find that it consumed my thoughts for long periods of time. <br />
<br />
So why am I leaving all this behind? I got to this point in a very unassuming way. For a while, I had been a bit frustrated with the game and the time I had to commit to it. I found it harder and harder to find blocks of time large enough for any real accomplishment in the game. This relegated most of my time in Norrath to meandering, buffing newbies and Bazaar browsing. This grows old quick. A break was brewing…<br />
<br />
About five weeks ago I decided to begin work on some household projects that I had been putting off for far too long. I worked my tail off during this time and found the end product very satisfying and rewarding. One project led to another and before I knew it I hadn’t really played EQ in about a month. I was ready to start playing consistently again but, much to my surprise, found myself with no real burning ambition to come back.<br />
<br />
One major contributing factor was that what I desired for my characters far exceeded the amount of time I could put into them. I fell behind. Not “behind” in relation to my friend’s and guildmate’s advancements but rather “behind” in what the game could offer. What I mean is, they were introducing new features into the game faster than I could take advantage of them. AA points, LDoN points and flags to unlock new zones. Soon, with another expansion in the works, there will be Raid points to acquire, a whole host of new AA’s and new spells that I will feel self-obligated to acquire. <br />
<br />
I am the sort of person that wants to be at the top. With any game I've ever played, I like to develop my characters with a loving touch, crafting them into perfection. I don’t mind working my butt off to get there, but the &quot;finish line&quot;, so to speak, is getting further away rather than getting closer. I realize my characters will never be as good as I desire them to be. I can no longer see or smell the carrot dangling at the end of the pole and I think this will only lead to a heightened frustration further down the line.<br />
<br />
So after thinking long and hard about it, I think perhaps it is time to let it go.<br />
<br />
So what is to become of Kashale and Muerta? I want to let you know that I will NOT be “E-baying” them. The last thing Norrath needs is another inept Shaman getting good folks killed. Instead, I will just let them quietly fade into digital oblivion. As “real” as they seemed to be when I was playing them I realize they are just bits and bytes. Bits and bytes that I have invested a disgusting amount of time into. Between Kashale and Muerta alone (forgetting a handful of low level twinks) I have logged 100 days played. I don’t regret a single one of them.<br />
<br />
So that is that. All good things must come to an end. You may see me online periodically over the next few weeks in an effor to try and say goodbye to some old friends and to tie up loose ends. I wish you all the best!<br />
<br />
Safe travels,<br />
<br />
Kash</div></div><hr />

GL with RL, it's not all bad :)<br />
<br />
One word of advise from someone who has taken one long and a few short breaks from EQ since April 1999 (and seen conuntless people leave the game &quot;for good&quot; only to come back later): Don't delete or give away your items unless you can easily replace them. Magelo is currently down, so it may be a moot point if your gear is mostly NO DROP, but there is no harm in mentioning it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Take care and be well Kash, I hope you continue to enjoy life's rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just remember, once an addict always an addict. Do your self a favor and actually DELETE your characters. Short of that, nothing else will stop you from coming back. Believe me...I know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can I have your stuff?<br />
<br />
Enjoy RL. It rocks sometimes.</div></div><hr />
