but....<br />
<br />
if you have noticed there seems to be a TON of uber high lvl gear out there that keeps poping up. do you think that they are paving the way for planes of power?<br />
<br />
and if they are PoP sounds like it will be hard as hell with chest peices that have an ac of 80 plus stat buffs up the wazoo<br />
( everquest.allakhazam.com/...item=12425 )<br />
<br />
and this is just one example. either way it looks like it will be a fun place to die<br />

<br />
Instead of adding content to the game to increase your enjoyment they have to satisfy you with better and better equipment.<br />
<br />
Sad but true, just look at the last few releases... PoP will just be another lot of the same old zones with uber equipment for the uber guilds.<br />
<br />
I say add some gameplay content!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya add some content i would like that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lagger has a good point...but I would add that most eq'ers are crap AD&amp;D players.<br />
<br />
Any random GM event usually ends up with several people trying to talk to the GM and roleplay, while there are several other people attacking him to see what phat lewtz he drops.<br />
<br />
When Kunark came out they developed dungeons that were meant to be 'crawled'...loot could drop off of any random creature, and the entrance wasn't the same as the exit.  A group goes in, battles it's way to the end, and heads back to the taverns for a beer.  Most of those dungeons stand empty, with only a few pharmers, or a group camped at the entrance.<br />
<br />
It's a two way street :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Every expansion has seen more phat lewts. RoK made old world items obsolete. SoV made RoK armor this way. SoL same thing. <br />
<br />
They have said that in PoP they are trying to get back to the smaller group focus of the game, where a good 6 man group can do well. Granted while there will be some large encounters that will require large level events etc etc.<br />
<br />
Who knows... I fugure that some zones (planes) will be very easy.. some will be very very hard and require yet another time since to get into. Sort of like every expansion before it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Put the stuffs into the old world first before milking from more expansion.  You know.. making it dynamic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">But also, in all respects to VI, the so called dungeons don't drop loot as you crawl through them.  NO DROP quest pieces may drop of the 200+ mobs but the only *loot* usually drops from the 1-2 Named mobs that *may* not even be up and killable because of a random PH.  I think this mechanic of the Norrath world is what has caused mob camping and farming to begin with whereas a place like COM for example has a chance for all the mobs to drop Wu's Stick, Wraith Hammer etc which doesn't get many farmers at all if any.  The boss mobs are quest related mostly in that zone too.<br />
<br />
Only your hardcore roleplayer or fantasy gamer will crawl through a 3+hour dungeon only to come out with NO DROP quest loot.<br />
<br />
My favorite crawls are Dalnir's and OS Emporer from RH.  Seems to be a steady flow of mobs with a good challenge.  Well they used to be :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The old zones aren't really dynamic are they?  I never really thought about this.  Ya old zones get revamped now and then, but for the most part - it's the same old content.<br />
<br />
Interesting....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The best thing with each new expansion is that i can put another stat buff on page 50 of my spellbook.<br />
<br />
Dex, str and agi are already back there. Stamina is getting dangerously close of ending up there too. In the end I know only charisma will be on my main page. Dear old charisma, never let me down, ay!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am hopeful VI will deliver on the promise to have POP zones designed for casual players in a 6 person group, with features like the automatic evac of your corpse to the graveyard by the entrance.  Currently, the casual player has a tough time experiencing much of the end game content.  What can you do in 2-3 hours in the 50's except solo or exp group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PoP is just gonna be more of the same old item inflation. Verant's idea of expansions is to make encounters that a guild at the previous expansion's max level of acheivement cant beat, so they have to spend the next 5-6 months gathering the 'new, improved gear' to do the uber mob that quads for double what the next oldest expansion's uber mob did. This means that as a player, your motivation is to always get a better item for slot X or slot Y.<br />
<br />
EQ is a game that has item acquisition as it's primary focus. This is the way it's always been, and I cant forsee it changing. Maybe EQ2 or SWG will be different. Hopefully games like Shadowbane, where the focus is less on items and more on politics and personal interactions with other players, will be more pleasant to play for the non-raid type players.</div></div><hr />
