<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've never hunted Sol B before, and besides Blackburrow in my early shammy days haven't done much dungeon fighting at all.  Can anyone offer some advice on both tactics and spell uses here?<br />
<br />
My biggest question is which resists/protection spells I will need that are currently buried in the back of my spell book.  I'll tell you what I usually keep memmed (my usual hunting is against giants), I'm sure I'm going to need to make some drastic changes here.<br />
<br />
Togors<br />
Dot (usually Scourage)<br />
DD or Dot (Blizard Blast or Venom of Snake)<br />
Root<br />
Cani<br />
Chloro/Alacrity/Ex Fatigue<br />
G Healing<br />
Sow / group Sow<br />
<br />
Buffs I work thru the Sow slot after I've sow'd everyone include HP, AC, Str, Sta, Agi.  Dex proc's off my gauntlets.  What resists or protections do I need to figure on adding into this buffing cycle, and what cures will i need to have handy from these mobs?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice, and happy hunting to you all,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Solb isnt a safe place to solo.  Some of the Kobold will have sow on them. If you dont kill them while they are rooted best shout TRAIN TO ZONE.  They will run straight to the bats and LDC.  If you do go. Make sure you keep root up and pet at your side.  I used pet slow VoS and root. I did ok  but you will have better luck doing some spirocs or bloodgills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not looking to solo here, but thanks for that advice.  Just curious, where are spirocs and bloodgills?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Filoranae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been in Sol B for about 10 days now, and this is awesome experience for the mid 40s.  Went there at 45, and hit 48 in 8 days.  That dungeon exp bonus definately helps.  While tanks may be LFG for 30 minutes or more, as a healer you will almost always find a group as soon as you walk into the zone.<br />
<br />
At 48 the Kobolds in KPC are a mix of lt blue and dk blue, but i'm still getting a blue of exp every 40 minutes or so.  Bat groups are even better, and although I've only been in one SS / LDC group ( MUST have a cleric along here, shaman heals aren't enough to keep the group alive) the exp there was even better.  You'll be healing and buffing mostly, slow's aren't much help at least in the parts i've fought - the aggro they draw isn't worth the damage they offset, since most groups will outtank the beasts easily.  Keep a dot or dd mem'd, along with root if there is no chanter to mez.  But if you're healing / buffing 5 melee (and this will happen, monks, rangers, pallys and SK's seem to love this zone) you won't have much mana left for offense.  My typical spell set up is root/DD/Buff/Alacrity/Cani/Chloro/G Heal/Gate.  <br />
<br />
I've won 2 bracers on rolls (+5 Wis), and several nice non shammy items to sell or trade.   So, the loot isn't terrible.<br />
<br />
Sol B, in short, is an excellent exp zone for those who like to group and aren't afraid of dungeons.  Sow before entering as it's an indoor zone, and drop gate into your sow slot for a fast escape - yes, the trains can be deadly.  And if you're going to die, do it at the camp and not running into some out of the way - wrong turn - cubbyhole where no one will find your corpse for a week.  Plenty of monks in zone most times as there is a nice monk quest item that drops here, so if do die you can find one to pull your corpse to the zone or to a cleric with little trouble.  Enjoy the fast pulls and non stop killing, and watch your exp. bar move.<br />
<br />
Happy Hunting,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i was hunting in solb at 32- in a grp at the round room and window area.  Everything was red. and i died loads but the exp was awesome nad was incredible fun.<br />
<br />
With regard to soloing this zone- i recomendtrying this from lvl 40 upwards to 45 .<br />
<br />
First off make sure u have the maps of sol a and b printed off!<br />
<br />
make a few shrink potions, and bind at the zone.<br />
<br />
Go through sol a and zone into sol b<br />
<br />
summon a pet and move down to the first mini room. medd up.<br />
<br />
ther are 2 spwns in this corridor but u can pull mobs from the window area with slow- assuming its not camped.<br />
<br />
After 44 u can camp the area past the window area- just make sure u can run to the aol a zone by memory!  This eacape route will save ur butt many a time- as the main exit is awful to get out of with a large race.<br />
<br />
at 45 u may want to move to velks, or karnors, and join a grp- all my shammy career i found i got into dungeons 5 lvls earlier than the ave tank, due to our buffing aboilty.  but then i am insane  i was in velks at 40 and was grped for 3 hrs-  i think they were too busy giggling at me to care )<br />
<br />
on second thoughts dont ever go to velks for exp cos its crap!!!<br />
<br />
just spent 5 lvls in droga and the place rocks!!</div></div><hr />
