The shaman community has its newest oracle!  Ding 60!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">noob 65 is the cap now your accomplishment means nothing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, Red.  Way to be a dick!  Gratz, Mulsis.  Ignore the idiot above.  60 IS a major accomplishment.  With 60 (assuming torpor and malo ;) ) lots of new things are now possible!  65 won't be far behind either!  You've got the hard part done.  61-65 is much easier!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You know, whenever i see anything by redspeed, i have to wonder to myself...<br />
<br />
1. Is he being a dick as an attempt at humour?<br />
2. Is he just a dick?<br />
<br />
I should make this a poll.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Grats to Mulsis!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">does this board also have an ignore function?  <br />
I have him on ignore in the serverwide.crucible channel. <br />
<br />
Grats Mulsis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">actually it does Lan.<br />
<br />
click on the USER CP button, then below it on the bar is &quot;Edit Ignore List&quot;<br />
<br />
You just type there the name of the person you would like to ignore.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grats Mulsis :)<br />
<br />
I agree with Chutoi you can have a lot of fun at 60 that you would never have thought possible at 59 ;)</div></div><hr />

Guess he just proved himself a liar.<br />
<br />
Yeh...it's time he's added to /ignore permanently.<br />
<br />
Grats on your achievement Mulsis. Not everyone does what you've just done (I'm living proof :)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Grats!<br />
<br />

I don't know how to explain what redspeed said, but in channel redspeed really isn't an ass, just people likle Arianna e.t.c. may make him mad because of their snobbishness e.t.c. IE once something was asked and I said your not special enough (Arianna) and she went and linked me a piece of uber gear most people in the channel will nevever have (including me). Linking your gear is fine, but special or not suck or whatever i said doesn't mean gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grats on 60 :)  It is a big dead. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Ignore does work here I have that wanker Chlorolast on ignore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kareck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Grats on 60 it is an accomplishment!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">L51 you get a new title.  L55 you get a new title.  L60 you get a new title.  L61-65 you can easily do in a week or so of half-ass exping and you will only have spells for 61 &amp; 62.  Hitting 60 means that you have indeed cleared the hump and are in sight of an easy finish to levelling.<br />

Congratulations Mulsis!! :)</div></div><hr />
