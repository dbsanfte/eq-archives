<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I've been thinking along a different route, that there are several areas of heals:  Complete, Fast, Group, HoT.  Without even comparing AA or focus effects, just to keep it clear in my mind, I made the following list.<br />
<br />
Clerics by far are the king of the CH, slow 10 second casting, huge 7500 hp for 400 mana.  Druids are 2nd with KR 10 second 4680 hp for 600 mana.  Shamans being 3rd with KM 10 second 1950 hp for 400 mana.  Asside from certain AA abilites (LOH for Pallies), thats pretty much it for the CH's.<br />
<br />
Fast heals, well many classes have that.  Clerics on top again with SL at 3.75 seconds, 2750 hp for 600 mana.  Druids NI 3.75 second 1750 hp for 500 mana.  Shamans have TM 3.75 seconds 1300 hp for 450 mana Paladins have LoN 1 second 850 hp for 400 mana or ToN 5 second 1125 hp for 450 mana.  Rangers and Beast have Chloroblast 3 seconds 428 hp for 175 mana.<br />
<br />
Group heals are again many classes, but no Shaman here.  Clerics being kings again with WoR at 4.5 seconds for 2500 HP each member (plus a cure) for 1100 mana.  Paladins WoM 3 second (30 sec recharge) 900 hp for each member for 850 mana.<br />
<br />
Heal over time is another area.  Clerics having SE at 4 seconds for 500 per tick, 4 ticks, 2000 total for 400 mana.  Shamans have Q 6 seconds at 300 per tick for 4 ticks, 1200 hp for 200 mana.  Paladins get SC at 1.5 seconds 225 per tick, 4 ticks, 900 hp for 300 mana.  Regen type abilities are so low per tick that I just ignored them.<br />
<br />
Group heal over time.  Clerics have EE at 5 seconds for 300 per tick, 4 ticks, 1200 total for 1050 mana.  Beasts get an AA PoS giving 1200 hp and 480 mana over 36 seconds.<br />
<br />
Without a doubt, Clerics are on top in all catagories as well they should be.  Their hybrid, Palladins have formitable heals as well.  So do druids and shamans, seeing as they (we) are priest classes.<br />
<br />
With 4 different catagories of heals (CH, HoT, FH, GH), I wonder how feesable it would be for the Devs to simply divide up who is master of what.  Make sure that Clerics don't get stepped on, or druids don't lose their desirability in groups, but so that each one of the 3 (4 if you count Pallies) are really really good at 1 area and decent in another.  Give shamans a group heal?  or a HoT for 500 hp per tick that aa and foci increase?<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
