<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hard missions have alot less named and Normals drop alot less pp and gems.. think they ninja nerfed it last morning at 5am with a 15minute shut down of LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Swiftfisted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If this is true that's BS.  On normal missions it was extremely nice to be able to walk away with 300-400pp per person, I really don't see that unbalancing or unreasonable.  Get exp, and a little side pp???  nawwwww.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">THe number of named monsters has dropped a LOT in the Normal adventures as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not only that I noticed a serious decline in the amount of exp I used to get.<br />
<br />
When I first started doing missions I would get 10% in exp generally from completing a mission now I only am getting 5% and it sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its all anquedotal.  People &quot;see&quot; patterns in things that never had a patern at all.  Unless someone does some parsing I am uninterested in claims that the game has changed because they feel it has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've done alot of adventures so far, and I can say that this is probably BS.  Alot of times there is only one or two named in the dungeon, this seems to be the most typical case.   Then sometimes there are no named, and a few times we had 3 or 4 named in the dungeon.<br />
<br />
My take is that it's completely random, and you just got unlucky.  There's no reason for them to nerf the dungeons this soon after the expansion came out...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A guildmate this afternoon sent a message along the lines of this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, 4 named in one adventure, I haven't seen this before.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, I doubt there was a nerf, at least from that very limited sample size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">anyone here remember how dulak was when LOY first was released?  You'll remember running around for an hour and finding 1-5 blue diamonds among other gems and make about 600+ PP per person in the group an hour.  Now you're lucky to get a blue diamond in an hour.  I wouldnt be surprised if there was a nerf as far as cash drops go in LDON.  An exp nerf would be an overboard nerf though...<br />
<br />
I think everyone is right about nameds though..i'm sure its just random.  They would be more likely to nerf drop rates of nameds..not appearance rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not too sure about this one guys... Did 2 adventures yesterday on normal, on the first we had 3 named and 6 augment drops on the second we had 2 named.  Seems to be just total random rolls when they make the dungeon in my opinion since I've been on adventures with zero named and zero augment drops as well.<br />
<br />
p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Read the text please.. i said they nerfed &quot;named&quot; on hard and &quot;pp and gems&quot; on normal... and i stand by that.. i'm 38th on the list on sullon zek! =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We got only one cash loot drop, and it made all of our HPs go down by 100 permanently when we left the dungeon.<br />
<br />
The monk also said that his penis shrank after he accepted the adventure.<br />
<br />
I have no proof of all this though!  It's just a feeling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, that was just the latest monk nerf. ;)<br />
<br />
At any rate, my wife ml's for our group. Our splits have been pretty random (60 to 400 pp). Collections seem to give the greatest amount of sellables (but what a pain in the ... adventure). I think it would be extremely hard to prove any type of nerf given the randomness of pp/sellables so far. The same goes for named... <br />
<br />
Just my opinion, I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I only had time to knock out 3 adventures on normal setting yesterday and this is what I saw:<br />
<br />
1.  The pp/cash drops on normal are definitely less.  <br />
2.  We saw about 8 named in 3 adventures compared to the usual ~2 named in 3 adventures.  <br />
<br />
3.  We had NO augs drop in 3 adventures compared to our previous average of one+ aug per adventure.  <br />
<br />
4.  The exp seemed the same to me.<br />
<br />
SOE routinely releases an expansion and makes &quot;adjustments&quot; to it a week or so after players get their hands on it.  This is the way it has always been and should be expected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I did 3 adventures on normal today<br />
<br />
First adv - 2 named, 1 aug, about 200pp each in gems<br />
<br />
Second adv - 3 named, 3 augs, about 400pp each in gems<br />
<br />
Third adv - 0 named, 0 augs, about 100pp each in gems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks pretty random to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its possible the named spawns were nerfed for Hard, though. They were being farmed by groups with no intention of doing the actually adventure. Have a Ranger, Druid or Bard, get a Hard adventure, zone in, check track for named, if none all leave and try another. If there is one, go kill it (maybe half an hour fighting to it) and then leave. So what if you failed, the Hard adventures are dropping 75/75 or better TRADEABLE (therefore sellable) items.</div></div><hr />

      They can just make them non drop ,but nope ,they prefer to nerf the hard mod ,making it less interesting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">anquedotal It's anecdotal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just adding my ldon experiences for the night on normal.  In 3 adventures tonite we had 3 named, 3 augments drop and just over 300p in split each time.  It certainly doesn't seem like normal has changed at all.  If you noticed any differences I'm sure it was coincidental.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh and the experience seemed exactly the same as it has been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">wow... i don't know if its different for pvp servers or just sullon zek..but i've never made over 200pp per group member in any adventure and i'm ML... i was lamenting the fact that for that one day i had less than 100pp for each adventure.  But i've done adventures the last two days and have seen some normalcy return to the loot... hard is still nerfed though.. my guild was one of those that farmed hard named...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kilokeo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Could the small thing they did actually be fix the problem some people were having entering adventure dungeons and getting the too dangerous message?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">They only nerfed Sullon Zek to teach them to be more polite over there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Great so if thats true they changed hard mode which was A) A Really big challenge and B) A Decent loot source for mid level guilds because some people just wanted to farm the stuff to sell? Now people at my level will have no reason to try a hard adventure at all and just have to do the normal ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">. Have a Ranger, Druid or Bard, get a Hard adventure, zone in, check track for named, if none all leave and try another.<br />
<br />
Often a druid or bard can't see named on track from zone-in.  I often adventure with all 3 in group, have noticed many instrances where ranger can see 2 named on track and neither the druid nor bard can see any, especially in some larger dungeons.<br />
<br />
FWIW I don't notice any real difference in Normal adventures, either in coin loot or number of named.</div></div><hr />
