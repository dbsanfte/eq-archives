<br />
Also strangely absent from the druid board (For a change)<br />
<br />
I know any sort of presence from SoE is essentially nonexistant on our little board here :/<br />
<br />
Anyways here's my questions/concerns. Feel Free to add yours.<br />
<br />
1) I'm fine if you're gonna put in some slow mitigation, but making everything mitigate slow is retarded. Make minis &quot;Mostly&quot; effective and the bosses either &quot;Mostly&quot; or &quot;Partially&quot; effective at best. None of this Spiritseeker Nadox crap.  If I wanted to essentially fight a PoV golem with a wavecrasher I can go do so without spending 30+ minutes running there.  I don't see your average trash mobs casting spells that make healing, or nuking, or anything else less effective, so how about you not go overboard here?<br />
<br />
2) Curses are lame. A new resist check on DoTs is nice and all, but either 1) Put them on Specialization (for a change) or 2) Make them do something other than just damage. There was so much creativity that could have been applied here and you guys blew it. It doesn't have to be monumental, just something interesting.<br />
<br />
3) Where do you wind up if you go LD? I'm assuming outside (saw a picture of a pile of corpses in everfrost on EQTraders so that's my guess)<br />
<br />
4)  I'm particularly fond of 'Ghetto&quot; groups such as me healing, a ranger or monk tanking, and just random other people. Or a group that uses pets as tanks and has no actual melee classes. Is there enough forgiveness in the structure of LDoN battles to allow this kind of group setup, or are we going to be reliant on plate class to tank, a debuffer, and either a cleric or druid keaping everyone alive?<br />
<br />
5) Dungeons mean casters. I'm a 250lb, 6 and a half foot tall barbarian. Doesn't it make sense for me to be able to smack something (bash) at least half as well as some gnome cleric? is say 100 skill in bash too much to ask, considering its limited use in stunning fleeing mobs, and possibly interrupting a gate or something. We're basically a class built around 2 tricks - Slow, and impressive mana regen. Every single other casting class gets either some sort of stun (or mez), be it an actual spell or utility through a pet-procced spell. I'm asking for something unreliable but at least an option.  I'm not asking to be some sort of melee machine, I just want to settle this injustice of shamans being primitive beings that can't dole out the occasional pimp slap to thwart a caster.<br />
<br />
6) Enchanters and clerics get a buff spell that reduces melee damage  dealt to the person it is cast on... Since after 3 years you seem to finally have this ability, why not re visit an old spell (cripple) and actually implement some of that functionality? hey it was worth a shot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I originally typed this at like 6am, changed the 8) to a 6) :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice post, I'd like to answer your number 3 but I can't.  ;)    I'll just say they've got LD's covered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow! For something thats not out yet, you sure have you mind made up about what LDoN is going to be like! Where did you experience all these zones to come up with all these opinions?<br />
<br />
1) You have 30 minutes TO get there. If you take anywhere near that long, the mobs will all laugh at you for the duration of your event, and take half the normal damage.<br />
<br />
2) Curses are curses. I hope you have the means to remove them.<br />
<br />
3) You end up where you went LD, just like anywhere else, unless your groups instance of the dungeon has expired, in which case you will be moved back outside the dungeon to the zone-in point.<br />
<br />
4) For someone with all the opinions on LDoN, what happened here? Brain fart? You should know this by now. You must have had plenty of experince with the LDoN system with all these opinions to know this one.<br />
<br />
5) You are a 250 lb, 6.5 foor tall blind as a bat Barbarian. At least the gnome cleric can see the mob to hit it. Shaman as melee characters was ignored, forgotten, and abused by SoE. Unless you wasted the AA points on Rabid Bear, in which case you can kind of act like a stinking hairy melee on 4 feet for a few seconds every couple of hours.<br />
<br />
6) brain farted again?<br />
<br />
7) brain farted yet again?<br />
<br />
8) We already have enough things to do in a typical group. If you cannot find enough things to do to go low on mana every fight, you are not doing enough. Dont bitch and moan simply because you didnt get something someone else managed to get. You are getting new things too, and the enchanter wont be getting it. Maybe they should be moaning and groaning that they want Bane too.<br />
<br />
You still have the best mob damage reducing spells in the game. My shaman gets groups EASILY! I mean fast! That means you got things other people want. Enjoy that fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One thing that irritates me a lot are pure melees always whining about wanting new abilities...   they wouldn't be pure melees anymore, so why didn't they choose a caster or a hybrid?   They knew the deal well ahead of time I'm sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;My shaman gets groups EASILY! I mean fast! That means you got things other people want. Enjoy that fact&quot;<br />
<br />
Just because you get a group fast doesnt mean that you are actually the very best at anything. It could very well mean that people dont know much about what shamans do. Maybe they heard that shamans can slow time and who wouldnt want to group with someone that can do that? Even the people that made EQ insisted for well over a year that alchemy was working just fine.<br />
<br />
Why all the brain-fart remarks? Got the wrong leg out of the bed first today?<br />
<br />
I too would like how SoE makes the dungeons suitable to your group. So far all I have seen Absor say is that it is based on level. If that is true then what about the vastly different equipment people of the same level has? And what about the vastly different mix and number of AAs points people have? If these two factors dont have any influence on how the dungeons are populated then there is a very real risk for serious problems here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am guessing the brain fart remarks are because the original poster went from 5), to 8).  There were no 6 and 7, and thats the number he put brain fart on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am curious about how they will tailor a dungeon to a group as well. There is a huge difference in gear and power between groups from the elemental planes with 200 AAs and those with droppable gear they picked up in the bazaar who just hit 65 with minimal AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One thing that irritates me a lot are pure melees always whining about wanting new abilities... they wouldn't be pure melees anymore, so why didn't they choose a caster or a hybrid?

<br />
The deal i signed up for 3 years ago when i rolled my first main,( mnk ) is not the one my monk is getting shafted with today.  <br />
<br />
They need atleast something, throw them a bone.  Some neat aa's or new disc's, anything!   Monks now are nothing more than dps, thats it, thats all.  I used to think i had a nice roll, it was pulling.  Now bards are better at it than i am heh.<br />
<br />
If you think pure melee's dont need something, anything, you are playing a different game.  I solo'ed lodi the other day.  My monk would die trying to kill a snow cougar.</div></div><hr />

Me too. As great as this expansion sounds, I'm just afraid it's going to be 40 instances of the Plane of Justice trials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to bring the thread off topic or anything...<br />
<br />
I remember seeing a barbarian warrior fighting with a dark elf guard in Nektulos forest, and it seemed to me the barbarian was about twice as tall as the elf.. The dark elf character description says they are 5 feet tall, so that would make barbarians 9-10 feet tall. So if you are a 6 1/2 foot tall barbarian, you were probably picked on a lot growing up in Halas. =P  j/k, lol sorry, #5 just seemed to glare out at me.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wanna bash, but not that bad.<br />
<br />
Bigmeeno is mostly on, cept for all that cranial flatulence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't think that posting only here will make any difference. How about sending the thoughts to SOE as well?<br />
<br />
And I do agree that shamans could have some improvement as well. Otherwise, when LDoN comes out, every other class will get yet another useful upgrade, no matter how small, and we get, in best case, new lvl 65 CHA buff. As big race chars, we have innate Slam ability, always escaped me how the heck we cannot train Bash to good levels, and especially pathetic was to see the clerics get Bash skill, what they can train. Blasted skinny tiny gnome cleric can Bash better with trained skill then I will even with my innate Slam skill. Bah, from all the caster classes, shamans should be most &quot;melee&quot; able ones.<br />
<br />
From spells, a la curses, I would love to see the REAL curses, i.e. something what would debuff the mobs skills directly, or casting speed, once cast on it. Buffs, which would raise the targets skills directly. So many ways to make it interesting, but clearly the SOE doesn't give a damn about it. It remains to be seen, what LDoN will bring us. I bet that shamans get nothing, or at least nothing worth getting/aiming for, as seems to be a trend with SOE's latest expansions.</div></div><hr />
