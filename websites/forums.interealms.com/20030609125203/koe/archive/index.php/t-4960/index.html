<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Temple of Veeshan - Halls of Testing <br />
Where: Temple of Veeshan, HoT Staging Area. <br />
When: 8:00 PM Eastern, Wenesday, January 23 <br />
Level Range: 54+ <br />
Requires: Dubious or better CoV faction. <br />
<br />
This raid will be limited to Four Groups. Though the level limit is set at 54 and up, I am willing to be flexible with appropriate resists and depending on space. We will rotate people in on a standby list as people leave. The raid will likely go until after midnight, but we will keep going as long as we have a capable force. <br />
<br />
Requirements: Attendee's are encoraged to bring some DoTs for Symbol/Rune. Able to commit to at least 3 hours. <br />
<br />
Resists: CR/FR near 100 unbuffed should be your target. MR is a secondary resist to look at as well. This assumes you are at least level 55. If you are lower level, especially lower level Melee, you need to be looking at unbuffed resists at about 150+ <br />
<br />
Objectives: The main goal here is to move to the Halls of Testing and pull MoBs for challenge and loot. <br />
<br />
If you cannot make the start time, please sign up anyway, but include the time you will be able to get on. We will rotate people in and keep the raid going as long as there remains a viable force present.<br />
<br />
Notes:  I mean what I say about continuing the raid.  The last couple have ended at about 1:00 EST from lack of bodies.  If you are a late nighter, don't feel excluded.  I am prepared to go on until 3:00 AM EST or later if need be.  Signup and come and we will get you in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Atokal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Unfortunately due to an agreement with my pregnant wife (I mean really so you are pregnant what is the big deal) I have agreed to cut down my play time. So last night Kilrain called me and literally begged me to come to Cazic Thule, Hence in support of the guild I logged on and helped with a valiant attempt at slaying the evil god. Now I have traded my one all night gaming nite and hence cannot attend this raid. (I may be able to log in after my wife goes to sleep.) <br />
<br />
Just kidding about the pregnancy not being a big deal btw.:D <br />
<br />
Cheers</div></div><hr />

That would not be a fun CR to go on for sure if I got booted and could not relog on.  Have a great time and good luck on the raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'll join when I get online unless something else drags me away.<br />
<br />
I'd like to bring Neo (lvl 54 and resists are acceptable) but will bring Moe as well for buffs and chanter duties if needed.<br />
<br />
Any of our jeweler's going to attend?  I have a few pieces I'd like made if possible, I will bring the gems and bars.  Otherwise maybe I can beg Rox to dust off Buri for a few mins to craft some shiny tings  :)</div></div><hr />
