<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did you quest for Canni 2? if no why?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes.<br />
<br />
(And am glad I did - it was worth it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I didn't until 49, largely because I hate begging for stuff - &quot;/ooc looking to loot X&quot; just goes against my nature.  Didn't get around to hitting KC until 48-49. And then I wished I had done it sooner. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did it at 42.  Actually got a few groups in KC at that lev and managed to earn the kills.<br />
<br />
Cann 2 is a nice progression from Cann.  The ratio of hp:mana is slightly poorer than Cann1, but it takes health in larger chunks and turns them into bigger bits o' mana for you.   I understand the hp:mana ratio on Cann2 used to be MUCH worse, now it's just a couple percentage points.<br />
<br />
Do the quest, you'll be happier for it.  Especially if you happen to be sitting next to a book-readin' GEB-wearin' non-meleein' shadr00d.  So far, none of the shadr00ds I've met have bothered to do the Cann2 quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i got it at lvl 45, quite worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Never did it, the quest looked like far more effort than it was worth.  As I recall, they changed the stats of the Canni line at some point to make the spell more worthwhile, or at least that was a debate when I started looking into doing it.  Canni 2 just wasn't a good ratio, tho it was more at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yea , i did. good lord what a hard quest it was for me at 39. i ended up buying the clay ( city of mist i think is the hardest part ) the Yun Shaman Powder was very funny . <br />
<br />
I get to the zone where they pop following intrustiongs from allahkazam's site i think. i get to where they said the shamans pop and didnt see anything.  /ooc anyone know if the yun shaman pops around the wall ? *enter guild passing by*  no words no anything , off in the distance i see magic flames burst from a necro. takes about 5 seconds then keeps runnning. again , no tell no reply. i go to look what he killed cause he didnt loot whatever it was (im not above clean up as a untwinked relitivly reclusive shaman) and low and behold it was a yun. i was there no longer then 5 min. i almost fell out of my chair with glee cause it was the last part.<br />
<br />
The bone was also funny . *enter KC*  /ooc anyone know where the warlod pops ?  *there is one dead at the front gate*  rofl.  <br />
<br />
the diamonds were truly the only reasonable item ont he quest. took some time to get but wasnt insanly hard.  honeslty im not happy with how they did this quest. it is certainly too hard for a 39 to do alone. Then again thats probly the point , but its very frustrating. <br />
<br />
anyway. i can say it was worth the danger. the faster rate of canversion is very welcome and now that i have chloroplast that i can stack with bearform , it makes some nights wher eim a ghetto cleric a lil more BEARable ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">actually for the level of the spell and the level you can obtain this spell it is kinda silly.  I was 47 and couldn't get a group in KC as they said I was too low at the time.  Just me though, I hate depending on people to help me so I try to do it myself.  I just wish it was easier to get :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think that VI doesn't intend for you to get the spell at 39.<br />
<br />
I think they just wanted to make sure that whenever you get the spell you can use it immediatly.  So they placed it at a level where you *couldn't* get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  I got it at 44, and it is definitly worth it.  I can't even tell a difference when Im using it (in terms of cast time, fizzles, etc) but when I'm desperatly canni'ing down for that quick heal I'm glad I have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I did the whole quest except for the bonechips at 39, and i got them at 49.<br />
<br />
All i can say is that i wish i got cann2 at 39, it is about 1000% better than cann1.<br />
<br />
Although the ratio is a tad worse, i only need to press the cann button about half the time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I never got it, so i dont know what i am missing I suppose.  All I know is that I was very very happy when I finally got canni3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jeddi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Aye, I quested the spell as well, more or less accidentlally picking up the pieces until I had to ask for help with the shaman powder, ended up getting it from some folks hunting Seb keys.<br />
<br />
Nice spell, 52nd now and use it all the time.<br />
<br />
Jeddi - 52nd iskar shaman on innoruuk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did it, believe it or not, at level 52. :P<br />
<br />
It was a hell of an upgrade from Cannibalize, which was getting pretty old by that point.<br />
<br />
Good chunk of XP, too.<br />
<br />
The sticking point was the clay. I was soloing like crazy in CoM at this point, camping for XP, my epic parts an this clay. I had everything else, but the behemoth just would NOT pop for me. So one day I WTB A Strange Ochre Clay, some guy offers me one for 200 pp, I take it, get the spell, go to solo some more and I swear to God that the damn behemoth popped no less than /three/ times in a row.<br />
<br />
Anyway... go ahead and get the spell if the pieces are places you were gonna go anyway. It's a great upgrade and it just plain beats the heck out of Charm Plants. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got this spell at around 49 I think.  It helped alot for the levels between 49 and 54.  Not much faster, but still noticable.  I only got it because I realized I had the KC and CoM pieces in bank, and Canni 1 was way too slow. :) Not a bad quest once you get those pieces out of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I never got it, but boy I sure wish that I had.<br />
<br />
Long about 48 I started thinking I could do the KC part (I had two of the other three parts) but some RL friends talked me into trying Bloodgills and I was hooked until lvl 51.<br />
<br />
Then my RL friends moved to Luclin and I didn't get back to KC until 53.  Cann I was driving me CRAZY by this point, but I figured I'd just grind it out to 54 and use Cann III.<br />
<br />
Cann III is sooo much nicer than Cann I.  Really nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yup, quested for it before I turned 50 and I liked it at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I did the quest at around level 43/44. I was lucky in that I back-doored into a couple of CoM raids for Jade Reavers. I got the clay and most of the pages AND the 3 books for my Epic in 2 raids hee hee.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think it is well worth doing the quest, but unless you have good friends or guildies to hold your hand, it is unrealistic to expect to get the spell at 39<br />
<br />
The whole point of Canni II is not the ratio - thats irrelevent, the difference between Canni I and Canni II is pretty damned marginal. The reason Canni II is such a significant upgrade is that you have to cannidance less often to regain the mana, i.e you regain mana faster with Canni II anyways, which gives you more time to do other things (like keel sturf)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was too lazy to do it, plus I had a canni 3 scroll in my pack since level 30</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kebra SpiritSage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hi all <br />
I have just started this quest. I was wondering if the crushed Diamonds part of quest still drops on Goria Island? is it on the ground or do i have to kill the mobs there to get it?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The crushed diamond dust is a ground spawn. I got mine two or three months ago. You might have to wait for respawn if the dust is not on the ground when you get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I had the spell waiting in the bank for me at 39. A fellow shaman on Ayonae more or less did the whole quest for me...Thx Saraza :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Quested at 39. <br />
<br />
I just piggy backed on a CoM raid and a Skelly group in KC , healing/buffing as I could.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just wanted to add my 2cp..  <br />
<br />
I got this spell at 49 and it was well worth it to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I never did it - I didn't want to put the effort into doing the quest.  However, not long after I got canni-3, I toyed with the idea of doing the quest so I could actually canni every now &amp; then instead of fizzle, fizzle, sit, fizzle, fizzle, sit, fizzle, wince, sit, /sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I just got the spell myself.  Doing City of Mist was the bottle neck for me, but I have found Cann 2 to be well worth the effort.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The diamond ground spawn on Gorla island was right between the legs of a mob when I got it, so yeah you need to kill one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Did the quest in my early 40s, can't remember exactly.  I agree with Snapdragon regarding VI's intent on that whatever level you do complete the quest, that you can scribe it right then.  Similar scenario to the level 39 wizard concussion spell quest -- which in my opinion is a tougher quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The diamonds definitely do still spawn on the Golra island, very visible if they are popped on the ice beach (check allakhazam or eqshaman for the approximate loc). If there is a golra right there, worry not, they don't see invis. Just lev and invis, walk up and snag it, float a good distance away and gate.</div></div><hr />
