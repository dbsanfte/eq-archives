<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've used a JBB since I've been around lvl 46 and I've used it LOTS, especially during the levels up to about 54. After that I used it every now and then for added damage.<br />
However since I've got Canni IV/Torpor and a Crystalline Torque I never used it, instead I was always casting Ice Strike. Just a few days before spell casting fury stopped working for the JBB I put 2 points into SCF because I thought it's nice to crit a manafree DD. Another reason not to use the JBB anymore.<br />
<br />
After I realized that I wasn't using the JBB anymore I constantly thought about selling it, but always thought that one shouldn't sell such a status symbol.<br />
<br />
I ended up putting the JBB on the Bazaar mule and am waiting for someone to buy it.<br />
<br />
Anyone else in the same situation? Should I sell it or keep as status symbol?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go to stormhammer, then transfer to Luclin, then sell it to me. :)<br />
<br />
Honestly, sell it to a shaman.  I wouldn't put it in the bazaar for sale, instead I'd find a shaman in my guild, or a friend, or at least someone that I've talked to a couple times, and sell it to them.<br />
<br />
If you put it in the bazaar for sale you can't control who gets it...a reseller, or a guy with a 20 shaman twink, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">aye<br />
<br />
find another shaman and sell it to him at a reasonable price.<br />
<br />
you shouldnt let others have it cause they will jakc up the price and rip off some poor shaman :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I still use mine for soloing the things at 60.  Well WW dragons anyway.  Keep it, mana free damage is always good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why on earth would you use ice strike over the bracer?<br />
<br />
With canni5 (almost there) and torpor I plan on pox/baning/epicing multiple mobs (2-3) and pet/bracer a 4th down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As much as would like to have the money back in order to help buy Torpor one day soon, I can't see selling it for anything other than a ridiculously high price.<br />
<br />
The JBB is a security blanket.  You all know it is there in your time of need.  Prime example the other day, headed to the Sebillis Kitchen, no chanter, but a bard. and somehow we kept aggroing frogs.  Must have 8 there at the peak and I bet we killed 15 unpulled at that spot.  Finally reached the do or die moment when we needed to polish them off and it was JBB Canni JBB Canni.<br />
<br />
You simply can't trade away the JBB.  It's a mana-free 200-some-per-tick dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">JBB=a nuke you always have memmed, that alone is worth the price of admission for a class that has 8 spellslots, and easily double that number of buffs and debuffs people want on a seemingly random basis.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I sold my jbb to make the money to buy torpor.. I sorta miss it sometimes.. but then.. I can torpor/canni4 and do some real damage anyway without too much trouble. <br />
<br />
I would like to get another.. just for those emergency situations though.. or for adding just that little tad more dps to a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I usually duo with my Monk who is the main source of damage.<br />
<br />
I found it far more efficient to cast ice strike or torrent of poison, depending on resist, then using the JBB. With Canni IV and Torpor I'm always FM when duoing so I can always spare the mana for ice strike/torrent of poison.</div></div><hr />
