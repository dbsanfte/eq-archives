I found a file cabinet but I couldnt switch out the &quot;question&quot;. thanks in advance for any info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hendrik</div><div class="date">06-14-2002, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guildie is doing this quest and posted the three steps on our boards. I think she did a great job. Here's the 2nd Step:<br />
<br />
2nd earring of veracity <br />
Still In Sanctus Seru (this whole part of the quest is in this one zone)Locate Euzan Jurek at neg 138 pos 263<br />
<br />
You say, 'torsten sent me' <br />
Euzan Jurek says 'So Torsten has sent you? He must see the potential within you to help us. I cannot give you any information right now as to who we are. That is a trust you must [earn]. ' <br />
You say, 'how do i earn your trust' <br />
Euzan Jurek leans in and whispers to you, 'Let it be known that assisting us will show your distrust in everything this city stands for. If you do not want to get involved I urge you to walk away now. However if you wish to [bring about change], stay and I will tell you how to earn our trust.' ' <br />
You say, 'i wish to bring about change' <br />
Euzan Jurek says 'Good, you must do something for us. One of our members, who needs not be named, is due to be called for the Question. We need you to go into the Heart [Consillium] and replace their records with this one. This false record shows that they have completed their Question and still have time until their next one. Changing the records will make the question pass over us so that we avoid being discovered. Go in stealth, when you have completed this task bring me back the original records and your Insignia Earring. ' <br />
<br />
NB: There are 4 main buildings surrounding a locked building in the center of Sanctus Seru. Each one is devoted to the different 'sects' of the seru - Hand of Seru, Heart, Eye, and Hand Legionnaires. Above the entrances to each building is a logo, depicting which sect it is. I believe the building with the Filing Cabinet was the Heart Building, but could be wrong - going from memory hehe.<br />
<br />
Give the replacement files to the File Cabinet, you get back &quot;Original Records&quot;, and a guard spawns and attacks you. Take the original records to Euzan, along with your first earring, and he rewards you with the 2nd earring.<br />
NOTE: We found that the Filing Cabinet is KoS, but is perma-rooted. If you hand the cabinet your report, but get someone else to invis you before you hit trade, when the guard spawned, he could not see you, therefore did not attack. Since we were using bard song invis, I cannot say if the guard will agro on anyone but the questee, so invis for all might be a good idea. If you mess this step up, just go back to Euzan, and say the trigger phrase to get another copy. If wanting to do this step multiple times, it is recommeded to go do the turn in for the first person while waiting for the guard to despawn, as he despawns pretty quickly if not aggroed.<br />
