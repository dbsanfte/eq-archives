<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This has been bugging me, not because I don't understand the obvious, but because I don't understand the mentality behind this line of thinking. Can you offer any insight?<br />
<br />
I am in EC (the trade center of our server) looking to pick up a Fighting Baton for my level 4 monk. We have a global chat channel, but most of the lower end gear is still easier to find in EC.<br />
<br />
Normally, when I am trying to buy some lower end gear I don't /auction WTB ITEM etc, I just read the auctions as I watch TV or something.<br />
<br />
So, I am standing there in the EC tunnel looking to pick up a Fighting Baton while watching the Matrix and I notice that over the course of the last hour or so I see a guy auctioning that he wants to trade for a Fungi Tunic. He seems to be getting desperate as he is almost to the point of spamming the zone non-stop with his auction. Here is a summary of what happned:<br />
<br />
Him: /auction Trading for Fungi PST<br />
Him: /auction Trading for Fungi PST<br />
Him: /auction Trading for Fungi PST<br />
<br />
Then I notice that he is inspecting me now...<br />
<br />
Him: Hail Thual<br />
Me: Yes?<br />
<br />
He sticks a bag in the trade window. I took a qucik glance at the contents, he had about 30k to 35k worth of assorted items in there (Fungi goes for around 35k). Nothing of which I would have ever been interested in.<br />
<br />
Him: All for Fungi<br />
Me: Uhhh, no thanks. I am not interested in selling or trading my Tunic. Thanks though.<br />
<br />
He sticks the bag back into a trade window... I cancel.<br />
<br />
Him: All for Fungi<br />
Me: No thanks. Why would I trade something I use for a bag of gear that I can't? That wouldn't make sense. Sorry.<br />
<br />
Him: You can sell and buy another.<br />
Me: Ummm...I already have one. Why would I want to sit here for hours and hours selling that gear to get enough money to buy back an item I already had in the first place? That doesn't make sense either.<br />
<br />
Him: Come on man! You can sell that gear easy and buy another Fungi!<br />
Me: OMG! No I am not trading.<br />
<br />
He sticks the bag back into a trade window... I cancel.<br />
<br />
Him: Dick<br />
Me: /ignore Him<br />
<br />
So, how on Earth could any reasonable person think that I would want to do that? I don't understand...</div></div><hr />

<br />
why did he do this? that's a rhetorical question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For the same reason that some level 2 char kept tailing me through Halas and Everfrost inviting me to join his group despite being told by me that I was too high level to group with him. I was level 46 at the time. It was funny despite the annoyance of having to constantly /decline. I had to /tell him several times to cut it out. LOL I think I finally gated back to my bind point to get away from him. I know I should've put him on /ignore, but I had other things on my mind at the time. Norrath has a sizable population of morons. Just try to keep a sense of humor and it's not too hard to bear. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">35K?<br />
<br />
Damn, they're going for 50-80k on Xev.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">they exist on your server =( we got 2, one droped on from legends, you guys are all spoiled.  well ahh well i ahve torpor now i survive :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lol, yeah on Drinal, Fungi goes for about 60k... Needles to say I don't have it /cry<br />
I also dont have a JBB (25-35k) OR my epic (Small guild). Epic should be in sight within a couple of months, but I have no clue as to when I'll get the other two things.<br />
That's why I just LOVE the 50 shamans that solo reds and say it's easy (4 blues an hour man!!!), and then goes on to saying how they &quot;just&quot; pull with epic, root, sic pet, and JBB all the time and be FM when the fight is over because they medded up on their horse... <br />
<br />
Yes, I'm jealous!!</div></div><hr />

Heh, now that sounds like a true newbie. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it was that easy why didn't he just sell his stuff and buy a Fungi in the first place ? Stop buggin those who have one already.  <br />
Stuff like that pisses me off, someone wanting to trade for something I have with stuff I can't possibly use. My Shammy is the only toon I play. So twink stuff doesn't interest me. <br />
<br />
Just sell your bag of goodies and buy a Fungi ....sounds easy to me. If you don't have the patience to sit and auction to get one then you pbviously don't want one that bad. <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Another option if some momo is trying to force a trade down your throat is sit down with the spell book up.  They'll get a sorry, I'm busy right now message.<br />
<br />
Stories like this keep me out of EC.  I'm bound at the bazzaar.  If I'm in auction and I see something I like I can hopefully meet someone at the bazzaar and just gate there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think most people assume that the pesron on the other side of the trade window is their age or older.  This sounds like a classic case of what a 10 year-old's logic would sound like.  I'm a school teacher and I deal with this all the time.  When stuff like this happens in game,  don't try reasoning with them, just give them a time out in the corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">He was 12years old.  His fiendish tactics had worked well before on someone else who had laughed so hard they choked and inadvertently hit the &quot;trade&quot; button.  He didn't really know what the fungi was, but he wanted it.....he wanted it BAD.</div></div><hr />

Mez not understand how people can be dat stupid either.  In dis case mez bet the person was young....  &lt; 25 or so.  I don't have a lot of contact wid the moronic segment of our population so it is easy to over estimate how smart most people are.  Mez bet the average IQ in EQ is significantly above norm but the game does not have an IQ test before allowing you to log on.  (no spelling test either /cheer).  The easy way to keep things in perspective is to remember that da people of da USA where so stupid as to elect Bill Clinton twice.<br />

If joo want horse and jbb it is not hard at all.  Farm.  Log on for night after nigh after night and farm.  If joo can make 500p a night (easy) then it will only take you about 70 nights to get both joo JBB and horse.<br />
<br />
The only thing that seperates joo,  or any other shaman (sans iksar),  from da the JBB is determination.<br />

Sorry ill send that bill over to you that effectively reduces taxes for the top 5% of US, Nixes protection of wetlands and national parks that contain oil and increases spending!  Sounds sooooo much better!</div></div><hr />
