I don't get any new dot or healing spell... My question is this: What am I expected to do in a group at lvl 14?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I was 14 I believe that I just healed, buffed, and nuked when mana was plentiful. <br />
<br />
In my experience, at low levels anyway, fights don't last long enough in a group setting to justify the use of dots. You might consider slowing, but at 14 it's a real mana hog and I didn't see much use in it.</div></div><hr />

Will I be relegated to the role of healer for most of my career? Shaman class has been fun and challenging so far but I wonder what I am getting into</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol this is EXACTLY what prompted me to post this message. I am sick of twinked monks asking me to med and heal with my paltry 30hp heal while they get hit for 25 damage per round by a greater scalebone. <br />
<br />
I feel useless. All our stat buff spells are next to useless so we are stuck to healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah- I got around this by solo'ing around this level.  Healing sucks.  :)<br />
<br />
P.S.  You think 14 sounds bad- wait until 23.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lev up, hover over targeted mob and click off lev.<br />
Blam you smoosh them, oops thats fatties only.<br />
<br />
Really, you da SoW, root and Bind man now at these levels later you will slow, that's enough to to earn your keep. Heal with Inner Fire and find a nice weapon as your melee at these levels does damage nearly on par with anyone else. Go to the bazaar, many cheap &quot;I wish I had when I was a newb&quot; weapons there to buy.<br />
<br />
Or you can also solo, no mobs at this level will catch you if you need to run, your offense, defense and weapon skills will improve, you'll learn how your spells work and be more self confident.<br />
<br />
Later on after dogdog, canni and better DOTS come along people will look at ya and wonder how you do that. Hang in there Shaman is a fun class like no other.<br />
<br />
ADDED: Solo reminder ALL our DOTS stack and the frenzy, fury line of self-buffs are your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You won't get a new heal every level, not even clerics do. It doesn't make your old heals obsolite though. Use your new buff spells and you can always try using slows to help too.<br />

Heehee, I guess they couldn't twink a fungi otherwise they'd be asking you for group 30 levels later :D Anyways, if they annoy you, solo and find better group mates. Don't suffer over stupid twinks who read from boards/heard from friends 'shaman/monk duo rules best exp in game!'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Use Inner fire<br />
<br />
Its slower, and does slightly less HP at a time, but it saves mana(10 mana, 20 HP heal).<br />
<br />
your only gonna be a healer for awhile, later on in life people always have more healing power(in KC, i refuse to be healer, and always get a druid(w/ sup heal) or cleric)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>L33TL355</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I found myself soloing from then on because i didn't want to spend hours looking at the few spells i had. Wasn't very fun. <br />
<br />
I spent 14 - 24 soloing. I know it can be done and with some really bad equipment too. When I hit 24 i decided to get back into groups. I hadn't been in groups for a while so I feel into being a main healer AGAIN. But with regen and canni you'll be a lot better. <br />
<br />
If you find that your healing too much. look to increase your DPS. I found that sometimes my group did better after losing a healer for another tank. But try telling a tank at 24 that we don’t need a cleric, druid.. get the rogue. <br />
<br />
When I hit 44 I got in a group with two Beastlords, a monk and a rogue in the dreadlands. Have you ever seen a meat grinder? We got a druid because the rogue wanted one. But there were dead chicken/spider parts all over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">personally i think u picked a hard race to lvl up....but thats personall opinion...if u really want that scally tail....<br />
<br />
at 15 (after dodge) id leave kunark and go to unrest for 2 lvls:<br />
get a port to bb ring {make sure u got the maps for bbmtns, dagnors cauldron, unrest}  Use levitate to run across the lake surface to unrest, bind at the zone!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Go to the gazebo, right side near the funny moat thing and fight beetles, maybe duo with a druid or cleric: druid is good for damage shield! offer highlvl players pp for ther buffs. You will be tanking btw.<br />
<br />
at 17 get a port back to bb ring spires and then head to luclin and join a bandit grp in paludal cavs:  as a semi tank.<br />
<br />
stay ther till 23 24 ish   then get in a grp at the pyramids in feroot till 27. (this maky be too hard, but you wil learn FAST or die here!)<br />
<br />
then go to marus seru and solo grey hoppers till 30.<br />
<br />
hope that helps)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have grouped my entire career. I love it. Its why I picked a shaman, for the groupability of the class.<br />
<br />
You'll be a healing class on par with a cleric until you're 34.  Thats when the cleric starts to pull ahead.  You'll also be pulled into groups for nukes and mainly SoW.   Buffs are nice as well, but your primary means to a group is SoW and healing.<br />
<br />
But don't worry, once you hit 34, you get your pet and it all changes :)<br />
<br />
At 51, you get your best slow and thats when your world changes.  You'll be pulled into groups simply for that one spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">At 14 heal is pretty much all your going to do.  Just the way it is :(<br />
<br />
Once you get some good buffs you will heal and buff.  Unless you are soloing you won't be using your damage spells.  <br />
<br />
I am main healer in groups even now.  It's not too bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>smashie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">1-14 = lots of meleeing<br />
14-24 = lots of healing and meleeing<br />
24-34 = lots of healing and medding<br />
34-50 = lots of buffing, medding and soloing<br />
51 = omg omg slow slow slow!<br />
52-59 = suffer... need 60!<br />
60 = Torpor, Malo, Focus, Avatar. 4 spells that change everybody's perspective on shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There are a couple things that you can do around 14.   <br />
<br />
But first thing is to start working on getting your skill up to speed.  Don't depend on any one skill but take a hour or two and do greenies to work them up.   You will see the differance in the long run &quot;Believe Me&quot;.   <br />
<br />
For example ... work on One Hand Blunt then switch to 2 Hand Blunt.  Keep your skills maxed to your level.  Next level (15) adds Dodge as a skill ... which will help some on damage recieved.   Good thing to do as you jump major skill cap's is to work on them doing greenies.   It's also a good time to work on your melee skills.<br />
<br />
Next work on casting skills.   Do True North till you are blue in the face to build divination skills NOW.  It will pay in the long run.  Try to keep your skills even with your level rather than letting any one of them fail behind.   You can also work on casting skills during fights ... so throw a Burst of Strength or Inner Fire on tanks.<br />
<br />
Then ... work on your parking skills.   You have root now ... so work on crowd control skills.   Parking adds is a skill that you will use throughout the rest of your playing if you are a grouping Shaman.    Creating the macro's, working on timing, and testing holding/or lossing aggro are important skills to learn and work out with each set of spells.   Soon your slow will start adding major effects to the fight ... and likely drawing aggro to yourself ... &quot;root is your friend&quot; here.<br />
<br />
Last ... if possible work on gear.   Get as much AC as you can get along with HP.   And you don't have to buy everything.   There are places that you can pick up OK gear off drops.   Check out the area's that higher up's solo' or do mass AA'ing.    Lot's of times gear is left to rot when fast pulling groups are working it in a area.   Plus there are a lot of bargin's in the Bazaar nowadays ... which are perfect for early levels gear wise.   <br />
<br />
Hope this helps ... hang in there ... it will get better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Good advice, Fascaser, but one thing - you can't raise defense, offense, or weapon skills against greenies.   You can raise spellcasting skills on anything, even on yourself.<br />
<br />
Smashie, I pretty much agree with your list, except that even the lvl39 slow spell is pretty nice and makes a big impact in underpowered groups.  It's a judgement call whether or not to use any slow - if the fight is going to be short, it is a waste of mana.<br />
<br />
At 24 your soloing options open up a whole bunch, with a great new DOT and cann/regen.  Stick with the class at least until then.  For me 14-24 were very hard levels, but since 24 it's been better and better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nashorn Panzerkampfwagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Did I make a mistake by choosing the Iksar as my race? I know we have an exp penalty but so far the benifits far outweigh the problems. Cabilis is right next to kurn and loio, both great places for exp. <br />
<br />
Biggest downside would be that we cannot wear plate.<br />
<br />
To be frank, I chose the iksar for 2 reasons<br />
1.Awesome newbie area(unlike feerot argh)<br />
2.regeneration(for cannibalize)<br />
3. highest starting wisdom<br />
<br />
if it were not for these three reasons, I would probably play an ogre</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shamans can't wear plate to begin with. Ya you get shorted on not being able to wear Totemic, Rune Etched and JB, but they gave you better Hate gear than the Rune Etched, and now they've got the Twilight Armor quests.  Teh biggest downside I see to an Ikky shammy is not being able to use a JBB.<br />
<br />
/hug JBB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">At 14 you are in the wrong place to level - head on over to Paludal caverns on the moon and you will be level 25 in time for dinner =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nashorn,<br />
<br />
Stay with your Shaman if you like playing him.   There are ton's of posts on pro and con's on each Shaman race ... the main thing is your enjoyment of playing the Shaman class.    I love my Troll Shaman ... but it's due to the fact that I love playing a Shaman formost.    I picked Troll's because I like them ... and if offered would play them for every class.  <br />
<br />
The worst thing to do at your stage is start second guessing ... best thing is to read all you can on this and other boards ... get out and try new things.    Kunark has some great places to Xp ... many are empty most of the time.   Check out the FAQ posts on this board.   Then pour through all the posts on where to Xp.   Then ask yourself ... of all the things you've read what match's your playing style ... then go try them.  Everyone plays differantly ... you will too.  <br />
