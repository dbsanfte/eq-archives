<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lokinoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to know if anyone could tell me how much the SOV Armor Quest Gems sell for now-a-days.  I have some that I still need to purchase and/or sell and want to make sure I am not cheating anyone or getting cheated.<br />
<br />
If anyone could ball park me some prices for each respected gem vs. its corresponding armor part (i.e. Black Pearl for Shaman BP) I would most appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kalrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I usually buy and sell them for about 300pp each.  Except for the CFE and that goes for closer to 1k.  I don't know if that is a fair price for them, but it is sooo much easier to sell them all at a single price that I never bothered to look up the individual prices for them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Most gems are selling for about 300 plat I believe. Exceptions are BP/Robe gems and CFE cause it's used in melee bracer (so they need 6 each) and also in priest boots I believe, so higher demand means higher price. Crushed Opals I believe are also in high demand, because they are for priest bracers and something else. I just bought some flawed emeralds for my rogues arms, 300 plat each, found them pretty fast in market channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lokinoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you very much for the info.  Helps a ton!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are vague categories of them:<br />
<br />
Chipped/flawed (common off CS wyverns) are the cheapest: ~200pp <br />
<br />
Crushed (drop off tougher mobs like Sentient suits) <br />
up to 500pp<br />
<br />
BP gems (Sirens and DN drops)<br />
1-2kish (3k for plate one?)<br />
<br />
Prices are extremely variable on all of these but this is what I see them going for on xegony on average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Brell Server has a forum just for Velious gem buying/selling.  Take a look and browse some of the posts and you should get a decent idea on prices, but it may vary a bit on your server, but it should be close.<br />
