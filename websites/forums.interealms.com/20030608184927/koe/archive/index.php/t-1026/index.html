<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy all! <br />
<br />
I was talking to Lianna the other day and she was raving about how great Howling Stones is and was shocked to hear that I dont have a Howling Stones key yet.  Is anyone else in the same boat?<br />
<br />
I thought I would post here to see if anyone else might be looking to go grab the components.  At least one half (which I cant remember at the moment)  The part that I am talking about is the one that is NOT on the Sarnak guy in Lake of Ill Omen... the other one... whichever that is.  heh.<br />
<br />
At this point everything is completely un-organized, but I thought I would see if anyone else might be interested in getting together to get this component.  If you are, throw up a post or contact Lianna or I via ICQ or the board.<br />
<br />
My ICQ is 48476840<br />
Please just be sure to say you are from KoE in the Auth Request... :)  I get lots of wierd Add requests from strangers (those get ignored ;) )<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to read this ;)<br />
<br />
Have a good Memorial Day Weekend ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're talking about the fang of Xalgoz from Kaesora. I still need one for Baracus (and a second for Bracs for when he's ready to go). So, sign me up if you need another. I'll bring one or both, depending on what the situation warrants.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How about next sunday?  One week from today. the 3rd of June?  Let me know... I think Lianna can make it then as well, I will double check that one... ;)  <br />

If it's to be on a Sunday - it either needs to be early or late - as Sunday is my travel day (long story - work in Tulsa, live in Houston), as I'm typically gone from the house by 5:30pm CST.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'll be happy to help out with this endeavor when/if I make it back online.  I've done the fangs quite a bit and Xalgoz dropping 2 fangs or 1 fang and 1 sword each time it should move quickly.  Going through some RL sh*t atm so not sure when that will be, but I'll be happy to help out whenever that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aziz Al'Qadir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What is that?<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
Well - if you folks are going to try for some keys - count me in. Have always wanted to check this place out. I have not yet started getting the components, but will be happy to tag along and see what I need to start.  :)  I know we need the fang and the chaddy prockdai thingy bob.<br />
<br />
I'll check the calendar and see when yaz have it scheduled. I can pretty much go anytime during Sunday or a weeknight. Can gate anywhere in the known Norrathian universe, so will log on early if I know ahead of time and can gather all the kids that wanna go if they need a TP. <br />
