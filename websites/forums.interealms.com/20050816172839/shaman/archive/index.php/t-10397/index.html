<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, maybe I'm in the minority of people who only own one account, but its always a big hassle to me trying to find people to transfer items from one character to another. There should be some way to transfer items between characters on your account, perhaps by adding in a slot in your bank that would show up on every char in your account. So you could put some items in a bag in that slot while logged into one char, then log into another char and be able to see those same items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Interesting idea but how do you deal with no drop items? Would you be allowed to transfer no drop items among your chars or would you be unable to use that slot for ND items?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same here, only one account and I think that one global Bank for all your characters is a great idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Didn't think of that, but yeah, you would not be able to place no-drop items into that slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also, didn't think about LORE either. But I'd see that working like you could put a LORE item into the slot. Then when you log onto your other char and you happen to already have that same item, when you try to pull it out of the bag it would give you a message that it is lore and you cannot take it out of the slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I mentioned this same idea on the Jesters board about a week ago, Leo.  If you look at it, I addressed the No Drop issue, and seemed fairly simple to me.  I have no experience with programming, but I can't imagine it would be terribly hard.<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can find the post and cut/paste it here, so I don't have to try and remember what I said...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It would really be a great idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I thought of this ages ago, but then I thought what SoE's responce would be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uses too much server space (mumble)(fart)&quot;<br />
<br />
But then again, they're finding the space to give us more slots in LoY.  Then again we're paying them for it, D'oh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">every zone should have an ATM!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What EQ really needs....... A casino! I don't care what kind of game it is, just make it a 50/50 house/player odds. It'd be fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What would be nice is if this global bank area would be your merchant.  You could put things on it take it off ... set prices and would be available to sell things without you having to be online.  It would also eliminate all the lag in the bazaar with all the players off line set up as merchants.  This guy would not be able to hold anything no drop and lore would function as always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's not an issue of being technically possible, but more that they don't want to add this feature to the game.  They have no interest in making it easy to transfer items between characters on the same account, because the primary use of that (for most people) is twinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">it also would be a serious depaRTURE from role playing.<br />
<br />
This game is supposed to be a online RPG, when u enter norrath with each character u assume THAT characters identity.........<br />
<br />
Guess some eq folk  arent interested in thath side, but you have to expect sony to exploit the roleplaying genre in a way that prolongs our playing time.....hence they dont agree with twinks, as it shortend an accounts lifespan.<br />
<br />
I am ofcourse being a total hypcrite here...i got a couple or few twinks too )</div></div><hr />

while you're at it, lets add an npc that follows you around to each zone and can cast an instant heal whenever you go under 20%.  and since pulling requires you to actually BE AT YOUR COMPUTER, lets allow this npc to do it for us - he will also MT, be main nuker, and randomly hand you items every 30 or so minutes!<br />

:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Just a personal opinion but all the posts I've ever read of yours are never constructive only inanely sarcastic.<br />
Constructive criticism is good for progression, humourless sarcasm is a sadly over used commodity.</div></div><hr />

Sony really doesn't give a rats ass about role playing, they just don't want all the people with seconday mule accounts to cancel them. Wasn't that one of their suggestions for the free accounts they gave out a while ago?</div></div><hr />
