<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Daeneil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Discussing a few things with the other shaman in my guild last night and in an ongoing thread on our board I have a few questions for everyone here.<br />
<br />
1) Does anyone else feel shafted on the quality of our alternate skills verse say a monk that once they max all arch skills is pretty unkillable?  Or say a wizard with Manaburn verse our canabalization skill, which is a very nice skill to have, but unless you have full raid buffs at all times draws way to much aggro or just kills you outright.<br />
<br />
2) New Luclin spell drops.  We have 5 shaman all level 60 in our guild and we all need the same 4 spells to complete our books basically.  We never ever seem to see greater remove curse, group acumen, new lev or new EB drop anywhere EVER.  For such useless spells that only ease up some bag slots from no longer needed components, *** is the deal with their rarity?<br />
<br />
3) Aggro from slow is bordering on too great now.  I used to be able to easily judge/time when to slow mobs in north tov, but after this last mega patch and these disease counters, the new added aggro is a bit harsh imo.  I am tired of dinging back to 60 on each ress personally.  To let you know just how bad it is, I slowed a flurry last night and with 55 people beating the **** out of it form start to finish t NEVER lost aggro on me.  I did not attack it beyond cast 1 DAMN SPELL, tried to duck and back up slowly and ended up haveing to burn about 5 CH to stay alive because the clerics were starting to feel bad for me after my 18th death.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just want some feedback form you guys on this stuff as I am in discussions atm with the verant folks now.  I do NOT want to bitch or moan or complain but these 3 items are making me want to play my alts more and mroe and it bothers me.  Shaman is in my blood from beta to present day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) I'm not wild about our AA Class skills.  I know a lot of melee shaman are really happy about rabid bear, but I think it's a waste.  I'm also infuriated by the alchemy class skill, think /pet hold should have been a pet command all along  and I'm also nearly convinced they made changes to our channeling and fizzling just to let them be &quot;improved&quot; by AA skills.  I'm looking forward to Mass Cann, MGB, 50% increased duration and 50% spell casting time.<br />
<br />
2) Greater Remove Curse appears to be on the same drop table as KEI, Greater Familiar and Group Focus.  The few times I saw it drop, shaman weren't on the list who could use it yet.  EB and lev drop off particular mobs, so if you want those you have to camp them for it.  Is Group Acumen in the game yet?<br />
<br />
3) Slow aggro sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Slow aggro SUCKS, I hate it. Have any of you guys put in feedback in game to let the powers that be know how much this sucks? I was in Seb the other day with a good group and was trying to get used to the new aggro from slows. My guildies and I agreed it was better to just ebolt the mobs then slow them because the slows were generating too much aggro. That sucks. Its totally lame that slow spells have become so difficult to manage. I hope they change this back soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daeneil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Jumping backon my soap box for a minute here.<br />
<br />
Along the lines of slow aggro and major raids like north tov etc...<br />
<br />
It used to be viable to dump some hp and ac to put on resistance gear and still take the assorted shot, but is anyone else saying screw the resistance gear and going full hp/ac on raids anymore in hopes they wont die 999999 times a night form 1 slow?<br />
<br />
Im not all that uber imo and yet can still take a beating more than some, but cmon.<br />
<br />
3877max hp, with 1339ac doesnt do much for me when a Flurry Drake decides im to sexy to live.<br />
<br />
I want natural durability and damage avoidance to replace alchemy skills and rabid bear and I would be happy personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AA Skills<br />
<br />
Verant either:<br />
<br />
1) Has no clear concept of what a shaman is, so they just toss things together based on obvious aspects of the class.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
2) Has a clear concept of what a shaman is, but it's totally wrong.<br />
<br />
I can just see it now...<br />
<br />
a_Verant_lackey_01: &quot;Duuuh, wut iz htis shamun ting?&quot;<br />
<br />
a_Verant_lackey_02: &quot;Hmmm, wel they git lotz uv buffs n they cna do alchumee. They cna maylay bettur thna a pyur castur 2.&quot;<br />
<br />
a_Verant_lackey_01: &quot;O ya, I remembur them now. Those cna b thur AA skillz 2!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ugh.<br />
<br />
Luclin Spells<br />
<br />
Greater Remove Curse - Drops ONLY from Rhag'Zhezum in Ssra<br />
Acumen of the Dar Khura - Nobody has any clue where this drops, or the people who do aren't talking<br />
Levitation - Drops ONLY from the deranged underbulk in the Deep<br />
Everlasting Breath - Drops ONLY from Trilexior Aeridia in the Tenebrous Mts. vampyre castle<br />
<br />
Does this suck? Majorly.<br />
<br />
Slow Aggro<br />
<br />
We have a problem: Giving slow spells disease counters is a good thing, but disease counters cause aggro by nature. Maybe if they just toned down the SIXTEEN counters on Turgur's. I mean, come on, POX (a 2000-POINT DoT) only adds NINE! And it actually does DAMAGE!<br />
<br />
Ugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1.  i LOVE my alternative ability stuff. I can't wait for canabilization.  Quick buff, mass group buff, they all look amazing.  Our arch type stuff rules.  Critical blast is a fun skill to have.  Mental clarity helps alot They all rule and i'm not one bit unsatisfied.  Sure wizards get some amazing things.  IMO rangers do get the best stuff but oh well.  We could have some crappy stuff.<br />
<br />
2.  Shaman spell drops are never good<br />
<br />
3.  Yes slow is a major aggro.  Mainly b/c it's that damn good of a spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">AA - Looking forward to Canni5 and Quickbuff.   I sure wish we could have a defensive version of rabid bear.   I would like a quick auto-dodge disc.   :)<br />
<br />
I also think rangers got the best AA set.<br />
<br />
Luclin spell drops.<br />
Shrug.  If you want the componentless versions, go camp the mobs that drop them.   These aren't just shaman spells, other classes have to go get them too.  Group Acumen should drop in Ssra with group regen and talisman of epuration.  Greater Remove Curse...unless you are fighting the mobs that drop this, you can get by with the lesser Remove Curse just fine, imo.<br />
<br />
Slow agro.  I think Gloriana is mad enough over this, she will corner some devs and beat an answer out of them at the Seattle fanfaire.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">3. Yes slow is a major aggro. Mainly b/c it's that damn good of a spell.<br />
- Was fine before counter changes. Of course Verant's infinite wisdom and the legion of monkey coders managed to screw it up. Even if mob takes 15-20% damage, the moment you slow it's on your arse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah, our class ability skills are lackluster.  Even our arch ones are crappy for the most part (not all).  Ticks me off SK's get two arch abilities, I thought only robe wearing int casters got: the one that lowers agro and one that lowers casting time on beneficial spells.   Those two would of suited our class fine.  Yes, I know we get Quick Buff (even a bit better), but it costs more and you must spend 12 points into an arch ability to get first.<br />
<br />
I have Can5.  It's awesome.  I agree with Gloriana that Rabid Bear is lame.  But guess what?  I'm working to get it anyway, because I'm so tired of the buff oriented crap.  I just want something fun.  I'm probably never going to get MGB.  Waiting to get 12 points  into MC, was bad enough to get Can5.  I don't think I have the patience to save up 9 points.   I have reservations about Spell Casting Reinforcement, because people always die and have to rebuff them anyway.   Quick buff isn't bad.  With Khura's Focusing taking 26 seconds to cast, investing a couple levels into that, would be a good option.<br />
<br />
I know some (maybe many) would disagree, but giving us any healing abilities and spell casting fury was a slap in our face.  We're dead last in both healing (yes, yes Torpor is cool, but so limited) and DD's.   And now with even JBB not functional with Spell Casting Fury, what's the point?  A complete waste.  Many classes have about 4 or so more choices than we do as well.  Why so limit shamans?<br />
<br />
They could of easily given us something like: Improved Defense, Offsense, Double Attack, Damage Over Time (SKs/NEcros get improved lifetaps) or something of the sort.  I truely believe Natural Durability should be available to any class.  I calculated if I had ND3, I would have roughly 400 extra hp.  That may not seem like alot to some, but I could use any hp I can get.<br />
<br />
As far as spells.  I'm missing lev, breath and group acumen.   As some stated above you need to hit The Deep for lev, vamp castle in Tenebrous Mtns. for breath.  With wizards, druids and chanters also able to use those, competition can be rough.   I still have no clue about group acumen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't think the competition on the lev / eb spells are there at all.  The deep is rarely occupied, every time we've needed to go get the spell we walk right up and have no problems.  Sometimes take a bit for it to spawn, but the exp is decent, so we don't mind.<br />
<br />
Every time I've been to vamp castle trilexior is up too, I dunno what his spawn time is.  The spell appears to be uncommon/rare drop though, i'm 0-3 so far.<br />
<br />
Don't think group acumen exists, and if it does, it's not going to make or break anyone to not have it =)<br />
<br />
And yeah, slow agro blows, hopefully they figure out something about it real soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">whoops thought you said group regrowth for some reason, havent seen group acumen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yeah due to the slow aggro i flat out refuse to raid until it's fixed and i'll only exp on stuff i can survive tanking or am able to root and walk away from.  Just tired of eating deaths, even with res it tends to add up after a few and it's just tiresome.  Quite a few other shaman i know are also refusing to raid until it's fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">1.  I am not impressed with our AA skills.  Mass Canni is nice im looking forward to that and quick buff, MGB, but other than that im not impressed.  What would be nice is something like a Dire Slow!  An unresistable Turgurs slow with a long duration would be awesome and very uber.<br />
<br />
2.  I still need almost every Luclin spell drop, but they suck so im not worried.  G Focus is the only one I really want.  I'm still tryin to get Kunark spells for god's sake.<br />
<br />
3.  I haven't had a chance to raid and test the new slow aggro, say in ToV or something like that, but I'll take your word for it.  It sucks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I expect there will be an ancients spell:<br />
Tigger's Bane<br />
80% slow<br />
50% aggro reduced<br />
Possibly low resistance<br />
<br />
Or something like that.  <br />
Slow should have aggro. If you slow a 100k hp mob by 75% you should expect it to get really mad. Changing it was just bringing it inline with the CH aggro changes. Just requires some adjustment in your approach and maybe teamwork with some of the classes doing aggro reducing/aggro creating things to avoid it. Adding the disease counters was a good thing, making our jobs in some areas more complex and diverse (did you ever mem disinfecting aura before?).<br />
<br />
AA skills, the one that is staring the dev team in the face, but they have missed:<br />
Ability to have one spell permanently hotkeyed, taking no gem.<br />
<br />
That would be cool.<br />
<br />
Group acumen i'm guessing due to the silence is not in game. I'm kind of glad it isn't. I hope they are trying to think of something worthwhile.<br />
<br />
I have remove curse. As i'm not constantly fighting cursing mobs, having the greater is not an issue. If you want the greater spell, kill boss mobs in SoL. If you aren't killing boss mobs in SoL you don't need the spell anyway.<br />
<br />
EB and lev? Who cares? Get one of the eb items available and don't worry about it. Lev, with SoE it's less of an issue. Or kill the mobs. You know where they are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;Slow should have aggro.

<br />
<br />
no offense but give me a break.  SLow has always HAD aggro, what it has now is not aggro it's a death sentence and has made slowing a very unfun experience for shaman.  I can't even count how many times the main slower dies on raids.  Start to lose count after 10 or so whereas before maybe only rarely as the aggro was manageable.  Now it's COMPLETELY unmanageable.  The mob stays pissed at you throughout the entire fight no matter what the melee's do.  And if you should get it into your head to cast another spell on the mob?  Forget about living.  You really want to be relegated to casting ONE SPELL every fight then having to stand the rest of the fight or immediately draw aggro assuming they can get it off you in the first place?<br />
<br />
I can take aggro in a fight now ANY time i want from ANYONE.  I'm sorry but the shaman class is not meant nor built to handle that kind of aggro and we are now a serious hinderance to a raid situation as clerics have to now focus on keeping us alive.  If this aggro change was intentional, i think it's time for me to retire the shaman as the mass amount of deaths from here on out, let alone being stuck casting nothing but one spell just doesn't sound like much fun.  Talk about &quot;managing&quot; the aggro all you want, but in quite alot of situations now, that it's darn near impossible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rebasik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i want torpor so bad, its all i ever think about when i log in and when i log off. ive killed juggs(trak lair), numerous kunark dragons, and chardok royals. its depressing seeing the same enc/mage 60 spells over and over.i dont think ill ever get torpor ;( guild makes fun of regularly for bein ghetto, just want torporomg <br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just give us a damn unresistable 25% slow or something that undermines Immunity for these ubermobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">/agree about the componentless Levi and Eb and group acumen. Havent tried THAT hard to get those, but everyone on Ab seems to need those spells, even the ubbers.<br />
 I like our AA skills tho, nothing to complain about the Mass Canni, Being able to cast Torpor in 3 secs, and being able to get over 2k hp's out of it with reinforcement mastery.<br />
 It just takes a lot of work to get there.<br />
 Also I dont mind being able to buff whole raid with one cast, once I have spend all the important AA points to other skills.<br />
 Oh, and who can complain about saving up to 30% mana with just by taking that specialization bonus skill? Or Channeling bonus useless?<br />
 Even tho monks become &quot;unkillable&quot; we already have huge amount of power at lvl 60.'<br />
 Think about Oracle with his AA maxed? Not deadly enough?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Agro doesnt seem to be any different to me. I have done HoT before and after the patches, and did some of the non-named NToV yard trash earlier this evening. (3-4 hours worth) <br />
<br />
Landing slow at about 70-50% health left on mob, would get a few smacks in the face if I got resisted, but otherwise it seemed fine. Didnt die but once (3 ancient wvyerns or something, lol all I saw was really_ticked_mob_01-4 goes on a RAMPAGE)<br />
<br />
POI is major major agro if you doing ID yourself also.<br />
<br />
Seems fine to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">To add to the slow debate, my shaman is 56, and yes, I did notice a large increase in the agro casting shaman slows cause.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I also have a 54 enchanter. Yes, the enchanter slow is about 5 to 10% less slow than the shaman, but I did not notice any increase to the agro caused by slowing mobs. I was slowing mobs all weekend in Seb with the enchanter and never gained agro from slowing, but if I would have been using the shaman, I would have gotten agro almost every time.<br />
<br />
The enchanter slow adds disease counters, too. Maybe it does not add as many, and thats why no agro change, I don't know. There is obviously something wrong though, when one class slow adds agro and another class slow does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">1.  Our AA skills suck besides Can 5 and perhaps Quick Buff.   Even our arch types blow chunks imo.   Why are we getting a pet hold command (anyone use a pet beyond 55?  I sure do not since it is worse than a range for being a mana sieve) and alchemy skill?  Hmm I almost 180 for alchemy and never use it so that was a waste. Then again the whole trade is pointless after shrink potions.<br />
<br />
2.  Spell drops.  Still need that lev, EB from luclin.  Group acumen.  Have not seen it nor do I care anymore since I get so few requests for it (if you have 100+ sta there are no bad effects on draining stamina).  Greater Remove Curse.  Nice spell but has gone to druids in my guild to give them something to do.  I have regular and that is okay for now.  Btw 0 for 8 in TM on the mob that supposedly drops EB one.  No biggie since I have an eb item anyway and most of my friends do as well.<br />
<br />
3.  Slow definitely has more agro and is causing some problems.  As one person said it has been brought into line like Complete Heal.  Hmm if I recall right when they redid the agro for Complete Heal clerics were suddenly dying due to high agro and were starting to use that spell less.  VI had to retweak the agro rate on that spell to make it effective again.  Perhaps it should be checked again for us.   I will agree it does change the stragety on slowing but one thing for sure...if you have to cast slow 2 or times it is near impossible to get rid of that agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Anyone seen trilexior drop the spell lately? I've killed it 14 times now with no luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 54, the enchanter would be using Shiftless Deeds, which adds 12 counters. Forlorn Deeds (at 57) adds 16 like Turgur's. That's a full 25% fewer counters, which could explain it.</div></div><hr />

I found that I had to do this in HoT.  There are benefits to disease based slow, and perhaps those benefits are worth additional risk.  But IMO the risk needs to be retuned to be in line with the modest benefits.  That means decreasing aggro some.<br />
<br />
As for AA class skills, I think rabid bear would be great, but needs to be retuned.  The refresh time makes it near useless.  Something to make shaman a viable melee damage dealer on high level mobs is needed.  Double attack would be useless without increased ATK; it doesn't do any good to miss twice as much.  Alchemy skill would be nice, but heck, I'm not going to spend the next 7 months leveling for it.<br />
<br />
Luclin spell drops?  Who cares?  Group Focus and group regrowth I use all the time.  Talsiman of Epuration is nice, but situational.  Disinfecting aura is ok.  Plague of Insects, ridiculous 25% slow for major aggro.  Every time we do Kromzek captain for the Benevolance quests, I end up tanking him.</div></div><hr />

Umm....NO. I still just right click my pants and cure them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Landing slow at about 70-50% health left on mob, would get a few smacks in the face if I got resisted, but otherwise it seemed fine.<br />
Sorry, but if you have to wait til a mob is 50% dead before you can slow it, it is cutting the usefulness of the spell in half.<br />
<br />
What I find to be wierd also, is that after landing a slow, you can draw aggro up to a minute or so after it landed by just standing there. Almost exactly like a DoT is running on it.<br />
<br />
As for spell drops. Luclin spell drops are fine. They are trivially easy to get in most cases, except for the EB. <br />
Far easier then kunark ones were.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The increased aggro with Slows does take some adjustments but the shaman in my guid look like they have adapted pretty well.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">1 hour respawn for the named vamps.  I killed them four times last night, and didn't get a drop.  Either EB their rare drop, or has been taken off the list.<br />

Two days ago I spent the whole day camping the ledge in Velks with a level 57 enchie.  My slow over-agro'd her mez every single time!  The cleric and melees were a little baffled that mez breaking sent the mobs screaming for the shaman instead of the enchie, but adjusted.  In Kael a couple of days before that, however, the cleric assigned to me did NOT compensate for the high agro rate, and after my 3rd rez in 10 minutes, I was told to just do backup heals and keep everyone buffed.  Seems like a waste of a perfectly good shaman to me.<br />
<br />
As for adjusting WHEN to Turgur a mob... it doesn't make much sense to me to wait until it is at 50% to slow the bugger.  Isn't the idea of slowing them to keep them from smooshin the MA from the outset?<br />

 Even tho monks become &quot;unkillable&quot; we already have huge amount of power at lvl 60.'<br />
 Think about Oracle with his AA maxed? Not deadly enough? <br />
<br />
I'm scratching my head, trying to figure out how our AA skills makes us &quot;deadly.&quot;  Last I experienced, torpor doesn't kill anyone.  Can5 doen't do damage to anyone else, but yourself.   A longer lasting Focus doesn't kill people...</div></div><hr />

1 hour respawn for the named vamps.  I killed them four times last night, and didn't get a drop.  Either EB their rare drop, or has been taken off the list.<br />
<br />
It's rare. Around 1 in 20 or so.<br />
<br />
/rant on<br />
<br />
Why the $^*#% is a reagentless enduring breath spell the rare drop from a 50+ enchanter NPC?! God forbid every druid, shaman, and enchanter be reasonably able to get this at 51, lest their insidious power to not breathe destroy all life as we know it!!!<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
As for slow aggro, hell, better me tanking a mob than an enchanter. It's still too much, but at least I can take the hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">1) Slow agro is so damn stupid we (the 7 shamans of my guild) call Malo as fast as we can so we stick another poor sucker with slowing. *hint* Call Malosini, hehe, its a viable debuff and keeps you verticle.<br />
2)Ok, yea group focus saves me time and mana but does anyone else see a BS trend here? The only new spells we got (50+) are basically convieniant group versions of spells we had. And why does Epuration out last group focus? That, my fellow shamans, is my biggest peave. Epuration, Ageo/group ageo, circle of summer, Brells mount, KEI ALL last longer. Our main buff that is most requested is the shortest duration of all lvl 60 group buffs? *Please, don't hide behind some lame ass AA skill to bring our buff duration up to speed, we should not have to invest our AA points to make our 1250 mana spell last as long as other class's buffs do from the time they are scribed.*<br />
3) Pet disc? what the hell is this? Give me a damn pet AA skill...Rabid wolf or whatever, but make it like a lvl 42 pet that does all that the frenzied spirit does. I might actually summon a pet then. <br />
4) Alchemy AA ability? the one or two failures i get making a gate potion is worth the time i save by obtaining other means. Make it so your potions all are 5,10,20% more effective, Id use that then i think.<br />
5)Where is the DD's? we get a 675 dd spell that is cold based. thnx, i like it and i use it but now clerics have a 975(?) DD spell that totally owns ours? Lame<br />
<br />
The 59 abilities kinda suckj but look at clerics and morn for them. A worthless ass 100% single res that is like1 hour refresh? Is 4% exp worth that much? No. It just goes to prove that verant knows jack and sh!t about the game and what is really neccessary to make a class unique yet balanced. Oh well, not like VI has ever listened in the past they damn sure won't start now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sabiniz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I agree with Cantiz here, but torrent x 9 is *decent* damage.<br />
<br />
our aa skills suck besides rabidbear mgb canni V, i dont even use a pet anymore at 60..<br />
<br />
oh well , maybe they will actually listen to us, but i dunno heh.</div></div><hr />
