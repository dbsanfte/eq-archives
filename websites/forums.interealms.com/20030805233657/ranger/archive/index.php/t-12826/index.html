I Like Everquest.  I think the Customer Service does NOT Suck.  I think the Game Developers have done a tremendous job.  I do not fault Sony for including features in expansions in order to sell more of said expansions.<br />
<br />
I will expand:<br />
<br />
Customer Service:  Over my 3.5 years of playing Everquest, I have had maybe 6 occassions to petition or call Customer Service.  On each occassion, they have been helpful and friendly.  I have not always been given the answer I hoped for, but what help could be given was.  I understand when they can't help me because &quot;if they do it for me, they have to do it for everyone&quot; and frankly, everyone is not as reasonable as I am :)<br />
<br />
Game Developers: I rarely hear praise of these folks, and yet look at the world they have created!  It is tremendously complex.  When they develop features, they do so in a small environment, then test in a slightly larger test server.  Things can change dramatically (for good or ill) when it is released to 3000 uniquely clever people at the same time.  <br />
<br />
When things DO work out, or work better than intended, great.   They get flamed because it &quot;unbalances&quot; the game for those that were not affected.  When the change works out badly, they get flamed for the error, and they get flamed for correcting it.  <br />
<br />
'Greedy' Sony: They are in business to make money.  They can choose which features to include as part of an expansion or as an update.  We have gotten many, MANY features, zones, and other enhancements without cost that were not part of the game you purchased.  They chose to include some of the new features in PoP, that is fine by me.  I am still entertained, I am still buying.<br />
<br />
This game has evolved tremendously since it's inception.  On the whole, I think the changes have been for the better, even though new players have it easier than I did.<br />
<br />
To think I could take the $12 per month that entertains me for 100 hours of fun, and spend it on a 2 hour movie, play 4 holes of golf, play in a casino for 15 minutes (on average), go to dinner (at Mcdonalds, or buffet here).  No, I like the $12 right where it goes now, and will continue to go for some time.<br />
<br />
Thanks for listening</div></div><hr />

Kidding....I agree... yes, I've had issues with customer service, but this game is still one of the best values out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hopwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go /petition for something simple like a surname change. Then go to the driving range and tell the ball boy you threw your club out into the range... see which is more satisfying CS :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only problem I've ever had is with trying to GET customer service. I've never had a petition answered - NEVER. My husband can get on and peition about my problem, and then I'll finally get some help, but not one of mine has ever received a single answer. That's not a very good percentage, I'm thinking...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've had a GM help me once, and he was nice about it, because it was a game glitch. I was froze, and couldn't move, despite the game showing me I was, so he got me to the zone line. I didn't go near that area again. However, I have petitioned for somethings that have never gotten answered which were gripes that I had. <br />
<br />
My major gripe with customer service is only when servers collapse, which Lanys has seen a LOT of lately. Hunting in Runnyeye for 2 Days farming a suit of Blackened Alloy Armor is not the easiest thing to do for a Ranger solo at level 40, but I did it, against all of the casters and everything. I was missing the collar, and only the collar, and when I looted it, the server crashed. Now, they cannot replace this meager piece of gear, because the server crashed, which is an error on their end, and you are screwed. Now, I understand not giving,say, a Matchless Dragonhide Breastplate to everyone in the Western Wastes when the server crashes, as that's insane, and I'd probably go and sit in that zone until the server did crash for one. I don't, however, understand why, if they can see you are still in that zone, and have a record of what you were fighting at the time, why they cannot give you a free 100% rez, and the item you claim was on that corpse at the time you were looting. The rez if you die only is an obvious there.<br />
<br />
Or, really, what would be nice is if they would finally just tell us they are trashing Lanys and give us all transfers with gear to other servers.</div></div><hr />

Most of the people involved in creating this game are not the same people who were around as long as a year ago.  Many of the problems in the game are not due to simple mistakes, but by and large simple stupidity.  From beginning to end, nearly all of Luclin was just horrible.  Terrible.  I say there is no excuse for demanding $30 for what amounted to a box filled with dog crap in the shape of a CD.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of recent changes have simply made lower level life easier.  Frankly, in today's world of twinks-galore, it was easy enough anyway; I don't see why they don't just chop off the first 10 levels, and give you 55 skill points in every skill and make the game level range 1 to 55.<br />
<br />
Most of the changes to high-end play have been pretty bad.  Experience nerfage was here and gone; apparently it wasn't even the same system they had put on Test, which shows just how useful Test is.  The resistance system screwed over anyone below 60; while I like a challenge, that does not mean that level 60's with 200 in a resist should be eaten up by AEs.  What's the point of resists when, instead of not making a difference past 150, they simply don't make a difference at all?<br />

Lets say you buy EQ and can't join groups because you only bought &quot;EQ Lite.&quot;  You have to pay $30 more for, likely, more content than you had even wanted, just to be able to group.  Hello raid experience system.<br />
<br />
So many features in this game have been promised &quot;for the masses&quot; only to later be rewritten to &quot;for the masses willing to shell out $30 more.&quot;  Raid experience should have been given to everyone, as buggy as it seems.<br />
<br />
Yes, Sony, like MicroSoft, can &quot;choose which features to include.&quot;  But, like MicroSoft, Sony is toeing the line.  Just across that line is a customer about to punch you in the face, because you kicked him in the shin and demanded he pay you for it.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I have to assume someone so &quot;happy&quot; with such a company, has little to no experience with the kinds of issues that produce such a huge complainant-userbase.<br />

I say there is no excuse for demanding $30 for what amounted to a box filled with dog crap in the shape of a CD.<br />
<br />
1) I have actually been fairly happy with Luclin.  <br />
2) Anyone who is a programmer (which I have been for 25 years) knows one simple truth: No mistake is a secret.  No mistake is trivial.  Every error, or misjudgement, or miscalculation is right out there for your entire user base to see.  There will be volumes of memos written by users for every simple, stupid mistake you make.  User mistakes and screwups, on the other hand, are understandable.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of recent changes have simply made lower level life easier.  Frankly, in today's world of twinks-galore, it was easy enough anyway; I don't see why they don't just chop off the first 10 levels, and give you 55 skill points in every skill and make the game level range 1 to 55.<br />
<br />
Because there are still plenty of true newbies out there.  Our view of newbies tends to be skewed when we have leveled 8 or 10 characters to a respectable level.  There ARE many true newbies out there.  The changes they made for newbies are great (per my son, per some of his friends, who are indeed true newbies).<br />
<br />
Most of the changes to high-end play have been pretty bad.  Experience nerfage was here and gone; apparently it wasn't even the same system they had put on Test, which shows just how useful Test is.

What's the point of resists when, instead of not making a difference past 150, they simply don't make a difference at all?<br />
<br />
Reread 2) above.  A test environment approximates a production environment, but (as any programmmer can tell you) the stresses of a production environment can change everything.  Plus, users are very clever, and do things you never expected sometimes, try things that make no sense, and discover work arounds never dreamed by the developers.  This, again, is a case where the change didn't work as expected, they get flamed, the change it to what they intended, and they get flamed, they change it back, and they get flamed.<br />
<br />
And No, it didn't screw over anyone below 60.  I was there.  My family was there. My guild was there.  We continued playing as normal.  <br />
<br />
Lets say you buy EQ and can't join groups because you only bought &quot;EQ Lite.&quot;  You have to pay $30 more for, likely, more content than you had even wanted, just to be able to group.  Hello raid experience system.<br />
<br />
I would venture a guess that the majority of us customers have more content than they need or want.  I have never been to many zones, or every spot in zones I frequent.  I have PoP, have yet to use 95% of those zones, I have Luclin, still haven't been to perhaps 30% of those zones, I have Vellious, still haven't been to about 15% of those zone, on the original EQ there are still at least 4 zones I have not stepped foot in.  THIS IS A BAD THING?  Better too much content than too little!<br />
<br />
So many features in this game have been promised &quot;for the masses&quot; only to later be rewritten to &quot;for the masses willing to shell out $30 more.&quot;  Raid experience should have been given to everyone, as buggy as it seems.<br />
<br />
There there are those features that were promised as part of an expansion that were released beforehand.  Raid Experience is a no win for Sony... I have heard many say it is useless because of the loss of Xp, people won't use it.  It is buggy, people won't use it.  These same people say it should be given to everyone, presumably not to use? ::boggle::<br />
<br />
As I recall, the New UI was to be a Luclin only item, but they chose to release it to everyone.  Bad Sony! <br />
<br />
Yes, Sony, like MicroSoft, can &quot;choose which features to include.&quot;  But, like MicroSoft, Sony is toeing the line.  Just across that line is a customer about to punch you in the face, because you kicked him in the shin and demanded he pay you for it.<br />
<br />
I and many that I know have not experienced this terrible customer service.  Sony has not harmed me as they have apparently harmed you.  Perhaps we have different expectations, who knows?<br />
<br />
Frankly, I have to assume someone so &quot;happy&quot; with such a company, has little to no experience with the kinds of issues that produce such a huge complainant-userbase.<br />
<br />
Assumption is the mother of all screw-ups!  There are well over 100,000 subscribers to EQ.  I see the same few hundred folks SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS everytime Sony moves.  I submit that the VAST MAJORITY of players are happy with this game, and enjoy it quietly.<br />
<br />
And then there is the obvious question:  Why are you still involved with EQ if the product is so terrible?  There must be some overwhelmingly redeming quality that keeps you around, that makes all these 'flaws' you've itemized a secondary issue to whatever compensation you get from being here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tekk, I don't think your view is unpopular at all. The fact of the matter is, EQ is hands down the most cost-effective form of entertainment there is. Even regular TV isn't this cheap (when you consider the electric bill that comes with using a TV).<br />
<br />
Here's the deal though. EQ players are passionate about the game and their characters. They've spent days, weeks, months, YEARS developing them so they feel they have a sizable stake in how the game turns out. This isn't a bad thing and you know this from your programming background. 989 Studios/Verant/SoE knew that in order for their game to be truly successful, people would have to become attached to their characters which breeds passion. They also knew the downside of creating such a passionate environment.<br />
<br />
You're right, their testbed is really small in comparison to the playerbase at large. In addition, there are many people who play on Test who have never played a character to the level their Test characters are at. That's very limiting. There are some issues that would never occur on Test. Like, how many times does Temple of Veeshan have 120+ people in it on Test? Happens (or happened) a lot on the older proddy servers. Test is also a mainly cooperative environment (by this I mean the players are a lot more friendly to each other, since the community is so small). You can't find bugs that can be exploited in a purely malicious manner unless you have people willing and able to use them. Anyone remember the zone crash bug? <br />
<br />
My main problem with SoE as it relates to EQ is how they prioritize things. Bugs that harm  the players are low priority but if a bug actually helps the player, omg emergency patch asap! Also, I love it how they allow &quot;bugs&quot; concerning loot tables and the like to stay in for the first week an expansion comes out then drastically kill the drop rate on anything with any inherent desirability to the players (parchments, windblade/girdle of mithaniel, etc) after that first watershed period.<br />
<br />
That said, I enjoy playing the game, warts and all. Fact of the matter is, you get what you pay for usually. Given the amount of hours I play in a typical month, I'm paying like 6 to 8 CENTS per hour to be entertained playing EQ (yes, I did the math last month :p). Just like I wouldn't buy a Kia Sephia and expect to get all the features and bells and whistles that come with a Bentley Azure, the same goes for EQ. Besides that, I realize the 'multiplayer' aspect adds a TON of issues all its own. If EQ was a single player game, it probably could be much better in terms of QA.<br />
<br />
<br />
The game rocks but as with most things, it could always be made better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Salty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Besides being less expensive than Satelite/Cable, EQ is often more interesting (Mole, Survivor, Elimidate, etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
When we still had server GMs I never failed to at least have any petition that I submitted answered (probably about a dozen total over almost 3 years).<br />
<br />
Since that time I think I have had 3 (and I am trying to remember if I actually petitioned a 4th or not) that were not answered at all, ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Spritle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">So much talk and blame on the programmers and developers.  I truly wonder how much real authority they have to make any changes.  You know good and well that EQ is a sacred cow as long as it lines the coffers of Sony's bank account.  <br />
<br />
Wouldn't surprise me at all if some fat cats in business suits had the final say on tweaking anything in the game that might jeopardize the cash flow.<br />
<br />
EQ Developer: &quot;Sir, we're getting several reports of problems with the current riposte damage from dual wield in tier 2 zones.  I have the latest server stats and a proposal to fix it. Can we call for an emergency patch this weekend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fat Cat Board Member: &quot;Hmm. Hang on.&quot;  &lt;punches intecom button&gt; &quot;Ms. Moneypenny, what's the weekly net profit on EQ subscriptions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ms. Moneypenny: &quot;Sales are up .3 percent and the shareholders meeting is next week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fat Cat Board Member: &lt;scowls and shuffles through some papers on his desk&gt; &quot;No patches for now.  Get back to work on those frogs.  Marketing wants to see more frog models.&quot;<br />
