<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TaneaGreanriver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Looks like a good place for a second question about endless quiver. :) Am I correct in assuming that with endless quiver there is no advantage to keeping my fleeting quiver on me anymore? I though that EQ replaced the haste from my quiver but I sure don't want to miss out on extra haste if it would stack.<br />

It just means you don't lose arrows as you fire...  1 is all you need...</div></div><hr />
