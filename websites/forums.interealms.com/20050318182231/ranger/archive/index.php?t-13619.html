I happen to be a fan of Lore and well, I was rather dissapointed with Luclin.  I am thoroughly enjoying this expansion and thought I would share some of the Lore. This starts with some background information and goes on to explain why we want to go to the Plane of Time.  If you are a fan of lore, or simply wish to know, enjoy. If you are looking for any kind of spoiler information, this is not the thread for you. <br />

If you have not gathered as much from your work thus far, we seek to find Zebuxoruk. As the followers of balance we seek his insight. He was the first to give mortals a true sense of our real power. The unfathomable concept that a mortal could gain an understanding of the immortal realms was wholly new and beyond the grasp of most. Those that did gain an understanding of Zebuxoruk's teachings rose in power. <br />
<br />
Though, others defied the core principles of balance and drove themselves insane in the process. The Shissar are an example of what can happen when you stray from the path of balance. Their power-crazed nature led to the misuse of Zebuxoruk's gift of insight and it drove them mad as a race. Their egotistical nature was their curse and it attracted the attention of the elder gods. The Sebilisian history is full of stories of such power, both positive and negative. <br />
<br />
There are many key examples in Kunark's history that can assist in the understanding of the balance. The knowledge that mortals wield can build empires or reduce them to ruins. Mortals have followed Zebuxoruk's path for some time. His teachings helped to alter the path of several empires. The Sebilisians, the Combine, even groups that felt they were working under the divine influence of others gods were following teachings set into the mortal realm by Zebuxoruk. <br />
<br />
Those that understood his teachings and began to follow him eventually learned of his fate. The enlightenment of mortals was not something that pleased many of the deities within the greater pantheon. Zebuxoruk's heretical teachings set the power of the pantheon upon him. There are many stories that describe his capture by the elder gods and their punishment. Until recently, we have not been able to completely decipher the truth. That is what we have been working on. Our people have been opening portals for ages, in the hopes of finding more information about Zebuxoruk's fate. <br />
<br />
The first portals into the realms of the gods were opened by our kind. The knowledge of these portals eventually made its way to other mortals. Naturally, curiousity and lust for power drove other mortals in to the Planes. The defilement of these sacred territories led the pantheon to feel even more justified in their persecution of Zebuxoruk and his followers. It set the momentum that brought us to this place and time. Now, you have found the location for us. We wait only on your final incursions into the elemental Planes, the true Planes of Power. Then we will move through time to finally find the answers that have been waiting us for so long.....<br />

The only way to free him now is to destroy the god herself.</div></div><hr />
