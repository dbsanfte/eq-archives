That's cute - and what exactly made you think I didn't do this to bring up this topic?<br />
What happened was that a mage gave my pet the full pack, including weapons, but I noticed that he was still kicking, bashing and biting so I decided to pass  the little thing a few random weapons i had picked up, this was a whip and a club, so by old standards he should now be slashing and crushing on top of kicking and bashing. This was not the case - but since I haven't had time to play since, I posted this in case someone else had noticed something similar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if you get the fists from a mage, its h2h so you will not see any thing else then biting and bashing, but if you look at the hits they should be mostly 60s and then you got the proc, if you want to see the slashing then you need to get the swords from a mage and not the fists</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks, must have been something the mage gave the poor little puppy - can mages summon &quot;martial&quot; weapons that would make him dual wield, but still leave him biting ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, you probably posted at the same time as lightus_rn, but any hand to hand weaponry (Fist of Ixiblat) will result in still getting a &quot;Bite&quot; attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ah okies, thanks, must have been the reason, and since it was already wielding stuff, the whip and club I gave was just excess. <br />
<br />
I should group more with mages :)</div></div><hr />
