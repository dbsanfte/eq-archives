<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been soloing in DSP from 34-38 and it's been good, but now at 38 I'm having some trouble. The mobs that con dk blue to me are getting harder to find, and the dk blue ones that actually give decent exp is even less common. Also a lot of the Dk blues have tons of HP and I personally think undercon a lot (maybe I just really need my 39 spells). <br />
<br />
anyways, enough about why DSP is sucking... I need a new place... I've been thinking OT, I trie dit out before at 36 and the sarnaks were doable, gave good exp, but I had a fairly long downtime due to their difficulty at that level. i'm thinking they might be easier, or maybe I could just beat up on cactus and other various stuff there.<br />
<br />
Basically I'm just looking for any specific spots people have found to give great exp. I'd love to find another spot that gave me 1/2 a blue for each kill (zelniaks in DSP did) when soloing, that hopefully dont take 20 minutes of pet kiting to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well I went to the Overthere and the exp was good. The monsters seemed more difficult than the ones in DSP, and I found myself pit kiting a lot more instead of the slow-&gt;DoT-&gt;melee to death method that I was using in DSP. The mobs hit harder in OT. They dont come close to killing me, but they do make my downtime much longer becuase of mana wasted on heals. SO I pet kite, and fetch just a bit under half a blue for each kill. Good exp. <br />
<br />
And once I hit 39, VoS will speed things up dramatically, I'm thinking.<br />
<br />
But I'm still open to suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What race are ya' Penny. At 38 and 39 the corrupt guards in West Commons are prety easy and nice experience.  Much easier at 39 though. I'm just slowing with Walking Sleep, one VoS and mele. If you're not evil another option is the Ulthorks in Eastern Wastes. That's where I'm headed next. They drop OK loot and occasionaly drop tusks. Save the tusks and turn 4 at a time in to the Othmir Chief Kalan. From what people on EQ Traders report there's about a 25% chance of geting a Blue Diamond from him. Those things still go for quite a bit in the Bazzar. Stonebrunt might be worth looking in to with the exp bonus for the zone. That's all I can think of for now. Good luck. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eq_newb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i was stuck at 36 for a while recently,was soloing hg's and got tired of it, posted here and one of suggestions was DL. i went to the ruins area right as i dinged 36, saw a 46 bst lfg and we teamed up. it was great xp, he just kept single pulling id slow and weaken it, hed tank, and wed have our pets chewing their rears. a lot of them were red to me, i just dinged 39 after our 3rd session together, about 6 hours total. since we both had kei, and he had virtue, it was nonstop pulling and fightin, kinda fun actually becasue i got to do some meleeing :) loot wasnt that great, around 3-5 pp most of them, with items that sold for 1pp on average. got 2 peridots, and sometimes the drovlargs drop plate armor that sell for 3-4pp (with 141 cha or so, ally vendor). think i might have made a few hundred plat in the 6 hours, btu i really needed levelling as i was stuck in the mid 30s forever. id definitely recommend this place for a duo, my guess a casting melee class with pet,like sk or bst, would be better than a regular warrior, just my opinion. actually havent grouped since i got my new spells, so my guess it would be a  little easeir with the better slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I say gunthrak, exp is above average, the agro range is small and loot is better than kunark. There are a few spots you can sit and not worry about trains, wondering mobs and have more than enough to pull.<br />
<br />
I was teamed shaman at 44-45 and warrior 41-43 there and was pulling non stop just keeping bihli up, cloro on both and alac on melee. that was it. I had it down to. pull slow canni (I have a macro that does it 3x) sit, warrior tank. no need to root, most are undead and will stay in da face. next pull only difference is canni 2x (6x) and heal warrior.<br />
<br />
of course solo it would be different (as you don't get to med while fighting, and will use more mana for dots and such), but I don't see downtime as being more than a minute, especially with KEI, probably less than a minute.<br />
<br />
and once you get your new dot, this place will be a lot nicer.<br />
<br />
downside is it is a mini trek to get there by todays standards, and I think that now that the newness is wearing down a bit people aren't going there heavily, but hey, that is just more pulls for you!<br />
<br />
xp will drop at 43.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fathum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hunted in DSP from about level 27 to level 32.  After that I went to SolA until 40.  If you're looking for another pretty good place for exp, try out lower guk or SolB.  However, these places can get pretty packed, and if you don't know your way around, you may get overwhelmed pretty quickly.<br />
Anyone have any suggestions besides those two zones?<br />
