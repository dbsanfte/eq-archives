<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">or just increase arachnae venom to 14 minute duration!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">this makes me undeniably sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Decrease Movement by 41% (L1) to 55% (L15) <br />
3:  Decrease Hate by 150</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The problem isn't the effect's ... erm, effects, per se, its the duration.<br />
<br />
Arachnae Venom<br />
1 ticks @L1 to 1 min @L20<br />
<br />
Ensnare<br />
6.8 mins @L29 to 14.0 mins @L65<br />
<br />
In a lot of cases, a 13 min longer snare is preferable, especially when you're depending on a proc to keep it maintained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree, lets all bug this. The proc is useless now, you can just go get the hammer of spirit calling if you wanna snare over this thing. Its trash now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The hate reduction is nice, but I agree that the duration being shorter isnt cool.  The ratio and hp/mana increases are really nice though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They just need to increase the proc rate on, to the proc rate of the cleric hammers.. Then it will have some utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One way or another, it needs a change. Preferable back to ensnare. Or make this version clickable at 4 seconds with a 15 second recast.</div></div><hr />

I may get some people mad at me about this ,but I think VP should be like it was origionally in the sense of no-gate,no-port out.<br />
   Theres no zones anymore that medium guilds Wont enter even if they had access too,and top guilds are hesitant about.<br />
    One thing that made the game become boring for me was the lack of fear.The funnest times Ive ever had in EQ I was scared out my shorts.<br />
Graveyards,portstones,and similar deals really took the fear out of playing EQ.<br />
     Should you be afraid of(in) a video game? in one like this sure,in the RP aspect of it all,ya cant tell me that your char wouldnt be scared of going up against Rallos Zek,even if you had a ton of hearty adventurers with you.The only thing Ive ever worried about with him was&quot;how long till I get my rez&quot; or something similar.Imo,it should be &quot;omg,what happens if I challenge the god of war and die?How do I get my mortal corpse back from under the hand of a deiety?&quot;Not saying you shouldnt have a way of recovering from something hrrible,but the Fear of losing my corpse was a huge driving factor in my playstyle before PoP(or maybe even luclin)<br />
     This all being said,if they did this with the present VP they should put ensnare back on the spear 8D<br />
     /ducks the many spear thrusts to the eyes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The lack of gates out of VP didn't scare me. Creating all the bodies outside to get rezzed out sure annoyed me though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh heh.....try IK when GoD first came out and your group was the only one in KT (not unusuall back then). Allmost all the mobs around the temples were see invis at that time, and it made for some interesting CRs without SoS or corpse summoners ;)<br />
<br />
[Edit: for those of you who dont know, to get into the IK trials you do kamikazi runs through hordes of 1300+ hitters behind a DAed cleric or pally :)]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is it just the new version with the screwed up proc, or are old ones affected as well?</div></div><hr />
