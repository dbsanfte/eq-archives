I went into Stop and Shop once at about 3 in the morning and caught a friend of mine on the night crew driving around one of those electric carts they have for the elderly. Then his boss rode around the corner on one five minutes later...</div></div><hr />

Electronic ones are cheating.  You've gotta use the manual ones.  Used to do that in the warehouse I managed every now and then.<br />

As I'm in the IT industry, usually it's afterhours Quake-fests...</div></div><hr />

Baggete (sp?) baseball is always fun...   stompin' the sour dough soup bowls and using them as frisbees is really fun, too. :)</div></div><hr />

After the Mall closed and before we left  we would take the Wheelchairs that they have there for people to use and Race around the mall.  About two months before I left they upgraded and got Electric carts,  Didn't go as fast but just as fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
At our local Wal Mart we set up a huge war across an entire aisle with X-Men, Star Wars figures, Gi Joes, the whole nine yards.  Soldiers were flying in on planes we hung from the top of the racks, they were everywhere.  <br />
<br />
We also did a few rather immature things with the Tickle Me Elmo's and Bouncing Tigers more than once, and nearly got kicked out for it.  That was a few years back. ;) <br />
<br />
At a restaurant I work at now we have super strong trash bags.  We fill them up with the water, climb up to the roof and let 'em fly onto each other's cars.  <br />
<br />
We do the stereotypical race with little kids bikes, roller blades, golf inside the store, dodgeball inside, that stuff to.  <br />
<br />
Reading the stuff I just typed I realized, I'm a month from graduating high school and I still haven't grown up at all. I hope I stay that way.:p</div></div><hr />

If I feel like making a fool of myself, I'll do it without the alcohol next time.</div></div><hr />
