<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I keep hearing the number 51 AP for success.  As a 61 shaman grouped with 2 other low 60's and 2 65's I got 29 AP's for each of the three sucessful adventures.  Will i get more AP's without the lvl 65's?  Or is there something else going on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The higher level YOU are the higher points you get. The points you get as nothing to do with the other people in your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is incorrect sadly, it seems to be based on the average level of the group and its a very steep curve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh, my 35 monk got THREE AP.  I had to save to buy one of those ****ty AC charms.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">was in a group, all were lvl 65 except a pally who was 64.  We all recieved 51 Points, the pally got 49 or something.  Not positive of exact number but was less than the rest of us.  So its not Avgs, seems to be lvl based per player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hmm i definitly was wrong. Its not just based on level. Lots of people below 60 are saying they get a different ammount of points for each adventure they do, but all the 65s i talked to (including myself) got 51 points per adventure no matter what. I don't really know what exactly its based on but i'm pretty sure if your 65 you get 51 points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's based on both. The higher level you are the more points you get, the higher the average level of the group the more points you get. At 65 if the average level of the group is around 62 I'll get like 41 points, if the average level of the group is 65 I'll get the full 51. The level 65's will always get more points than the lower levels in the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was only non-65 in a grp (lvl 59) and got 41 pts.<br />
I was in a grp where lvls ranged from 57 - 61 (still lv 59) and got 31 pts.<br />
<br />
Also did 2 different types of missions (kill XX mobs and collect XX widgets).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The points you get, are based on YOUR level, versus the level of the Adventure you get.<br />
<br />
Your level is pretty self explanatory... higher your level, the  more points you get.<br />
<br />
The dungeon level... is based on the average level of your group.<br />
<br />
If the average level of your group, is 63.00 or higher... you will get a &quot;Level 65 adventure&quot;.     In a 65-A Level 65s will get 51 pts.<br />
<br />
If your average group level is 60.00 to 62.99 you will get a level 60 Adventure.    This adventure will be easy for level 65s in the group... you'll notice less hp mobs, less powerful spells/traps.... you'll basically kill a lot faster.<br />
<br />
In a 60-A level 65s will get 34 points.<br />
<br />
I've tested this several times over the last couple of days... I was sick of getting 51 points this time, and 34 next time... I don't always group with a full group of 65s... many of my friends are 59-65.<br />
<br />
Selecting the HARD setting... will bump your Adventure level by 5.<br />
<br />
If your adventure is level 60... and you select hard... it will be the Normal adventure for a group of level 65s (65-A).    If you're in the level 65-A and you select hard, you get bumped to level 70-A which is the nasty 900 hitters.<br />
<br />
Yes , I've tested it.</div></div><hr />

Hail,<br />
<br />
Froggie Sariss is right.  Great info &amp; thanks for sharing!<br />
I'm personally looking for 2 other 65's and then 3 other people whose  level is above 61 when I create LDoN groups, thus assuring I'll get the full 51 points for success.  The 60-62.99 adventures are MUCH easier than the 63+ average group member designed dungeons, though you still have to be careful.  The first time you get 34 points instead of 51 makes the Success victory message a bit less thrilling.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was in a group with 3 65's, 2 63's, and a 60. We did a MM adventure at normal level and won. I got 51 points and my 63 friend told me she got 47. We tried another one with the same group and we failed. Took us another 5 min. to complete the adventure for the lesser reward, grrrr. I got 13 points and my 63 friend got 16? Has anyone else seen this or was maybe her math off?</div></div><hr />
