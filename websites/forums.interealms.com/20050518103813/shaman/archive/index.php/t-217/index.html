Also how is 49+ ? Are we any more powerful?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, I love these threads.    Fungi, coldain skin gloves, ivory collar, JBB, flayed turmoil skin belt...you would DIE if you knew what I was wearing back at 45.  (To give you a clue, I was finally able to loot jarsath pants at 54).<br />
<br />
I think your gear is wonderful for your level, I would only suggest maybe ditching the mask for maybe an enshrouded veil.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wolvenborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I'm 42 (been around a long time though) so know of maybe one upgrade for ya.<br />
<br />
Switch out your shield for a Strathbone Shell Shield.<br />
<br />
AC19<br />
Wis8<br />
<br />
cler/shm only<br />
<br />
<br />
They shouldn't be all that expensive, and you could probably just go to Kaesora and get one yourself if you really wanted to.  Good AC/Wis upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 49 introduces some great spells, especially if you solo: Envenomed Bolt, Plague, Rage, new pet. I wish I had been playing my Shaman pre-Kunark because I have to assume that we were seriously overpowered at Level 50 at that time.<br />
<br />
Grouped, you probably won't get as much use out of these spells. I use Envenomed Bolt sometimes in a small party that is low on melee output and healing (i.e., when duoing). Malosi is a very worthwhile spell if you have a bunch of casters in the party. New Strength and Dexterity buffs make the melees feel good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Or profiles are a lot alike- and since I've given a little thought to what I need- this might help.  :) <br />
<br />
Possible upgrades:<br />
<br />
Seahorse cloak (great AC, I'd still keep the AW for wis, though)<br />
<br />
Crystal Chitin arms/gloves<br />
<br />
Dragon legs, bracer (good luck finding these- I've been looking forever) - sentry bracer is a nice upgrade to totemic that's easier to find.<br />
<br />
Shoulders:  Elder wolf hide, Chokadai hide (wis), or Imbued granite spaulders (ac, resists)<br />
<br />
Crystal chitin shield for wis/mana or Clay guardian/Sarnak for AC/HP) - Clay guardians are mega-cheap now- 25 AC, +50 HP.<br />
<br />
Shadel bandit ring<br />
<br />
That's about it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well your gear looks fine. A couple upgrades that I would do is get a higher ac shield such as a Sarnak battleshield ac25 and +10 all resists or the quest shield in Ten. mts its ac25 wis20. Money it seems is not a problem.<br />
<br />
level 49 is a nice level for spells. Malosi, EB, plague a new pet. Probably the best level since 34. Level 51 is great also with Turgors and superior heal.</div></div><hr />
