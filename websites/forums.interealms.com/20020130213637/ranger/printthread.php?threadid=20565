<p>Well it seems that there are lots of threads with questions about this so hopefully my post will clear things up enough for everyone.<br />
<br />
The quest involves 2 mobs.  One is Vluudeen, a reddish-brown wurm in the Great Divide.  I usually find him sitting in the hall on the way to the crystaline shardwurm cave.  The other is Gleed Dragonhunter, a frost giant that is on the way to King Tormax.<br />
<br />
Vluudeen carries Vluudeen's tail:<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.schrade.com/eq/zones/greatdivide/ID-VluudeensTail.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Vluudeen is blue to a level 60 and has lots of hit points.  I'd say over 10000 hit points.  Once you kill him and get his tail, you can attempt to turn the tail in for the Bow of the Huntsman.<br />
<br />
<b>You must have non-KOS Storm Giant faction! (Kromzek)</b><br />
<br />
There are several see-invis Storm Giants on the way to the area where Gleed Dragonhunter is.  It's ok if Gleed is KOS to you.. you'll be sneaking behind him the whole time <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Once you have checked your faction with Storm Giants and are not KoS, you can attempt to turn in the tail to Gleed for the bow.<br />
<br />
The path you take to Gleed is shown on the map below.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.schrade.com/eq/zones/kael/Gleed3.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
In the picture below you see me standing in front of a flag.  Below that flag in the lower area is where Gleed Dragonhunter stands.  You can sneak at the point where I am standing in the picture.  Test it by targetting Gleed and if he cons indifferent you are sneaking.  (Gleed sees invis btw)<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.schrade.com/eq/zones/kael/Gleed1.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Once you are sneaking, you can drop down behind Gleed.  Be very careful that you drop behind him and not in front of him (i.e. take it slow) so that he won't aggro.  Leave sneak on during this whole process.  Hand in the tail to Gleed and you should get your bow as a reward.  Now you sneak off to Gleed's left and back up to the bridge.  There's a spot where you have to jump up a bit to get to the very top.  It's safe to not be sneaking there.  The wolf is also far enough away to not aggro on you when you are visible to hand in the bow.<br />
<br />
In the picture below the first arrow path show where you drop down behind Gleed.  The second arrow path is the path you take to get back up and out of the area.<br />
<br />
<img src="http://www.schrade.com/eq/zones/kael/Gleed2.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Your reward is the very cool Bow of the Huntsman:<br />

<p>Holy..this was the *very same thing* I was going to do last night..right before I headed off to the Arena. I wanted to see if it would work, since I had my cleric with me at the zone. So I head over there, sneak up, target Gleed, drop down, rumage through my pack..son of a! I left my tail in the bank! And not wanting to annoy my group with having to run to Thurgadin to get the tail, I figured to hell with it, went to the Arena, and totally destroyed my faction last night :\<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

KoS = Kill on Sight.<br />

glares at you threateningly<br />

pne question.. your reasoning for faction sems to be because of thee see invis guards on the way to gleed, is this correct?<br />
<br />
I ask because I am curiousif you have hella bad KOS faction, if you could still do quest, and either kill or harmony or have the see invis guards mezzed or rooted, tillyou are done and hi-tail it out of there!<br />

<p>I really wanted to do this quest. Saw the wurm on track, went and got him and pulled him back to my group. Fear/snare made it a cake walk. The druids goes to check the whip which I clearly stated is for a quest bow and sees that a druid can use the whip so he wants to roll for it. Of course he wins.<br />
<br />
Damn sweet bow, hope to have one some day.<br /><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I went back to Skyshrine today, and pulled the courtyard area for a group camping there, and got some faction back up. When the group broke, I went back to Kael, con'd a Kromzek, sure enough, he was dubious. Tossed up sneak, checked it on the Kromzek, then slowly inched up to Gleed. You do <b>not</b> have to drop down to hand in the tail, I inched up to Gleed and kept clicking on him until I reached the ledge, and the trade window opened up <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

Incorrect.  Gleed sees invis and casting invis on you will help you in no way.  Invis is also not needed since you are sneaking and that brings you to indifferent.<br /><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

My faction with storm giants (Kromzek) is warmly.  My faction with frost giants (Kromrif) is scowls.  There are see-invis giants on the way to gleed that are on storm giant faction.  You must be non-kos to them otherwise you can't get to Gleed.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter what your faction is with Gleed because you are sneaking behind him to hand the tail in.<br />
<br />
I don't think any giant in Kael is mezzable and harmony is not castable indoors, btw.<br /><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<br />
From what I understand he has a chance to have the bow if killed.  I prefer doing the quests because I can do it on my own without any help.  This is also the best way for a younger ranger to get the bow.<br />
<br />
People that say 'just kill him!' are no help at all in these things and that's why I posted the little quest walkthrough.<br /><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>The rumor is the the bow is Gleed's common drop if you kill him, and Flamesong is his rare drop.  Certainly doesn't guarentee that he'll drop it the first time you take him out.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I'm in the position of not wanting to mess up my dragon faction to get the bow, so I'll have to do it the hard way, and pry it from his cold dead fingers...<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Wow great post thanks very much<br />
<br />
Just spent the last two days getting my giant faction from KoS Scowl to KoS glare.  I figure another day or so killin dorfs (with whom i am dubious) and i should be there.<br />
<br />
After seeing sean's pics on tha armor and hearing that they have the best,  Giants is the way to go for me.<br />

<p><b><img src="images/icons/Furious_Face.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> I'm very pissed with Velious factions</b></p>

<p>I don't understand why they put the best armor quests, and the bow quest, and every other good melee quest (except the ring quest), in the Giant city, the enemies of Tunare, heck, the place seems to have almost twice the number of quests as Thurgadin.  I'm sorry but that is just crap.  Why must they try to force you to side with the Giants?<br />
<br />
I'm finally up to Dubious in Skyshrine, and Warmly in Thurgadin, the hopes of me getting to non KOS to Storm Giants are slim.  I could live with the Armor quest situation, but the idea of no questable bow for me really ticks me off.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> *shrug*</b></p>

<p>velious is designed so you MUST choose sides. I was warmly to dorfs and to most of kael (execpt the zone in but tormax loves me so it is all good). I would say ditch dragon faction personally. Killing dragons will let you improve faction with giants rather easily and has almost no impact or dwarves. why do this? from what I hear the items from skyshrine are iffy. Furthermore, if you are frienldy to dragons you cannot hunt skyshrine, westernwastes, most of veeshans temple and a few other mobs in other places.<br />
  Also since giant faction is easy to fiz killing named stuff in WW you can keel plenty of giants for your POG helm and still con warmly ). then go kill dragons in WW and in no time you will be maxed out on good faction again. )<br /></p>

<p>Ya, and how often is the wurm up?</p>
<hr>
<i>Posted by Valcor on 03-01-2001 08:58 PM:</i>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>id say its uncommon<br />
<br />
ive seen him up a few times.<br />
<br />
If i had to guess its PH is the southern most tunnel right near the stream.  That is where i have seen him, sitting, not roaming, twice.  So any wurms at that spot could be fair game as a PH.<br />
<br />
He has a TON of hps.  i would guess far more than 10,000.  <br />
<br />
We had a 55 druid and 50 druid and myself kitting him for over 15 mins.  Everyone dotting and rooting.  Mix in a bit of melee when i had the health and it took that long.  <br />
<br />
Its a nice weapon - i will hate giving it up  but i want that bow badly<br />
<br />
Now to get from Threatening to Dubious!<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

I enter keal invis.<br />
<br />
my mage friend who cons happily with the giants COH me over to where Gleed is, thus bypassing the see invis giants along the way.<br />
<br />
she summons me to a safe little nook.<br />
(er, where is there a safe little nook?)<br />
<br />
she tehn gates back toher bind spot, near edge of zone.<br />
<br />
I sneak over to gleed, do the trade.<br />
<br />
once done, or if anything goes wrong, she COH me to the zone line.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will this work?<br />
<br />
<br />
one final question.. I use sneak to trade with the woodelfs at Kelethin, as they tolerate me, but wont sell to me.(too many elf faction hits on the PvP server).<br />
<br />
now, my sneak skill is a pitiful 35 .. but it does the trick.<br />
<br />
however, Inotice now that the kelethin banker will still try to kill me, even when I am sneaking. <br />
<br />
I bring this up as I am curious if a certain sneak skill level is needed for certain NPCs...<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks for all your help.<br /><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<br />
If ye look at the map Chromite posted, when ye take a right to head down to where Gleed is, you can easily see a Kromzek standing infront of the archway when you turn and head forward slightly. He's really far away, so you wont have to worry about aggro.<br />
<br />
I think Lt. Krofer in the constuction yard in Wakening is on Kromzek faction as well, not sure.<br />

From my understanding you can stand on the ledge and not be argo'd...the problem is just getting by the other guards before you get there.</p>

Chromite, I owe ya a huge one for this!<br />
<br />
I've had my Vleedun's tail on me for weeks now.  I went to try and sneak to turn in the bow.  Well, I was standing near the archway, looking up the bridge and trying figure out which giant was Gleed.  I was clicking in the are that houses Stormslayer, and kept getting Gleed, so I assumed he was the giant on the left near the wall, never ever guessing he was down below, but in my line of sight!<br />
<br />
Your image was perfect for showin' me where really is!  I ran right over this morning and nailed my bow!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks again!<br />

<p>Last night i started out threatening to the giants, so i went about killed a few more dorfies for about an hour and figured - due to the lenght of time it took to get from Ready to attack to threatening with giants i would be there for days killin dorfs (who are now threatening).<br />
<br />
Well i saw a giant in the distance during a medding period and said, what the heck ill con him, and much to my surprise he con'd DUBIOUS!  Boy was i happy.<br />
<br />
So i ran as fast as i could to Kael and sure enough, everything along the way was Dubious.  I slowly made my way back conning everything as i went and everything was dubious.<br />
<br />
Following the beautiful guide (thanks chromite) i found my way to Gleed, and began to sneak.<br />
<br />
I floated down behind him and decided it was now or never.  So i handed him the whip and got the beautiful Experience music!!!<br />
<br />
Wow - what a nice bow.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I received this bow after completing the quest.  Chromite is correct when he says TAKE IT SLOW.  The spot you drop down on is slippery.  If you arent careful you will slide forward into visual range of Gleed.  Be prepared to press the back key.  Otherwise it works as advertised.  Nice post.<br /><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Oh and Lt. Krofer is on Kromzek faction.  We go and kill in Skyshrine and check by conning him.  He also gives the quest for the Collar of the Storm (AC: 11 +6 STR, +7 STA, +15 HP, +13 CR, +7 MR).  A VERY nice neck item indeed...<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>OK...I just went down to do this and found some very strange differences...<br />
<br />
First of all, I'm kos to storm gaints and had no problem at all getting to Gleed (in fact I'm camped out at his feet)<br />
<br />
Gleed is Dubious to me. He apperantly sees invis... as he has no difference in faction message weather I'm hiding/sneaking/camoed.<br />
<br />
Can I just hand in the tail to this guy while he is dubious?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>also, to add to howwl's comment, if you fail at sneak it should refresh. The refresh is kinda long, think like 10 to 20 secs, not sure. But probably good idea to wait if you cant target mob, though from these posts, seems you can.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>My point is see invis has no effect on sneak if it works.  I have snuck behind see-invis mobs lots of times, and they con indifferent when sneak succeeds.  Maybe you were't truly behind him, but kind-of to the side?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>"Kyenka is the boot and mantle guy. He's in Tormax's room and is on Storm Giant faction. The size of the giants creates an illusion that they are very close to you when in actuality you aren't in their aggro range. If you sneak and keep your distance from them, you can make it to Tormax's room without a problem."<br />

<p>This is one of the quests that you must be amiable with giants to do.  Indifferent will not work. <img src="images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="">  However since most of the quests are on Kromzek (Storm giant) faction just killing in Skyshrine is enough to get you to the point where you can start these quests.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I got my bow, not the way I had planed, but I have it now none the less.   I tried to get past the storm giants that see through cammo and they killed me.  Fortunately, I died near the banner, behind Gleed.  I am very KOS to all giants.  I found a cleric with good faction to give me a res where my corpse was.  Cleric (Soulus) did not get aggroed since no giants were near.  I used sneak and became indifferent to Gleed.  The funny thing is I was KOS to the wolf near Gleed at the same time.  This is because I was in front of the wolf and behind Gleed.  I turned run off and went towards the banner slowly.  You have to get very close to the edge to make the trade.  You can see Gleed’s back very clearly when you are this close and look down.  I made sure he still coned indifferent and made the trade.  I then made a dash for the zone and was killed very quickly, but not until I made is past where the storm giants stand.  It was then easy to cammo, retrieve my corpse and get another res.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank Chromite for the original post.  Without him, I would not have this bow.<br />

<p><b> Misinformation</b></p>

<p>Tantolar, <br />
<br />
Please refrain from posting information which is false.<br />
<br />
True: Gleed will not give you the quest or respond to quest keywords if you are not amiable or better - you get the 'we don't trust you enough yet' message.<br />
<br />
False: You can't complete the quest until you are amiable.<br />
<br />
I just got my bow, and here's how:<br />
<br />
Once I had the tail, I killed dwarves until my faction with both storm and frost giants was dubious. I was still dubious to dwarves at this point, so now I can walk through most of Kael and all of Thurgadin without a problem.<br />
<br />
Go to Kael, get behind Gleed, sneak. Check he's indifferent. <br />
<br />
Hand in the tail, and get my shiny new bow.<br />
<br />
Now I just need to spend some time slaughtering giants to make the dwarves like me again.<br />
<br />
So to re-iterate, even though Gleed won't <b>tell</b> you about the quest when you're indifferent, he <b>will</b> give you the reward when you hand in the tail.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>buying coldain heads is a great way to raise frost giant faction among others without killing dwarves. oddly enough, turning in a coldain head does NOT lower dwarf faction. /shrug. <br />
<br />
It does lower dragon faction though. Yet more proof the dwarves and dragons are at least at peace with each other. /sigh as usual, VI screwing the roleplayers over with the loot rules. and screwing the ubers into not roleplaying because they'll have to gain giant faction killing dragons.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Turning in the d0rf head should not lower d0rf faction anyway.  The d0rfs do not know you are turning it in.  Killing the d0rf, as expected, will lower your d0rf faction.  Seems perfectly logical to me.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>How many see invis giants are there on the way there? Is it possible to get to this point to turn in the tail without messing with faction?</p>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/Naughty_Face.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Thanks</b></p>

<p>Well after working 18 hours stright over the weekend, I am the proud owner of a shiney new bow <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Thanks for all the info, I got the tail realy easy he was up stright after the last patch, although he does have a TON of hp me my wife and daughter managed to kill him.<br />
Working the faction was THE WORST, Khromwif was easy but Khromzek took AGES. Unfortuantly im KOS to Dorfs now so Ill have to work on fixing that faction now.<br />
<br />
So my shiney new bows gonna be firing summoned arrows into some giants ass all day <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<p>The ressing part will work, both directions, but the cleric will not be able to drag the corpse around.  Kael is one of the places that has that new no-drag-my-enemy code.  Since the giants in that arch can see the cleric, they'd kill him.<br />
<br />
A workaround might be to duel someone at the zoneline (or suicide on one of the giants near there), then leave that corpse while you do the suicide run through the arch.  Then the cleric resses the arch corpse, do quest, then stand and wait for the zoneline res.  (remember, you can get revived several times on a single corpse)<br />
<br />
Another option to get OUT after you've done the quest part is to use a thurgadin potion, that way you don't have to die again.  If you can stand there after getting a res, you should be able to stand there to cast a spell to.  (also, a druid/wizard port or translocate can be used, but now you're starting to form a group effort, lol)<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Well, indeed Vluudeen was up yesterday after the patch like everyone said!  Got a group together and killed him pretty easily -- though he has LOTS of Hit Points!!!  Many thanks to Aludar and his friends for the their help!<br />
<br />
I also cruised around Kael a bit for the first time and found that I was dubious to all the giants I saw there.  I guess the two nights of hunting in Icewell Keep did that for me.  Hopefully, all systems are go for me to get the bow tonight!<br />
<br />
Thanks again Chromite for the excellent guide!<br />

<p><b><img src="images/icons/Cool_Face_Cyan.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> A level 60 Druid said I couldnt do it.</b></p>

<p>I logged in after camping on backside of shardwurm cavens. I put on track right after I hit run button and there is Vluudeen! I check to see who is on in the guild and I managed to recruit a level 44 Monk Randor and a 47 Paladin Itdano (thanks guys) and me a 47th Ranger.<br />
<br />
As I waited for group to form a level 60 Druid stood in the enterence of cave. Obviously noticing Vluudeen on track. I told him I was forming a group to kill it right now. He sadi the only reason it isnt dead yet is due to his lack of mana. The Monk went LD as Paladin arrived. Vluudeen conned yellow to me but I couldnt let this oppertunity fall away.<br />
<br />
I went in pulled Vluudeen. Then proceeded to flame lick and snare (thank god I had little resists). The Druid said we couldnt due and he sat and watched me almost die <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">. Almost that is... The monk came back on and we kept up the the insanity. Hahah. I am ususing it as an alternate primary weapon for time being until I get to Skyshrine again. Oh yeah Thanks Riordan and Brodo. The night before pulling Crystallines I got the call of earth spell. Then Kromiff Military legs after that! Im one lucky Ranger<img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">.<br />

Oh yeah Thanks Chromite again for your experience and passing it onto Glade!<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> What do you need to take down Gleed?</b></p>

<p>My guild sided with Dragons so there's no way I can raise my storm giant fraction.  We'll probably end up raiding Kael anyway, so I was wondering, just what does it take to bring him down? I either have to kill him or use the tactic Greywolf did: die by the banner, get rezzed by a cleric who is friendly with the giants, turn in the tail, die past the storm giant section, and get another rez : P<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Ok an easy way to catch Vluudeen up isjustgetting a quick TP to GD just when the servers come up, he is up then or at least he was in this last patch.<br />
<br />
Now just raise the giant faction enough and get my new bow )<br />

Btw, Vluudeen was cake for a 55 druid and a 55 ranger )<br />

<p>I really wanted to do this quest but after nearly 2 weeks of looking for that stupid Wurm our guild went to that area instead of the normal arena camp location in Kael. First pull and the only ranger there has a new bow, after respawn he dropped a Flamesong (I have better so I'm holding for another ranger to ask for it). I just haven't had any time yet to try it out.<br />
<br />
Oh and in the Irony department, when we left Kael and a smaller group went to Icewall, someone mentioned that Vuuleen was up and asked in OOC what it dropped. I check tracking and sure enough ... D'oh</p>

<p>Last night, our guild went on a Kael raid.  Before hand, I got a group of use together to go kill Vluudeen.   Was a fun fight.  Our bard wend LD when it started and he gated at the end and ended up on the mountain about the tunnel enterance.<br />
<br />
Then our raid started and we cleared everything up to Gleed.  I managed to sneak up behind him and proceded to get too close and fell behind him.  I was able to complete my quest but while sneaking and trying to get back up, he proceded to plant my arse into the ice.<br />
<br />
My guild then pulled him and he also dropped the Bow of the Huntsman which Aralys is now the proud owner of it.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone that has posted here.  This info was great and helped 2 of us get the bow.!.!<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>My story is not unlike many others except I'm probably a bit lower level than others. I was soloing in GD for experience(Kodiak cave under Velks Lab are great for high30s low 40s) and that nasty wurm Vludeen popped on track! Well, I logged on my higher level enchanter character and tried to take Vludeen but at level 42 for ranger and 59 for enchanter I didnt too well since I dont do multi-character botting well.  I called over a wiz friend who stopped by and with me snaring and my enchanter clarity'ing, dotting and rooting, we killed the nasty wurm and I looted his tail!<br />
<br />
Off to Kael I was.  I got a CoH mage friend who is on good terms with the giants to help out.  Here's what we did. I snuck and lev'd myself and grouped with the mage. The mage ran to the flag right behind Gleed and summoned me to that spot.  I inched close to Gleed while lev'd(that doggie scared me with its standard movements. I was almost positive it was going to leap for me at any moment.).  Eventually I was still on the ledge but close enough to Gleed to hand in the tail.  I got the bow, the da-ding message and some faction hits. By that time the mage was already at the entrance and just CoH'd me back and I walked out of Kael the proud new owner of a Bow of the Huntsman.<br />
<br />
Ok, so I'm a tad low in level to own this bow but I'm still proud of it! Does anyone know at what level it will proc?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> Mage summoning...</b></p>

<p>If your not on happy terms with the giants from what I've read having a mage summon you seams to be the best way. So, my question is, what level does a mage need to be summon you?

<p><b> Moving Giants....</b></p>

<p>Hi all.   Just thought I would post a way for those of us without a large guild, or a non-KOS Cleric or mage friend to move some giants out of the way to get to Gleed.  <br />
<br />
     Ages ago, a couple friends and I made a bunch of little Rallos Zek worshipping ogres, and had a druid bring em to Kael. We primarily used em for scouting purposes, but occasionally they are nice for corpse pulling too.<br />
<br />
    It occured to me that a small ogre with a long range bow and SoW could make a hell of a train of see invis giants.   The bow (I recommend oak: 125 rng) should be as long a range as possible, to give your mini ogre a head start.  <br />
<br />
    Have a friend make one, give him a bow and arrows, sow him at the WL entrance, and have him go into the passage towards Gleed's area.  You may have to make an ogre of your own to show him EXACTLY what it is you want done.  Find a friend who is tactically competent, or you will get very frustrated before you are done<img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br />
<br />
   Once you get to where the three giants are, guarding Gleeds area, instruct him to shoot the farthest back Guard (the single one).  Once again, range is key here. He needs as much of a head start as possible, so use the bow at its maximum range.  The guard farthest towards Gleed, once he has been potted by your mini ogre, will charge your friend:  He has to run like hell.    As the guard goes past the 2 that are side by side, he will agro them as well, and you have a nice train.<br />
<br />
   After instructing my friend, I switched back to my ranger and waited invis far back from the passage entrance.   We decided to run the train down towards the WL entrance, giving me enough room to slip in behind em and go get my bow.<br />
<br />
   Once at Gleed, follow the excellent instructions given above to get your new bow, then use a thurgadin gate potion to get out, or do it all again to get out.  Thurg potion is a hell of a lot safer<img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
   This is not theoretical:  My Kael faction is about as bad as it can possibly be and I got my bow quite a while ago, first try.<br />
<br />
   A Word of Warning:   your sacrificial ogre will get quite a few giants on his tail - DO NOT TRAIN PEOPLE.<br />
Do this when the zone is quiet, make a hotkey and use it a lot , and have your lil ogre stop a ways before the zone, so some poor fool who just zoned in doesnt have a bunch of see ivis giants dumped on him.  <br />
<br />
     Safety here is paramount:   I can't justify getting a new bow at the cost of someone elses life ( an innocent bystander).   Please be careful, the nature of this trick makes it dangerous.<br />
<br />
    Good luck with your new bows<img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<p><b> Kill Giants!</b></p>

<p>Kill 3 Giants that see invis 2 guard the archway that will have to be done together or FD pulled.<br />
<br />
The 3rd is at the far end of the Archway. <br />
<br />
Then FD pull Gleed so you get Him or his Dog single. You can do them at the same time it just hurts a lot more.<br />
<br />
I did this with a single group twice. Both times on the first attempt we wiped out. <br />
<br />
The second attempt both times we succesfully killed Gleed and his dog one time one by one, the other time both at once. <br />
<br />
A single 55+ group that knows what they are doing can do this easily. <br />
<br />
Gleed or his PH is a 1 or 2 hour spawn time. I've only seen his PH twice. He has dropped the bow all 3 times we have killed him.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon14.gif" alt="Thumbs up" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Just did it!</b></p>

<p>Well, I have been hanging around ICEWALL and Great Divide killing dwarfs to get their heads to improve Kael faction. After two days and about 20 heads I get to high aimiable. I was just about ready to head to Kael to turn in more heads when I hit track and Vluudeen was up! I got a 54 mage and druid together quickly and headed to southern entrance to the wurm caves. <br />
<br />
Vluudeen is in a nook almost right inside the tunnel, so is fairly easy to pull single. Once we had him outside cave and in a clear area we had mage pet and myself (using swarmcaller) tank. Vluudeen hit for close to 130, but we managed to kill him without having to summon a second pet. I think I was healed by druid using chloroblast about 3-4 times during the fight.<br />
<br />
Turning in the tail to Gleed was very easy, as in the process of waiting for Vluudeen to spawn I had gotten to high aimiable with Storm and Frost Giants. I also got a nice faction jump to kindly from doing the quest.<br />
<br />
As to the bow itself, it is awesome! The thing is ready to fire by the time the first shot has hit, practically! This bow reaffirms my belief that rangers should go with Kael faction.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> why doing the quest?</b></p>

<p>I don't get it. Why should I do the quest when the giant who gives you the quest drops the bow as common drop? <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> Well, and why should a ranger go after kael faction? Okay, Kael armor has a bit more AC but a ranger will never get over 1100 AC (unbuffed) and more than 1000 AC is also possible with Skyshrine Faction/Armor + more resists and a lot more HP/STA! Just my two copper.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Bah, today's patch I think just broke the quest aspect of this. Be a giant friend or kill Gleed, those are the choices now.</p>

<p>Underbrush........do you know for a fact weither after the patch you are able to sneak and do the quest or not?  It is my understanding that only the velious armor quests (sort of but not 100% including the Thurgadin) were effected by the patch..........I sure would like to find out if anyone knows wether you are able to still do this quest using sneak and indifferent.<br />
<br />
Granted you never know with Verant but.........I would think that the changes that would be needed to be made to change ALL of the quests would be a phenominal programming undertaking so I am almost leaning towards thinking that they only did change the armor quests themselves.  Also in the past when they made changes like this they would NOT be specific in the patch message as to what was changed and later you would find out that things were included that surprised you.......however, the message seemed pretty specific to armor quests..........but you never know.</p>

<p>No, don't know for certain, it may just be armor givers that were effected. After looking about the boards, I'm guessing it might not be changed. I seem to be hearing that only the high end armor quest were altered (forest stalkers & golden leaf)</p>

<p><b> Faction</b></p>

<p>I think I have read through every posts here, and maybe I missed it...is Gleed on Kromzek, Kromrif, or Tomax faction?  I am an ally to Kromzek, but threatening to Kromrif.  I am not sure about Tomax, but have not doneanything to work on this faction yet; I assume I am dubious at best.  <br />
<br />
If Gleed is Kromzek, I am golden, I believe.  But otherwise I am concerned taht I may have to work on other factions since the the "ally" patch.  Has anyone done this using sneak since lately?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>That is exactly what I am going to do. And if he drops the Flamesong rather then the bow it works out for me anyway, as long as he drops one or the other I can't lose. Unless we all die of course.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> Vluudeen</b></p>

<p>Finally killed this sucker last night after cmping for him on many nights previous.<br />
<br />
Someone was doing tenth ring quest apparently, and Giants had cleared the entire GD zone just before I logged in.   Suspecting that Vluudeen might pop, I notified my Guild that I might need reinforcements.<br />
<br />
Sure enough when giants despawned, Vluudeen poped just inside the southern most tunnel off the main one through wurm cave.  Pulled him single easily and kited him around for 10-15 minutes till the cavalry arrived.  I put a lot of arrows into him while weaving around between shardwurms south of the cave, but I could barely see damage.  In addition to having a ton of hit points, out of melee range, his regen rate can keep up with a lot of crits.<br />
<br />
With 52 Shammie, 51 Cleric, 53 Druid, and two late 40s arriving, Vluudeeen went down pretty easy.  We had enough mana left to pull Shardtooth just a few minutes later.<br />
<br />
On my way to turn in tail this evening <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br />
<br />
Great guide here, so many thanks.  Just need to have giants clear the zone more often so Vluudeen will pop for us.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>From what i saw today Vluudeen seems to have between 18000 and 20000 hp. Wiz with me did 15856 or close damage, while the druid did some more with arm dots and starfire, and me with some melee. Not overly hard, although the wizard had to med back up fora second mana dump. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>With the 'ally' patch and some quest patches since then, I'd still like to hear that this quest has been _recently_ completed with less than ally faction. <br />
Just scored the tail last night and tho he is amiable, won't speak the quest to me. Dealing with quest NPCs makes me nervous anyway. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<p><b> Perfection</b></p>

<p>Chromite's post and instructions and pics were perfect.  My guild went to bank area and was killing everything in sight.  It got to thepoint where thepath to Gleed was clear.  I followed Chromite's guidelines, sneak etc and I got the bow and experience.  THe folks in my group were puzzled when the experience showed up as they were medding and no fight was in progress.  It is a cool bow! Can't say enough about it.  Thank you Chromite!<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>About two weeks back we killed Gleed three times, he dropped the bow everytime. Oddly enough every time my bow procs it gets resisted.  <br />
Then we moved up to Glammaz Stormslayer (Frostbringer/ Cloak of the Maelstorm questor), first time around he tore our heads of and put them someplace where the sun dont shine. Second try we wiped the floor with him with only two deaths. He dropped the cloak.</p>

<br />
Thanks to Gardack our Kael expert we took out 3 giants which blocked our path to Gleed, then another ranger and I sneaked behind Gleed (almost fell off the edge) and handed in our items for our bow's and then we pulled Gleed and got another bow for our warrior!<br />

I'm KOS to giants.<br />
<br />
Much easier now, as long as the "giants don't see invis" holds out.<br />

If you have the tail, I recommend doing this quest soon.<br />

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>With both Gleed and this buddies around him no longer seeing invisible, this is much easier to accomplish for those of us who are not exactly on good terms with the giants.  HOWEVER, be careful the position you have to stand in to give the bow to Gleed is just (and I do mean just) outside of the agro range of one of the guard giants.  Additionally when you drop your camo make sure that your sneak is on and holding otherwise Gleed will agro on you too (you would swear he has eyes in the back of his head)<br />
<br />
You're best way out (if you were like me and ended up dropping sneak after the trade....) is to gate out using a Thurg potion.  Gleed does path up the little ramp to come get you, but this gives you just enough time to drink the potion.<br />
<br />
In retrospect you have to wonder....if some little ranger con'd you out of your prized bow, wouldn't you get a bit miff'd.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>Since everyone links to this walkthru and it gets asked everytime does it still work. Here is my experience, second week of november 2001.<br />
<br />
Killed the named wum in GD twice, me (51) and 55 ranger. Took forever but doable, to get the whip.<br />
<br />
Made lvl 1 ogres that worship rallos zek and took them to Kael to look around un-KOS to get the layout for the upcoming sneak.<br />
<br />
Hung around kael a day or two until a guild was going that way to gleed. Asked if when they cleared to Gleed I could do the quest, they said yup.<br />
<br />
They cleared the 3 see invis giants, first my friend snuck up on him and got the bow - then me. Then we killed him and I got the flamesong.<br />
<br />
People ask why do the quest when you can just kill him. It's possible to do the quest first for whoever has the tail then kill him and get the bow some more.<br />
<br />
You don't have to jump down behind gleed it is possible to trade to him from up on the ledge if your careful and get right beside the flag pole, use 3rd person if you have to.<br />
<br />
Have fun.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

I plan on using the gate potion to get my giant-hated butt outta there, but I'm really looking forward to doing the quest.<br />

<p>I can verify that as of Nov 24 sneak still works for this quest.  Big thanks to One Hundred Swords for holding off on killing Gleed until I could get down there and hand in the tail!<br />
<br />
I'm currently max negative Kromrif and Kromzek, max positive Coldain and warmly to CoV.  The faction hit took me about 5 scouts in GD to erase.<br />
<br />
What a bow!  Dang that is a fast refresh.<br />

<p><b> Yeah it's a bit lame to say it but...</b></p>

<p>Killing him is rather easy too. If you have 2 or 3 groups, it's possible to hunt by the arch, not only do you have the chance for Thurg armour peices, the bow to drop, you also have the opportunity for landing a cloak of the malestrom, all though this drops off a much harder mob. If your on your own, or only have a couple of friends, then doing the quest maybe good, if not make a raid out of it spend a few hours there, get several drops of thurg armour, maybe some nice items (i forget if the orb still drops there which is a nice caster shield) and probably several bows. After hunting here several time, i'm pretty sure that all the regular playing rangers and warriors all have this bow now.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>
