<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I found recently that when i was in a Chardok group and casting canni 1 every fourth cast or so would only take 40hp, instead of the general 50. I dont know if this is because I was grouped with a bard or if the Obulus Death Shroud just decided to work. I tried it later, and although i didnt actually look too many times it was always 50. I am positive it was only taking 40hp off while I was in chardok. Does anyone know why this is, and hopefully the Obulus Death shroud saves 10% hp on canni.<br />

Humburto Burrito<br />
lvl 53</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Buffa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It was the bard song...not your ODS. I wear ODS myself and I am 100% sure it does not save 10% off my HP on Canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">my next question would be then what was the bard singing. It was a level 59 bard. I have been grouped with other bards, just recently a 53, and didnt see only 40hp being taken off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bard was prolly singing the rune song, like 15 hp, yes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ahhh! I was wondering what that was also. I wear an ODS and the same thing was happening with me the other night while grouped with a bard. Cool. At least I know what was going on now. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Question is why does the Obulus Death Shroud's effect show up when you cast Cannibalize.  That is, if you're casting a zero mana spell, how exactly is the focus effect (mana preservation) working?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The answer is the same to that as to how much mana you lose when you fizzle a cannibalize</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cann isnt a zero mana spell, it does actually cost mana to cast but only like one mana so you arent going to save a lot with your ob shroud.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last time I checked Cana took 0 mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Its Niv's melody of Preservation.<br />
<br />
Its a MR Buffer and Spell Shield.  Think it has a small regen component too, not sure.  It knocks 10 pts off any spell that does damage to you.<br />
<br />
Best one for Canni is Chain casting Lvl 49 Shield of Songs. <br />
<br />
Get a bard with a Kellin's Lute and you have  60pt+ Rune Shield every 3 seconds.  BooYah!<br />
<br />
edit:  Forgot to mention that Shield of Songs has an annoying buffer cast sound that you can't turn off.  So every 3 seconds you get that Buff sound like you are casting an AC or HP buff.  In meelee situations its pretty nice, but a HUGE aggro generator on a BARD.  Imagine preventing (potentially) 60ish Hps of damage every 3 seconds on every member of your party?  Thats like casting a 360pt heal every 3 seconds.  Aggro out the wazoo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You were grouped with an over-achieving bard who probably has carpal tunnel from constantly twisting songs even during down time.  Kocho used to play that song for me.  She was an amazing bard.<br />
