<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A new scam seems to be spreading, at least on my server.<br />
<br />
The way it works is this: someone puts a rare but otherwise worthless item up for sale in the bazaar for about the price of an item you want to buy.  Then, using an alt, they offer to trade you this item for the item you want; you just have to go buy the item they want to trade.  Of course, after you buy the worthless trinket, they disappear.<br />
<br />
This happened to me recently when I was /auction'ing for a Steel Ring of Earthen Resistance.  Some guy offered to trade a Trakanon Fern Root for it.  He explicitly refused to take any platinum; instead he wanted this fern root.  'You're in the bazaar. Do any happen to be on sale in the bazaar?' he asks me.  Intrigued, I looked the item up, and then realized it was a worthless foraged item and that he must be trying to rip me.  Lo and behold, a few hours later, some other guy (with similarly bad engrish) offers me the same deal.  Hmm, wonder if I would have ever got that ring...<br />
<br />
Next time, I am just gonna tell them that I already have the item they want in stock, heh.<br />
<br />
Anyway, caveat emptor.</div></div><hr />

Yep, next time I am gonna get the link out of the bazaar and say: 'oh this one?  yeah, I got your worthless_item_01 right here, buddy.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its very old scam, older than eq for that matter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">just trade the amount of money the useless item costs, for the ring and tell him to buy it himself :p<br />
<br />
edited to make sense  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yah I got ripped like this once when I was trying to buy an aon.  Got stuck with a fungi and jade reaver I overpaid for.  Fortunately I found someone else that was willing to do that trade.  Sold aon last night for 250k so I'm going to go ahead and call it a good deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, this is an old, old scam.  It's known in the general world as the violin scam IIRC.  A guy goes into a diner, say, and leaves an old violin there.  After he leaves, a compatriot comes in and says &quot;hey, someone left this here.  This is actually a valuable antique instrument.  If you find the owner and he wants to sell, give him my card, I'd be willing to pay $10 000.&quot;<br />
<br />
Later that night, the original owner comes back, and the mark will then try to buy the crusty old thing from the owner.  He'll claim it has great sentimental value, etc. etc. which will drive the price up to say $1,000, at which point he'll finally relent.  But when the mark goes to contact the dealer... no such luck.  He's now bought a $10 violin for $1000.  The &quot;owner&quot; and &quot;dealer&quot; then buy a new crappy one for 10 bucks and split the $990.</div></div><hr />
