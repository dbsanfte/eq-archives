<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gilgamesch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Had just received the broken arrow from Abe the Abandoned when EB and fish scales ran out (DOH). Gated out.  Can I go back and hail Ooglyn and re-do step or do I have to start over?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you have to start over.  You're not that far into the quest so it should be a huge deal.  A pain yes, but you're not SOL.  <br />
<br />
Next time if that happens, poke your head out of the water until the spirit pops.  You don't have to be there for the guys to show up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can get Oogla's gem from the spirit in Freeport.  No need to get the first gem.  Tell the barb in Freeport &quot;you can buy booze&quot; and that will trigger him to head to the Jade tiger.<br />
<br />
Had to do it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gilgamesch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the info.  It's no big deal.  Just didn't want  to go to Freeport.  I have plenty of fish scales now.<br />
