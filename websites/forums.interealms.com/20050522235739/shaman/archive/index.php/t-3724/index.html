<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A few pointers:<br />
<br />
- in order to sell something it has to be in a traders satchel which you can buy at a vendor near a bank. Weight is irrelevent in Bazaar so load up as much as you want.<br />
<br />
- You have to price the item. Same items will all have the same price so no bait and switc, doh! Prices are saved in a .ini file tied to the character. It's marked with chars name and has bazaar in it. It's computer specific so if you switch comps you better copy over that .ini.<br />
<br />
- While you can stuff your trader full of 8 satchels holding 10 items each, the buyer can only browse 30 items. So just keep 30 items in the trader's satchels. Fill the rest up with regular bags and switch items in and out as needed.<br />
<br />
- When someone buys something from you, the searchable list (/bazaar) is NOT updated until the trader goes out of trader mode and back into it. Hopefully they fix this somehow.<br />
<br />
- You can put your trader into afk mode if you want so if someone foolishly sends you a tell you can respond with &quot;Buy my stuff, I'm sleeping!&quot; or whatever.<br />
<br />
- you can shrink/grow or otherwise transform your trader if you want to be unique. Of course equipment worn also shows up as normal so play dress up if you want. You can't sell equipped equipment.<br />
<br />
That's it for now, happy trading!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Daedric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm curious to see when I get back how much food/water I go through.  I guess if you are selling food you need to make sure it's not in the top of your inventory too.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if numbers in the Bazaar will drop a little once the newness wears off, or if it will get more crowded when folks find out how nice a feature this is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also MAKE SURE you set your intended price before enabling begin trader.<br />
<br />
An example on my server of a buy I can only assume came from a trader who wasn't careful:<br />
<br />
Fungi Tunic for 700pp (Imagine how ticked this guy must be now...I am sure he intended to put 70000pp thinking it wouldn't sell and if it did hed be rich:(  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are worried about going through food and water, you can either summon a bunch before bedtime or put it all in the bank (not like you will die). My mule in NFP has been hungry and thirsty for about a year now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Being hungry and thirsty is not a good thing, if your want your mule to sell lucky cabbages, demi-sec champaignes, lotus pies, and misty thicket picnics.<br />
<br />
He'll eat all of his own merchandise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you're selling multiples of the same item, doe they count as just one of the 30 available items?<br />
And if you have multiples of a stackable item, do they count as just one of the 30?<br />
And if you have multiple stacks of the same items, do they count as just one of the 30?<br />
<br />
When you're a trader, can you see in real time who's browsing you and buying from you? Is there a record in your log file of who bought what from you while you were AFK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nytmare...<br />
<br />
Not sure about stackable items =/<br />
<br />
However, you do get a log in the trade window that indicates all browses of your wares and all transactions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Multiple stacks of stackable items take up 1 of your 30 slots total.  For instance, I was selling 400 Truffles.  When someone comes to buy from me they see 1 Truffle that they can buy 400 times.<br />
<br />
When you price things in a stack, you are pricing a single item, not the whole stack.</div></div><hr />
