<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goku999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, lvl 34 shammy here and was wondering what my gear upgrades should be.........<br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=131090<br />
<br />
I know i need to get a better face for ac, and im planning on sitting at karnors to try and get jarsath bracer/leggings/gaunts/helm if possible, then going on from there. the thing is, sort of having a money problem right now so not really able to spend a lot, 1k at most<br />
<br />
So.... any suggestions? :)<br />
<br />
BTW, on a side note, im also open to suggestions on where to hunt, been to dawnshroud, a lil of CC, and other places, but im thinking of going back to OT cuz it seems to go faster there. (Im usually with a 42 enc on another acct, btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goku999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nobody got suggestions??? :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Qwantum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have no idea if iksar can wear Rygorr armor from EW but you might want to check into that stuff.  Some of the pieces are pretty decent.<br />
<br />
I was wearing primarily Totemic until I started replacing it with Rygorr in my low 40's.  The nice bit about rygorr is that it's at least theoretically possible for you to get at your level, either through camping or buying (its not really that expensive, except for the BP).<br />
<br />
You have a great BP and primary hand weapon.  Other than leveling up quick and trying to get into hate raids for your planar armor (iksar hate armor is nice stuff and drops more often than the old shaman armor) I'm limited in advice because of my advanced ignorance into iksar wearable shaman armor :P<br />
<br />
Maybe one of the older Ikky's can help you out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most of my suggestions are going to be around swapping out pure wis gear for ac/hp/wis gear... and I'll try to keep prices comparable so you don't have to dip too much into your piggy bank.  I'm an ac/hp nut (my normal wisdom at 49 in solo mode only hovers around 130) - so take that into consideration...  :)<br />
<br />
Swap out your charred guardian shield for a clay guardian shield (ac 25, +50 hp) - you might even make a few pp on the deal.  <br />
<br />
Swap out your velium ruby veil for an arctic wyvern mask (ac 6, +5 wis, +6 cha, +3 vs cold) - you could make a couple hundred plat on this deal, too.  Masks are increasingly cheap, since people often use them to train their tailoring skill.<br />
<br />
Ry'gorr provides a nice set of cheap upgrades for you.  Don't spend more than a couple hundred pp per piece.<br />
<br />
Specifically, I think the gloves (ac 12, +2 str, +1 cha, +5 hp), the helmet (ac 13, +15 mana, +3 str, +3 vs magic), and the leggings (ac 13, +2 Sta, +2 Dex, +3 vs magic, +5 vs cold, +5 HP) make a lot of sense.  <br />
<br />
The arms would add 3 AC and take away 3 wis- not worth swapping in my opinion.  Same with the bracers... you'll lose 5 wis and gain AC... not worth it.<br />
<br />
Overall, you've got very nice gear right now... you should be able to make these changes with little if any cost.<br />
<br />
A couple notes:<br />
<br />
Remember that AC tends to work in intervals... your goal should be to get your AC just over a 100 marker (700 or 800) is possible, over a 50 marker (750, 850) if not.<br />
<br />
And of course, just in case you haven't been doing this, make sure your defense skill is maxed each level.  Each point in defense is free AC, and they get much harder to raise the higher you go.  If it's not maxed, I guarantee you'll kick yourself later.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goku999</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thx for the suggestions, and yes, i only melee solo mainly right now, so my defense IS ALWAYS maxd :)<br />
<br />
Was wondering though, should I go for the jarsath or Ry'gorr?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think Ry'gorr is easier to come by, since it's tradeable... so I'd go for that first.  That said, they're fairly comparable stat-wise... so either one will work well.  :)</div></div><hr />
