<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just hit 47 doing spiders in nurga, loved it but too many light blues now.  Was thinking of bloodgills or seafury cyclops. I am a soloer but will group if exp is good. If anyone can give me tips would be appreciated and also looking for breakdown of how to handle the bloodgills. I do have my jbb thanks again.<br />

My friend, you are IN LUCK! :D<br />
<br />
Forest Giants in F.V.  :)<br />
Let me give you a lengthy description...<br />
<br />
Excellent experience at 47 and 48, starts to slow at 49, but I still go there at 50, and often take over the camp from a 51 druid or monk (about a half dozen of us seem to have them perma-camped, but we're all friendly about it) who hunt there.<br />
<br />
Root (not enstill), back up to max casting range, JBB until it breaks, re-root and JBB until dead.  This works well for the Forest Giant Arbors.  For the Verdants, I also dotted them disease and poison, and would throw a Blizzard Blast in if necessary.  You can root/JBB the Verdant's too, but it takes awhile to chew through their hit points that way.  I spent more mana on them just to keep the spawn times moving smooth.  The Verdants also hit a lot harder then the arbors do.  Hope your channeling is maxed, because you take a pounding if you let them get close and try to re-root.  I let them just to keep working defense, and maxed it while I was at this camp.  BONUS! :)<br />
<br />
As you head out from the bridge, go NE to the corner of the FV zone.  (Bind at the bank, use bearform &lt;to get in the huts&gt; to sell to Basil the skinner or your favorite NPC of choice)  Giant camp Loc is around 2500, 2500.  One coord is neg, the other pos.  You'll figure out which when you head NE, and I don't want to give them to you wrong.  <br />
<br />
There are generally 3 forest giant arbors waiting for you next to their little open stone buildings.  There is a nice rotisserie going over a fire in the middle of the camp.  Don't eat it though, I think it used to be a dwarf... :p <br />
<br />
Anyway, as you approach them, move over to the far right.  There is a little stone embedded in the ground there.  That's where I usually cast my first root.  Single pulled w/ no problems.  <br />
<br />
If you try to pull from the front of the camp, you'll end up with drolvarg or froggie adds that can be really annoying and sometimes deadly.  A few path right up the the camp.  If you pull from the right, the frogs and dogs generally don't bother you.  <br />
<br />
If you pull from behind (which I did for awhile until I learned better) you can sometimes get 2 of the Arbors at once.  All is not lost!  If you are pulling with root, you can turn and head down the hill before you root the one coming after you.  This generally gives you enough distance (short aggro radius) to keep the first one right at his spawn point even after the root breaks.  You may get some dog/frog adds on the hillside, but if you keep an eye out and don't let them get close, you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
Your pet will drop too fast at your current level, so don't use him.  If you are still there at 49, you may want to try your new pet (frenzied spirit) to make things a bit easier/faster, but only if you are smart about using him.  If he drops too often, just go back to soloing them w/o pet.<br />
<br />
Self-buffed SoW, ac/hp/sta/chloro, and clicky buffs (they're free, may as well use them).<br />
<br />
Search out the route to the zoneline before you start for The Swamp of No Hope in case you need to run for it.  It isn't a hard run if you have SoW and for whatever reason (laziness or inattention were my biggest problems that led to a zone run) things go bad all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
This was the SINGLE best piece of exp information I found in the old hunting grounds forum.  I'm happy to repeat it here for you, and wish I could credit who wrote the original writeup, but I didn't print it out. :(  Other people may have different opinions, but this worked AWESOME for me w/ my jbb.  The rapid respawn always kept me busy, and the same zone banking (and availability of alchemy components too!) made things very convenient.  Sold lots of 10 shot SoW's with only sporadic auctioning.<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoy this camp as much as I have.<br />
Take care,<br />

Nice post and thank you for the info. I tried the FV forest giants at the top end of 47 and never looked back. Now, newly minted 49 I think I may even stay for a few gold. Although there are several light blues that pop I usually just slow those and sic doggy on em while I canni back to full after those annoying verdants pop. <br />
<br />
Usually I can take all three spawns one after the other if they are blue arbors. The only thing that slows me down is when a verdant pops up, they seem to resist e-bolt a lot more than the arbors and have about 1k - 1.5k more hps.<br />
<br />
Other than that I am very satisfied with this camp. The exp is good and steady and you can make a good bit of cash selling the tunics and other drops. <br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

Edit: Btw ... No JBB, No Fungi or Ikky BP, and No Epic. I am sure if you had these this camp would be a breeze.</div></div><hr />
