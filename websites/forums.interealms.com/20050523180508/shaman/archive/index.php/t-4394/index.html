<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, been looking to get myself one of those nice raptor tooth baubles from CT :) The only problem is, I am kind of stumped where Terrorclaw spawns. I have read he spawns in the maze or in the large ziggurat past the maze, and not sure which is correct. I've only done CY, TR and pools xps there, so I have 0 experience in the deeper sections.  Any clues to what I might expect to find or bring in terms of a group would be cool =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its in 4c, which is the temple past the maze.  To do that camp you will need a damn good 60 ench and cleric plus a very good tank and a ton of DPS (2 60 rogues, monks, wizzies...just need really good weps).  If ya want an idea of how much DPS, my normal group is all FoH cept me and we still can barely clear the corners before repops...repops here are on a 10 min timer so it gets pretty insane.  Fleshgrinder, Lizard tooth earring, Lizard bone earring, and Tae Ew Ritualists Mask also drop here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I still don't think one group can clear every single corner of every single mob before anything pops including roamers and the hallway guards. I would like to see that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For a laid back experience it takes about two groups, that's clearing three corners and wanderers.<br />
<br />
The best place to camp is on the back side.  The only wanderer that spawns there is the terrorclaw ph (I've actually camped him with my rogue, never spawned though :/)<br />
<br />
People in better gear can probably do it with a single group (assuming right classes).<br />
<br />
Edit: I don't know if it is noted anywhere, but that bauble is awesome for something besides the kickass stats.  The cast time on the effect is 1.5 seconds.....yep, now THAT kicks ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you should focus on the southwest and northeast corner....they have rares. of course you'll have to clear the northwest corner too if you set up on the back (north wall) as suggested. not extremely hard with a good group, but it is hard.<br />
<br />
terrorclaw is rare and pops along the north side (where you camp) of the temple....and the bauble is rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i like to camp in between the maze and the temple area .. <br />
theres a small passage with no wandering mobs ..<br />
as you enter the temple area .. pull every thing to your left <br />
this gets you a PH for the named brown lizzys .. nice agro axe and high hp earing <br />
<br />
ps: be carefull .. i was drunk and casted bind on myself, same icon as shrink at the time  .. being bound in 4c SUCKS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahhh the dangers of EQing while under the influence :)<br />
<br />
At least you didn't wake up nekkid in Gnome town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was at 4c last night and didnt have very many problems.  We had a wipeout once due to me getting a resist on adept with slow and cleric not realizing he hit very hard before it was to late.  Second try at him went like clockwork.  Got the Fleshgrinder out of it.<br />
<br />
Group was<br />
60 Ranger (epics)<br />
60 Monk (avg weapons)<br />
60 War ( from Keepers of the Faith our servers &quot;uber&quot; guild)<br />
60 Chanter<br />
59 Cleric<br />
59 Shaman (me)<br />
<br />
second try at adept was with a 60 Rog instead of the ranger as he had to leave though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I do 4c regularly and can confirm whats been said above.  Adept spawns in front left (common lizard bone, rare fleshgrinder), Ritualist spawns in back right (common mask, rare lizard tooth), and Terrorclaw ph is the back roamer raptor (common necro shoulders, rare raptor tooth).   The camp isn't that hard if you have an all 60 group with good enc, clr, shm, war/sk/pally, rog, rog (or rog/monk).  The tough parts are break in and pulling the corners.  Just make sure your enchanter is using rapture on the browns and raptors (kill raptors and Thul defenders first, leave the Thul Justicators last as they have unresistable ch- you gotta kill these about 4 times and they have a ton of hps).  Have your MT pull the corners and make sure to wait for the wandering mob on the wall you're not on, he will add if near the corner.  Also, Malo every mob before slowing, or you'll get alot of resists from the lizzys.  <br />
<br />
Asheran, I notice in your magelo you have a Hammer of Spiritcalling.  The mob that drops it also drops the Barbed Rubicite Coif, a shoulder piece I am very interested in accuiring (15AC 55hps 15sta).  Can you tell me where he spawns (Tae Ew We Spiritcaller i think it is)?  I heard 4c, but i've spent dozens of hours there and never seen him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">spiritcaller spawns in 4c, but not in one of the corners.  in the second corner (going left from entrance, just above you on the temple is a spawn.  PH is a thul tae ew zealot, the named spawn is the spiritcaller.  we can usually just single pull the zealot or spiritcaller down, though there's a wanderer that comes up, so sometimes 2 mobs.<br />
<br />
4c is by far the most fun in the zone, 3 corners doable by a good group, ton of exp, and some nice loot to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;spawns in front left (common lizard bone, rare fleshgrinder), Ritualist spawns in back right (common mask, rare lizard tooth),&quot;<br />
<br />
in my experience it's the other way around....seen truckloads of tooth earrings and fleshgrinders drop</div></div><hr />
