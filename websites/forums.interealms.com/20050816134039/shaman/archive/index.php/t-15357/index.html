<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I bought another PC (Dell Inspiron 5100 Notebook) to take on the road with me when I'm on business.  I figured while I'm at it, I can set it up at home too and 2 box something while I'm home.<br />
<br />
The problem, is I can't think of anything to dual-box with my shaman.  I've duo'd with just about everything imaginable, and I do ok with anyone.  I have access to 3 friends' accounts which have, between them, 2 clerics (upper 50s), ranger 52, bard 56, wizard 61.  But now I want to make a second account that's *mine*.  I just can't think of anything to play that I think I'd really enjoy dual-boxing with a shaman, or investing the time and effort into to level.<br />
<br />
I've considered a mage, shadowknight, necro, rogue, warrior, etc., even a paladin.  Hell, I've even considered just rolling another shaman and dual-boxing 2 shammies - although I wouldn't mind having a snarer. Plus after leveling 2 shaman to 60+ on different servers, I'm not sure I want to level another.<br />
<br />
I just can't think of anything that I feel would be greatly value added to me at this point.  I've considered necro because then I could snare, rez, FD, have strong pet, and can root-dot or agro-kite mobs in HoH at some point.  I just don't know how much trouble dual-boxing a necro would be?<br />
<br />
Same with a shadow-knight.  Mage seems low maintenance, but I'm not sure how much benefit they'd be aside from summoning pet weapons and burn dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I guess the biggest thing is I'm just not sure if it's worth it for me to even bother with it at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dualbox a level 1 enchanter standing in the bazaar with your shaman.  That's what I do and it helps my shaman IMMENSELY.  Stuff sold during prime time goes for more money than stuff sold overnight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ya know - I hadn't really considered that, but it would be a big help to me to just make a bazaar mule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've two-boxed a melee (51 paladin), but for some reason I didn't like it. The best combo I've found - don't laugh - is my 50 Cleric. I just sit the cleric in a safe corner and play my shaman. Other than the occasional stun or snare with the Inny necklace, the only two spells I cast are HoT and CH.<br />
<br />
I'm basically soloing with the shaman at incredible efficiency - no downtime beyond the time it takes to canni to FM and then get hit with a CH. If I could afford to give the cleric a mount, it would be that much easier because I could skip the standing/sitting.<br />
<br />
If I was fighting casters, I'd definitely grab the paladin, though. Bash and stuns make even cleric mobs a piece of cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll just point out nicely here that this is a question that gets asked a lot, I recall at least 2 threads on this issue in the past week that addressed the question of which class to duo with.  Search will do you wonders.<br />
<br />
That said, IIRC, good cases are usually made for Shadowknights (probably the preferred right now), Warriors, Paladins, Mages, and Necros, and there's usually a Monk contingent as well.<br />
<br />
Apart from Clerics, who usually don't bring a whole lot to a duo, pretty much anything works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've tried alot of combos, and play a monk atm.  If your looking for something easy yet powerfull, monk is a good bet.<br />
<br />
To me playing 2 casters is hard, but i play a friends 65 necro sometimes on my other box.  This duo is insane, and i highly recommend it.  I slow/debuff/buff/tank with the shaman, and the necro burns the mofos down like theres no tomorrow. Then when he pulls aggro i just FD and get back to tanking with the shaman.  Not to mention the 65 necro pet tanks like a champ.  It mitigates dmg better than my monk in chardokb lol. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">aye Rorgg, I've read those threads ... my question really isn't which class to dual-box though, but if it's worth it at all.  I can't especially think of any class that just &quot;shines&quot; in a dual-box shaman combo, they've all got lots of pros/cons, etc.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just getting to a point where I'm wondering &quot;why bother&quot; in general ... I dunno.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Since you can't think of anything that peaks your interest, how bout:<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
<br />
2 shaman would rock, 1 does dots, tank, other buffs, heals...<br />
<br />
<br />
WE ROCK!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually in addition to the bazaar mule I dualbox with my 46 druid.  This is a pretty good combo for several reasons - ports/evacs, snare, tracking, and downtime heals.<br />
<br />
Even at 46, I can burn half a mana bar on the druid, chain canni with the shaman, and be at FM on the shaman and half mana on the druid pretty darn fast.  And snare and track are SOOOO nice when &quot;soloing&quot; this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with Weissblau on this one.  I 2-box almost all of the time now due to limited playtime.  My druid actually complements my Shaman pretty well.<br />
<br />
I started her before PoP for ports initially, but decided to start 2-boxing to try it.  It is actually quite nice.  Maybe not the most efficient duo, but it works for me.<br />
<br />
1.  Lots of DoTs and DD damage<br />
2.  Snare<br />
3.  Evac - has saved me a more than a few times.  I sometimes end up exploring places that I shouldn't be.  Auto-follow sucks.<br />
4.  Damage Shields<br />
5.  The skin line of druid spells is pretty good and stacks with all of our buffs.  Protection of the Cabbage is actually a good mana regen +6/tick, + 400 or so HP and +24 AC.<br />
6.  Tracking was nice while doing the shawl quests and checking for nameds as I run through zones.<br />
7.  Cheap to gear up a druid in passable gear.  Look into Disturbed Elysians in Umbral for great no drop druid gear that is easy to get 2-boxed with the druid or soloed on the druid.<br />
8.  %CH - If it was a long fight, I canni down quite low and then have my druid CH him.  Druid then regens mana while Shaman pulls.  This will likely be even more useful when I get CannV.<br />
<br />
They complement each other fairly well and with hotkeys, it is pretty easy to 2-box a druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I two box a druid frequently, and I find it a really good matchup for me, although I do like shaman/monk as well.<br />
<br />
Complimentary dots, crosshealing if needed, evac, nine, thorns, nukes, snare etc all compliment the shaman quite well.  Its almost like they are two sides of the same coin they work so well together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I 2 box a necro and shaman.<br />
<br />
I chose this combo mainly because I wanted to be flexible whether I am grouped with others or just soloing with these 2 chars.<br />
<br />
When solo, I work mostly on the necro since it is easier to pull singles because of FD, snares, roots, and fear.  Then on the shaman, I would have slow, pet attack, and 1 dot hot keyed.  I would throw a debuff or/and extra dot in that lineup depending on where I am fighting.<br />
<br />
When in a group, I work mainly on the shaman specially if I am the only healer.  The necro would be hotkeyed only for pet attack and twitching.  A snare and dot would be optional depending on the group make up.<br />
<br />
It really isn't that hard playing a necro and shaman in a group since you won't have to switch back and forth between your 2 pc's trying to make sure everything goes well.  Heck, you can leave the necro FD if you want and just hotkey pet attack so you won't even have to look at that screen.  <br />
<br />
The best part of this combo is the soloing capabilities.  The only mob that gave me problems are those that are totally immune to spells (Gullerback comes to mind).  Good thing about those spell immune mobs is you have 2 pets that can buy you time to gate both characters out. <br />
<br />
Good luck on your choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Their are only 2 big benefit to 2 boxing IMO:<br />
1)  You have a required raid class sitting around, and you need 1 more of said class (cleric most common for this, or enchanter sometimes) who is on your 2nd account.<br />
<br />
2)  You have &quot;issues&quot; with groups.  This could be several things:  you don't like pickup groups, you don't have time to get into pickup groups, you never get pickup groups, etc.  Pretty much, a way to make it easier to solo.  Keep in mind, unless you kill things 2x faster (minus a little bit for the group bonuses), you're getting less exp than you would solo.<br />
<br />
Personally, I hate 2 boxing, but I'll do it on &quot;raids&quot; (only 3 real people in my guild, so we do a bit of that, if you can call them raids =P) if I must.  I never have troubles getting a group if I want one, and the exp in even a pickup group in bot / pov / hoh is going to be better than duoing in almost all cases.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:  Forgot a 3rd reason:  Utility.  Cleric to rez you, druid to port you around (less useful since pop), enc to kei you, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>kabyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I started 2Boxing and now automatically login both accounts every time I play. I never need a group and can start playing immediately . I 2box a ranger with a shaman which I have found to be a perfect fit. Now I am used to it, I don't think I could ever go back to just one toon at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mage seems low maintenance, but I'm not sure how much benefit they'd be aside from summoning pet weapons and burn dps.<br />
<br />
Burn DPS is good on a mage in a pinch, but their pets are where the easy DPS comes into play for 2 boxers (especially with a strong damage shield). Look at it from another angle, Mages are a very strong DPS class, but what is their weakness? No Defense.<br />
<br />
With Shammie Slow/Root, a Mage becomes a great partner. IMO its easier to control two pets while lobbing nukes, than it is to try and control a melee PC.  Yes they fold like a wet napkin when hit, however, in most cases, the shaman will be gaining aggro, and the pets will be peeling the mobs off of the shaman. The mage won't get hit often.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest downsides to two boxing is transporting your characters. Having two classes that can gate is definately a plus, mix in Call of the Hero, and you'll be moving around extremely well.<br />
<br />
One other thing to point out, strong pet classes like mages and necros farm greens better than anyone else in the game (the /pet attack command can be stacked, and you build up a mini hate list for your pet). If you're thinking of creating a bazaar mule, do it on your main account, and once your pet class is high enough in level, put them to work in the tradeskill zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Is there a way to &quot;2 box&quot; with just one pc?  My other pc just fried and I'm not going to replace it anytime soon and hate to have the other account just sit there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">eqwindows.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>JomoMojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I really enjoy dual boxing my magician.  With call of the hero I can do a lot of things that I was doing before, but a lot easier.  For example, I can fully debuff a named mob that might be a bit tough on my group before we even engage.  Click my CoTH macro, click my Slow macro, if it resists who cares I'm already off the mobs aggro list and heading back to cripple it or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xishi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Maybe I'm just getting to a point where I'm wondering &quot;why bother&quot; in general ... I dunno.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it's just priceless to turn down a group in order to say, &quot;I'm playing with myself.&quot;   :D <br />
<br />
I'm kind of late on this thread but did you decide on a character Ciccero or go the mule route?  I've had fun with a shaman/sk combo, but I started both from scratch at the same time. Your situation is different.  I chose the sk for a couple of reasons:  damage, use of gear I stripped from my ranger and spell investment.  Since both of my characters started at the same time, I'm buying most of my sk spells, but in your case it would probably be a fast PL by your shaman so skipping sk spells wouldn't be detrimental.  One way to get decent gear for an twink sk without having to shell out plat (all races but iksar) would be to grab pieces of a sentient suit from WL.</div></div><hr />
