I don't care what &quot;risk&quot; you think is involved, its just too overpowering.<br />
<br />
It would be interesting if they could in some way scale the dps of the pet versus what situation its charmed in.  Like, if its a full group, the charm pet only adds the dps of one support role, perhaps a bit more.  So the charm pet has about shaman dps perhaps.<br />
<br />
However, that would leave chanters unable to solo at all, which would be too big a nerf. So maybe if the chanter is solo, the pet could hit for full power?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mspeedie, I agree with your sentiment, but I must also agree with the correction of an imbalance.  As it stood, charm killing was an imbalance to the game.  It should never have gotten to the point that it did.  However, with SoE hoping to keep the EQ money machine going for a few more years, they had to do something about it or it would have continued to escalate out of control.  In this case, the change is a good one and long overdue.<br />
<br />
Lets raise all boats to an equal level and not continue raising the ones that are already far above the rest.</div></div><hr />

Slow affected 4 classes.  It was an across the board nerf.  The problem was other classes had other useful abilities that either didn't decrease in strength, or became highly sought after in the new content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My point is that it took a lot of work (Snare, Malo, 2nd healer) to properly use the more dangerous pets.<br />

I am going to take a wild guess and say....yes  :D<br />
<br />
It will only use it's secondary damage table when it is under the effect of a charm spell, so when the charm breaks... You have a hasted NPC hitting for its real max damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i have been saying charm was out of control since pop started...charm was a sick tool which should have been fixed then.  any class doing 1500+ dps from controling trash mobs is stupidly overpowering.  50% less damage is still retardedly high damage output.  This was not even close to a nerf, it was a fix.<br />
someone said tipt damage tops off at about 2200 with FA...a pet putting out 1100DPS, what a nerf...<br />
btw, the risk that goes along with charming isn't to high...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's also very dangerous to have a 2000 dps pet.  Your average enchanter will have 3-4 seconds to live under those conditions. And after the enchanter is dead, the rest of the group goes too unless they act quickly.  Charm isn't really overpowered if you look at the risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">With the right controls in place, and a good healer to keep an eye on the enchanter, I think the rewards could easily outweigh the risk.  If a mob is being charmed, there is a good chance it is not the toughest mob you will be facing.  So even if the enchanter does have to get a res, the group can still handle the mob most likely.  With Stuns/Mezzes, a snared mob with it's resists debuffed shouldn't be too tough to control.  <br />
<br />
There will be deaths probably, but with the kind of DPS those mobs can do, you will make up any exp loss many times over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Charm isn't really overpowered if you look at the risk.<br />
<br />
You got that slightly wrong. Charm is really overpowered if you look at the risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This isnt ldon, charm mobs can be snared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yeah, the key to proper max damage charming is the snare.  Once snared, the chanter can keep complete control of the pet so long as she stays far enough away to recapture when charm breaks.  Snare does that for you.  You just intentionally break charm every 13 minutes (if it lasts that long), resnare, and continue.<br />
<br />
I've done my share of charm soloing with my enchanter Auli, and I can tell you that the 50% reduction in dps sucks.  I won't be able to charm solo nearly as effectively in the OoW zones because now I'll have to haste my pet and slow the victim, and that means I'll be dealing with a hasted, max dps enchanter-eating monster when charm breaks...and oh, I have no snare on it.  Lovely.<br />
<br />
My only cause for relief is that it seems this new charm system will only apply in OoW zones...so my charm soloing in HoH and Tactics will be left alone.  *shew*<br />
<br />
Now that idea of scaling damage depending on if you're in a group or not, that's one heck of a good idea.  Speaking as an enchanter, I wouldn't mind that at all.  I'd still be able to charm solo effectively, but my pet wouldn't out-damage the entire group when I charm in groups.</div></div><hr />

An enchanter friend of mine trioed Tipt.  The classes were Ranger, Enchanter and Druid (Yes not even a cleric).  It's simple for the boss, the  Ranger pulls, uses WS and keeps agro, the pet then simly chews the boss up before WS ends.  Each time I have had a Ranger tank the boss I have never seen him/her lose agro.<br />
<br />
Got Tipt flagged with the enchanter (after dieing before I hailed a previous attempt due to invis) and I was basicly there just for the ride, wasn't allowed to cast any spells before the boss mob because the pet was tanking (only enchanter, ranger and cleric were allowed on the hate list)<br />

<br />
F@$% enchanters and the horse they rode in on.<br />
<br />
First of all well still be able to charm like before in any pre-OOW expansion (including tips/vxed).<br />
<br />
Secundo-obvioulsy Grizlor reading skill are poor. If you read carefully we are not &quot;whinning&quot; about not being able to have 2kdps pet. Here what were complaining about:<br />
<br />
-Pet DPS is reduced to half when charmed and return to 100% when charm break. That mean that a pet that cant kill crap while charmed will still one round there former master when released. Where is the risk vs reward there?<br />
<br />
-Lack of CC tool for when charm break. All our CC tool that we had in pop got nerfed as well in OOW. Word of morell line is discontinued (pbaoe mezz) and our new PBaoe stun only last 6 second (not enought for recharm).<br />
<br />
-Inability to solo in OOW without a huge mana pool. Not reduced ability--Inability.With slow mitigation our hasted pet would do slighly more damage than a slowed mob of the same type.<br />
<br />
-Many (NOT ALL) see this a good change in the enchanter community if the point above are corrected.<br />
<br />
To finish, I have 2 question for all of you to answer. <br />
<br />
In a group would you let the enchanter charm a pet that has the DPS of a ranger but can wipe the group in 20 second?<br />
<br />
What about in raid? Would you cut your ranger/druid dps so they can help control a pet that does less dps than them?</div></div><hr />

Each time I have had a Ranger tank the boss I have never seen him/her lose agro.<br />
Oh.  I have no problems with a *ranger*, druid, and enchanter trio doing tipt.  But shaman, enchanter, and druid are not able to do it, which is what they claimed in that other thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">not true ...<br />

False.<br />
From what I've witnessed, if the pet is ever at the top of the aggro, it gets dispelled.<br />
I've seen our warrior pull the kyv, pet was sent in, it aggroed the kyv before the kyv got within melee range of the warrior, charm broke instantly.<br />
It was 100% surely not the first mob to aggro the boss.<br />
<br />
Another situation I have to back this up is this.<br />
I was playing an enchanter for the encounter.<br />
Warrior pulled kyv and started to melee.<br />
I tashed, and sent in pet.<br />
I cast slow, got aggro, and started to run since I had aggro.<br />
Kyv got pulled away from warrior due to my aggro.<br />
With sow, I outrun the kyv, leaving only the pet meleeing the kyv.<br />
That very moment, charm broke, and the kyv returned to chasing me down.<br />
<br />
So how can the druid, shaman, and cleric kill the kyv boss?<br />
The *only* possibility is one of those 3 main tanked the fight while the pet did the dps.<br />
Malos, slow, and the druid + shaman healing while enchanter runes might possibly work.<br />
Incredibly incredibly doubtful that it would work though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">-Inability to solo in OOW without a huge mana pool. Not reduced ability--Inability.With slow mitigation our hasted pet would do slighly more damage than a slowed mob of the same type.<br />

2 mobs worth of xp, no xp drain due to pet, incredibly less mana spent per kill.<br />
<br />
Other option is to take a much stronger pet, and send it at crappier mobs that the stronger mob can take out solo.<br />
<br />
In any case, you *should not* be able to get xp for killing multiple mobs in a row my pulling it with slow, and just waiting around for the pet to finish it off.  That's lame.<br />
<br />
In a group would you let the enchanter charm a pet that has the DPS of a ranger but can wipe the group in 20 second?<br />
A mob hitting for 1k normally, charmed, would now hit for 500s.<br />
That's huge dps.<br />
In a situation like that, I'd sure as hell want the enchanter to charm the pet.<br />
Charm pet, stand far away, send pet and do nothing but be ready for the pet to break charm.<br />
When we have a hasted pet hitting for 500s and duel wielding, we don't need the enchanter to do anything else.<br />
The enchanter is taking the damage dealing spot in the group, and that's pretty much it.<br />
Hell, the enchanter is taking the spot of 3 people in the group for DPS purposes with a hasted 500 hitting duel wielding pet.<br />
If you happen to get 2 mobs in camp, the pet CCs one mob, while the group deals with the other.<br />
When pet breaks charm, enchanter spams the &quot;omg pet broke!&quot; hotkey, and everyone in the group that is capable of rooting the pet does so until the enchanter can recharm.<br />
I'm guessing by even asking this question, you've never thought about trying Tipt or Vxed without a snarer.<br />
<br />
<br />
What about in raid? Would you cut your ranger/druid dps so they can help control a pet that does less dps than them?<br />
<br />
Been there.  Done that.  Had an entire group devoted purely to keeping a mob charmed for the entire 3 hour raid.  The loss of that group's dps wasn't missed, when the pet alone did approximately 1/3 of the *entire* 54 person raid's damage against the end bosses.  We'd still do the same thing for a pet that does 1/6 the damage of the entire raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2k DPS /2 = 1k DPS. I'm affraid I havn't seen a ranger or druid doing 1k DPS. On the raids I attended only on very, very few encounters were charmed pets allowed.<br />
<br />
And I hope the idea with solo charmed pet does full damage will never ever go alive. Just to think about it: To do the same DPS (2k) with DoTs we would have to do 12k damge / tick!!! Would you call this broken?<br />
<br />
PS: OMG you can't solo in OoW now? Hint: just duo and get one with root, snare or stun.</div></div><hr />

I usually don't post to topics like this. Whether I think Charm was unbalanced is of no importance, but...this is ridiculous. What the hell are you people smoking, I wonder.<br />
How can a pet that used to do 2200 DPS suddenly do the DPS of a ranger when it's halved.<br />
Let me do the math for you. A 2k DPS pet which, after this adjustment, is going to do 50% of it's former damage, will still do 1k(duh!) DPS.<br />
<br />
You'd need 5 Rangers to do 1 k DPS. Most groups don't do 1 k DPS. You are smoking bad crack.<br />
<br />
So to answer your questions: Yes and...hell, yes.</div></div><hr />

I can't remember how mcuh Spectral Trushar Worshipper hits for though, but I think it's something like 1500, as opposed to the much smaller ~1000 that pooka hits for.  I'd guess his dps with mage summoned weaponry alone is about 4k dps.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunatly most of the time mob of the same level range hang together. And moving a charmed pet across a zone is really looking for trouble.<br />

I'm guessing by even asking this question, you've never thought about trying Tipt or Vxed without a snarer.<br />
<br />
Yup did vxed without a snarer once. We wiped in the last room when charm broke because i coulnt stay 100 feet behind.<br />
<br />
Personnally I dont think any class should be standing 100 ft behind the group only doing one thing. Enchanters should be able to perform reduced normal duty like mezz and nuke while they have a charmed pet.<br />
<br />
As i said in my first post it is not the damage nerf that concern us the most but the fact that the mob get back to max dps once charm is broke and that we have no way (spell) to get the situation back under control. With reduced DPS charmed pet shoudnt be as much of a burden for a group as before. The enchanter alone should be able to take back control withtout much help from the group.<br />
<br />
<br />
Been there.  Done that.  Had an entire group devoted purely to keeping a mob charmed for the entire 3 hour raid.  The loss of that group's dps wasn't missed, when the pet alone did approximately 1/3 of the *entire* 54 person raid's damage against the end bosses.  We'd still do the same thing for a pet that does 1/6 the damage of the entire raid.<br />
<br />
Hmmm your talking about events that are designed and tuned around charming, when the dev put those mob there they wanted them to be charmed. We re not talking about charming trash mob there. <br />
<br />
And yes i might have been smoking crack about ranger DPS but you must be smoking the same thing as me with a 3500dps pooka. ;)<br />
<br />
Pooka (178% speed) hasted/mage mask/2 mage weapon: 2kdps<br />
Pookia (204% speed) hasted/swiftblade/1 mage weapon: 2,5kdps<br />
<br />
Does the Conflag proc really add 1kdps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">My claim of up to 3500 is from one of my guildmembers who is the main person that parses our guild raids and such.  If he says he's parsed it doing that much, then that's how much it parses.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for your &quot;inability&quot; to solo, if you can't figure out how to solo that's not our problem.  If hasting and equiping a pet roughly doubles it's dps, and it's doing 1/2 damage in OOW, then it's doing the same amount of dps it would do in the first place.  1 mob vs 1 mob doing same dps will get both of the pets to, say, 3% health at the same time.  Invis up with clicky invis, and figure out how to kill 2 mobs that are both at low enough health that 1 single nuke will kill them.  If one mob is higher health, then charm that one and finish off the other mob, then figure out how to kill your charmed pet sitting at slightly higher than 3% health.  Your inability to solo doesn't mean the nerf isn't warranted.<br />
<br />
Your other option is to charm a pet, send it at one mob, and let it get low on health, invis, charm the much healthier mob, and use it to finish off the very low health pet for xp.  Now you have a low health pet, send it at a new mob, let it get low on health, invis, charm the much healthier mob, and use it to finish off the very low health pet#2 for xp.  Repeat.  If you can't handle that, then just EBAY already.  It's not hard.<br />
<br />
Personnally I dont think any class should be standing 100 ft behind the group only doing one thing.Ya.  Instead, you should be 10 feet from the mob doing 1 thing like wizards...<br />
If you are doing dps as a primary role, that's what you are doing, and shouldn't expect to be doing many many roles at once.  If you are charming a pet for dps that is as much or more than the entire group whatsoever, you damn well better expect to spend some time paying attention to keeping it under control.  Risk vs reward and all.  What the hell do you want?  You sound like you want charm to be no risk, and still do CC and nuke and whatever.  You can't have everything.  If you are charming a pet for dps that rivals the *entire group's dps*, then you shouldn't be expecting to do everything else you would normally do.  That reward is way too big.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enchanters should be able to perform reduced normal duty like mezz and nuke while they have a charmed pet.<br />
And shaman should be able to malos, slow, dot, primary heal, and melee every mob, while constantly wincing to have crazy mana regen, right?<br />
What you want is a dire charmed pet.<br />
You can't f'ing do everything.  It's entitlement whores like you that make me happy this kind of nerf is being done finally.<br />
You can't be the CC and the main dps of the group without risk.<br />
Either you can have the crazy dps with no risk and low CC abilities<br />
or you can have the crazy CC abilities with no risk and low dps<br />
or you can have crazy dps and crazy CC abilities, and risk death every second.<br />
You can't have everything.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">It's also very dangerous to have a 2000 dps pet.  Your average enchanter will have 3-4 seconds to live under those conditions. And after the enchanter is dead, the rest of the group goes too unless they act quickly.  Charm isn't really overpowered if you look at the risk.<br />
<br />
My opinion is that no matter what the risk, it was overpowering. Let me quote a enchanter from their own forum.<br />
<br />
 Thandor  :  And lets face it, its pretty much trivial to recharm anything that doesnt summon, if your careful. Theres risk but its not insane<br />
<br />
By their own words recharming is in large part not that dangerous, i would venture to say it is equal to the risk we take trying to slow a mob on INC before it gets to a group. If we slow to fast we will get ate, its a simple matter of class knowledge and player skill, not a huge risk that its made out to be, not with the rune system in the game for the enchanters.<br />
<br />
But beyond that, having a pet that was as powerful as they could charm in places like BoT/Elemental/LDoN Hard/GoD was too much and i say that cause it made them more desired then any other class for this. Not only did they have KEI and the best haste in the game and a few other useful group spells, but they could bring DPS to a group that a whle group full of rogues or wizards probably couldnt keep up with. They are not a DPS class to begin with so beyond it just being plain unbalanced for them to bring this to the table, its out of their class description to have that ability.<br />
<br />
So that said, i think this is a great change. It sucks for them cause something they had for so long is being changed, but i honestly think it was not a right ability for them in the first place., Fun yes, useful hell yea, but right it was not. IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">This is just another example of SoE's very, very, very slow and very, very, very dim understanding of how much the change from low-DPS/high-HP mobs to low-HP/high-DPS mobs changed the game in very fundamental ways.  It has taken them years to realize the most obvious issue with that new paradigm.  Perhaps in a few more years, they will pick up on some of the more subtle ones.  Like our class.<br />
<br />
That being said, I very much hope that this change came along with an enormous increase in enchanter usefulness doing their normal functions (cc above all), which have been MIA in large swaths of content for a very long time.  That remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Oh bloody hell... Aurolia you're so full of it.<br />
obvioulsy Grizlor reading skill are poor. If you read carefully we are not &quot;whinning&quot; about not being able to have 2kdps pet. Here what were complaining about :<br />
<br />
-Pet DPS is reduced to half when charmed and return to 100% when charm break. That mean that a pet that cant kill crap while charmed will still one round there former master when released. Where is the risk vs reward there?1) yes, you are whining about not being able to have a 2kdps pet, because apparently a 1kdps pet isn't good enough suddenly.<br />
2) Ever heard of Stun? or Root? come on, is it really that hard to hit tab to cycle target to your pet then fire off a greater Fetter?<br />
-Lack of CC tool for when charm break. All our CC tool that we had in pop got nerfed as well in OOW. Word of morell line is discontinued (pbaoe mezz) and our new PBaoe stun only last 6 second (not enought for recharm).<br />
If you're charming without a snarer that's through your own stupidity. if you're solo and charming you can use good old root like the rest of us ^_^ you're getting an extra spell slot, make use of it.<br />
-Inability to solo in OOW without a huge mana pool. Not reduced ability--Inability.With slow mitigation our hasted pet would do slighly more damage than a slowed mob of the same type.Don't get me started on Slow Mitigation. with slow mitigation our relative healing power drops by a factor of 2.5 on trash that mitigates &quot;Partially&quot;.<br />
<br />
But you can haste and equip your pet with weapons which will double (if not more than double) its DPS, then slow what it's fighting. I think this point was already raised.<br />
-Many (NOT ALL) see this a good change in the enchanter community if the point above are corrected.<br />
You should be overjoyed that they're even letting you charm AT ALL in this expansion, yet you're whining like little bitches.<br />
To finish, I have 2 question for all of you to answer.<br />
<br />
In a group would you let the enchanter charm a pet that has the DPS of a ranger but can wipe the group in 20 second?<br />
1) I don't know any rangers that do 1000 DPS. Can you please introduce me to one?<br />
<br />
2) Wipe the group in 20 seconds... Yeah, if the enchanter is a retard and has no clue what in the hell they are doing... But based on the posts you've made in this very thread I really start to wonder.<br />
What about in raid? Would you cut your ranger/druid dps so they can help control a pet that does less dps than them?Risk. Versus. Reward. A druid or ranger can take 5 seconds to snare something, it's part of thier damn JOB. to make stuff snared. The raid isn't going to miss the 1000 damage a ranger wouldn't do in those 5 seconds, that's 1-2 hits from a charmed pet<br />
You forgot 4 line...<br />
<br />
Root fade<br />
Nuke break root<br />
Charm break<br />
Chanter die<br />
<br />
Happen randomly at least once every 7,5 min <br />
All that easy charming exp and you don't have run speed 3? /boggle.<br />
Unfortunatly most of the time mob of the same level range hang together. And moving a charmed pet across a zone is really looking for trouble.<br />
<br />
Why not if it grant about the same xp as other soloers class? Granted we have take more risk than them and that our pet steal some xp.<br />
Because your charmed pet could rip through zones like crazy. I was in tactics like a year ago duoing with a necro agro kiting, and an enchanter was ripping through like 10 mobs to each that we killed. Are you telling me your pet steals 90% of the exp from your kills?<br />
Yup did vxed without a snarer once. We wiped in the last room when charm broke because i coulnt stay 100 feet behind.<br />
<br />
Personnally I dont think any class should be standing 100 ft behind the group only doing one thing. Enchanters should be able to perform reduced normal duty like mezz and nuke while they have a charmed pet.<br />
<br />
As i said in my first post it is not the damage nerf that concern us the most but the fact that the mob get back to max dps once charm is broke and that we have no way (spell) to get the situation back under control. With reduced DPS charmed pet shoudnt be as much of a burden for a group as before. The enchanter alone should be able to take back control withtout much help from the group.<br />
Failing tipt because you didn't bring someone to snare or babysit your pet is your own fault. When we flag our lesser geared knights for vxed/tipt, we put em on pet control duty. a stun or a fear and the pet follows them, they kite it, you recharm. blam, easy as pie.<br />

<br />
Of course charming is a bit easier on the PvP servers too though.  Can get the charmed pet resnared/remalosed/whatever without having to break charm assuming you aren't the same race (on PvP teams).</div></div><hr />

Let's be fair, charm was getting overpowered. Just a shame that it takes Sony until the NEXT expansion to nerf it, while all the powergamer types have already exploited the benefits. (I don't mean this is an exploit, i mean it in the usual sense of the word).<br />
<br />
Shamans and enchanters have a lot in common (haste, slow, we have ghetto CC with roots) so I expect Shamans to get more invites to groups now. I've recently done a lot of sewers trials where the group didn't have an enchanter/bard for mez and I've played CC. Recently most of my guild think of the enchanter as a &quot;dps&quot; class not a crowd-control class.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong, but I think this nerf will benefit us, (ieven f it does limit our ability to storm through mobs as fast when grouped with an enc)</div></div><hr />

I friend of mine who I know quite well in RL and i started toons bout the same time.<br />
<br />
I got my sham to 200 AA and he was at 400 AA, we play similar times.<br />
<br />
Early days of pop i would go with him while we would charm kill the named in Bot. we would stand there and watch full groups fail, then I would pull with malos, he would tash and charm, then we would kill the named<br />
<br />
Didnt really need my help, cause his hasted, charmed pet with weapons could kill both the named and his remaining guard without drama, but he was being nice.<br />
<br />
Then they nerfed that somewhat by reducing the xp a charmed pat gave, so he came to me one night with the tactics faction xp exploit. I remember going with him and getting 15 aa's in a single 4 hour session.<br />
<br />
I remained steadfast, but in the face of someone saying &quot;I always make sure i get my 5 aa's per day before i accepting a group&quot; its a tad hard to remain motivated and convinced of the &quot;balance&quot; and &quot;Vision&quot;.<br />
<br />
And he used to complain to me bards got better xp.....<br />
<br />
He was a very tallented charmer, but he was still by far and away so overpowered that it was dissheartening to even be in the same zone as him.<br />

I think for the health of the game this should be avoided.<br />

I don't really like seeing them nerfed, but I guess I can understand the point.  If a full 75% slow is making things trivial, adding a 3500dps monster to your arsenal for a single group encounter is insane.  That's like adding 3 groups!<br />

Pookas in tipt (just as an example) move plenty slow even without snare. <br />
<br />
As a response to &quot;fast moving&quot; or &quot;summoning&quot; mobs in tipt some groups go further and keep the pet at 10% HP so that it is always &quot;running&quot; when it wakes up.<br />
<br />
I know quite a few high end groups that have done tipt without a chanter. It takes 2 clerics (i hear) and a strong tank. <br />
<br />
I just realised (in response to my earlier group) this actually means the shaman does not get into the group whereas with an enc they do.<br />

I have no doubt this is doable.  After a couple unlucky deaths, and an LD, our group found ourself with only chanter/shaman/ranger left to face the Kyv boss in Tipt.  It didn't have a prayer.  Even with my crap heals, the charmed pet ate the boss alive.</div></div><hr />

1 charmed mob in tactics will take 1 red splitter + the 2 splits and still have HP left to kill more WITHOUT heals....<br />

yeah, in tipt the chamred mobs /own the boss...i know a chanter who does it with a cleric/druid/enchanter as the team to beat it...<br />
<br />
even with the DPS OOW pets will be putting out, they are still going to outDPS an entire group most likey..<br />
<br />
i refuse to even contemplate the fact that charm soloing could be dangerous.  Most of the enchanters i know rarely die when useing charm, and when they do they don't even bother getting a rez because it slows them down...<br />
<br />
edit- as to the bard AE &quot;nerf&quot;-<br />
one of the top end bards on my server was telling me, not more than 2ish days ago: he AE kills in fire, it is about 15 mins to get the mobs in mass and about 40ish minutes to kill them.  this was anywhere from 8-12AAs a kite depending on how many mobs he pulled...as far as soloing goes, i am very pleased to get 1 AA in a half hour.  i am not so sure this such a &quot;nerf&quot; as it is a fix.  this nerf/fix isn't as obvious as the chanter fix due to the nature of bards usually doing this solo, but the fact remains that this stuff was going on way to long and really should have been fixed expansions ago...</div></div><hr />

(for the obvious impaired, yes this was sarcasm)<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
On the serious side - it is a nerf. Anyone holding the timeline for how long ago Smedley said, &quot;No more nerfs!&quot;? Nevermind ... shaman are proof we are way past that selling point.<br />
<br />
Without charm, what do enchanters bring to the group? They can slow and provide some CC. Enchanter CC abilities have been spiraling downward for a long time though. At least the mez lines. Duration decreased and mob levels mezzable require spells you get within 1,2 or 3 levels of the mob. Recast times and cast times lengthened.<br />
<br />
Yeah, charm gave chanters a dominant group role. But without it they become redefined. This is a possible bump for shaman cuz if the chanter can't perform at the prefered level they will be replaced in groups and shaman higher slow and marginal healing makes us better than chanters that can't charm. Then again, beastlord dps, slow, preferred buffs beat both of us out.<br />
<br />
Chanters are not there yet, but that doesn't mean they won't be soon. It doesn't mean that as OoW content is tuned, adjusted, fixed that the 'write-off' class this expansion will be enchanters. This might be good. In places where they can still charm a shaman/enchanter duo would be awesome. (oops, sarcasm creeping in again.)<br />
<br />
Nerfs are nerfs. They suck. Essentially this is mitigation of charm ... surely, as a shaman, you understand the concept of mitigation and how, rapidly, it evolves into complete removal of a fundamental and basic class skill base.<br />
<br />
What is this mention of only on OoW mobs? Didn't SOE introduce the lowered damage tables for charmed mobs in other zones already? HoH, PoV come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">If mobs in GoD would resemble anything sane, this nerf would be completely unnecessary.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Entharion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">While I understand your contempt for our &quot;whining&quot; over this issue, and I understand the Shamans' complaints about current game status, and I think it's interesting to hear your arguments, I would like to correct a few facts/conceptions that some of you seem to have wrong:<br />
<br />
1) A 2k dps pet is hardly the norm. This is pretty much only achievable in vxed and tipt, two trials based around charm. If it wasn't for charm, these trials would be almost impossible to ferry a whole guild through. Tipt pretty much requires two clerics and a 11k+ tank if you don't have a charm pet, which would make the KT+ flagging process unbearably long for any guild. If it wasn't for charm, those zones would look very different. But yes, charm is wildly unbalanced in those two zones, and most reasonable chanters you talk to will agree with you on this. Making these zones excellent xp zones was a huge mistake. Noone cares if one class is almost required for a progression trial (sewer 2 rogues, etc), but when the trial turns into a xp zone rivalling anything but Fire and KT, it becomes wrong. However, the overpowered state of charm in those two places shouldn't really make it underpowered in the rest of the game.<br />

2) Charm soloing hasn't been very unbalanced in a long time. With the nerfs that came around during PoP, even the best solo chanters I know only average an AA every 40-45 minutes solo. Of course, this is very powerful, but bards and necros still AA faster than us solo. I am not sure about wizards and druids at fire tables, but I am pretty sure they approach the same rates. With the very unreliable nature of charm, true, 20-25 minute AAs are achievable with extreme luck, which helps strengthen other classes' dislike of charm. Those runs are extremely rare though. Even though I consider myself a very skilled charmer, the fastest I have ever got was 30 minutes. Note that I am talking about the current state of charm, not the exploit that was tactics pit war, or the wildly unbalanced pre-nerf PoP charming.<br />
<br />
3) The main gripe most chanters have with this change is that the risk, not only to the chanter but to the group, is so huge compared to the dps put out by the pet, and that the change is sweeping. In outdoor Dreadlands-like zones, even the nerfed charm pets will be quite viable, unless they summon. In any tighter spot though, charm will be pretty much completely impossible, because to make the charm pet deal enough dps we have to buff it enough that it is impossible to control in close quarters. Several of us are pushing for a change that will make charm block haste instead (by including a 1% slow), which will make it viable in most zones, but still rarely overpowered. Tell me the last time an unhasted charm pet (again, outside of vxed or tipt) was unreasonably powerful? An unhasted pet will be possible for the chanter to control pretty much solo, like it is in LDoN, instead of having to build a pet control unit instead of a group.<br />
<br />
4) I hate repeating myself, but don't judge charm by it's nature in vxed and tipt. Those are only two instanced zones out of a zillion in the game, and we all agree they were a mistake (in their current form).<br />
<br />
<br />
And btw, hi Vincenzo :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, I forgot to add. One of the reasons we are hanging on to charm this tightly is because the last couple of expansions have reduced our ability to perform our primary ability (CC) by a lot. If we could still CC like we used to, complaints would be far fewer. And no, our ability to cast C5 and haste is no more &quot;our primary ability&quot; or a role we want to play any more than your ability to cast Focus, Sta and Haste. Being a buffwhore is not fun, and does not even require a player behind the character (or for the character to even be in the group). You should know more than anyone.<br />

<br />
<br />
I don't think the change is in the rest of the game.  I think the change is only to OOW zones, and I would expect that the reason is because there would be more situations like &quot;vxed or tipt&quot; in OOW.  I haven't been in but 2 zones in OOW and I have already run into mobs that hit for nearly 1k extremely fast.  Seeing how easily I found those mobs, I don't think it would be too hard to find charmable mobs that hit for 2k either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not.  Any zone an enchanter charms a pet that can out-perform the entire group's dps is what I'm judging charm by.   And I see that often.  Bot, Tactics, etc...  Anywhere an enchanter is charming a mob equal to the lvl of the mobs you are fighting, there's a pretty good chance that mob will outdo the dps of the group.  Thats wrong.<br />
<br />
It doesn't just make competing classes like shaman and beastlords feel out of place and useless, if you can perform both a slowing, cc, and dps role... it was also making it useless to have any dps classes in the group.<br />
<br />
Like I posted above, I don't think the nerf was strong enough.  Chanters should be able to provide dps equal to other support roles, period.  Course, that hasn't been the case for such a long time, that I'm sure half the chanter population would just quit if they could *only* provide the dps that shamans can provide.  <br />
<br />
I still don't understand the attitude that the enchanter is a dps class.  <br />
Enc = Crowd control, buffing, debuffing<br />
Shm = Healing, buffing, debuffing<br />
Bst = Dps, buffing, debuffing<br />
<br />
Shaman have mainly been fine with just enough dps to solo, and I don't see a problem letting enc's have enough dps to solo either.  Just containing that entire package of the dps, a free tank, and no need to heal in the form of a charmed pet was a bad move from the beginning to give a class solo abilities.<br />
<br />
The only reason I think that shaman started to whine and beg about upping our own dps was directly because a chanter (our main group spot competition) could provide so much of it. <br />
<br />
I'd much rather see charm hover around 100-150 dps, but make it set duration.  Heck, I'd even give Enchanters snare.  That way they could aggro kite much the same that necro's do now, they'd just have a pet thats 2-3x as good as a necro's pet dps (course with 10x the hp), but lack the dots as a balance.</div></div><hr />

Outside of normal LDoNs, noone pulls more than 3 mobs on purpose in any good 65 xp zone today, and if the argument is that zones are spacious enough for charm to be low-risk, then zones are also spacious enough for root to be as good CC as mez.<br />
<br />
This isn't a chanter vs shaman discussion though, I AGREE that shamans are hurting like hell in GoD, and I understand your pain. We are simply arguing the thoughtless nerf, when it could have been done so much more elegantly. A 1% built in slow to negate haste would:<br />
a) make it impossible to solo/duo nameds anywhere but old zones where other classes can as well<br />

<br />
Thats my proposal.  You get snare, and shaman dps, plus a fixed duration.. say... 45minute charm.  Zero risk.   But, honestly, how risky is charm if you are in a competent group?  Not much in my experience.  The reward has always been far beyond the risk imo.  The only times its truly risky is when you're in confined areas, but then you have to ask yourself.. why the heck are you using charm in that situation?  Its not different that a wizard overnuking and being summoned imo.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Comparing crowd control to healing is also a very slanted comparison, with the extreme importance of healing compared to crowd control in today's game.&quot;<br />
<br />
And shaman healing contributes how much to the group versus locking down the 2 mobs that quad for 4k per pop?  The new mobs in GoD who spawn the adds/pets... Charm is just as useful, more so with mobs specifically designed to bring adds with them.  Our healing, on the other hand, was always balanced around slow.  Slow was nerfed with mitigation, but our healing wasn't increased to match that nerf.<br />
<br />
&quot;Outside of normal LDoNs, noone pulls more than 3 mobs on purpose in any good 65 xp zone today, and if the argument is that zones are spacious enough for charm to be low-risk, then zones are also spacious enough for root to be as good CC as mez.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wish I had AE root:) to compete with AE mez.   Or the ability to lower a mobs resists in 1 second.  Or the ability to AE tash.  Try casting malos (5 second cast, 10 second recast on the three adds that jumped you and rooting each one.... jeez).  But I do agree with you that in normal grouping scenarios, adds are less of an issue (except for the new god pet adds).  But you can't tell me root is as good as your arsenal of cc abilities.  And since my heal can't compete with even one KT mob, having that mob mezzed is a better solution than someone offtanking it or having to heal against it.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't a chanter vs shaman discussion though, I AGREE that shamans are hurting like hell in GoD, and I understand your pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Its is, because most groups will take a chanter over a shaman directly because of this issue, and your ability to pull, and your... etc..  Granted, if we healed as well as druids, provided a better fraction of your dps, had our hybrid cousins ability to give mana, etc.. I might be considered more for groups:)  But chanters are definetly the main shaman group competition, so really, what happens to us affects you, and vice versa.  <br />
<br />

<br />
I have heard your argument, but I think any situation where one class can out dps the entire group, dropping mobs in 15 seconds that should take 45 seconds, etc.. far outweighs the &quot;risk&quot; of dying.  Which in most cases is just having the backup healer FD, or 10 minutes of downtime where you get rezzes.<br />
<br />
Really, the risk isn't a risk. Whats dying in EQ?  Nothing but a bit of downtime really.  And when you're killing 3x as fast, you still come out way ahead.  <br />
<br />
I agree you need to retain the ability to solo, so I don't have the answer for that.  Perhaps you'll need to swap the pets like druids did at ww in pon.  Perhaps sony needs to give you some better dots or nukes.  Whichever.  But even at 70% less power (without haste) a charmed pet can drop a 10k tank in seconds in GoD.  Thats still way overpowered imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Grouping with a shaman could be risky, we could cast Stoicism on you :)</div></div><hr />

This would negate the purpose of charm altogether, and we might as well get a summon pet that does that. If we did, it wouldn't be much of a problem, except the class would be a lot less interesting to play. <br />
<br />
&quot;And shaman healing contributes how much to the group versus locking down the 2 mobs that quad for 4k per pop? The new mobs in GoD who spawn the adds/pets...&quot;<br />
Well, most mobs can be locked down with root as well, and your healing matches the dps of the spawned pets as far as I have seen. Yes, we are good at CC, but with today's state of the game, I would switch my mezzes for fixed-duration-root and shaman heals most days (that is, if I wanted maximum power).<br />
<br />
&quot;Wish I had AE root to compete with AE mez. Or the ability to lower a mobs resists in 1 second. Or the ability to AE tash.&quot;<br />
Heh. Outside of special events, AE mez and AE tash is never used at 65+. Most chanters are also jealous at malos because of it's low aggro and higher debuff. Mezzing in KT is a moot point, it is never required, everything can be pulled solo with less risk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have heard your argument, but I think any situation where one class can out dps the entire group, dropping mobs in 15 seconds that should take 45 seconds, etc.. far outweighs the &quot;risk&quot; of dying.

<br />

<br />
Nowhere in the 65 xp group game (again, outside of vxed and tipt) do I know of a charm pet that outdamages the entire group unhasted, unless the group is made of all support casters. Even in an extremely charm friendly place like tactics, two good dps characters deal more dps than an unhasted charm pet, and they present zero risk to the group. When a charm pet is treated like it will be in OOW, with insane power on breaks, but not enough power charmed to run the whole group like in tipt, groups can no longer afford to dedicate 3 players to keeping pet controlled. That will result in even MORE group wipes than in tipt, and complete wipes cost at least 20 minutes of xp time, often more. Again, we're not asking for vxed/tipt class pets. Or even tactics pets. We want to<br />
- retain our ability to solo for xp, not including the ability to kill group nameds solo/duo.<br />
- have pets with balanced risk/reward, instead of pets that are twice as dangerous to the group as to the mobs we are fighting.<br />
<br />
In my eyes, a 1% slow would achieve this, while the current nerf/fix/change does not. Not surprisingly, a lot of people disagree. The grass will always be greener on the other side, and every class think they suck compared to their bitter rivals (ranger vs rogue, druid vs shaman, enchanter vs shaman, warrior vs knights, etc), so that's just the way it'll have to be. <br />
