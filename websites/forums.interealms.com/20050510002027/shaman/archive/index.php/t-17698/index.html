Your pet mows through mobs like their nothing.<br />
<br />
Sorry<br />
<br />
Beastlord for me is not fun but ultra boring.<br />
<br />
I don't get it, why everyone raves about them. I really do prefer the shaman playwise.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just recently brushed the dust off the Beastlord I made soon after Luclin went live. Got him up to 22 back then and left him to go back to the Shaman. Got the Beastlord to 32 now and still working on him.<br />
<br />
I'm having fun, it's cool to fight with your pet and a very different experience from my Shaman. The DPS is great and being able to melee well is what makes it fun for me.<br />
<br />
But oh man, I miss root and canni so much. :(<br />
<br />
Even when I get my mana buff line it still won't be the same. I like being in control of my mana pool. I like being able to give myself huge chunks back when i want. Medding sucks, period. :P<br />
<br />
Playing the Beastie is letting me realize this whole class envy thing is a bunch of crock. I love the Shaman for it's diversity and control. I'm liking the beastlord for it's in your face DPS. Both are fun but I don't think I'll ever prefer a Beastie over a Shaman. <br />
<br />
Just my 2 copper. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Morel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sooo, what level did you get to to base this judgement of Beastlords on?  I understand it is your opinion and I'm not judging you but I was curious as to what level, what you were hunting, etc.<br />
<br />
My understanding is that all levels prior to 20 are kinda boring then most of the 20's are, for some, just as boring.  I believe with most classes things start getting interesting in the 30's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Low levels are a blast with the bst because of the pet.  But wait until you are level 48 with the same pet you had 39, that kinda sucked :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Real Beastlords don't med. Why should you when your slow costs so little that there is hardly any movement on your mana bar. Heals? nah just use bandaids between fights and keep plowing. About the only thing we use mana other than slows is to keep our mana buff up for the group. Again I have to ask why is there so much hatred for Beastlords? They aren't shaman and they sure as hell don't want to be know as the group buffer/healer. Hell I started a Beastlord so I could get a break from that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I played my first character, a druid, I also played a ranger.  I considered them both my mains because I leveled them up at roughly the same time and which one I played depended on whether I felt like playing a caster or killing more up close and personal.  They are both 51st level and in semi retirement.  <br />
<br />
I started playing my shaman and fell in love with the class.  And after I started grouping, about level 35, and my melee days all but faded away, I began missing the unclose blood and carnage.  So I created a beastlord.  I still consider my shaman my main, but my barbarian beastlord is a lot of fun to play.  He’s 54th level and working on run three.  I’ve been driven of late to get at least my first piece of shaman armor from the Everfrost camp, so I’ve not played my beastlord recently, but one day I’m sure I’ll feel like kicking some butt again and Jondor will be back in action.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's cause some idiot comes in here every once in a while and posts something like &quot;OMG BST r rule; SHM r suxx!  Y evar would u pik SHM over BST in ne group lololol!!!1!!!11!&quot;  and all the shm have a big discussion on shm vs bst etc...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah it's because people like to continually bring up the whole BST vs SHM thing when there really is no point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well beastlords and shaman arent in the same boat to me anymore.  After contemplating a few things on the beast that the shaman didn't have I made one and twinked teh piss out of it and went to town.  Got it to the high 30's atm and entirely differetn set of tactics.  <br />
<br />
The beast to me is more of a cross between sk and necro play instead of shaman, You have a great pet but your combat alone sucks (hence necro).  but combine the two and you have one solid class. <br />
<br />
The things that the beast does not have that shaman do, Root, dots (good ones), DD, canni, ability to handle 4 mobs or so at a time (maybe i suck but I could only do two at a time cause I cant heal with the beast for squat, yes thats right you can't root park back up heal yourself then jump back in.).<br />
<br />
SO from now on when anyone says beastlords are so much better than shaman I will laugh laugh laugh.  Cause there is no real comparison, we are craptastic for melee, but have other tactics to employ that make it fun.</div></div><hr />

No need for root. The pet holds aggro quite well. You just need to back up so that the mob switches to the pet. Anytime you or any PC is in melee range mobs will ignore the pet. If you play it right by having the pet change targets you can get him to park more than 2 mobs. This will cause you to put yourself in pet cleric mode but there are times when this is a great option to be able to fall back on. Beastlord heals suck just like all hybrid heals but Beasts also get a pet heal line of spells that can fully heal a pet in 2 casts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because most shamans don't want to be known as group buffwhores that might as well be bots either.  Or clerics except with crappy heals, no rez and vastly inferior buffs.<br />
<br />
People bring it up as a &quot;competition for pickup group spot&quot; issue.<br />
<br />
Shamans used to be the ideal choice for almost any group without a slower, and even many with an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Now, only some spots are not all ideally filed by a shaman.  If you need more healing or CC in your group, the shaman remains the ideal choice.  But if you don't, the BL is the best option, all else being equal.<br />
<br />
I am not saying it is a bad move or an unfair one, but it is a simple fact that shamans are ideal choices for fewer groups than they were before BLs got their new slow.<br />
<br />
Luckily for those shamans that do a lot of pickup grouping, 99.99% of pickup EQers have exactly zero clue at all about this fact, so that while our theoretical desireability has dropped significantly, our actual desireability has not.</div></div><hr />

The main reason I use root is crowd control, I've never played a beastlord so can someone say what happens when soloing if you get adds. As my shaman can just root  the adds move away and continue the fight maybe dotting the add for good measure. I can't see how a pet can hold aggro from several mobs when you start healing the pet for loads</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The same thing can be said for alot of classes. All of the &quot;required&quot; classes are no longer absolutely critical for a good group. As an example druids and Paladins work just as well as clerics in most experience groups and SK's and Paladins work as well as warriors. Thye list goes on and on. This isn't the same game it was even two years ago. Class distinction and specialization has been blurred over the last few years. The fact is that shaman aren't absolutely required for alot of situations they once were. We all need to realize that and move on. EQ has evolved and I doubt they will ever move it back to where it was. They would rather see groups out killing mobs than sitting around at a zoneline waiting for a cleric, warrior or shaman to ask for a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Flash of light is my weapon of choice for adds with my Beastlord.  That certainly isn't as effective as root, and it doesn't work very well at higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">couple mid 50's shaman here, and a 65 chanter, and I made a BL, twinked to 33 in three days, and I must say I am impressed.<br />
<br />
Different, all about offense it seems, and can take a hit, but I dont see them replacing shaman, I still think a well played shaman is the king, grouped with some 65 BL's and ya, good damage, but still thinkm shammy better if doing tough stuff.<br />
<br />
I just need a damage class that kicks ass for once, tired of playing caster/support. Besides, chanty/Bl combo gonna whup some ass.<br />
<br />
Mill the old newb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wow, not seen Mill in a bit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">All of the &quot;required&quot; classes are no longer absolutely critical for a good group.<br />
<br />
Exactly, and to do this most classes got rather improved abilities or spells. Druids got great hp/regen/mana/ac buffs and massive heals (on top of already excellent DD, dots, roots, and snare). Pallys got even better buffs, heals and stuns. SKs got better damage spells. Etc Etc. <br />
<br />
Shaman are still primarily a Malo/Slow class. Shaman dots are mana inefficient and their DD blows. Their healing and regen capability falls behind druids. Stat buffs are useless. Shaman utility spells are outdated and useless (its insanely easy to get ultravision, see invis, lev or EB items now). <br />
<br />
Shaman really should have their scope expanded some by adding some of the following: spell casting slows (curse?), more fast acting debuff dots (30 second dot and debuff effect), or expanded pet functionality.</div></div><hr />
