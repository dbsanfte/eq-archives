Away on &quot;business&quot; (i.e. golf, drinking...usually BS) 8-10 hours.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The thing about having babies in the house isn't that your nights are that much shorter, it's just that<br />
<br />
   A) They are constantly being INTERRUPTED, sometimes 5-6-7 times a night, for 15-30-45 minutes depending on the child<br />
<br />
   B) Babies wake up at the same time on weekends as weekdays.<br />
<br />
So the 6 hours you're getting now is going to feel more like 4.5 or 5 hours, and if you currently get extra sleep on the weekends, you can kiss that goodbye unless you work out an arrangement with your spouse.</div></div><hr />

I deliberately moved so as to be 15 mins (by bike) away from my place of work. I can drag myself out of bed at 8:30 am and still be at my desk by 9.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Potens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There was a study done that said 8 hours is what you should shoot for as a normal adult.  They say you have a GREATLY increased chance of dieing early if you sleep LONGER.  And a slightly increased chance of dieing early if you sleep SHORTER.  So if you get less than 8 hours you are better off than someone who gets 11. <br />

NOTE: It might be 7 not 8.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Oh one of my favorite subjects.<br />
<br />
I've been working third shift (11:00 PM to 7:00 AM) for over 20 years and here are some tips on how to adapt and survive as a vampire.<br />
<br />
Be consistant-I go to bed within a few minutes of 11:00 AM and get up within a few minutes of 5:00 PM everyday I work and even on days off I come close to this. During vacations this slips and I end up closer to normal nighttime sleep but force myself back to this schedule a few days before going back to work.  Remember that 2:00 PM in the afternoon is the middle of the night for you so treat it like that and tell your friends and neighbors that this is when you sleep, some things like lawnmowers and daytime sounds can't be avoided but at least your buddies won't be calling in the middle of the night to borrow your toilet plunger or to ask you to play a game of tennis. The hours may vary but still be consistant.<br />
<br />
Caffeine- Avoid it. I'm a big coffee drinker so I violate this rule but I still don't use coffee to stay awake after work. If you are drinking caffeinated beverages to stay awake after work, that's the time when you should be sleeping.<br />
<br />
Sunlight-can't be avoided but should be kept to a minimum after work and before sleeping. One of the things night workers notice is that no matter how sleepy they may be at 4:00 AM once that sun starts coming up they get less sleepy. This is your body making awakening chemicals.<br />
<br />
Darkness-Good, keep your house dark and sleep in the dark. You still can't fool your body into thinking it's night, there are too many other factors involved but you can at least help it not get anymore awake by keeping your house just like it was getting dark in the evening. This means that electric lights are ok, it's sunlight that is the problem. When I first started trying to sleep in the day I covered my bedroom windows with black opaque contact paper and then dark heavy curtains. Even one tiny ray of light was like a laser drilling into the room.  Now I don't need it that dark but I still use heavy dark velvet curtains in the bedroom and every other room has heavy curtains or blinds pulled closed until I go to bed. Yeah just like in a funeral parlor.<br />
<br />
Noise-Noise masks noise, old law of acoustics. Get something in the bedroom that makes a constant noise to lull you to sleep and to mask outside noises. The two best sources of this are the plain old box floor fan and a room air conditioner. Turn the fan to medium or high and you'll block most of the impulse noise that wakes you up and even mellow out lawnmowers if you hear them at all. Window air conditioners are even better, I had a neighbor that used a chainsaw in the day and a window unit was able to block that. You don't have even have to have the cooling on, usually the fans are enough. The key is loud white noise, any pings or pops of the fan blades will stand out and keep you awake. I've found the white noise or waterfall sound generators that they sell don't work as well, they never get loud enough.<br />
<br />
Face up to the fact that you'll never get a &quot;good nights sleep&quot; in the daytime. You'll always be a bit tired, a bit edgy and always ready to plop into bed when it's time to go to work. This is just biology at work. There is still nothing like sleeping at night when your body wants you to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tenoq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">well, since I'm between degrees and all I have to do until fall is work 20 hours a week I get about 4-6 hours nightly, usually going to bed between 4 and 7am and waking up at about noon.

<br />
4 hours a sleep on average for the past decade plus.  And now thanks to the blasted heat I'm getting well under 2 now.  If I had wanted to wake up every 15 minutes I'd have had kids. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've found that 24 was my favorite age, I'm 2 years shy of 50 now. At 24 you were old enough to get in places and young enough to walk and your hands still worked. <br />
<br />
Another thing..every abuse you put yourself through in your teens, 20's and 30's comes back to bite you with a vengence in your late 40's or early 50's. Trust me on this.<br />

You know what the worst part is? It's when you realize that you've lived longer then you have left and then you think how fast that first half of life went and you know time isn't getting any slower.</div></div><hr />

Bed at 1am, up at 7am IF I AM LUCKY (that means no one pinged me for a pickup raid or something :)).  Wife works a lot of nights, so my sleep is broken up by attending to the children.  I have learned to sleep like I was dead, as illustrated by the fact I woke up this morning covered with self-adhesive address labels (you know the sticky ones you can get so you don't have to write your return address all the time) and had two grinning little kids staring and laughing.....<br />
<br />
Hmm, maybe I *should* get more sleep :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I've been a father for 10 months now.  I really really dreaded my sleep schedule after my daughter was born, but I think i'm the luckiest man on the planet :) <br />
<br />
From almost the time we got her home from the hospital, she slept all nite long.  Seriously...10pm to 8-10am.  Scared the crap out of my wife and I at first....nothing like going to be exhausted at 11pm, expecting to have to get up in a couple hours with the baby and the next thing you notice is it's sunny out.  We both ran to the kids room a couple times to find the little bum alive and healthy, but still out like a rock :)<br />
<br />
Nowadays, it's not uncommon for her to go to bed at 10-12 and wake up at 10 or 11am, then maybe take a nap during the day.  <br />
<br />
All in all, I think we really lucked out on the whole parenting deal :)</div></div><hr />

 Babies are like Vampires - they sleep by day and suck the life out of you at night. <br />

More than 8 is not good. The better shape I am in (running, weight lifting), the less I eat and the less sleep I need.<br />
<br />
Conversely, the more out of shape I am, the more lethargic I feel.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I used to get 4-5 hours of sleep a night, getting back from work around midnight-2am, playing EQ till 7-8am and then sleeping a little past noon.<br />
<br />
Then I quit EQ.<br />
<br />
Now I get to bed around 4am, sleep till noon and wake up rested after my 8 hours of sleep... and once I'm up, I plug the phone back in. It's amazing how many people interpret &quot;don't call me before noon, I work late&quot; as &quot;call me, a lot, and preferably around 9am&quot;<br />
<br />
I still get 2-3 hours of EQ on the weekends and my days off... though if I try to stay on more than that, I get withdrawals and have to log. I suppose once you've broken the addiction, it's hard to go back.</div></div><hr />
