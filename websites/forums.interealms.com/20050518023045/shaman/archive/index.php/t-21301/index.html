<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm feedbacking this every day until OoW goes live.<br />
<br />
If they do not inrease Focus4 effects up to level 70 many many zones will no longer be raided.<br />
<br />
No guild in their right mind would start keying up for VT from scratch if none of the focus effects worked anymore.  The gear is really nice but the focus effects are what make the items extra tasty.<br />
<br />
Time would be similiar.  Yes, the raw HP on most time items will still make it worthwhile but if none of the focus effects work up to 70, again, after farming it two or three times for weapons, guilds won't return.<br />
<br />
I urge all of you to /feedback this everyday.  I'm hoping Sony will see this and update all the focus effects from 65 - 70.<br />
<br />
Thank You.</div></div><hr />

Chill out for heavens sake. I can't believe all the chicken littles have come out to play again. Why not wait and see, before petitioning? If I saw that petition I would laugh.<br />

Who said anything about petitioning?  I said /feedback.  You know, the ability that lets us talk to the Devs to help them improve their game?  I write around a dozen feedbacks a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Feedback, petition, whatever..... you are using a channel in game to provide feedback on content.......<br />
<br />
You are using it to feedback on content that hasn't even been developed yet.<br />
<br />
Either way, it's idiotic. Yes, idiotic. People will go to the zones you say they won't because not everyone will suddenly be 70 with all the spells and effects. And if they do, who cares. The content will still be there and perfectly doable with the current focii and spells. <br />
<br />
Basically you are frothing at the mouth in a spectacular fashion over what, 8-10 lines of release notes on an expansion for the future.<br />

I am going to start sending in feedback that the new spells they will be releasing at level 70 need to have the agro reduced. I mean, ***, we know as much about them as the focii changes they have planned so I better make sure the developers start thinking about it.</div></div><hr />

I am not hostile. I am irritated, but not hostile. You are urging people here to /feedback EVERY DAY. You are doing this without giving any thought to the fact that SoE might well have already considered this. You are doing this without asking any questions. You are urging everyone else to leap onto your bandwagon.<br />
<br />
If you want to be proactive about it why not swing by the SoE official boards and post the question there in a polite fashion? Or, email them directly and bring the response back.<br />
<br />
/feedback every day on a thought you have that may or may not come to fruition is bizarre, and chicken little'ish.<br />
<br />
They run beta before any release. Things get changed there. Stop panicking right now, and see what happens. That is what I am saying. I am sorry that you don't like to have the obvious pointed out to you. <br />

Everytime someone says stop panicking right now and wait to see what happens we get screwed. Why wait to /feedback till we are bent over when we can possibly get it taken care of now. <br />

Going to feedback as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My point Asthore, is that there is an official messageboard run by SoE that has several developers and SoE staff members posting on it. Posting a polite question there (note I used the word polite which unfortunately precludes many crucible members from posting) might just get a response. /feedback will of course flood the feedback box and most likely get nothing achieved..... or it might... good luck to you either way.... <br />

/shrug. whatever floats your boat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i share the same concern.  if all my focus IV stuff becomes useless because of this, i would be VERY angry.  <br />
<br />
I dont however agree with the /feedback everyday.  I do belive that this is in issuse that needs to addressed by the Devs.  If it has then we need to be told whats goin to happen (i.e. focii V or higher, or is IV goin to go to lvl 70).  I think that the problem at this moment is the lack of information given to the players about what to expect.  we cant complain about something that we dont know is goin to happen yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">deleted. I just got two great anonymous negative rep bumps. lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Negative Bump 1 (lowering rep about 20 points) - he doesnt seem that excited, i think he has a legitimate point and you dismissed him quite rudely. <br />
<br />
/feedbacking every day? Not overly excited? I think you are wrong, but thanks for the anonymous bump.<br />
<br />
Negative Bump 2 - Just because you don't care about the future of EQ doesn't mean the rest of us have to give up too. <br />
<br />
Just because I don't agree with spamming the developer box in game doesn't mean I am apathetic to the future of EQ. I really don't see any value in the actions offered in the original post. I gave what I believed is the correct method. No one wants to do the rational thing. <br />
<br />
Everyone bump me down, eventually you will weed out those who disagree with you. Does that mean you are right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm glad you posted this, because focus effects are a big deal - for me especially because I love my VT stuff.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, they almost have to limit the focus effects, because otherwise they just recycle the same focus effects on new items.... which actually doesn't sound like a bad idea at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Karshak, I don't think anyone posting in agreement here really intends to /feedback every day.  I know I don't, anyway.  That's kind of a minor point in my eyes, but it's what you seem focused on.  You may not agree that extending focus4 items up to level 70 is necessary or even right, but that doesn't mean that those of us who would like to see that should not make our views known.  Brenlo has seen this now, so mission accomplished, imho.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I wouldn't worry too much about the rep bumps...  It's not like you can be voted off the island or anything. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Kamidari,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your post. I didn't realize I was coming across as not agreeing with the topic. I thought I was showing my disagreement for the fervor in which it was being posted.<br />
<br />
I have VT focus items, and I am thrilled with them. I would hate to see them become obselete. The same goes for my elemental pieces. Who wants to see elemental chain become useless for example?<br />
<br />
I don't.<br />
<br />
What I was trying to get across as my point was that this is such a fundamental aspect to all casting classes that I cannot believe it won't be throught through. I just can't accept that.<br />
<br />
If they choose to give Focus V effects then we will have to go through the pain barrier of getting them. At the same time we get them we will no doubt be using our Focus IV effects and spells. If for example everything was just upgraded to be Focus V that we already have it removes the opportunity to earn new items. Half the fun is getting a great piece of equipment with a much needed focus effect. Don't forget that the spells we already have are focussed, it's the new one's we don't know about that might not be. If the spells are more powerful than we already have, what do we lose by losing the focus effect? Did we lose much when we were on focus III items but higher in level with our spells? I don't think so, we just battled on until we got a focus IV. <br />
<br />
I am not disagreeing that it is an important point. My irritation was in the method being touted as the way to be heard.<br />
<br />
It's great that Brenlo swung by and got the message. It would have been just as good to have posted it calmly on his own boards. In my opinion.<br />
<br />
As far as being voted off the island. That did make me laugh. It's funny how people would rather support the SoE haters, than the critics of the haters.<br />
<br />
I guess  I am in the wrong club, it doesn't mean I play my shaman any differently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Thinking more about it why do our existing items have to be made focus V items on release?<br />
<br />
SoE has already introduced the concept of slots, and have retroactively added slots to all items. Add a new slot before release. Add an augment for Focus effect + I or something. Have it be purchasable, or questable, or droppable. Then everyone could upgrade their equipment as they go along, without losing anything.<br />
<br />
Just a thought. I am not sure I want to be given everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wow...the tension is thick these days.  I would imagine that the focus IV items will be extended to level 70 spells.  I don't see a reason to have IV for 5 levels that people fly thru in PoP zones, but logic isn't always a priority for SOE from past experience either.  Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if SOE has even taken it into consideration yet :/<br />
<br />
Spraggon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I guess my thinking on the focus effects is that lvl1 is good for 20 levels, lvl2 for 24 levels, lvl3 for 16 levels, so having lvl4 being only good for 5 levels would be... annoying.  The focus effect items tend to be fairly hard to obtain or fairly expensive, so I'd like more than 5 levels out of them.<br />
<br />
The +1 focus effect aug is kind of a neat idea though, as long as it was a new slot on all items, and dropped more than, say, GoD spells. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Actually this is one of the first things I thought of as well upon hearing of the expansion. I have just hit 65 and have watched all my III items become useless. I have started to save LDON points to get some IV focus items but I would really like to know before I get them if they will be useless. I think we are intitled that much at least, Let us know.<br />
      <br />
      I would be very bugged by new items btw. I think it would come off as to much of just giveing us something new to grind on. I have only played 1 year and I can tell you this, it is a big freakin grind startin this game at this point as it is. All the old timers might be lookin for more of a challenge to keep em busy but, there is almost to much for me to do as it is. I know everyone keeps sayin take it slow, enjoy the old stuff dont rush things. Get real, I dont want to take 5 years to get to where the game is now only to still be 5 years behind. few would do that its not human nature.<br />
<br />
      In addition to no new focus effects I would also like to request that the new spells be attainable. I wouldnt mind If the very best of the new spells were hard to get, but I would like to see some of the others fdairly easily.<br />
      Just my thoughts<br />
      Oh yea and I guess sence I might start postin a little I might as well saw thanks to all you guys you have all been an immence help to me over the last year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Lethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The entire implementation of Focus Effects is bizarre. Nothing else equipment wise becomes so abruptly useless.<br />
<br />
A (perhaps) better idea is to revamp the current ones so that I is +5%, II is +10% and so on. That way you don't hit these roadblocks where you have to upgrade 4-5 slots all at once to be competitive. (Losing any of my foci would hurt, losing em all would be beyond gimp!)<br />
<br />
Then V wouldn't be so bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Attention devs: Add all/all MP4/IH4/ID4 purchasable augs to LDoN already and make sure they're both type 3 AND type 7.<br />

Why this is such a big deal I have no idea- apparently bazaar players do not deserve general foci unless it's on garbage gear w/ poor stats a la Gleamscale cape, ornate or Dusty Girdle of Reformed Sand?

<br />
I will say, that's actually a pretty good idea too. Expanding the LDoN merchant offerings, for those that truly can't raid, but would like some useful focus effects that aren't on anything that doesn't require a raid to get a remote shot of obtaining. Even if the &quot;focus augments&quot; were only type 3 (because if you aren't raiding, chances are something in the LDoN armor list, will be an upgrade, at some point, and most of the higher stuff has at least a type 3 on it), I think it'd be good to see.<br />
<br />
Now, I'd also like to see some augment, that isn't a rare drop, that will actually fit in a type 1 slot... they gave a bunch of LDoN items a type 1 slot, but only the dropped stat/HP/mana augments will go in them, and are rare enough as-is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Well what's annoying is that some of the higher end augments (GoD stuff not Ldon) are type 3, and by the time your doing that you don't have anything with a type 3 slot.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Honestly, I think that they will expand all Foci-4 items to the new level cap. If you look at the focus levels, 4 is the smallest, applying only to 5 levels. I am sure Foci-4 will be good up to Level 75, at which time the expansion following that will have Foci-5 :)</div></div><hr />

If you don't like open discussions, I can't imagine the point of coming to a community forum.<br />

Maybe we should just have a &quot;shut up&quot; forum, where all the people who want to tell other posters to shut up can just go and tell each other to shut up over and over and over again.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">SOE has obviously NOT learned that upping levels breaks the game.<br />
<br />
When Kunark came out, it added ten new levels! Great powerful spells! And completely threw all classes out of balance by gearing the whole thing for melee classes and giving casters &quot;compensation&quot; spells - Such as Turgur's, and a 96% rez. By the time Luclin rolled around, they'd more or less gotten things smoothed out a bit. All classes were good... the introduction of AA helped a lot<br />
<br />
And then they released PoP, added five levels, and again, class balance was shot as each dev tried to out-do the others on &quot;their&quot; class or whatever. In addition to this, those five little levels managed to turn the three expansions prior into duoing sessions at best.<br />
<br />
And now they want to add MORE? When several classes are still reeling from being hosed in GoD? Are we going to see Lord Inquisitor Seru zone-banish people who aggro him over level 65, like Vox does?</div></div><hr />

Ah, forgot about all the Velious stuff. My bad.<br />
<br />
Still, though, some stuff is only Focus-3 by design, and others are not. For example, the 8th Shawl isnt, and will work right up through any level, but the Coldain Wrist is BA3 by design.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I think the raised level limit is what is going to balance Gates, and its not a mistake that Gates is so hard. Its obviously TUNED to level 70. It is PART of this expansion, there is very very little doubt of that. They just got a 2fer1 on us, /shurg.<br />

As for the second part, I would honestly like to see some more mobs do this, especially Kunark dragons now. Make them 64 limit. Other possible examples are Lodi, Dain, Vindi, AoW, etc. Its gonna suck to see AoW get 1-grouped, but you KNOW its gonna happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">why dont they make foci 3 up to 70 then?<br />
<br />
honestly, the only reason you want F4 to go to 70 is because YOU have those items... now the encounters where foci items 1,2,3 whatever... drop have in theory been tuned for those levels and so work for those levels.<br />
<br />
why should some ornate that drops in bot or tactics... easy as **** to do right now or from VT (5 expansions ago from 2001... much of which can be 2 grouped) still be of benefit up to lvl 70 and beyond<br />
<br />
if it's come to a point where EQ has to be dumbed down that much, why not remove all levels from all foci items so that your velious tracking collar can be used for improved damage all the way up to lvl 70 then 75 then 80 etc until 2010</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, I dont have any items with numbers in the Focus, my focus effects are all VT or EP, with names like Marrs Gift and Focus of Mediocrity. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think you have a valid point, but not ALL items. However, the ones that were the &quot;top&quot; of its expansion like the Coldain Wrist SHOULD be usable to the top of the level limit no matter how high it goes. But most Foci 1 and 2 items should be left there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">It's a serious issue worth wondering about.  PLEASE let's cut back a bit on the noble martyr posts heroically telling people to shut up.  Almost every thread someone pops in telling people to shut up, usually all hyped-up and wild-eyed, and then gets on a martyr kick for not getting a huge instant wave of approval for it.<br />
<br />
If you don't like open discussions, I can't imagine the point of coming to a community forum.<br />
<br />
Maybe we should just have a &quot;shut up&quot; forum, where all the people who want to tell other posters to shut up can just go and tell each other to shut up over and over and over again.  Then they can all shut up,  catch a few breaths, and start a barrage of telling each other to shut up again.<br />
<br />
They can all hate each other and be each other's heroes at the very same time!<br />
<br />
lol, I assume you mean me here, and you are completely wrong about why I posted in the first place. But, if it makes you feel happier to gloss over the bull**** and attempt to put folks down then more power to you.<br />
<br />
I thought responding to a viewpoint with the total and opposite viewpoint was what an open discussion was all about? Now we can't do that unless you say it's ok? Or is it that if it isn't a &quot;**** SOE&quot; post it isn't ok? <br />
<br />
What is it?<br />
<br />
By the way, &quot;all hyped-up and wild-eyed&quot; is hysterical. You seem to be insinuating that the posts going against the serious issue everyone is wondering about are written in this fashion. Well, the amusing thing is that the reason I posted in the first place was because the original poster was trying to start a riot of in game /feedbacks, it had nothing to do with the fact he was wondering about the future. It was because he was assuming the future sucked, and complaining about it. haha.<br />
<br />
Maybe instead of having a shut up forum you guys who have been through time both ways with no gear on in the snow and rain should stop thinking you own this forum, and stop believing your own hype for long enough to read what's written.<br />
<br />
The point I was making is valid. Why on earth does this forum need a slew of &quot;I can't believe they are going to do this to us posts&quot; about an expansion that was publicized less than a week ago?<br />

I'm happy the post was made. Raising the level limit to 65 and losing my level 3 focus items (I had spell haste III, the affliction trifecta, MP 3 and enhancement haste 3) hurt me a LOT. I would prefer not to have to go through that again.<br />
<br />
Even though it was a pretty painful to replace all those focus items, I didn't immediately think about it when I heard the level limit was moving to 70. Kudos to Floppydisks for bringing it to the attention of the Crucible and Brenlo.<br />

Actually, the board is for shaman to come together and discuss anything they like isn't it? So, how is my disagreement with Floppydisks methods wrong?<br />
<br />
It must be wrong, or I wouldn't be getting hammered in the little dots, 3 more and I'll have a full deck... :P<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that you can Kudos him all you want, but he's still over reacting and his original post asked for everyone to /feedback every single day until release.<br />
<br />
I wonder what you would have done if it had not been about an issue you agreed with Gloriana. <br />
<br />
/shrug.<br />
<br />
And by the way, how did it hurt you a lot? The spells you gained that didn't use the effects were more powerful I am sure, and you didn't wake up on release day with them in your book. The Focus III items became defunct as you stopped using lower level spells, but you still used those spells until you got your higher ones.<br />
<br />
I don't disagree it would be painful, or MIGHT be painful to have to upgrade, I just haven't seen anything other than a splash page of 30,000 feet release notes to go on. I see that as maybe worthy of a query, but not worthy of an uprising.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My theme is not that people should shut up. Can you read? My theme is that there is NOTHING in the release notes for the new expansion to get all hot and bothered about. My theme is stop being Chicken Little every time you read something (you, collective you).<br />

I am not oblivious, I am not using knee-jerk self justification. Stop talking **** a minute lad.<br />
<br />
What I am saying is:<br />
<br />
The new expansion has been announced with VERY LITTLE information. It's basically a freaking press release. From that we get minor information. We do not know that things will be broken, and we do not know that things will be correct. What we do know is that there will be new levels that may or may not impact current focii. Wooooooooooh.<br />
<br />
SoE opened a message board up. If the idea is to mention that this might be an issue then go there and post a message. If the idea is to come here and whip the already pissed off uber crowd into more of a fervor then come here and post as the original poster did.<br />

I don't have a wait and see attitude. I have an attitude that coming here and getting people to follow a retarded course of action is much less of a good idea than going to SoE's own web page and asking a calm question.<br />
<br />
Yes, yes, yes, I said calm question when I am obviously not calm.... but.... I am not trying to talk to SoE so who cares if I am calm.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">One point to note about all of this is that in last expansion (GoD), most spells started out as 10% upgrades on previous versions, with some being increased to 20% afterwards. If the next expansion does the same (assuming they show the same lack of originality) it would mean that, barring some other useful attribute, it would be more efficient to use your older spells until you aquired a focus 5 item. Presumably focus 5 items would be common on high end gear, and no doubt everyone would go through a retooling effort as they have done with most previous expansions.<br />
<br />
Of course its quite possible that the new spells will be very different from what is currently available, in which case you wouldnt be losing anything if the current focus items are limited to 65 (can't lose what you didnt have).<br />
<br />
The desire to upgrade plays a large part in the game for most people. If Sony are smart they would limit the current focus effects to 65 and lower spells, creating the incentive for people to replace their armor and consequently to be willing to spend more time in the game.<br />
<br />
Increasing caster spell casting power can come in two ways: (a) getting the spell in the first place; and (b) augmenting the power of that spell through focus effects. In GoD there was no (b), so to regulate the influx of that power they made (a) very difficult to do. We all know how popular that was, basically it hurt the little people more but everyone to some degree. Even now I am yet to get any GoD spells and I only know of 2 other GoD shaman spells in the guild.<br />
<br />
At this point we dont know how these things would be implemented. I think it would largely depend on how much the upgrades that come from being 70 or whatever affects older parts of the game. If it makes content that drops most of these focus effects trivial then I would be very surprised if they didnt cap current effects at 65. If that content is still just/allmost as chalenging as it was at 65, then they might elect to upgrade the limit to 70 (or whatever).<br />
<br />
I do find this idea of GoD and the next expansion originally being one kind of interesting though. Its curious, but what could they be thinking? GoD content is nowhere near being completed, so its not as though the content has been exhausted. I'm assuming that the expansion will have a lot of xp zones to level up to 70 (can't do that in older zones, everything will turn light blue or green  :D ), with the objective of giving people the tools to complete GoD.<br />

Right, so basically every non-raid priest in the game must wear those exact same 2 pieces of gear in those exact 2 slots if they want those foci.  And for knights it's beyond brutal- the itemization is even worse if that's possible.  IMO there should be some variety in your gear choices, but for too many classes there's not.  I liked that in LDoN you could mix and match what augs you want in which slots, which pieces to go slot 3, which to keep what you have and go slot 7, etc...  Ideally not every character is a carbon copy of each other.<br />

<br />
Honestly Iz, this is a pretty universal problem for a lot of classes, even including EP gear. I got my arms well after I had the cloak, same focus effect, I screwed myself getting the cloak, because my choices of arms in the EPs are severly limited. While there is MP like focuses in a number of slots, I am pretty sure boots still get the nod, since again, why double up focus in another slot. <br />

Those named with a number I mean (Spell Haste IV, Burning Affliction IV, Improved Damage IV, etc, etc, etc...).<br />
<br />
When PoP came out, only the uncommon focii were upgraded to 65 (mostly those from VT) and I'm ready to bet that only the same kind of focii from PoP, LDoN and GoD will be upgraded to 70.<br />

I could understand if the IV foci lost their viability above 65 because they can be tradeskilled, but knocking out &quot;named&quot; foci as well would pretty much toss PoP into the obsolete bin for casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">A very interesting topic indeed, and while the original poster's initial wording did come off a bit panicky, it by no mean dilutes the importance of the issue at hand.<br />
<br />
First of all, none of us knows how hard 65 to 70 will be.  Heck, they could make it require flags for all we know.  Each time Sony raised the level cap on EQ, they were surprised at how fast certain players reached the new levels.  They might try and overcompensate here, which would have both positive and negative effects... though the first that come to my mind are a further separation of uber and casual, as well as another huge grind.<br />
<br />
The fact is very few people are interested in the &quot;journey,&quot; because they completed it back in Kunark.  They have reached the end of the game, and are comfortable with the game mechanics up there (which as you all know is vastly different from 50 and below gameplay).  But I'm getting a little off topic here...<br />
<br />
The way focus effects are handled does bother me a bit.  Focus 1 and 2 are not as big a deal, as they are easily attainable, and very fun, and, in the case of focus 1, relatively easily replaced.  Also, they work for a rather large time span.  I enjoyed my focus 2's for a very long time as I casually leveled up my new character.<br />
<br />
I actually was in Beta 4, but quit the game around 2000, rejoined early last year, and since then, a lot has changed, but a few things haven't, and the first thing that comes to mind is the expression that the squeaky wheel gets the grease.<br />
<br />
Karsh, I appreciate your stance in your first reply.  However, the reason you are probably getting a lot of negative feedback is because you come off as focusing on one aspect of the poster's post (I.E., the unrealistic feedback'ing every day, as well as the worry you feel is unnecessary).  Also, the majority of your replies are simply quotes of previously posted replies and counters to all of them.  Personally, I believe it induces more respect to at least point out where those who are replying to you had good points, and then explaining about where your opinion differs, rather than putting up a stone wall for several replies.<br />
<br />
The MAIN problem, in my opinion, at least, is not that everybody will have to replace their focus items, but the fact that many zones might become trivial.<br />
<br />
In Kunark, there were some harsh zones, yes, but PoP really raised the bar, and called for larger and oftentimes more difficult raids (harder to manage that large amount of people) to attain the new items, therefore putting them on another level of play.<br />
<br />
The problem is that, with the implementation of some wicked hard zones in the last few expansions, people have worked hard to get what they revere as their endgame equipment.  I can see no way for Sony to induce the type of game stakes raise as they did back in Kunark, as they've already pushed the game too far too fast (/cough GoD trials /cough) as it is.  This expansion also claims to be for all levels, indicating that it is not the same high level challenge increasing fiasco that GoD is.<br />
<br />
What I don't understand is why Sony would potentially trivialize a lot of fantastic zones, for example, those in PoP, all for five more spell ranks and a new title or two.  It's way too fast and too soon.  When the cap was raised to 60, it was TIME.  65 was different, as those levels were required for new content.<br />
<br />
So basically to sum up my ramblings, unless they intend on releasing a new area of &quot;triviality&quot; that people post 65 will be forced into unless they feel like soloing or duoing some planar mobs, focus effects should probably be increased, or at least, a good deal of items from current zones that are IV being given Zephyr of Brell (shawl 8) type effects which apply to all levels.  Who knows, perhaps they'll cap focus IV at 69? It would be a heck of a lot better than 65, because the day after the expansion goes live there's gonna be dings to 66 all across Norrath.<br />
<br />
P.S. Too bad the focus effects don't work at all levels, just with differences in effectiveness.  Would be nice if they could put a percent benefit that goes down as people go over the level cap for the focus, just to prevent your full, decked out suit of Focus IV equipment from becoming as valuable as a full suit of NON focus equipment which you could have attained a LOT easier early on.<br />

I am getting a lot of negative feedback because I am not on the bandwagon, no other reason. They might not like the way I delivered my message, but there is nothing wrong about the message itself. If I end up with a red dot below my name I won't die in real life. And fortunately the number of green dots under a name has absolutely no reflection on how useful a poster you are. Just look up a few posts on this thread to see that.<br />
<br />
However, I see your point regarding pointing out the good points and explaining where my opinion differs. The issue is that I don't really see any good points on this thread, and I don't mean that offensively.<br />
<br />
I have VT focus gear, I have elemental focus gear. I would and will have the same problems as the shaman complaining about it on this thread. I agree that it MIGHT suck to have to upgrade equipment.<br />
<br />
That's as far as I can agree with anything. I don't want to be given things. I want to have the best equipment I can because I earned it. I am not end game equipped but hope to be someday. If the new expansion goes in with all focus effects lifted to the cap I will be happy..... I guess. The problem I see is that with new zones, levels, aa, etc. coming out what else is there for people to look forward to? If you already have the core focus effects and they already work to the top level spells that you won't have yet I can't see the excitement.<br />
<br />
Will all the new boss mobs drop +300hp gear? Is that  exciting to people over new focus effects? I imagine that the new spells will be more powerful than the current ones, it makes no sense otherwise. Imagine if the current focus effects don't have an impact on them..... what happens?<br />
<br />
So buffs will not be extended, fine. We don't know what buff spells we will be getting, if any. Even so, we will just have to cast more often.<br />
<br />
Mana Preservation, well this is the great unknown but I can't imagine mana is much of a problem for folks here. I am middle of the road and I pretty much cast/canni non stop and do ok. Some of the magelo's here can't probably remember the last time they were out of mana.<br />
<br />
Haste, detrimental, etc, etc - Does it matter if these need upgrading?<br />
<br />
The main point of this is to show that on day 1 of the new release we would lose absolutely nothing. Perhaps as we level up and new spells become available we will have focus effects not kicking off. If that happens, it happens. If my spell book is 99 percent 65 and below I won't worry. When I get more spells from the new expansion and they replace current spells I will deal with the lack of focus effects and get excited about drops with newer ones.<br />
<br />
I understand that some people don't want to have to upgrade effects. The flip side is that if you aren't upgrading effects what are you doing apart from adding more stats? I'd rather have the fun of really upgrading. It's my personal opinion.<br />
<br />
I can understand people being interested in this topic, I can't understand people getting up in arms about losing focus effects. The game isn't that difficult as it is, why trivialise every aspect of it? That's my point.</div></div><hr />

Something else for everyone that is complaining/feedbacking to consider is, at some point SoE may just consider your comments as whining to whine and stop listening at all.  <br />
<br />
SoE has made an effort recently to get feedback on the current game content.  I suggest constructively commenting on that topic on the SoE boards for now.  By already complaining about an unreleased expansion all you are doing is devaluing valid statements about existing issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">The new expansion has been announced with VERY LITTLE information. It's basically a freaking press release. From that we get minor information. We do not know that things will be broken, and we do not know that things will be correct. <br />
<br />
This is true, but most humans naturally try to detect patterns from past experiences when lack of future data is available.  I'm willing to bet that the reason the majority of posters that are complaining, about both this issue and the OoW spells in Lucy, is simply because they are looking back at past shaman &quot;upgrades&quot; to be given with each new expansion and inferring that OoW will be similarly either bad or good, depending on each person's opinion of Luclin, PoP, etc.  No one is claiming to be able to see into the future, but when looking back at things such as slow mitigation with PoP, plus the less-than-desirable role of shaman in GoD, can you really blame them for wanting to get their voice heard before the expansion goes live?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">However, the ones that were the &quot;top&quot; of its expansion like the Coldain Wrist SHOULD be usable to the top of the level limit no matter how high it goes. But most Foci 1 and 2 items should be left there.<br />

hehehehe.. i used to sell 3-4 coldain wrist MQs a day.. good times, good times</div></div><hr />

Either way, it's idiotic. Yes, idiotic. <br />
<br />
Funny stuff here. Support for a feedback on an expansion that hasn't even been released in test. I love it. <br />
<br />
I am sorry that you don't like to have the obvious pointed out to you. <br />
<br />
note I used the word polite which unfortunately precludes many crucible members from posting <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You started out being pretty harsh to the original poster, and then proceeded to sarcasm and mocking, and then finally adopted a martyr personna.  That's more likely to get you negative rep that people disagreeing with you.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">there is precedent for this, focus 1 items work over a span of 20 levels, focus 2 work for 24 levels, focus three spans 16 levels,  so is it too much to ask that focus 4 work for 10?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Hi all.  This is going to be a huge issue with the upcoming expansion.<br />
<br />
My 2c for what it's worth is if the spells are difficult to get and all new focus items are as well then it is just too big of a nerf to all priest and casting classes.  So, I'm hoping Sony has more sense than that.<br />
<br />
If for some reason the 65-70 spells will not work with existing focus items then the GOD spells will become even more valuable and I know that I will be farming the heck out of them.<br />
<br />
Also, if 65-70 spells will not work with existing focus items there should be some way to upgrade the LDON augments you have already purchased.  That way at least you could get some spell haste on the new spells if nothing else while you are waiting for new armour.<br />
<br />
But anyway, at the end of the day I believe that Sony will be forced to up the IV items to satisfy the casual gamers.  At least I hope so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Bah!<br />
<br />
I say leave it at 65, and only give Shaman the entire range of Focus Effect V as spells :P<br />
<br />
Of course, we will need a Shaman buff box similar to the short duration buff box, and maybe cap it at 5-8 effects :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">To put this thread back on topic . . . the following is some information from a discussion among the Class Correspondents with regards to OoW and Focus effects.  It was one of the first topics brought up.<br />
<br />
While there has been no final decision made, the Dev team would prefer that Focus IV effects continue to work in some manner past level 65.  Code is being developed and tested with regards to this, but at present there is simply not enough relevant data to give a firm answer as to the exact disposition of Focus IV effects.<br />
 <br />
Since the code for a hard cutoff at level 65 is already in place, the fact that code work continues on the disposition of Focus IV items should tell you something - if you are crafty enough to draw the conclusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is ALL I can say at this point, but perhaps it may help some of you who are trying to make decisions.  Please don't ask me to make it any clearer than that, because I've already told you all I am able, and really, all I know for that matter.  Anything beyond that above is mere speculation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Serbitar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">So when they say Focus IV, are they talking about just things like IH4 and ID4 or do they include effects like Marr's Blessing, Discordant effects etc. in that category?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>TeodorL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">The entire implementation of Focus Effects is bizarre. Nothing else equipment wise becomes so abruptly useless.<br />
<br />
A (perhaps) better idea is to revamp the current ones so that I is +5%, II is +10% and so on. That way you don't hit these roadblocks where you have to upgrade 4-5 slots all at once to be competitive. (Losing any of my foci would hurt, losing em all would be beyond gimp!)<br />
<br />
Then V wouldn't be so bad.<br />
<br />
Great idea Lethe.  A tweak to it would be to allow IV focus effects to extend to level 70 and just have better focus effects drop in the new zones.  Avoid the whole issue with the level I - II focus effects.</div></div><hr />

I will try to get you an answer on that.</div></div><hr />
