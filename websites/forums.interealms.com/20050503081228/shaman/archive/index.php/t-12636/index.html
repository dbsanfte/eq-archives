<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">just a simple question... is the horse worth it..    i've had 2 in the past and sold both of them for diffrent reasons.  but are they truely worth habveing?    i am debateign weather i should buy another or not.<br />
<br />
the major reason i disliked the horse was that i could not interupt the spells.. wanst that big deal since i could click off the icon but was more the poitn of the thing..<br />
<br />
on the otherhand i really liked the extra mana regen i had from it..<br />
<br />
so my question is simple is the pro's to a horse enough to make it worth it over the con's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes..worth it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a drogmor, but yes, worth it to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definilty worth it. For the simple fact of no sit aggro.<br />
<br />
As a shaman however they arne't as necessary sine we already have good mana regen. But the simple fact is more mana is always good besides the only downside is the lack of duck which really isn't all that big of a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have yet to need one.  And since you can't use them in Vex Thal where my guild is raiding alot, I see no point in them.  If you have the pp to blow on them, go ahead but I know I won't ever buy one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Before I got Cana 5 I always thought of a horse as being = Free KEI/C3. Except that it stacks with KEI/C3 $$$<br />
<br />
Nowdays I don't often go OOM unless I get REAL lazy and stop using Cana 4 completely!<br />
<br />
If you solo a lot and/or don't have easy access to cheap KEI I would probably say get one.<br />
<br />
I have been contemplating getting a horse again as I would probably actually notice the extra mana regen combined with my effective FT 14 (inc mc3 and lunar whispers) now. $$$</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had to sell mine.  I couldn't stand all the drawbacks:<br />
<br />
1. Can't interrupt spells easily.<br />
<br />
2. Horsehead in face requires a shrink all the time.<br />
<br />
3. Slow start!  I HATE THAT!  And the alternative is to click off the buff, run, click on the buff every time you want to move slightly.  BAH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Its worth it.<br />
<br />
In a group, biggest problem I have is that horse's head gets in the way, so if I can't use /assist targeting can be a pain.  Moving slightly will interrupt spells, just not a speedily as by ducking.<br />
<br />
Soloing I click it off/on so running speed isnt a problem.<br />
<br />
There are three things Sony ought to have done before they 'fixed' horses:<br />
<br />
1.  Program it so that ducking interrupted spell casting when sat on a horse.  This OUGHT to be trivial to do.<br />
<br />
2.  Sit an artist on a horse and note that being on a horse generally improves the rider's ability to view things.  Make it so.<br />
<br />
3.  Improve the level of detail on the neck and top of horse's head so it looks like we are sat on a horse not just a collection of polygons.  Change its posture so its head is lower down and further forward so that rider's head doesnt get stuck through the horses neck so often (NB: this would help with (2))<br />
<br />
Personally I don't think any truly professional games company would have forced us to use horse models until 1-3 were ALL implemented.  But then what would I know, I'm only a programmer working in the ...er computer games industry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yup definately worth it for the lessened sitting agro =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">how do the drogmors compare to horses as far as visibility when it's on ? .. <br />
<br />
does a big lizard head stick right in the middle of your screen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As stated at the Fan Faire, not being able to interrupt is *intentional*, and they have no plans to change it.  The price you pay for sitting med regen while standing and no sit aggro.  <br />
<br />
I played with the old models invis horse for a long time and thought I'd never get used to the regular horse.  The head thing really drove me nuts so I sold the horse and bought a lizard.  No head in my way now.  The few times I REALLY need to interrupt my spell I just click the lizard off.  The other times (say when I'm nuking and the mob dies before the nuke will land) I just move forward a step.<br />
<br />
I hate to say it, but I've adapted to the regular horse penalties, and they are worth the pain for the mana gain in most situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">With a drogmor the only time you see a head is if you are looking down (and I mean WAAAY down).  In that aspect they are much better than horses....and they just look cooler too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I had a horse.  I loved the old glue pot but I sold her to close the deal on a 12kpp JBB.  I missed her terribly right away. :(   Even the JBB could not make up for the lost mana efficiency a horse brings. :eek: <br />
<br />
I spent the next week cash farming my backside off and bought a lizard.  I am happy again. :D <br />
<br />
The lizard is a huge improvement over the horse just by getting the head out of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Totaly worth it =) I have a lizard though. A friend let me test out his horse once before I decided to get one. all I have to say is I dont see how the hell you people can stand the glue mobile! that head is SO annoying ( I couldnt shrink because my friend is a druid  :rolleyes: ) only draw back I see with a lizard is the fact that its a VERY bumpy ride =D. but hey, who actually would want to move on a 9K mount hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I find mine very useful, shrinking isn't that bad, you can strafe to move short distances quickly.  Anything to keep me from having to cast canni4 all the time is worth it to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Graphically, drogmor's heads are very much &quot;out of the way&quot;, but as far as targeting with the mouse, it's exactly as bad as with a normal horse.  <br />
<br />
Everyone needs to /bug or /feedback this (both the horse and drogmor mouse targeting and spell interrupt UI clunkiness)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tehh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I finally got around to buying one the other day (lizard) and while it is the slowest one money can buy, I would'nt trade it for anything.  As mentioned above the extra mana regen and lack of sit-aggro is more than enough to justify having to click off the buff, type /dismount or take a few steps each time I want to cancel a spell.</div></div><hr />
