<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally, Sony has recognized that EQ has roleplaying aspects tied into it.  At level 65, once you receive access to each elemental plane, shamans receive a unique AA that is based upon the character's religion.  Each AA costs 35 points, but depending on your religion, you receive an innate skill that will affect your entire group!<br />
<br />
Rallos Zek followers, being war mongers, can expect to see their melee friends' minimum damage raised by a small percentage, causing more damage than ever before.<br />
<br />
Innorruk followers, which feed on fear, scare the bejezzees out of their enemies, allowing their group's melee to more easily strike through the mob's defenses.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule followers inspire their group's melee to hatred, making them swing faster, if endowed with powerful haste to begin with.<br />
<br />
Followers of Mithaniel Marr boost their group's moral, increasing their ability to resist harmful spells and melee damage.<br />
<br />
Sony has seemed to focus on the Shaman's power over melee based characters, which is good, because this seems to fit in with many roleplaying themes in addition to the historical background of the class itself when it was first implemented.  All in all, it is an interesting set of AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cute.  Got any screenshots/links to lucy to support this?  Also you can only save 30aa, so a 35pt cost is gonna be pretty tough to manage.  Also this would be the first AA that depends on your POP flags.  Which sounds lame to me, zzz.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Obviously a joke, but a pretty cool idea that has been suggested before.<br />
<br />
btw, shamans don't worship Mith Marr ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Agree with Henora.  Sounds pretty bogus not to mention nothing about The Tribunal.  It is kind of a neat idea minus the whole EP flagged thing and that's coming from someone who is flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hordza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">frogloks do dont they?<br />
<br />
i wish sony was bright enuff to think of something like that ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You're a day early :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">btw, shamans don't worship Mith Marr ;)<br />
<br />
btw, they do.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BTW Cazic Thule and Inny are backwards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What about the kitties?<br />
<br />
Left out in the cold again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Kitties are always getting left in the cold. I guess they figure with all that fur we will survive</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kitty Shaman get &quot;Proc of Hairball&quot; where the melee characters weapons give off this wet, gooey hairlike substance that makes mobs go &quot;ewww&quot; and they lose 1 round of combat while they get a paper towel!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh, forgot all about the frogloks, that was a happy few moments, hehe :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zacknaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Didn't see anything about Tribunal either...at least if you're going to come up with something bogus, do it completely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ya pretty lame joke what  with the getting CT and Inny parts backwards, forgetting Tribunal, Agnostic kitties, and Mith Marr froggies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One day early on the April Fools... fool.<br />
<br />
Each AA costs 35 points<br />
<br />
Impossible. Can only have 30 saved. Nice try though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah, it was bogus.  Clock on my computer was all messed up, I thought I was on time...just noticed it was all screwy ;)  And for a post at 3 or 4 am last night, the fact that I didn't mess more up amazes me.  I thought it was a neat idea though.  I mean, come on.  How hard would it really be to implement a system of alternate advancement based around roleplaying ideas?<br />
<br />
edit: I like how I am receiving negative rep points for this post...amazing, simply amazing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Its still a neat idea, should suggest it for FF :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shoot, it was Because of those trademark SoE mistakes, that I almost believed it.<br />

Almost :)<br />
