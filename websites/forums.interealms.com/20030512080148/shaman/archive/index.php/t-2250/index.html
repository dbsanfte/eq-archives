<br />
Also what is the pause time for one second of real time ie: if an itme can be cast from inventory and has a cast time of one second what would i set my /pause at in order to get it to cast again almost imediatly after ending the first cast?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There is currently no know way to activate items from a macro at this time that I'm aweare of.   I've looked up and down the net several times as well to find something.  <br />
<br />
Only way I'ld know of to make a fast way to activate an item and then sit would be to create a shortcut for both the item you want to activate and the sit button.  Then placeing both buttons near each other in the hotbank to activate when needed.<br />
<br />
If you're interested in some good information on Macros try looking at the Macro 101 (http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/001332.html) thread at the Offical Everquest board in the Newbie Zone.  You can pretty much find examples of any macro possible out there.  As well there are some good ideas for thier use to simplify many things.<br />
<br />
P.S. The pause comand is very connection dependent.  For about ever 10 used in the pause comand is equal to about 1 second real time.  Though as said before its very dependent on your connection so for every person its defferent and some zones require larger pauses then others to have your macro work corretly.  That theard earlier mentioned explains pauses as well in much better detail and how to use them effectivly</div></div><hr />
