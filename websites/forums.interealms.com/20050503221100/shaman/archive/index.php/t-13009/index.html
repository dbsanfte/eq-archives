<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">meand some friends are gonna start to pl a cleric..  theres a 64 chanter 64 druid 62 sham 57 monk can log on a friends 62 war or 65 wizard..<br />
<br />
so got wide variety of classes...   now i need to find the best way to do the pling.. <br />
<br />
i was thinken cb belts up to round 10.. get em some xp and hit PC at around 14 get me 20 in a night or so..    past that /boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Enchanter &gt; All for pling a cleric, I used a 51 ench to get Kogu to 46 fast, kurns to 14, Paludal to 25, messed around to 30 then did Kaesora to 46.<br />
<br />
Once DS/Berserker spirit/melee can't cut it, switch to nuking/memwiping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the monk can beat everything to within an inch of its life and then FD, cleric nukes and gets the kill.  the enchanter is nice for mana regen, but otherwise, i've used my monk to get my cleric to 25 without any trouble and not too much time.  the biggest drawback is that the cleric is completely inept at spell casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gotta be careful PLing too fast.  I PLed a beastlord to 30 in a few days.  Now she is pretty much useless as her spell skills are around where a level 10 should be.  It might be best to stop every 5 or 7 levels, get a KEI, find a quiet spot and just cast cast cast until you get all of your major spell casting skills with 5 levels of max.  Otherwise you might not have the most useful cleric on the block. hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kurns/FoB and or paludal to 20th (the mobs don't run when Low on life). The way I found was fastest to pl a cleric was Buff him out the wazoo so he doesn't get plastered. Have a druid cast a ds on him. Cleric runs up to a mob, attacks till he does 11 points of damage to get the xp, then he runs to the next mob, does the same (red mobs of course) When he has about 5 mobs killing themselves on the Damage shield, he runs them back to you in case he might need a heal. Repeat as necessary. Level 1 - 17 in one sitting, things slow down around 18 or 20. <br />
<br />
After 20th, I suggest switching to having a melee beat the stuffing out of the mobs and the chanter mem blurring. The Monk Fd tactic doesn't work, I tried doing it in various ways, even during the recent Fd change. Mobs forget about the monk, start regenning hp fast and walking away but the cleric still wasn't getting the xp. Didn't matter if the mob was dead man walking or just at 1 bub of hp.<br />
<br />
For the skills the first approach has the advantage of maxxing melee skills (damage shields raise offense for some reason and 5 mobs beating on you have a definite effect on defence, weapons skills are a perk since you're meleeing rather than casting). The spell skills are easy to max and you'd have to practice them anyways even without pwrlevelling (from personal experience) so I suggest making sure you max his melee skills up to level 40 or so when they pretty much cap. <br />
<br />
Practicing spell skills... = <br />
<br />
Hotkey X<br />
/cast #<br />
/pause X<br />
/cast #<br />
/pause X<br />
/cast #<br />
<br />
Easy as pie. I think you can even piggyback he pauses with the casts to let you hotkey 5 casts but Still trying to figure out how. Now to find a way to get Hotkey X to recast every 20 or so seconds automatically....<br />
<br />
<br />
If you only have yourself to pl, personally I've gotten exellent results pling a drOod up to 40 ish by just Buffing him, slowing the mobs so he can melee them and sending in dogdog at 50 percent. Ds and nukes weren't worth casting so I'd guess it would be just as efficient for a cleric. Past 20 the lightcrawlers, zelniaks or wolves in dawnshroud work well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't forget, after level 34 clerics get a nifty little spell called &quot;Atone&quot; that is like enchanters' mem blur in that it wipes a mob's hate list if successful.  I'd say have the shaman kill something within an inch of its life and then root it, cleric atones until mob changes direction it's facing (away from the shaman), and then cleric nukes once for kill.  Then back to med while shaman pulls and kills another mob.  It would work very smoothly.  Monk can do this with FD before 34.</div></div><hr />
