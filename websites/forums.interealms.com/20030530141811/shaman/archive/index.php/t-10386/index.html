<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goratha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if there is only one way into PoM (mischeif)? I was looking at a map the othere day and they put a zone in to PoM on their map in SG. Does anyone have any fact to this or is it still through NToV? :confused:  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">NTOV is it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As far as I know its still at the end of NToV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The zone IN to PoM is currently in North ToV, the zone OUT is in the middle of the water in Cobalt Scar. Both zones are one way.<br />
<br />
There was talk of revising this zone at the last convention. From what was stated they were supposed to be looking at it immediately after the Con. There was recent spell changes in Lucy that were for PoM only spells so there is a bright light.<br />
<br />
The devs stated that they wanted to make the zone more accessable so alternate entrance(s) are a high possiblity when/if they do revise the zone.<br />
<br />
But other then the spell data changes &amp; 2 more pointless halfing guards added in the sideways pool room, there has been nothing new added to zone as of yet &amp; no mention of anything in expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They would have to increase the mob population 4x in order for that zone to be someplace to exp in with a group.  As it is now, its ok for a partial group in a few areas and solo/duo only in others.  Now if they made the mobs more along the line of PoP then it would make a nice place for 60+ to play but they would still need to increase the number of mobs.  I can see them messing with faction as well.  Currently, faction isnt really and issue so you can run around willy nilly.  But I would expect that if they turn the zone over to the masses, then expect them to mess with faction as part of any zone revamp.<br />
<br />
My personal feeling of the zone, I love it. I wish they would just up the level of the mobs a tad to allow 65's to solo or duo there and make it worth their while.  But maybe thats just me being selfish..../shrug<br />
<br />
Anyway, I will miss the old PoM if they do change it.</div></div><hr />
