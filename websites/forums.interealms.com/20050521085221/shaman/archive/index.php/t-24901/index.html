<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wulfgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail and well met all.. Have been reading these boards for long long time , few years at least.. I have a ? for any about Trial of Torture.. Is it bugged for 1.5 epic.. <br />
  I have done this stupid Trial 3 times now and Veshtaq never spawns..<br />
Do i need to Talk to Maluvin again (which is just lame if ya have to) .. I bug reported and what not.. Done trial of execution so was unsure if i had to do dialogue with Maluvin again to make Torture trial work.. <br />
 Keep up the great posts all and all the helpful info..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You may be killing the mobs too fast. DO NOT pull them.. let them enter the room like they're supposed to. I didnt have this problem when I got mine because it was me, cleric, 2 pallies &amp; 2 warriors.. um over-dps wasnt a problem :) In fact, I think I did the majority of it.. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had a wierd experience when I did mine<br />
<br />
We were clearing the mobs, easy, no probs. Then after a few waves it stopped. We waited and waited and got nothing.<br />
<br />
We left and decided to try again. We were able to get the trial again right away (didn't have to wait 30 mins)<br />
<br />
When we went back in we got only a couple waves then the final guy. It was as if it picked up from where it left off.<br />
<br />
No idea what happened, but i got my talisman so I was happy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wulfgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ok cool.. will give it ago .. Been having the warrior round em up and pulling them into room.. They die so fast it is funny.. got wraith of agony to spawn 2 times so cleric didn't even have to heal haha.. After last wraith spawned in room we waited 4 ever and no Veshtaq.. <br />
 Thanks for advice will see if it helps tonight.. Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">when i did it i failed the first time because i didnt pull the wrath of agony. (the prisoners were gone suddenly, i guess they need the ae-heal as well).<br />
<br />
the second time we pulled everything asap and everything worked fine.<br />
and i doubt too fast is a problem, i had 1 ranger and 3 wizards all time+ geared, the mobs were downed more than fast, hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Soram</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">when I did mine, about a week ago, the 3rd wraith didn't spawn in the room, he was bugged, and spawned out where you zone in.  there was also a mob that never did path its way into the big room.  If we hadn't gone and killed it, that would have failed it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep, the pathing of the wraith is buggy.  Half the times he spawns at the zone in spot.  If you don't kill him the torture kills the prisoners and you fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wulfgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks all for the help.. I got him last night.. We had to return to trial room and go back in for it to work right. <br />
 We killed 2 waves and 2 wraiths and bam , prisoners left and we waited for about 5 minutes or so.. I went back and read post, and decided to try to return and come back in, wth ya know =).. We came back went to room and Trial worked like magic.. Stupid Game.. I guess i should be use to all the little screw ups in this game after 4 years, hehe.. <br />
 Thanks all...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rezipps</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When i did my trial just a week or so ago i never once saw a &quot;Wraith of Agony&quot; and none of the mobs cast CH upon death..... Yet Veshtaq still spawned after 4 waves... And none of the prisoner's died. We killed wraith like mobs but none were CH'ers....<br />
