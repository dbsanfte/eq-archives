<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Whats the lvl 60 spell Focus Of Spirit go for now-a-days? I bought mine for 200pp in Gfay today (regardless or w/e ppl might say, 200pp is downright CHEAP for a lvl 55+ spell and if I get another I'll just let a guildie have it. Always nice to have it in your bank incase u do get 60 and DONT have it :))<br />

No answers here, sorry. :( <br />
I picked it up off Bubar in EC for around 9pp if memory serves.<br />
Sometimes it pays to browse vendors, I guess.  :cool:<br />
<br />
Bought it with a broke mule after borrowing 10pp from a guildie.<br />
I was so afraid someone else was going to see it after I had and snatch it. :D Now I only have to get 10 more levels before I can use it. ;)<br />

Take care,<br />
