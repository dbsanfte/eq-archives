<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ive always pronounced the word shaman as sha-men, with the first a being soft, but i was watching CNN and they where pronouncing it shay-men, with a hard A, so i was wondering how you pronounced it, just out of curiosity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moonmist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">****in Sha'men - never Shay'men. Holy ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From the first time I saw the word it was always Shay-Men kinda hard to change now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have always said the second version, Shay-men. However, I have also heard the other pronunciation as well...usually like in some BBC documentary on the people of new guinea or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman - (SHAH muhn).<br />
The word shaman comes to us through Russian from the Evenk people of Siberia (referred to as Tungus by Russians). It is sometimes spelled saman, but shaman is more accurate. Generally, when used as a noun, it has no gender, however some use it as a masculine term with the feminine being shamanka, but this is actually a Russian change, the Evenk people would say shaman in all cases. Shaman may also be used as a verb, defining a state of being. For example, &quot;he is shaman&quot; is equally correct to &quot;he is a shaman&quot;.<br />

Pulled from a couple of sources.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've always used the first pronunciation, although my dictionary lists both as being acceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Both are accepted actually.<br />
<br />
And I've always used the first, also.</div></div><hr />

We say it how we want to say it correct or not.  So what does it really matter?  Hell even George frikin Lucas pronounces stuff different when he talks about Star Wars than the frikin actors do in the movie itself.  Find out how he pronounces Hoth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Just dun say shamen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Who CARES?  i do, both pronunciations are technically acceptable, but im interested as to how people pronounce it.  problem?</div></div><hr />

Who CARES?<br />
<br />
Forgive me for asking, but why are you posting to a thread that you DON'T CARE about? Try skipping threads that don't interest you, sheeeesh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well it depends on which race your talking about:<br />
<br />
Barbarian: a-NOTHER<br />
<br />
Iksar: Suitcase<br />
<br />
Ogre: Big-un<br />
<br />
Troll: Ded Sexy (Props)<br />
<br />
Vah Shir: Meow<br />
<br />
I always preferred Heyokah, Oracle, or Mystic.  &quot;Illuminary&quot; sounds like some dork with a torch in one hand lighting the path in a dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">shaymen is gay</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've always pronounced it the first way. And plural is shaman, and female is shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I remember a thread stating that the plural is Shamans.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Shay-man is how I've always pronounced it, though I've heard other people use Shah-muhn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sha-muhn is how I pronounce it, and also the plural for shaman is shamans OR shaman, both are acceptable, but most use shamans (say shamen and I kill you :p )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So is it pronouced 'Man-uh' or 'Mon-ah' ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">man-uh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I bet you are the same type of people that sit there and debate wether its, Hairess ment, or ,Her ass ment,  for the frikin word harassment.  Who cares?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">were not debating, people are just interested how other people pronounce it. And obviously you care, and are worse than most of the people posting on this thread, because even though you really dont care about this topic you have decided to take a valuable minute out of your action packed day to post how stupid we all are, and to edit it to i might add.<br />
