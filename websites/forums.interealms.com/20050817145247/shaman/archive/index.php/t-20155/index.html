<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay all, after much deliberation, the change to Breath of Trushar on Test yesterday is the straw that broke my back.  SOE is obviously not going to take care of the shammy class and I don't want to be a second class citizen after spending months and countless hours getting my character to a high level.<br />
<br />
Therefore, as a level 57, I feel I have a couple of options; re-roll or quit.  Quiting may happen either way, however, if I decide to try life as a different class, which would you folks recommend.  I've got a level 32 BST and a level 30 Pally.  The BST was meant to be a replacement for my shammy when I first got to feeling that things were going the wrong way for us.  I later changed my mind and decided I'd be a Pally and 2-box with my shammy.  Well, 2-boxing is ok, but I prefer to focus on one character at a time.  So, what I'm looking for is a class I can PL past level 30 or so, and then just play straight up to the high end of the game.<br />
<br />
I read the boards and have a feel for how the other classes see themselves, but I'd like some input from those of you who play other classes.  I recall Ceno mentioning Necros and Pallys.  Others, like Anaskesia, play BSTs or Chanters.  Also, it seems that at the high end, in raiding guilds, Warriors and Clerics are always in demand, along with high dps classes like rogues and wizards.   However, I'd also like to be able to solo due to my weird playing schedule. <br />
<br />
OK, I know I've rambled a bit, bottom line, what class would you recommend.  I fear my days as a shammy are numbered, but at least I can PL the new toon very effectively.<br />

That turned out to be longer than I intended it to be.  I think I might have missed a class, but Im not going to go back and look.  I personally have a ranger alt that Ive worked on in the last 2 weeks or so.  Have pumped about 75K into gear and he just hit 51 with 3 days 12 hours played.  PLed yes, but his casting skills are almost maxed and his melee skills are.  No other class PLs better than a shaman.  Druids do it faster, but skills lag FAR behind when druid PLing.<br />
<br />
I like the ranger because its great fun for me to actually feel that I contribute damage to the mob.  I still like Thorzion, but tossing slows, malos and FA's for hour after hour in a grind has worn me out.  The ranger gives me a chance to still have utility and help out, but also smack the crap outta some stuff too.<br />
<br />
Many will disagree with some things I have listed, but these are my experiences with the classes.  Feel free to debate/correct what you will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't mean to be an utter ******* here but how much deliberation did you actually do regarding this Thunderwolfjr?<br />
<br />
If there are no typo's in your post, and I am not missing the obvious, you are levels away from torpor and Q is not even on your horizon. To quit playing your shaman is one thing, but to provide changes to a spell that a lot of shaman won't see for a while as your reason seems a little reactive.<br />
<br />
Best of luck in whatever class you play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Nice write up Thorzion.  The only class you missed was Bards.<br />
<br />
Pro<br />
Able to seemingly do four things at once.<br />
Very high group demand, if you can play your class well.<br />
Good soloers as well.<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
A very demanding class to play well.<br />
Playing well for extended periods of time may result in premature arthritis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since my main for a loooooong time was a monk, I'll critique that class.<br />
<br />
Monk<br />
Pros<br />
High sustainable damage<br />
Excellent pullers with the new phantom wind line of disciplines and feign death<br />
Very good damage avoidance<br />
Human monks are dead sexy<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
Obscenely expensive to outfit - good weapons alone can run 150k<br />
Poor - no, pitiful damage mitigation - the damage spikes will kill you<br />
Considerably less effective without raid-level gear.  Bazaar monks are gimp.<br />
<br />
I would very much advise against a monk unless you have an excellent guild that will help gear you up in raid loot and no-drop weapons.<br />

As I cock my head to the side I'm wondering how great our &quot;upgrade&quot; is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Got my (troll) BST up to level 61 before getting interested in my shaman again (thanks to a great fun guild of people).  There ARE no downsides to the bst class.  You have the best pet in the game, the best pet heal in the game, significant (2nd best?) mana regen to offer the group, the best atk buffs in the game, DPS that is pretty far up the food chain (not sure exactly where), and pretty stellar damage avoidance.  I revisited the spots where I'd leveled my shaman and had a ridiculously easy time soloing in these spots.  It's a fun, busy class.  I was rarely bored, and a tremendous asset to ANY group in ANY situation.  Even with a slower or 2 in the group, the BST slows are so fast-casting and mana-cheap, that you can save the day in an emergency (though nobody will know  *grin*).<br />
<br />
A ridiculously overpowered class (at least to 61) with no downsides that I could find.  The biggest thing I missed was gate - oh, but I had the gate hammer (took a day) and could self-buff my DEX to max.  Yeah, problem solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I fail to see how a change to spell on test affects a level 57 on a live server that won't even have a chance at the spell for quite some time.  If you want to quit playing EQ just do it...don't look for some ridiculous and insignificant occurance on a test server to justify your actions.<br />
<br />
SOE is obviously not going to take care of the shammy class and I don't want to be a second class citizen after spending months and countless hours getting my character to a high level.<br />
<br />
Yup.  You heard it here first.  Shaman are now 2nd class citizens.  *snicker*.<br />
<br />
Look, no one class is completely domininant in EQ.  At varying points and in different types of content some classes may shine more than others but that's the way is will ALWAYS be.  Why?  Because the classes aren't exactly equal and never will be.  Otherwise, why even have classes...we might as well all have every ability and skill and do away with classes.<br />
<br />
Get.<br />
Over.<br />
It.<br />
<br />
SOE is not going to &quot;take care of you&quot; and they're not going to take care of anyone else either.  They present a game with content and classes.  You pick a class and it's up to you to make the best of it.  If you can't, or you find that you don't enjoy the class, then do something different.  It's not up to SOE to constantly change the game design to fit your personal desires.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I could also be mistaken, but until this goes live.. then I wouldn't get your panties in a bind.  Seriously, the changes that they made a few days ago didn't make it past test.  My boT still heals me for 360hp at 220 mana. I hope they aren't done changing it.  Alot can still happen till they go live with it.<br />
<br />
On that note, I'm sure that as a level 57 you've experienced first hand what it's like to have problems healing groups in places like the kod trials.  Oh, wait, nm, you have to be level 60 to get into the zones to get the flags for kod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Whether or not the original poster is making a smart move by rerolling at lvl 57, the results (i.e. this thread) have been very useful.  I am not in GoD yet, but I realize as well as anyone else that there is approaching a time when I personally will feel about as useless as teats on a boar hog.<br />
<br />
So I'm looking at starting an alt now, and gradually level up over the next few months so when (if) I hit the brick wall with my shaman I will have a solid secondary character.  <br />
<br />
So THANK YOU for the informational posts in this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">seriously, goodbye won't miss you.  If you think that the fun factor of playing ones class is all about what types of leet new spells we get or changes made to them, than let it be and reroll as something else.  Despite what they've done to the shaman, I still love playing mine and I won't stop.  Do yourself a favor and delete the shaman now.  I don't want someone that brings such negativity to my class.  I will never ever ever ever feel useless.  There is so much to do on a raid or in groups.  If you get to that point where you feel worthless, then by all means create a wizard or something so that you can be relegated to one duty your whole existance... do dmg.  Oh, wait, two duties.  Someone needs to TL the melees after the raid/group is done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OK, I know I've rambled a bit, bottom line, what class would you recommend.  I fear my days as a shammy are numbered, but at least I can PL the new toon very effectively.<br />
Thunderwolf<br />
<br />
Based on the fact that you want some ability to solo, I would suggest any of the following:<br />
<br />
Bard (tricksy, but fun)<br />
<br />
Beastlord (easy to play, but the levels between 55 - 62 really suck becuase everything you will be fighting will own your pet)<br />
<br />
Enchanter (very desirable in groups, and very good solo if you like taking chances)<br />
<br />
There are plenty of classes to play, and some of them are very enjoyable.  <br />
<br />
Valsouvious:  I don't think hes responding specifically to the breath of trushar changes.  Hes responding to the apparent pattern of disregard from Sony.  And based on the last 4 expansions, hes really not being all that hasty.  Why cut him down for pointing out what dozens of other people are also pointing out?  If I knew back at level 57 that I was going to feel this abused at level 65 with 300+ aa, I might have chosen a different class too.  People play to have fun.  If you don't feel like your having fun, and each day you see some new disappointment, can you really be blamed for deciding earlier in the game that is not what you're looking for?  If I see a boulder falling from the sky toward me, I know enough to get out of the way before it lands.  I don't really need to stand there and let it crush me before I decide that maybe being crushed with a boulder wont be much fun.  Maybe those changes won't go live.  Maybe they will.  Maybe other changes will happen.  Maybe they won't.  All people can do is wait and see, or not wait and see.  For the people that choose not to wait and see, thats a perfectly acceptable choice.  People need to do what they think is fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thank you Deria,<br />
<br />
You hit the nail right on the head.  Yes, I, like many others, took a wait and see attitude with GoD, and look at what we got.  Now, they take our Q upgrade and nerf it.  It is not the spell or the fact that I don't enjoy playing a 57 shaman, I love playing my little guy.  What has upset me is the apparent attitude at SOE towards the shaman class.  And this last nerf is a real slap in the face.  Every single shaman in GoD is complaining about our inadequate healing, so they nerf our new heal while improving every other healers spells, including the Pally and Ranger!?<br />
<br />
Maybe I was a bit hasty in my original comments, I did write my post right after I saw the changes on Lucy, so I was hot.  I won't be retiring my shaman any time soon.  But as Deria mentioned, I don't want to be a 65 with 300 aa's and regret the time I put into the charater. <br />
<br />
For those of you who answered my original question, I thank you very much, especially Thorzion, great summary.  Valsuvious and the others, I respect your opinion and hope that I am as positive in the end game as you are.  In the meantime I'll hedge my bet and keep playing both my shaman and alts, until I decide which will be my long term &quot;project&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks all,<br />

<br />
I like to call these inflations, not upgrades.  Upgrades tend to be better than the original.  Trushar is just an inflation of Q.  An upgrade would be 1.75hp/mana or something inherantly better than Q.<br />

I don't know how any shaman in Everquest can say with a straight face that Sony hates us.  It's ok to complain about little things sometimes, but big-picture-wise, the shaman class is very fortunate.</div></div><hr />
