<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wiltavian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hmm.... anyone know what the scoop is on Mask of the Hunter versus Mask of the Stalker??<br />
<br />
We killed Doomshade last night and he dropped Mask of the Hunter and I looked at it and it said it was scribable for me (Ranger) at level 65 when I looked at description.<br />
<br />
I was in the  bazaar the same day and saw Mask of the Stalker for sale and it also said it was scribable for me at level 65 when I looked at the description.<br />
<br />
Are they both scribable for us at 65 or is one not scribable after all and is a mistake??  Checking there effects they both appear to do the exact same thing as well...just different names.<br />
<br />
I confirmed myself that BOTH list Ranger usable at lvl 65 when right-clicking them....whats the scoop?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Is one of them Outdoors only and the other both Indoors/Outdoors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jooneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">According to &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://lucy.fnord.net&quot;&gt;Lucy&lt;/A&gt;, Mask of the Hunter should be DRU/60 only (and the scroll should be tagged as such).  Mask of the Stalker is tagged as DRU/60 RNG/60.  Mask of the Stalker is the one you want, because Mask of the Hunter is outdoors only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mask of the hunter is most likely tagged Rng 255 as it was Rng usable on Test for a while before PoP was released</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dravack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yea, it is tagged ranger lvl255....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jooneau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually it's tagged as RNG/127.<br />
<br />

<br />
Scroll down to the rnglevel value.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've seen a copy linked, Hunter is set to level 255 in the EQ UI.  Or was, for a while.  Could have changed.<br />
<br />
Mask of the Stalker is actually scribable, Hunter is not.<br />
<br />
The scoop is there were several spells that were Ranger usable in PoP beta but were moved to level 255 later on because better spells were put in place.<br />
<br />
As a side note, Mask of the Stalker is one of the most useful spells I've cast.</div></div><hr />
