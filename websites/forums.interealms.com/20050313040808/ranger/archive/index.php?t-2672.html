<br />
Mairee Silentone in Eurdin, Odus<br />
<br />
Give Mairee Silentone the Dwarven Smiths Hammer and the Swirling Sphere of Color.<br />
<br />
Mairee Silentone holds the sphere and makes intricate marks and patterns on it, eventually turning the entire crystal clear. She rolls it across the hammer, raising a ringing sound in the room. 'There. Now take the hammer back to Kinlo. He'll know what to do from here. Good luck to you .'<br />
<br />
Mairee Silentone gives you the &quot;Hammer of the Ancients,&quot; which identifies as Hammer of an ancient dwarf.<br />
<br />
Hammer of the Ancients<br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP<br />
Skill: 1H Blunt Atk Delay: 40<br />
DMG: 2<br />
WT: 5.0<br />
Class: RNG<br />
Race: HUM ELF HEF<br />
<br />
I have a bit of a question for you guys. Last time I was on a sky raid, the stone dropped, and, yep, you guessed it, a daft druid looted it without knowing what it was for. I won the random for the chaining rights.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm dubious with ole' Mairee, and I'll really freak the hell out if I have to kill the DE and Jalil again. Sky isn't that big a deal... raid next week.<br />
<br />
The druid is also dubious. <br />
<br />
Now, if we both sneak to gain indifference, he pops the stone to Mairlee, I pop the hammer in, he hits give, then I hit give, will we I recieve the hammer of the ancients? I'd sure love to get Swiftwind before that Sky raid and let one of our other rangers take the stone when it falls. <br />
<br />
Because of our dubiousness, I'd like to know if this method of MQing will work. If it won't, does anyone have any ideas on how to improve faction with this wench?<br />
<br />
Remember, you can no longer grab a camo after beginninng the trade. Patches suck, but hey, as soon as I have both swords, I won't give a damn anymore. =)<br />

Extremly good point. We're talking halfer druid here. I believe all those little hairy bastards do. <br />
<br />
Don't quote me on that, though. Damn you for bringing another wrinkle into my wicked plot. =P<br />

Yes, those hairy-footed pie-bags do get sneak for all their classes (at skill 50, I believe).  No more ports for me...</div></div><hr />

Normally if they will talk, your faction is good enough. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's a halfer with sneak, then you're all set.  Have him give the sphere first, complete the trade fully, etc, then, sneak up behind her and give her the Hammer.<br />
<br />
If he can't sneak, then have him put the sphere in the trade window.  Before he hits trade, cast invis on him.  Once done, he hits trade, and it should count as trading with indiff faction.  Then, sneak up and give her the hammer.<br />
<br />
I don't reccomend using invis though.  I've never done it and don't fully understand how to do it.</div></div><hr />

They just &quot;nerfed&quot; this ability in the patch yesterday.  Can't do it anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crydee Ossiriand</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, she talks. You just need to know what to say to her...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You say, 'What ancient hammer?'<br />
Mairee Silentone says 'Yes, the ancient hammer. I heard something about that. Do you mind if I take a look at it?'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merrikat</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there seem to be some differences on how exactly to MQ this part for me. I've worked my ass off for this pair, and I'm super excited, and to be honest, a bit nervous about getting them. <br />
<br />
How exactly does one go about MQing? I've never done it before... anyone know?<br />
<br />
Does the party that has the MQ item have to complete the trade fully first? Or should I go about it like this: druid sneaks, druid puts stone up, Merrikat sneaks, Merrikat puts hammer up, druid hit's &quot;give,&quot; Merrikat hit's &quot;give?&quot;<br />
<br />
Any specifics you guys could give would help a bunch.<br />
<br />
Also, Crydee, she spoke to me with that trigger at dubious. I've checked your site about a million times over the last two or so months, and she isn't listed in your faction list. Will she take the hammer and the stone and return them to me at dubious? Or do I need to prowl the lands trying to find a way to raise faction with this stuck up smarty pants erudite?<br />

PS: Crydee, thanks for your work with the epic... I tried my damnest not to look, but when I did, it helped a bunch. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically Multiquesting works because Quest NPC's keep track of what's given to them, but not WHO gives it to them.  Thus in a situation where there are 2 items to be handed in, one person can hand in the first one, and the NPC will register that hand in, and wait for the 2nd one.  The Person who wants to recieve the final reward then hands in the 2nd item, and the NPC registers the item as completing the quest, and gives the reward to the last giver.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that I've read of people doing the PoA turn in while dubious.  As a Ranger though there's no reason to take chances.  Just use sneak stand behind her and get indifferent.  Indiff has worked for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwindor</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pally who mq'd this with me was also dubious.<br />
At the time, I didn't want to risk it so we did the invis trick which has now been disabled.<br />
However at the time the advice I was getting unanimously suggested that it would have worked with the pally as dubious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strongboww's corpse</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't need to worry too much - i MQ'd this part both of us (53 and 55 ranger) were dubious - he did it the same way - just have him give stone and FINISH trade, then immediately hand in the hammer, presto chango! Your done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are the facts:<br />
<br />
1. all halflings get sneak, it's a race enabled ability, like all wood elves get forage.<br />
<br />
2. The questing part with Mairee Silentone in Eurdin is intended to be done with players that are only at dubious faction, she just hate people.  The givaway is that she talks to people about the quest with dibious faction, so the quest can be done with that faction also.  Most people just prefer to sneak so they KNOW they are safe doing the quest.<br />
<br />
3. When turning in items for a quest, the NPC only pays attention to the order that the items are actually GIVEN to him.  Who actually walks up to the NPC or opens the trade windows first have absolutely NO effect on the outcome of the questing.  It is strictly based on the order of hitting the GIVE botton.  However, when multi-questing with another player it is MUCH MUCH safer to have each person open and fully complete their trade before the next person.  That way you don't get into problems with lag or miscommunication causing people to hit the GIVE button in the wrong order.<br />
<br />
4. The patch change to the Invis thing, according to the patch message, only relates to INITIATING a trade while invis.  You are forced to be visible to START the trade.  Once the trade window is open, you should still be able to have another player invis you before actually hitting the GIVE botton.<br />
<br />
So the answer for you Merrikat is this... both of you can sneak if you want to to make sure you have an acceptable faction level.  The sneaking Is't really required.  HOWEVER, if you decide to do it without sneak, make sure you BOTH talk to Mairee to make sure she responds correctly to the quest dialog Crydee mentioned (you should do this with every quest you ever do, to make SURE your faction is still correct, and nothing has changed to cause a problem).  Next have the druid go up and turn in the Sphere from Sky, completing that trade in it's entirety.  Then after the druid tells you he has completed the trade,  THEN you turn in the hammer.<br />
<br />
Also, make sure you have the correct hammer.  This part of the quest is to take the hammer you got from Hole and give it to Mairee so that she can look at it.  Then she gives it back as a new name and tells you to get the Sphere from Sky and then give her the Sphere and the hammer again.  Which results in you getting another hammer back with a third name.  Check Crydee's walkthru to be sure of the exact names of each hammer.</div></div><hr />
