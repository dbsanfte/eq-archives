<br />
most rangers fletch (make bows and arrows)<br />
<br />
to fletch form skill 180ish to 230ish you lose a ****load of platnum unless.........<br />
<br />
you make a gnome alt, get him to lvl 16 and get his tinkering skill to 100 and have him make some of the parts for you.<br />
<br />
now from skill 180ish to 205ish you break even. from skill 205ish to 230 (when they triv) you actually MAKE PLAT FROM A TRADESKILL, <br />
<br />
which, i'm sure, will be nerfed once VI sees this. Tinkering will become some naughty skill that only gnomes get cuz they are so short, use your imagaineation here.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">as for fighting? heres what they do:<br />
<br />
you are in the middle of a long fight and begining to doubt your chances for winning. because they are the perfect height the gomes comes along and gives you a f***ing good bl**j** during the fight. this is a special ability gnomes got in the 6/9 patch. it gives you 50% haste plus it fears and roots your enemy, occationally though the gnome gets a ****load of argo because the mob gets jealous, then the mob is perma-stunned whilst the gnome sucks the mobs d***.<br />
<br />
morale of my sick story:<br />
a.) never answer a post after watching some, er, guess<br />
b.) never ask dumb questions when I could potentially reply late at night.<br />
<br />
<br />
note: for all you pervs out there a.) was after watching a Barney marathon</div></div><hr />
