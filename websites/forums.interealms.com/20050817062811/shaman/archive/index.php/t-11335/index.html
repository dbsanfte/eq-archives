<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Before we go and bitch about the damn spell can someone at least complete the damn quest and tell us how hard it is?  Hell, I can't even get that guy to look at me twice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">And can we plz avoid the redundent.. Where do you get this spell? Where dose this spell come from.. Ect ect ect. Yes we know its out there. Yes a lot are looking for it. So there is no point to asking the same questions 20 billion times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">12 hours and Mr.I'msocoldIcan'ttalk is still mute.  I hate quests like this, I want to go up, buy my damn spells and get the hell out of that expansion.  I don't want to try to figure out what the hell the Devs want me to say to this barb, I want my damn spell.<br />
<br />
If anyone has at least completed the quest please say so, if ya wanna put up a walkthough, its all bonus =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mingh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The barbarian guy is the beastlord spell quest man. I think this has something to do with the ogre inside the windmill.<br />
<br />
Cant find a phrase to get more info from him through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wasn't able to log in yesterday so I haven't even explored the new zones, but just an overly-obvious thought:<br />
<br />
If the guy is cold, be a buddy and try to warm him. Maybe with a nice hot beverage or meal, or a warm, fuzzy blanket.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this is the right direction to go but it's possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kyylie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Talk to the sea spirit inside the overturned boat under the water at p650 n300. He'll talk to you and send you on a quest though all he's done for me so far is eat everything i hand him.<br />
<br />
But i have a feeling he's the stoicism guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dorking around with a frog last night I noticed an oddity with the new quests.  I was told to get an eye from a spider and when I returned I handed it to the quest guy as usual and he gave it back.  I hailed him instead and he took the item and finished the quest.<br />
<br />
So for LoY quests, always hail the quest guy before trying to hand him stuff.  Cuz it looks like they changed up their quest system a bit (at least for some of the new zones).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes I noticed that with the newbie frog quests to they would not accept an item if given to them but if you hail them they see you possess it and give you the next step.<br />
<br />
An interesting way of working quests and it is a good idea to try the same with the loy spell quests before handing it to them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This also prevents MQ'ing. Looks like EQ2 will have no MQ'ng.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ok, so I get home last night and ask my wife who's had all day to explore the new zones if she picked up my new spells. Reply nope, no one knows where to get them.<br />
<br />
I spend all night last night on a giant lord raid, mostly scraping my sorry ass of the ground, so I didn't get to do much any exploring myself.<br />
<br />
So this morning I check the boards to find out the spells are quested. I was upset yesterday about the change to DA, which I use a lot, but now I have to quest to get a replacement for it?<br />
<br />
Come on! Is anyone else as pissed about this as I am?<br />
<br />
Just another slap in the face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Salamonda Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yup I'm really annoyed also.  I too used the spell Disinfecting Aura quite often on Hate raids.<br />
<br />
Not only do they nerf a spell... but they make us buy a new expansion to get back they spell they nerfed... which they ALSO give to 2 other classes!  (Cleric, Druid)<br />
<br />
They should have changed Disinfecting Aura in everyone's spell books to Pure Blood, and then make Disinfecting Aura the quested spell for Shaman.<br />
<br />
Personally I have no desire for a remove 48 disease counter spell.  Abolish Disease is fine with me.<br />
<br />
With the way Disinfecting Aura has been changed to work now, I likely wouldn't have scribed it in the first place.</div></div><hr />
