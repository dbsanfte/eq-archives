Looks like from that thread Xalmat from the mage board and Chenier from the druid board have admitted as much.<br />
<br />
So many thoughts run through my head, first off would be why didnt they (SOE and/or those who had their way paid) announce this? Sounds like most who had their way paid for were keeping it under wraps.<br />
<br />
I find this trend disturbing.<br />

I told all my guild and a ton of people at Fan Faire that Sony picked up my air fare, hotel and registration cost for Fan Faire (I didn't get a goodie bag like Xalmat did though :( ).<br />
<br />
I've told anybody that asked about it.<br />
<br />
I tried really hard to use the time wisely. I attended panels both days, asked questions of the devs, took the entire print out of shaman questions and wrote down every bit of useful info I picked up to report back here. I didn't feel like I an obligation to Sony to be responsible, not drink all night and sleep til 4 but I felt I had a great opportunity to find out as much as I could and share it here.<br />

<br />
I'm fully aware of what is spent for marketing. That's mainly WHY I find it disturbing. I see too many parallels in other industries, or politics. Where is becomes much less about the product, and more about the marketing.<br />
<br />
why is that disturbing? <br />
i mean, it is in both their and our interest, that the correspondants and the as honored guests betitled users (those running the &quot;real&quot; community sites, like glori here) get the chance to see what they plan, get the possibility to talk to the devs/designers irl, without the board as medium.<br />

<br />
It may very well help both sides in the short term. I don't feel its the best choice for the GAME in the long term. They could do the same thing without spending the money. I don't know about you, but I would rather they hired a new &quot;spells guy&quot; with all the money that is going to pay for these &quot;junkets&quot;. Hell, I would rather they HIRED Glori officially than do things this way.<br />
<br />
AFAIK that is standard practice in the business world. I have buddies who got out of the Army and when they interviewed with companies a second time they were flown and put up at the companies locale on the company dime.<br />

<br />
I agree with your points completely. However, all the information they want is already available on the class boards. You know that, I know that, why don't THEY (SOE) know that? Look at what came out of the guild summit, most of the good ideas were sold to us in the next exp. Makes more sense to me to just hire these folks outright (shrug). Perhaps its a psychological thing?<br />
<br />
If someone asks you out on a date, do you expect them to pay? Hell yeah, why else would Glori fly to New Orleans and spend her valuable time giving SoE input/feedback on the game? Hell, if they called me to invite me, my first question would be &quot;Are you paying?&quot; If not, click.<br />
<br />
Personally, I always pay my own way, and I always offer to pay for the date whoever suggested it. Perhaps it's that I'm a guy, or how I was raised (Shrug). TANSTAAFL, at least not in my world. You always pay in some form of coin. I would rather pay up front.<br />
<br />
get over it Saar...<br />

<br />
Get over what? I pointed out something that I read to the community. I stated I found it disturbing. I have elaborated upon why. I attacked no one, I did not use nor imply the words &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. Perhaps you have something to get over?<br />
<br />
This is how business is done in the real world. I get free lunches almost every week from vendors, even though I have no influence over the purchasing decisions. /shrug<br />
<br />
Again my concern is not whether this is &quot;how business is done&quot; its rather is this how WE want the games industry run? Specifically EQ. Don't we play these games for fun? Now it's about &quot;business&quot; rather than enjoyment? <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Gloriana,<br />
I hope you did not take this as an attack upon you or your character. I had no idea you had received the same treatment from SOE. I'm speaking more about what is SOEs reasoning behind it, and what the impact is/will be on the game we all play as well upon the EQ community here. As I said, disturbing trend, NOT &quot;lynch mob&quot; time (grin). I have many more thoughts on this, however they are of a more personal nature to my little piece of EQ, and I don't want to turn this into another raider vs. non-raider thread.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you had a good time, sounds like NO is a nice place. <br />
<br />
One request, please feel free to ignore it or deride it, I ask that you post that your trip was paid for in your write up of the event?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your support of the Shaman community, I know you do a much better job of it than I ever could.<br />

You do not owe us an explanation, or even to use the time wisely.  This is a reasonable business expense for SOE that benefits them more than you, that is why they do it.  It is certainly in their best interest to keep the respected leaders of their clientele happy and informed.<br />
<br />
If those of us on the forum sent you we would probably have expected something - but we didn't.  We are just happy to see you remain in the SOE loop.   The fact that you did use your time to our advantage is a bonus for us.<br />
<br />
Looks like you had fun - Great!<br />

No, because I don't want the thread to derail into a thread like this.

I am not going to second-guess SOE marketing, but this strikes me as a win-win for them, and for us.   Forming personal relationships with the most influential of their clients can only be good for them. <br />
<br />
Of course SOE knows it is not providing a free lunch.  I am sure Glory knows that too.  In this case, what is good for SOE is probably good for the shaman community.  Making SOE aware of our concerns face-to-face is a win for us.<br />
<br />
I will agree that mentioning that SOE picked up the expenses may prevent threads like this one.</div></div><hr />

As you wish ma'am. No reason to change your title, as I stated I had no idea that your trip had been paid for when I posted this thread. Its not in any way an attack on anyone, or any practice in the business community.<br />

It was an opinion, mine, and a sharing of information with the community here that I had hoped would generate constructive discussion.<br />

Glori is a tribute to the class. And is a pretty damn good person as well. She is human and subject to a little bribery as well. But she was there. We were not, so her information is more valuable than folks that were not there. <br />
<br />
As for Sony's marketing and practices. Well. Smart it is. But I would always be more loyal to a company that was straightforward and loyal to me before I would ever be loyal to some smarmy doublespeaking shyster that is better off in a used car parkinglot than a position of importance.<br />

Not sure what you intended. You can't complain about me not announcing it without making it sound like I had something I wanted to hide. Copied from your post on TDG:<br />
<br />
Am I the only person that feels there is something unseemly about certain members of the EQ Community being treated differently then others when they get special VIP status at EQ events and are essentially paid to be there? I really have to wonder if SOE is trying to somehow influence the opinions of the EQ Community when our community leaders are flown out to SOE functions, wined and dined and given special gifts. Is this really ethical?<br />
<br />
You are questioning my ethics, how am I not supposed to see this as an attack? What DID you intend if not to imply that my opinions are bought and paid for by SOE?</div></div><hr />

I must say I am very confused. I have never posted on TDG, I dont even have an account there. I linked the thread on TDG in the first post of this thread as a reference, not as a cross post of something I had posted there. Whomever you quoted, it was not me. I read the boards for every class I play as there is so much information spread accross them that applies to all.<br />
<br />
The only class board I even have an account on is this one, I must say I'm starting to question starting this account given my apparent lack of a &quot;clue&quot;.<br />

<br />
<br />
How it impacts this community - I have email addresses and contacts with the people at SOE who can make changes for our class. <br />
<br />
What it did do, and I don't know if people are necessarily 100% happy about this, is make me less ANGRY at SOE, because I just don't see a faceless entity out to screw players. I have met the developers, I've seen how they love the game. Any problems or issues don't make me want to rant, they make me want to send a friendly email asking for help.<br />
<br />
SOE money didn't buy me but the friendships do make a difference. It won't stop me from fighting, but it will change the way I fight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I was there.  I can attest that Gloriana did nothing but bust her ass trying to get questions answered and issues addressed.  Heck, after Thursday night (first night in town for most of us) I didn't see her out on the town because she was at all the panels and conferences.  The next time I saw her was Sunday morning as I left the hotel.<br />
<br />
Saar does bring up a valid point though.  It is very difficult for someone to remain objective about a company that is picking up the tab.  If this was directed at someone else who was younger (meaning someone that was too young to understand the situation) it could very well be valid.  In this case it isn't.  I would never, EVER, question lady Gloriana's integrity.  She is an old school player that has done nothing but stand for the betterment of the shaman class over the years.  She does this voluntarily.  Furthermore, when the rest of us were off boozing on Bourbon St., she was doing what she could to address our issues.<br />
<br />
I still have to write an email to Sony explaining the way I was treated during the registration process.  I am currently holding back because Sony treated me exceptionally well at the FF (which I didn't attend and didn't register for, but had the option of going to free of charge).  Lady Gloriana, in my position, would have had the email typed up on the flight home and sent as soon as she got to an internet connection.  She is simply one of the most honest people I have ever met anonymously (we met at the FF in Seattle), and we shaman should be ecstatic to have her on our side.<br />
<br />
Now that that is out of the way, I can attest that Siilverain, Candyluu, Analorne, Savya, Sylva, and all the other women from our intrepid server more than held their own against the other servers in the, ahh, external features department... lady Gloriana definitely included :)<br />
<br />
Good luck and good hunting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has nothing to do with being ashamed.  I do not think anyone would pass up a free trip to talk about a game.  Why make it a secret though?  If Sony is paying your way, and you are then evangalising the &quot;new shaman love if we just do not cancel&quot; then yes, I would like to know.  In no way am I saying you should not accept their free lunch, just that you tell us.</div></div><hr />

Looks like from that thread Xalmat from the mage board and Chenier from the druid board have admitted as much.<br />
<br />
So many thoughts run through my head, first off would be why didnt they (SOE and/or those who had their way paid) announce this? Sounds like most who had their way paid for were keeping it under wraps.<br />
<br />
I find this trend disturbing.<br />
<br />
Saar<br />
<br />
<br />
Lots of disturbing trends in the world, this isnt one of them. :eek: <br />
<br />
I see this practice by SOE as nothing but upside, for everyone.<br />
<br />
Trying to see the big picture though, Saar does raise a valid point about objectivity and feedback but I see it as being irrelevant in this case and in this community. <br />
<br />
Effective and responsive community leaders SHOULD be compensated for their time (cheaper to finance annual or semi annual weekends than hire full time) and I hope SOE continues to engage community leaders in this particular fashion well into the future while WoW eats away at their fan base. :cool:</div></div><hr />

I was wrong to bring up the topic here as I now see no way to discuss it without causing disruption to the community here.<br />
<br />
Taking the advice supplied a few posts up I withdraw from any further discussions on this board.<br />
<br />
Again I apologize for any misunderstanding, nothing was implied nor intended beyond what was stated.<br />

Saar<br />
<br />
Saar am i reading you right. That if sony hadnt spent money on this fan faire for the reps to come that they would of spent it in the &quot;right&quot; places in game? <br />
<br />
I could maybe see that if this were a new company. But we've been clamoring for more talk and feedback with and from soe for years. I think this is actually money spent in the right place. Not to mention soe isnt a broke company they have the money to spend in the right places they just need to choose to do so. <br />
<br />
If you want to respond to me can do so in PM if you want Saar. Not trying to bait you back into responding in this thread. I dont think you meant any harm to any of the reps who went themselves.</div></div><hr />

Just curious, if you don't read/post here and you don't read/post on the SOE shaman boards (which I keep up with, but don't post much), how would you like to be consulted? In person shaman by shaman poll of every shaman in game?<br />
<br />
I generally consider any polling here to be a cross section of shaman in game. I consider myself the representative of the shaman here because I don't pursue my own agenda when talking to devs, I bring a print out of posts from this board and use that as a guideline.</div></div><hr />

Well they have reps for all the classs boards that are most highly used. Some classes have more than one board and i think they tried to get a rep from each place. If you arent posting on a board or some place where alot of eq traffic happens how do you suggest you'd be represented?<br />
<br />
Glori and Grim seem pretty straight forward about what they are doing and seem to be busy in the name of shaman. So what is your complaint? Did you happen to do some research on them and their posts before the small complaint?<br />
<br />
Or is it their new company cars you see them in thats upsetting? The power to reprogram the game? the high pay? the thankless job?<br />
<br />
Sorry sarcasm sneaking out. Just seen this complaint on a few boards now and i wonder what people want.</div></div><hr />

Good points. Perhaps an email to all players? As I said, its a small problem. Just rubbed me the wrong way. Im a shaman, I play, why don't I get a free trip?<br />

SoE has very frequently paid for various press / community leaders to go to fan faires or other events, this is nothing new.<br />
<br />
I personally think you should all be thankfull that Gloriana cares enough about the community to take her time and devote it to you all.<br />

PS.  Thank you gloriana for nabbing me over to your table to talk with rashere saturday night.  Was a good time all around, and we got a lot of good info and feedback from Rashere.</div></div><hr />

kradek its highly possible for a lvl 70 anything to be uninformed about the game. You seem to want to know who is representing you and why without the work but want people to take you at face value. <br />
<br />
<br />
I dont know who you are. You might be very informed. But i do know through the board who glori is and while i havent talked to her in person I am  comfortable with her representing me. <br />
<br />
See Glori and Grim and anyone else i am missing are doing stuff and arent just wearing a fancy rep tag. They got the trip paid for for a reason. God forbid they might of had some fun in NO too! If they were slacking and not doing their rep job I am 100% postive they would hear about it on the forums. People arent exactly shy about complaining on here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Setanta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">As long as Glori and the guys had fun I'm cool with it.

Does your company consult you before they appoint someone to supervise you?  <br />
<br />
EQ is not a democracy (remember &quot;you're in our world now&quot;?).  They are a business, with business decisions to make.  SOE is not trying to win a popularity contest (obviously) they are attempting to build a game that folks of all classes will pay to play.<br />
<br />
SOE went out into the community and picked the best they could find from the shaman community to provide them with information.  They did not consult us.  They did not need to consult us.<br />
<br />
They were not looking for &quot;a rep for us all&quot;, whey were looking for a knowledgeable shaman to consult.  In addition they were looking for  a community leader who could bring their message back to the rest of the community.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think we got lucky in their choice. They could have done far worse.<br />
<br />
While I am sure you are an excellent shaman with great ideas about what the class needs and who would be best to represent shamanhood to SOE; but if you don't read or write about them how is anyone to know?  If no one knows who you are, how would you influence the community?</div></div><hr />
