  My main character is Fedora.  She is a level 46, nearly 47 enchanter, who is really itchjing to go on any raids, or xp groups.  I am an oficer in United We Stand, which some of you may remember, used to be  adecent guild, however, many of our higher level players have moved on to larger guilds.  I feel I have an obligation to the lower members of my guild, as I have been friends with them for quite a while, and UWS helped me a lot when I was starting.<br />
<br />
  So I am not asking to join, not yet, at any rate.  I am asking to be in your thoughts, should you have need of an additional enchanter on a raid, or in general.<br />
<br />
  I know some members, and was watching the Kael raid yesterday.  I noted many wisdom casters, and lots of melees.  Earth, Water, and Wind were well represented, but Fire needed a bit of a boost, if only in numbers.  Feel free to send me a tell if you feel your Fire needs a boost, I'll come if I can.<br />
