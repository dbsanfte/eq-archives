If you have dogdog summoned can you still use spirit call?<br />
I am not sure If I will get that aa but am just curious about the effects.<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, what Val said.  The reason the game lets you do this ( I think ) is because you can not control your pets (no pet windows), they attack whats targeted, the only way to effectively control them after the origional mob dies is to get hit by the next one, if your dogs are still up that is.</div></div><hr />

I got spirit call a few days ago and its pretty fun ;)<br />
The only time I been bummed out is when the chanter mezzed the add I was 'spirit-calling' on, so my 3 little mongrels just stood theere for a minute sniffing each other's bottom's. <br />
<br />
Solution -- kill all enchanters Muhahahaha</div></div><hr />
