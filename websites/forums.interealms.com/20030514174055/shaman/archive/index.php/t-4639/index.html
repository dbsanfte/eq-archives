<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok guys, I am hearing that now that the resistances on pets has been changed, Lord Rak is now a Pain in the Butt to do.  It used to be that you could use fire pets which would not take damage from Rak's AE fire spell, now that fire pets are not immune to fire magic, they die, and quick.  So now, instead of a nice easy battle using a few mages from your guild with everyone else around to watch the show, you have a Queen of Chardok style, everyone is probably gonna die battle.  Does anyone have a new strat?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Fire pets resist vs fire was not changed...   Fire pets will always be immune to fire.<br />
<br />
If you want to test it out (without risking the tear).  Just attack him without turning in the tear.  He still cast the same spells.  Just you will have to wait for the respawn of his reaver again, which isn't such a bad thing.... unless you get that 67+ string of black reavers.<br />
<br />
Oh, if they aren't resistant to fire anymore...sorry :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aabubu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well i finally got round to finishing epic a few days ago(lvl 60 without epic was getting embarrasing so thought i better finish it) :D  and i can safely say that resists are fine, pets still resist the ae fire and is still an easy target with a couple of clrs and fire pets</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One word - manaburn. It's over kill for rak and removes the fun of the fight but if you must :)<br />
<br />
We did a AE queen raid :) She lasted about 2 seconds from contact.. her guards died a a few secs later with AE..<br />
<br />
It's good to see that fire pets are still immune - a 2000dmg AE is harder than some nTov mob's AE .. just his melee damage is much lower :)<br />
<br />
I would ensure that your mages are using their highest level mage pet... I as the only one healing mage pets on some of the rak encounters I have done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kehlen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From my limited Rak experience (my raid and one other) and discussion with mages, they will tend to use their 49 fire pet.  The higher level ones cast more often instead of tanking and Rak resists them.<br />
<br />
For my fight I had 2 60 level mages they both summoned 49 fire pets.  Had one cleric each of the pets.  One pet died when Rak got forced into the hallway and aggro'd some goos, they killed the pet while the cleric got a you can't see your target message.  Mage got another pet up and Rak died quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can confirm that fire pets still work just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fire pets still work fine in the Rak'Ashiir battle.  I just did it a few days ago for my epic.<br />
<br />
Make sure the mages are NOT fire resist buff.  That may make a difference, as I insisted the 3 mages I had there remove all fire buffs for the battle.<br />
<br />
I died, although I could have lived.  Just chose to keep things simple.  One of the clerics supposedly healing the pets rezzed me (thank you Ashlynn), and by the time I had reloaded my spells, Rak was dead.  Pets were fine =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">60 cleric / 60 warrior with 6khp+ can duo him pretty nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the pets work fine but they are no longer totally immune, in my fight (920) the non-aggro pet took limited AoE damage, but nothing the attending cleric could not cope with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Korlace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In my rak fights (did it 3 times for 3 shamen, me included), what I noticed is that the LOWER level mages had more luck keeping pets up (regardless of the FR of the caster, tried this with 27FR, 100FR, 150FR).<br />
<br />
Lvl 60 and 61 mages had to constantly recast their pets, while a lvl 52 mage with so so resists and not a single notable piece of equipment managed to keep his pet up for the entire fight, even as random fools grabbed aggro, were summoned and died.  Out of 3 groups on one particular (sucessful) attempt, we had 3 clerics, 4 shamen, 3 druids, (for healing) and 2 mages.  The lvl 60 mage had bad lag, grabbed aggro and died while rak had about 60% health left, and prior to reaching that point had to recast his lvl 52 pet 3 times.  The lvl 52 mage only cast one pet the whole fight (melees rushed rak when he was at 20%).  Overall, my last rak fight was ugly, but if i had to do it again, I'ld grab a lower level mage in a heartbeat, having seen 3 fights, and each time the lower level mage seemed to keep his pet up much more easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just finished my epic, and my Rak fight was MUCH easier than I expected. We had no mages, so no fire petc. We had a level 60 war standing in front of Rak and keeping agro, an then the rest of the melees behind him. As Raks AE only hits poeple in front of him it was only the tank who got hit, and with some fire resist buffs we had no problems keeping him alive.  I handed in the tear, Rak agroed me and I was git by his AE and threw a few sup heals on myself. Had no problems keeping myself alive. Thereafter i threw some heals on the tank, he never came below 40%hp. After 1 min. or so Rak went down, we had a few dead rangers, but hey, rangers always die :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Moved this thread from the hunting grounds area to the Quests/Special Items Forum.  Good info, just alot harder to find unless its here.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Artistikone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">His AE goes off every 30 seconds, and is AE meaning hits melee's behind him(from logs). He has 26k hp, did him 2 days ago, I tanked(61 war 5khp) had a 61 rogue,58 Paly (AE heal is nice for this), and a 62 bard. With bard song, I had 300+ FR and only resisted 2 of his 5 AE's. Had 2 clerics and turn in shaman for heals. Lasted about 3 minutes. Only thing that landed on him was Paly epic.</div></div><hr />
