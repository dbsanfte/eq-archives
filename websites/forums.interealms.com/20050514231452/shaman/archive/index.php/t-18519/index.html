<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok you're Soe, you are releasing a new server. What restrictions and ruleset would you put on that server? What kind of perks would you put on it? Something suggested by someone(lol specific) of project M being implemented on the fallen server whereby people could play npcs. This is an example of an interesting idea, although possibly bad in terms of implementing it for the fallen server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Old world only, no LoY, 50 level cap<br />
<br />
Trolls own Grobb<br />
<br />
All the old dungeons in play<br />
<br />
All the old drops dropping<br />
<br />
Add Kunark at the approx time that it came out.<br />
<br />
No NO DROP<br />
No Required PvP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Call me old-fashioned, but Wazbuk's idea has appeal for me. <br />
<br />
What is the rule set?  Are Monks still nerfed? Necros still gods? (ok some things don't change much)</div></div><hr />

Always wanted to play one of those story book Hill Giants in the Rathes  :D . Wonder what a level 1 HG would hit for though???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">In answer to my post, going to brainstorm a few ideas;<br />
Double (Or triple) the exp.<br />
All expansions but Luclin, Pop and Ldon. Maybe exception of keeping nexus/bazaar, Shadowhaven in.(also possibiliy of locking zones till certain % of server reaches x level)<br />
Wizzies can port to all newbie hunting grounds at level 10. Druids port to outside where dungeons are. <br />
All items are put on a common loot table. And also made as a random loot in a zone its in.<br />
10 x the exp given for quests, with restriction of only being able to do a quest once. <br />
Pvp, groups only in arenas. Maybe with some perk to pvp.<br />
Items with charges, Lore, with maybe scaled by level. Put these on places where there are &quot;camps&quot;.<br />
For example, an orc camp instead of a random snake in the zone. (examples of nukes, gate, invis, bind, procs, charms as effects)<br />
Maybe a class regulating balance, ie you join server depending on balance of all other classes will determine what classes you can choose.<br />
Buffing uses no mana to reduce downtime.<br />
Duration on buffs increases on focus items by 25%, 50% and  75%. With the drops of focus items being in dungeons.(Maybe openings too when they come in)<br />
Rogues, Wizards, Clerics crit from lvl 11.<br />
No ability to shout.<br />
Trivial loot code apart from mobs where they drop tradeskill items.<br />
Tradeskill items drop common.<br />
A tradeskill npc per city who gives tradeskill containers out free, and somehow guides in tradeskills.<br />
At night, half the mobs turn undead in newbie hunting zones.<br />
Coffins free to buy.<br />
Merchants don't sell food/water. You get 20 intial food/water. After that you can buy from other players. Or you can make your own.<br />
All items droppable.<br />
Lvl 50 cap intially.<br />
When a certain percentage of the server are lvl 45, then zones opened up. <br />
Ability to leave messages offline on this server to people to reinforce community.<br />
Casino opened up every Saturday/Sunday with 25pp bets, possibility of gem rewards, spells, opening scrolls and charms scaled from hp(10-100), basic resists, stat ones, and maybe rare ones with see invis, lev and Eb, <br />
Key parts made common drops.<br />
Maybe make server last 3 months before reset also.<br />
Also possibly no guilds. Or put in a random guild when you start a character or a server based channel again to reinforce community and regulate guilds. <br />
Snare/Slow maxed at 2 min duration.<br />
One char per account. <br />
Would want a way of crippling 2 botters, but don't there is a way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">-No racial experience penalties.<br />
-Old world, Kunark, Velious, LDoN expansions enabled.  Getting to Kunark, Velious will require sufficient level and the completion of a quest or two<br />
-No drop items are restricted to epics and some quested items.<br />
-Porter NPC's located in cities that have INT caster guilds, will port for money if you have sufficient faction with them.  Not every guild will port to every location, ie Erudites wont port to Nektulos, but Queynos might, for a high price.  NPC's at DL spire will port to NK only, and vice versa.<br />
-Horses can be rented from cities, but must be returned there<br />
-PVP is enabled on the server, but can only be activated by a donation to a mercenary guild in towns (Rogue maybe).  The intended target is informed that someone has taken a contract out on him when he/she enters a city with a Mercenary guild.  For a donation to the Merc guild the PC can find out more about who it was that wants to kill them.  For a small donation, they might be told race and possibly class.  For a larger donation they might be told a name. Answers would be faction dependant<br />
-Introduction of better tradeskill items such that items produced bycrat masters (200+ skill) would be better than most dropped items, but possibly harder to produce.  (could involve multiple compnents that need to be imbued by certain NPC's in certain towns/zones that might require subquests in themselves)<br />
<br />
Im sure I'll think of more later, but thats all I could come up with while coffee is brewing.</div></div><hr />
