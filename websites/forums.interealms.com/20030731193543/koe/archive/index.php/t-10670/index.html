DO NOT.<br />
Eat at a reasturant called Amigo's Its a horribly ran establishment. The vegitarian stuff ISNT EVEN VEGETARIAN! The current managers are on the clock drunk. the food is made like crap and the people are just plain disguesting. Sadly I worked there for a while, It was horrible but was in middle of moving etc and tried to make due. Tonight me and my RL brother was finnally fed up and walked out leaving a drunk manager as the only one to cook in the middle of a HUGE rush.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to post this warning. I know a couple people from keepers live around this area and I know alot of ppl live around here that play EQ</div></div><hr />
