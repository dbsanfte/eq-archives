<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>umpaa_the_prophet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used to be able to two box just fine with my old school PC prior to the DX9 patch. Post Dx9 patch I could still do 2 box but it was a little more laggy and I found that upon zoning to many times that I needed to log out and in to cut down on the lag.<br />
<br />
As of a couple patches ago my second session (the one that enters world last) is so lagged out that it is unplayable even when I f9 to the above view(looking down on my toon). I've cut down the clip plan, turned off the sky, turned off all models, and turned off spell effects; everything I can think of and I can no longer get it working.<br />
<br />
I thought I could do some research at eqwindows.com on their message board but, alas, the site is gone. Does anyone have any suggestions or resources that I could go to and get some help? I can't exactly PL my own toons with my Shaman if I can't 2 box.<br />
<br />
Any help or suggestion would be appreciated. I'm considering stopping billing if I can't figure out a way to get 2 toons going at once again.<br />
<br />
Thanks Cruciblites,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use 2 EQ Directories, and 2 instances of EQW (1 for each account).<br />
<br />
That works pretty well for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">copy your eq folder to a new location, so you have 2 full instals.<br />
instal eqw to both,<br />
enjoy. you will still lag like hell in some zones but most exp areas will be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>umpaa_the_prophet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the advice. I have always run 2 copies of EQw and had 2 folders for EQ. I'm pretty good about reading up on stuff, at least when the eqw message board was still up, and solving my own problems. I read about eqplaynice and started using that but it didn't seem to help at all (I stopped using it).<br />
<br />
The wierd thing is that I don't really hear anyone else complaining about these problems. I wonder if I've got something evil on my machine now. I can run one session with mid range settings just fine with only occasional lag but the second session just lags to a stop (like 1 fp 10 secs). Sometimes when I can move the second toon around at like 2 fps I zone with it and then it works and the other lags out.<br />
<br />
It's driving me crazy as hell.<br />

Thanks again,<br />

Well, I don't know how to fix it, but just wanted to let you know that you're not alone.  A couple of my guildmates are complaining of exactly the same problem.  2-boxing is such a habit for them, they're becoming really annoying whiners when they can only play one char at a time  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm having similar issues.  The really odd thing is my 2.6 ghz computer with 512 ram and win xp runs 2 instances of EQ much worse than my girlfriends 800 mhz, 512 ram, win 98 machine.  It isn't unplayable but its pretty bad.  Also, it seems like the instance I switch to less often goes ld quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was having the exact same problem.  The Sony boards have a fix for it.  I added a few lines to my eqclient.ini file, per Sony's direction there, and all is now better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've not had any major issues. Zoning can be very slow and sometimes I get kicked to login screen or server screen whilst zoning, but otherwise working fine.<br />
<br />
I run off one install, one directory, old models, no spell effects, 1.4GHz Athlon and 512Mb Ram - so far from an ideal setup. Graphics card is Geforce 4 Ti 4200 (128Mb), latest drivers.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I've got a guildy that can't get EQW working at all for him since the DX9 patch (and yes, he's using the new version) so it does seem there are some problems.<br />
<br />
@BlargX - can you post a link perhaps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I also 2 box on one PC using EQW.  I have spell effects and new models on both , but sound turned off one. My spec is AMD 2100 1GB ram ATI 9700 Pro.<br />
<br />
I've altered the EQW.ini file for EQW to limit the amount of frames per second in the window in the backround. This always helps as there's no point in drawing stuff real fast if it's not going to be seen. I also tell it not to update and lessen the priority.<br />
<br />
[Foreground]<br />
Vsync=FALSE<br />
MaxFPS=60<br />
[Background]<br />
Vsync=FALSE<br />
MaxFPS=30<br />
Update=FALSE<br />
PriorityBoost=FALSE <br />
<br />
You may want to tone them down even further for your PC.<br />
<br />
The Vsync, while it's nice, will also have a hit on performance if you are getting graphical lag. Setting it to false means that you get jagged images when you turn but it's slightly faster than waiting for vsync.<br />
<br />
I also use EQ Play Nice (http://teqim.sourceforge.net/?p=eqplaynice) because it stops EQ hogging all the resources, and makes anything else run more smoothly, including a second copy of EQ. You need to update this after each patch so you may have to wait a day or so for it to become available after each patch.<br />
<br />
Another tip for you. Don't try and zone both chars at the same time even if one has already started to zone, wait for it to finish before you start the second, or you will end up waiting a whole lot longer and risk going LD with one of them. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My EQW.ini file. <br />
<br />
It gets created get created in the directory where you run EQW from. The [Foreground] and [Background] stuff doesn't get created by default. I put that in a while ago. I think when Luclin got released if memory serves me right. It was added by JustSomeDude to help people run multiple copies of EQW with the new graphics. It's been a while since I did it but I'm pretty sure they still work as the vysnc is definately not synced on my PC when I spin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Part of the problem is that EQ will gobble up as many hardware resources as you can throw at it, and when you run 2 instances, one of them inevitably gobbles up the lion's share.  There are a few utilities out there that will help by capping the FPS, RAM, and CPU time for each instance, but the only one I can think of I ain't gonna mention here, b/c its also used to do bad things.</div></div><hr />

It works now. I went ahead and added all the lines even though the post itself says to add them one at a time (kinda low on paticence at this point).<br />

Back to 2 boxing. Now if I could just figure out why my UI doesn't work anymore =p<br />
