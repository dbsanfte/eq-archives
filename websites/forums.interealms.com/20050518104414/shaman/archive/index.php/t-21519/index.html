<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, this may sound strange coming from me--especially since I've been a pretty obvious proponent of the &quot;shaman are fricking broken!  fix us already!&quot; group--but damn, I've just been having fun lately (yes, in EQ!).<br />
<br />
Maybe we're all suffering a bit of burn out.  The tired old &quot;been there, done that, got the T-shirt&quot; syndrome.  I know we're still broken.  I know we desperately still need rebalancing at the GoD+ level.<br />
<br />
Still, I'm suddenly having fun again.  Hopefully you guys will, too!<br />
<br />
In a fit of macabre masochism, I started the breakdown in communications quest.  It's a traditional SoE epic quest--tons of rare drops, mindless camping, repetive camps, but damn if I'm not enjoying it.  I'm having to do sewers, vexd, and tipt again, in addition to most of the lower level zones in GoD, but I can help guildmates camp spells while doing it.  It's something that is going to require a guild to complete, of course, but still.<br />
<br />
Raid wise, we're playing around in uqua.  We still have some back-flagging to do for Ikkinz Raid Trial 4 to get the whole guild flagged, but we're aiming to stay mostly in uqua with the occasional 1 day Time raid to keep fleshing out the equipment of our newer folks.  Uqua is annoyingly hard as others have described--one or two accidental deaths can basically wipe a raid (each person that dies spawns another mob).<br />
<br />
So what is up?  In the words of Arnold, &quot;it's not a tumah!  It's not a tumah at all.&quot;  I'm just having fun again for a change.<br />
<br />
So tonight, if you log in, go do something fun!  Take a cleric buddy and see if you can train every mob in Umbral to the zone in!  Go find that annoying buff beggar and give him the Inner Fire he so richly deserves.  (Hit your guild leader with it too.  That's always entertaining!).  If you're unguilded, go find one!  If you find the right one, it can completely change the character of the game for you--in a good way.  It's just nice to log into a bunch of friends and go hang out.  Plus, you can't imagine how much better you will get as you learn each other's strengths and weaknesses.  You'll pull off stunts you wouldn't believe!  Go solo something nasty for the heck of it!<br />
<br />
Tonight's mission, should you choose to accept it, is to go have fun!<br />
<br />
Today's upbeat message coming at ya from the leezard!<br />
<br />
Best wishes,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The shamans in my guild have started a game on raids. We pick a tank and if he dies then when we rebuff him we give him things like Inner Fire, level 9 stat buffs, HoS,  See Invis, EB if not in PoW. We each pick a buff to cast. If the tank says W T F  and then names your buff you win the game.  Its great  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Potionpusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LOL -- That's great!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been working on Breakdown in Communications quest as well.<br />
I'm actually liking it.<br />
It's freaking long, and I'm pissed that 2x now the Kyv boss hasn't dropped my powersource, but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, I was duped by a cleric friend into starting the breakdown in communication quest, done a few bit in qinimi (the trial thing) and barindu raid thing with the top guild on server and seem to have a bagful of crap in the bank from it so I guess I'm getting somewhere ;)<br />
<br />
My only gripe is that in all of this, and a load of vxed/tipt runs and complete clearing of ferubi raids (weaponmaster/packmaster/rondo etc) I have yet to see any shaman spells. Haven't been back since the spell drop patch tho ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh Asthore.  That does sound fun.  Maybe I should actually log in some time soon and join in, eh?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh Asthore.  That does sound fun.  Maybe I should actually log in some time soon and join in, eh?  :)<br />
<br />
Your missing all the fun  Fera, we are driving Toras nuts. Ras gets blamed for every buff no matter what while the rest of us tisk and say shame on you  :D  Hope your road trip went well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Atleast your trying man. I actualy logged into EQ last ngiht and got a freaking group in PoE, i couldnt believe it. I got 2 AA before the cleric had to leave and i had to do laundry.<br />
<br />
Was fun actualy. I been trying to get into this low end guild doing velious and SoL but moving fast with alot of old guildies, but when i ask about its like this.<br />
<br />
/tell dude; hey you still recruiting, you need a 65 shaman?<br />
<br />
/dude tells youl;  **** LITGRUV, hell yea dude, im in a raid on vindi right now, but definetly.<br />
<br />
/you tell dude; cool so where you guys at in progression and how much time you require from players.<br />
<br />
<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
/you tell dude;  hello anyone there?<br />
<br />
<br />
chasing a guild down that isnt in kunark content still is really hard, so in other words....<br />
<br />
Still no reason to restart billing and time is running out.</div></div><hr />
