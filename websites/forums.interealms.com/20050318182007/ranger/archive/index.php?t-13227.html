<br />
What I am looking for is confirmation that you can either<br />
<br />
A: train them 2 times per ding and ONLY 2 times.  So if you powergame to 65, then put points into advanced innate str.  Would you cap out at 2 points into advanced innate str?<br />
<br />
Or <br />
<br />
B: does the CAP you can raise them to raise 2 times per ding.  So thatif you power to 65 you can raise all 10 points in advanced innate str???<br />
<br />
Need this from the horses mouth, because I heard that A will be true from teh same people that said you will leave the planes and be back to lvl 60 =P.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khalysta</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The wording on many of the aa abilities is kinda bad.  Just go to level 65 and then buy the points like you did in the past.  The levels mentioned are just minimums and that is all.  You can go to level 65 and spend you points in Advanced strength if you wanted too.  I bought guardian of the forest 1 just fine at 65 even though the wording says the first level is at 61.  Its just like the old aa where you didnt have to buy regen1-3 at 51 you could buy them anytime at or after 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neclon</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what I suspected.  But is that worded as trained once per level or just worded as having a minimum.  I strongly suspect you can go to 65 and get them all then and do not need to train 2 points in every stat raise you want to get at 61, then 2 at 62.<br />
<br />
Of course all the testimonial we can get will help.  We've already dispelled the rumor that when you leave PoP you delevel to 60 and cannot youse your 61+ spells and abilities.  <br />
<br />
I'm looking to dispell a few more.  In addition to the &quot;have to train it while youre that level&quot; rumor this thread is meant to squash or confirm, I would like to address another.<br />
<br />
Difficulty of gaining AA points. While it seems rediculous to me that they would make it harder as you gained levles alot of people are just sure if you get 61-65 each aa point is harder to gain.  Has anyone actually seen this and measured it?<br />
<br />
Hunted mobs at 60 that gave 1 % aa per so many kils... gotten 65 and hunted the same mobs and seen less?  Actual experience would be appreciated, as opposed to speculation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neclon</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No one has gotten 65 and gone back to try and spend points on the per lvl advancements?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aluaden</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The max trainable points just raises, its not capped the way youre thinking.  At 65 you can train every skill from zero points to complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the harder at 65 thing is because alot of mobs that used to give exp will now be light blue or green (you can no longer sit in velks all day) and not that at 65 AA points actually require more exp to fill.   Just the difficulty of exp giving mobs increases.  <br />
<br />
But there may be some good zones in PoP with high level mobs to exp on, and most people agree level &gt; all.<br />
<br />
Itd be nice for some 65 people to post where they get AA and if it seems harder or easier then what they did back at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neclon</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, some feedback from 65s on this would be GREAT =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ashbys</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree<br />
higher level = Less exp per mob<br />
Less exp per mob = longer time to get aa exp<br />
Longer time to get AA exp = more game time <br />
More game time = happy sony<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Celt</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can level to 65 and train whatever you want, and so far there's no maximum to however many skills you want, Kraiven will soon reach 400 aa, and he' s not capped in any way.<br />
<br />
AA xp is exactly the same per kill as it always was, though in the first few days of the xpac it was somewhat bugged on different UI's in the way it was reported/recorded in the bar.  HOWEVER&lt; if mobs go light blue or green, you will NOT get the same xp as you did at 60.  <br />
<br />
I still reccomend you get to 65 as soon as possible, as the xp in the new xpac OBLITERATES anything in the old world, I can get 1 aa every 50 minutes in a full 6 man group with no gimping at all :P  They monty haul'ed the xp in the planes, everyone will soon have 400 aa and everything maxed if they work hard enough.  Already I have level 65 and all the important Planes of power AA's maxed for damage, and I also finished off Mass group buff if that's any indication, without gimping one iota, simply grouping trying to get spells to drop for the guild :)<br />
<br />
Get 65, explore the heck out of planes of power with your guild, get to higher tier planes and xp like madfolks and you won't have much to worry about.  The power gains with levels are MASSIVE compared to any aa you could possibly get other than archery mastery 3 and endless quiver.  Period.  HOwever, if you dont have them yet for some reason, I would still reccomend you pass your justice trial, and live in Wal-Mart (Valor) so you can cash in on falling prices of xp :P  The higher tier planes you get to, the MUCH MUCH MUCH better xp you get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ransom</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took myself from 62 back to 61 because I found that I was having trouble efficiently getting exp in PoP.  I can definetly tell that I get a lot more Exp per kill there, but I rarely have time to group so I just duo with my enchanter.  Even with slowing things in the planes it was very difficult dealing with mobs that hit for 400+ and some that hit for around 180 and were already light blue at 62.<br />
<br />
I was looking forward to leveling to 65 but I don't see how I can do it.  I have the feeling I'm making a mistake just not sure what else to do at the moment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lithledana</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guildmates have reported getting as much as 7 aa in a day with somewhat hard core XPing and 4 or 5 with more casual grouping at 65 in PoP zones.  IF you have the ability to get the flags to go to places like valor, honor and decay, deleveling to 60 for aa points is NOT the way to go.<br />
<br />
If you feel you are unlikely to get those flags anytime soon but still have some aa skills you want to get, *possibly* staying 60 is worthwhile.  Even then it might be better to level and xp in nightmare or disease, I have never XPed there so I can't tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Voronwë Nimbrethil</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it would be better to level to 61 no matter what than stay at 60.  the mainhand damage bonus is a substantial dps increase over the course of a level.<br />
<br />
if you are gonna be stuck in PoN, you can still get good xp doing the big spiders or hobgoblins, so i dont see any reason to keep yourself lower level.</div></div><hr />
