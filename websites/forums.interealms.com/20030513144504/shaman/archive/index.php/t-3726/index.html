<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any good ways to deal with adds while soloing in the early 40s? I can solo singles just fine but every time the corpse-to-be's little brother shows up i have to leave little Vabantik to die while i high-tail it for the zone line. I've tried root parking but that never seems to last long enough, especially if the first mob  leaves me without enough mana to up and whack the second one with zero downtime (as is usually the case).<br />
<br />
Is the answer that I'm just standing in the wrong place and really shouldn't hardly ever get adds to begin with? If that's it, then what do other shaman do when they want to grab a camp of two or three and have to split the spawns up that first time?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depending on the mobs you are fighting, and where you are fighting them, there are a couple of things you can do.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Slow the add and let it beat on you while you finish off the first mob<br />
 Slow the mob, then root park it.  Slow it first so when root breaks it will be easy for you to get it rerooted.<br />
 Flash of Light.  Blind the mob and then step back, it will run off.  It will come back after FoL wears off, so not usually recommended indoors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Several other techniques, these are just the ones that worked for me.  At that age, and ever since, I was using the slow/tank soloing method.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the fear necklaces out of paineel are also very nice for handling animal/undead adds (for those of us who worship cazic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just tend to slow and root park any adds I have.   Tossing dots on it while you wait might be a good idea - disease based ones since you probalby have the time for them to work.  But be wary of the DD component breaking root.  Since you're talking low 40s, you won't have the epic to use to soften it up while you wait.  <br />
<br />
As for breaking a camp - get to the absolute outer limit of casting a spell.  Use a low aggro radius spell - like Annul/Dispell magic.   Look into perhaps getting one of those Extended Range Focus items.  Make sure that you're on the outer most mob and that the mob you're pulling won't cross any of the other mobs in camp.  If you can get into a position where the other mobs are not looking at you and your pull won't cross their line of sight, try that too.<br />
<br />
With the removal of the Moving Target DoT Damage modifer, you can dot it and kite it around a bit as well.   If you need recovery time after the first kill, make sure to call the dog off and you and him move far far far away.  Make sure you can still see the sucker, but sit and rest.  When you hear root break, reroot when it gets in range and move back again.<br />
<br />
If you're regularly still unable to single pull from a camp, look into damage shield potions, rooting the mobs on top of each other and AoE rain while you DoT and Dog them to death.  Though I dont' think the AoE rain is mana efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One mob shouldn't be causing you to go oom.  What mobs are you fighting? <br />
<br />
One of the shaman's main strengths is our versatility.  I am assuming you are slow tanking the mob with pet nibbling at its heals?  If this is the case perhaps this isnt the right place for that.<br />
<br />
I would suggest the following:<br />
<br />
Pull mob with slow knowing you are going to get an add.  If 44 immediately toss on VoS and Scourge that is a total of 800dmg plus your pet. The mob will be on you with pet fighting it...your ac should be enough to take a few hits from the mob. <br />
<br />
Now slow the add and immediately toss the same dots on him then root (do not root then toss on dots as you are just wasting the mana for root imo). <br />
<br />
Pull back leaving the rooted mob rotting and get enough distance so it doesn't hit you. YOu should still have more than enough aggro on first mob for him to follow you with pet still nibbling.<br />
<br />
Now go ahead and toe to toe with him..knowing that if things start looking bad you can always pet kite him a bit...you will still have sufficient aggro to avoid having him stop to pound your pet (2 dots and slow takes care of that). Just run large circles (only if you need to..ie health low) around the rooted one and reroot that one as necessary.<br />
<br />
When the first mob is dead you have an add that should be at 1/3 to 1/2 health.<br />
<br />
I suggest using your regen spell at all times as well as some form of regen armor...Iksar Ceremonial works well. You get down on health...you are still getting 15hp per tick pet kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The way I usually solo is to pull with a slow, run to a safe spot, stop, send pet, and then dot, turning on autoattack-- the mob will break off the pet and come attack you.  Reason why I do it this way is I like to keep all my melee skills up and playing with my 2hbs is really fun and makes it a lot easier-- otherwise I'd probably be pet kiting.<br />
<br />
What I usually do with an add is I dot it (optional), ENSTILL it, and move away a good distance from it.  Continue to melee the original mob and keep pushing pet back off and pet kill til your pet breaks off of the add and comes after the original mob (helps if your pet is sowed).<br />
<br />
I've found Enstill to be a lot more effective than root...  I now keep Enstill up all the time and have root in the back of my spellbook.<br />
<br />
... or, do what some other people said already, and pet kite.  Sometimes this doesn't work out, especially if the original mob stops to finish off your pet or if your pet is attacking the add (if that's the case, keep backing off the pet and telling it to kill the original).<br />
<br />
The only reason why I never slow then root is because I feel like it's a waste of mana when the mob is just sitting there enstilled and slowed...<br />
<br />
This strategy works fine for me at 42 in Overthere/Eastern Wastes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For me, when solo'ing two mobs, the key is to break it up into two one-mob fights, then pet kite the second one. If I'm fighting one mob and get an add... I'll dot the new mob (the first is already slowed and dot'd), then lead it away from the other. The first one will usually turn on my pet. If not, root it and then lead the 2nd one away.  Root the 2nd one outside melee range of the first, and go back and finish off the first one. You might or might not want to slow the 2nd one, depending on how hard it hits and how much mana you have. <br />
<br />
Then go finish off the first one. Med if root is still holding. The dot(s) you put on the add should have it good and mad at you, so that it's easy, when it breaks root, to pet kite it around. The advantage of this strategy is that it takes minimal hp and mana to kill off the second one. It's slow, and if you have good mana you can dot/nuke/whatever it more to kill it faster, but this can work when you just don't have enough juice to handle that second or third add in a series of fights the normal way. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">this may be just me, but i slow EVERYTHING.<br />
whenever adds show up i find it easier to root the primary target, and slow the add...which usually brings it right to me, where i can root/rot it at my leisure while puppy plays with the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Odaku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I find it that there is no reason to slow a mob your &quot;kiting&quot;.  I find it best to just turn the pet's taunt off and let him nip the tail of your original target, then as add's appear just Enstill the thing.  Here's a little tip to gain that time advantage with which to cast any spell while, kite all mobs following you first UP a hill and then DOWN a hill.  You will gain a big distance between you and them, thus enabling you to get off Enstill, or Slow if you like wasting mana to kite.  Slow IMHO is only good when you and pet plan to straight melee a target.</div></div><hr />
