<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tevash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wondering about drop rates in Old Sebilis...List of Mobs:<br />
<br />
Emperor Chottal - Killed this guy countless times...has dropped one malo and almost every 60 kunark spell other than torpor..can someone verify he will even drop it?<br />
<br />
Sebilite Protector - Seen him drop torpor twice..but was never able to get it sadly...anyone know if he drops it commonly? seems like it...<br />
<br />
Tolapumj - Never killed him..any info would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Sebilite Juggarnaughts - Still sketchy to believe they will drop torpor...and if so must be really rare...<br />
<br />
Trakanon - im unguilded..so put what want for him.<br />
<br />
Did i forget anything? Ive been living in the crypt far too long...get me out of sebilis ^_^...hehe any info would be most appreciated..im sure im not the only shaman thats frustrated with getting spells, but starting to lose interest in my shaman not having torpor =/<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The mob most likely to drop it from your list, in my experience has been Jumpy. Your mileage may vary. <br />
<br />
Trak doesnt drop spells so don't worry about him taunting you.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rates are rare, I have personally only seen torpor drop off of a guardian wurm in skyfire. However, in the last month it I have heard through personal contacts it dropped off of the emperor in the crypt. We tried to get a copy of it from the guy who won one copy in the crypt and he agreed to sell it for 10k. Of course by the time he got to the bank he decided to raise his price and the Shaman we were trying to get it for told him to stuff it for being a greedy bastard.<br />
Never seen it drop any other place in Sebilis. So rare as hell I guess is the best way I can put it.</div></div><hr />

heheh - My wife is in Farstorm.  That happened a few days before I acquired Torpor, and knowing how anxious I was to add that to my arsenal, she was quick to taunt me with that drop when she saw it come up in /gu...  My wife is evil, which is her best feature of course ;-)<br />

Tevash, just keep at it since it's largely just a matter patience.  Along the way, work towards building a large nest egg to purchase those spells that you lack.  I ended up looting about half of my rare spells and buying the others.  I'm still missing pox though - I refuse to pay money for it...<br />
<br />
The Sebilite Protector, Tolapumj and Chottal are the mobs most likely to drop torpor, but there are reports of it dropping from rare 58th lvl juggernaut spawns.  You'll drive yourself nuts waiting for a jugg to drop it though... 1 in 20 are the right level &amp; then 1 in ??? (100?) might drop torpor.  Kill them to get other spells that you can sell for funds to buy your spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pox I recieved in Skyfire off of a Guardian Wurm.  Yes, I tanked this for the group and it was the most INSANE feeling of my life.. of course most of my messages were:<br />
<br />
DL on Luna<br />

Hehe.. sorry highlight of my EQ career there... monk felt it was better if I died during this than her (as once a dot is on, it's on)<br />

(stuck every dot from 39 up on this sucker..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have killed loads of juggs. Protector and jumpy many times. Trak a few. Never killed the emperor.<br />
<br />
The count:<br />
trak - no 59/60 shaman spells<br />
Juggs - no 59/60 shaman spells<br />
Prot - no 59/60 shaman spells<br />
Jumpy - Torpor <br />
<br />
Torpor is just rare as hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">emp chottal drops a good spell about every 20 hours of farming. good being 59 necro pet, lure of ice, sunstrike, malo, or torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think people are lying that it drops off of Jumpy/Prot/Juggs.  Spent weeks in there with my crew.  We set up camp in the Lair and would get 3 Prot/ Jumpy kills a night and countless Juggs pulled back to us.  ***Run 3 on your puller is the greatest thing ever in a dungeon***<br />
<br />
We could have made at least 3 full books of 50-60 Mage spells.  We would walk out with our bags filled with every useless spell there was and not one spell any of us needed.  60 sham missing malo (Me), 60 Necro missing quite a few spells 55-60, 58 Wiz missing most 58-60.  After all this time killing those fools I'm tired of it.  I'm just hoping a friend, that wont rape me on the price, will stumble across malo....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>pudger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Killed Emperor a lot and only shaman spell seen him drop are Voice of the Berserker 2x and Avatar 1x<br />
<br />
Killed Juggs until blue in the face never seen malo or torpor drop<br />
<br />
Guardian Wurms seen them drop torpor 1x in 30 kills <br />
<br />
VP seen malo 2x drop in 3 hours, seen a lot spells that mages and wizards were going nuts for.  Spells was dropping off common wurms and drakes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My copy of Torpor is off Tolapumj<br />
<br />
A 56 shaman friend of mine has had 2 copies of Malo drop off Emporer Chottal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Had Malo (Went to the 52 Shaman) and I WANT to say Pox or Bane (too long ago to remember) drop off of Emperor. This in about 30 different Emperor kills spread out over a few months.<br />
<br />
Like the idea of setting up a Jumpy / Prot / Jug Cycle.</div></div><hr />
