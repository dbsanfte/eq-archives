<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azis44</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First, I would like to say hello to everyone reading this. I will explain a little bit about myself. I've been playing EQ on and off since 2000. I've always had lots of trouble sticking to one class. I've recently decided to come back, and am looking for a really well class to solo/sometimes duo. I've played a wizard to 54, and a monk to 46.. and out of both of those, Its never really be.. great at soloing(expect prenerf monk, thats when I played him. :P ). Now, my main question is, I've always heard that shamans can solo incredibly well, but I don't know for sure. Is there anyone out there that can enlighten me on this? I would be much thankfull!</div></div><hr />

Shamans in WoW are nice.  Don't join the sinking ship of EQ. ;)  But anyway, shamans can solo well at all levels, but group will net you more xp if your group doesn't suck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Necromancers are probably still considered the best solo class.  FD, Rez, higher dps, better active mana regen, etc..<br />
<br />
Shaman have one distinct advantage (for the average geared character) and thats the ability to tank moderate summoning mobs.  Until a necromancer gets to the upper ends of gear, his lifetaps will not keep up with a summoning mob.  At that point, shaman shine as solo'ers.  Slow+hot+dots++dog = good solo ability.  <br />
<br />
If solo'ing is truly your main interest, I'd still vote necro though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">First I find it difficult to fathom considering a monk better at soloing than a wizard. Wizards are a great solo class after getting the aoe snare. Quad kiting is a wizard staple.<br />
<br />
As for shaman, they are great soloers as well as great assets to a group ... and duo.<br />
<br />
For pure soloing, necro is at the top of the list. They just get better as they level. While available mobs decrease, that is true (and more so - mostly) for all classes the higher level you get.<br />
<br />
Given what you said about finding it hard to stay with one class, I would suggest try them out. Don't jump on any one else's opinions about which class is best to solo with. Individuals find ways to do amazing things when they play the class they have the most fun with. Mages, enchanters, bards, druids, rangers, shadowknights, beastlords, paladins ... necros, shaman ... all the classes find ways to solo. Some do it better based on the inherent class abilities, but all can do it if the player knows how and enjoys playing that toon above all others. It is a game - find the toon that makes it fun for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you'll be able to solo up to lvl 70 as a shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grokii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I left EQ for 3 years, came back and started a wizard.  Got 'em up to 58 and also found it boring/lacking.  A buddy talked me into switching servers and I started a necro.  I liked it, but aggro kiting just got boring.  I then talked a mutal friend into starting EQ and wanted a class that could solo and group well with my friend.  I played shaman and haven't looked back in 63 levels now.<br />
<br />
Shamans can solo, slow, but steady.  But when you get 50+ it's real easy to get into a group as the slower.  Works even better when your duo partner is a tank, makes starting up groups dead easy.  Just find a druid/cleric to heal your tank and you're set.  When I hit 65 and get Q we should be able to just grab whatever dps is avaiable and I can keep him alive with Q.<br />
<br />
So, yes, shamans are a great choice.  But we're sorta a slow bloomer.  We don't get our first canni until 24, our first pet at 34, and our first Heal Over Time at 44.  If you stick with it until 44 and still don't like the shaman, then we're not for you.  But if you can stick with it all the way to 44, then the shaman is probably for you.<br />
<br />
Oh, make a friend with a magician, they also make fun duo partners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Necros are undoubtedly the kings of soloing. Shaman are very good soloers too, but necros definately rule the roost. Both necro and shaman can solo mobs that other classes cannot, but necros can kill faster and with less risk than shaman. Having said that...I'd rather be a shaman than a Necro...yes I would.</div></div><hr />
