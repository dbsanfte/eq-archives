<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is pointless, and purely just for fun, but then again, I'm easily amused. ;)<br />
<br />
The pet alterations they did during the patch weren't completely undone.  They put BL warders (particularly kitty BL tiger warders) back to normal size, but the trick they used to get them so gigantic (65 kitty BL's could make their warders the size of a small building) wasn't completely removed...and it works on dogdog.<br />
<br />
Simply put:  summon dog, and Grow him 3 times.<br />
<br />
The result:  a dog about the size of a large horse.  If you shrink yourself, you can stand completely underneath your pet.<br />
<br />
Though it has absolutely no impact in the game outside of serving as an obstruction for line of sight spells, it's kinda fun to super-size the dog and sic him on things, usually done while I sit outside an LDoN zone-in and wait for the group to set up for the crawl.<br />
<br />
Seeing a pet larger than a Desert Madman chewing on his head amuses me. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I can't shrink my dog since that patch :(.  I even went out of my way and bought Tiny Companion for the ungodly 50pp it cost in hopes that it would help out the chanters bitchin about too many pets in the way.  I can still shrink necro pets, havent grouped with many mages since then but I do need to try it).  I liked having my dog about the size of a spiderling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You know, the fact that I can't shrink Lil' Sparky anymore is really ticking me off.  I agree with the above poster in that I prefer to shrink my dog down to the size of a spiderling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, it defeats the whole point of shrinking down if the pets are gonna be larger than we are.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wouldn't be so bad, if we could atleast ride them like ponies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">just tried and it didnt work :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Have your chanter use NDT on the pet, then shrink it twice. Same for BL Warders, makes them into tiny little scarecrows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree that the lack of pet shrinkage is extremely annoying in dungeons where space is limited.  But the powers that be are very aware of the problem and they’ll decide to fix it when they decide to fix it and no sooner.  So, I’ve decided to have as much fun with it as I can.  I’ve been spending a lot time buffing newbies in different zones, like GFay and NK.  When I enter the zone I summon puppy, shrink myself and enlarge puppy to giant size.  Even sitting on my lizard, Pokey, my puppy is still drooling on my shoulder.  It’s a lot of fun.  I’m guessing that when the shrinking problem is fixed we will no longer be able to grow our pets that big so I’m making the most of it while I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the loss of pet shrinage sucks when you have an EQ/AM3 ranger in your dungeon group.  I hate hearing the poor guy complain about LoS almost as much as I enjoy moaning about the RNG effect on slow resists ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This isn't pointless at all, attack of the giant puppy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I noticed the other day that the tigers in stonebrunt are a little on the large size too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">screw the rangers..my friend played a ranger and i always would grow myself to giant size and purposely block LOS, and on special days i would grow the whole group to make it that much harder.<br />
<br />
Ever since we got the ability to grow our pets i've been growing it to max size whenever i have one up :)  It'll eventually be gone i'm sure; so i'm making the most of it~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The gorge hounds and dark stalkers in East Karana are huge as well.  The dark stalkers are even larger than my pet fully grown.  I bet they scare the pants off any true newbies that make it to that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmm grow blocks LoS on rangers. I think you've found a good PvP tactic :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmm grow blocks LoS on rangers. I think you've found a good PvP tactic :)<br />
<br />
um yeah..if you want to be the proverbial broad side of a barn...<br />
<br />
it blocks LOS because their arrows hit you and not the intended target, not just blocks LOS and hits nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Winteris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm still using my level 34 pet, but something I find infinitely amusing: <br />
<br />
When I use /pet guard here in my little spot in DSP, the pooch will watch/follow zelniaks as they walk by. I usually can't see them, so it's sort of a poor shaman's tracking. I'll med behind the dog and wait for him to spot something wandering around, then go tag it and bring it back to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, boy? What do you smell? Is it a zelniak? Is it, huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
/hugs dogdog<br />
<br />
Call me silly but that furball amuses me to no end. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You can track even better by typing /pet attack a zelniak.   Or any other name of a mob you're looking for.  (works great on the zeks, people always think I cheat)<br />
<br />
p.s.  Only works if they're within a certain range.</div></div><hr />
