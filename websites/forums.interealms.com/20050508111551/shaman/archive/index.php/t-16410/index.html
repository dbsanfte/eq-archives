<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't done a lot of LDoN dungeons yet, so I'm mostly asking what people's experiences with various themes are.<br />
<br />
I've tried 3 Mistmoore and 1 Rujarkian theme dungeon, all at &quot;normal&quot; level.<br />
<br />
The first Mistmoore one was &quot;kill 55 mobs in 90 minutes&quot; which a group of monk, rogue, shaman, druid, cleric, wizard did easily, with 40 minutes to spare. We explored a bit after that and found a miniboss to kill.<br />
<br />
The next two Mistmoore ones I did were Assassination ones. We had warrior, paladin, necro, shaman, cleric, bard, all 65, for the first and the paladin was replaced with a druid for the second. Both times we succeeded easily, with 40 minutes to spare the first time, and around 60 the second time, and used the extra time to go kill any minis that were up.<br />
<br />
For those who haven't done one, the assassination adventures involve killing 60% of the mobs in a dungeon, at which point the boss spawns. You get emotes every few minutes indicating in which direction he is, so a tracker isn't necessary (although desireable).<br />
<br />
Because we wanted to try something different (and I wanted to collect Rujarkian points too), we went to EC for a new challenge. Bear in mind that this was the same group that did a Mistmoore assassination in 30 minutes. We were assigned another assassination adventure, so we went for it.<br />
<br />
We found the Rujarkian adventure was *much* harder than the Mistmoore one. We were expecting to find things a little harder, simply because as a group we were well suited to undead and these were alive. However, the mobs hit harder, they had more HP, and seemed to be more resistant.<br />
<br />
They also had a larger agro range, and were more likely to come in big bunches (up to 8 at a time). We ended up having to pull with FD split or lull where previously we'd mostly pulled 2/3 and worked with them. We had several deaths in the process (due to a 6 pull), but were getting into the swing of things and getting used to it being harder.<br />
<br />
Whether or not we would have succeeded at that point is uncertain, for I crashed out and got bugged so I couldn't log my character back in for 30 minutes (crashed out repeatedly, until I figured a way around).<br />
<br />
We failed, but carried on for the lesser reward of beating it within the 30 extra minutes. We did this within about 10 minutes, so I believe that had I not been bugged we could have done it in the time, though it would have been close.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my point is this: even taking into account necro/cleric being suited to undead, etc, the Rujarkian adventure seemed to be at least twice as hard as an equivalent Mistmoore one with exactly the same group. Has anyone else had similar experiences?<br />
<br />
If this is typical, unless they tweak it somewhat, I can see people wanting to go to the easier themes, which will be unfortunate for those of us who need spells in the harder ones.</div></div><hr />

Haven't had much time yet, but from our limited experience, Miraguls seems on par or perhaps a little easier then the Mistmoore dungeons. We've completed 2 there (Miraguls), once with 15+ minutes left and the one last night with about 2 minutes left (5 in group, fairly low dps). Failed the only Mistmoore we tried (collection, last piece dropped on the very next mob). I think our Rogue LD'ed for a few minutes and it was basically the first time in for half the group. Neither areas seemed overly hard for a group in average gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Haven't done rujark, only mistmoore and lguk. I can say that lguk is definitely harder than mm. lguk had alot more resists (mez/slow) and more gating/CHing mobs. Also lguk terrain is alot more difficult to negotiate. You have water, pits, ramps, split levels, etc.<br />
<br />
So sounds to me that rujark &gt; lguk &gt; mm &gt; miragul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Weird, from my experience Rujark have been one of the easiest dungeon themes, very doable without any bard/enc on hard and a joke on normal. <br />
<br />
As long as you stay away from the collect mission in hard difficulity Rujark is rather easy with even non-optimal group setups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah only two so far<br />
<br />
Killing any 51 mobs in Guk was 4 times as hard as the Rujark kill 25 Orcs (of course there were those Goblin thingys and Wolves in the way) adventure. <br />
<br />
Guk is dark and hard to see even with Acumen.  More casters (CH and Debuffs) and multiple pulls.  Harder to get to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, I thought Rujackian was a lot easier than Mistmoore.  Mobs seemed to have fewer hit points, and in general it was just a lot easier for the same group.  <br />
<br />
That makes sense in a way, since they do have software that scales the &quot;instance&quot;.  So there might well be non-theme specific variation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suppose with your gear, normal would be a joke. Thats why they have hard mode, normal is for us little folk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My group last night did Mistmoore and Rujark: cleric, SK (my alt), ranger, necro, enchanter, rogue. Mistmoore was definitely harder with 2-4 per pull until necro could get things mezzed. Many resisted the enchanter's lull and my stat taps. I counted 3 DoTs on me at a time for many fights and decided to life tap my way thru them. The orc dungeon was a cake walk compared, more spaced out and was being hit by only 2 DoTs every 15 minutes with some goblins having damage sheilds. Some of those orcs were healers so that .5 second Spear spell was a life saver, but mostly no problem compared to the undead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">IMO, the most difficult to the easiest goes like this: Guk, MM, Takish, Miragul, Rujark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a petition to make... no more of the PoTime guilds blabbing about how these are a joke on norma.  Since PoTime Wiz can tank better than Warriors in SS/Ornate it's kinda not the same.  I agree with Rakji that the HARD setting is for you folks.<br />
<br />
Heh had an odd instance the last raid I was on.  It was normal setting and I was the only healer.  Group was:<br />
Sham (Me)<br />
Monk <br />
Rogue<br />
Wiz<br />
<br />
First mob I pulled in the room we popped into resisted, came up and wailed me for 690s.  Hrm... this was normal setting?  Mob wasnt named either.  No one there had taunt to get it off me.  Luckily the second slow landed... though mitigated.  Right now I'm going nuts on the Monk for selecting hard btw :)  He swears we didnt go into a hard setting and from then on out there were no problems.  hrm... *crickets*.... anyway it was odd.  has anyone else had what they think is a &quot;hard&quot; mob thrown into the easy dungeon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Haven't done that many missions yet but I haven't seen any mob ever mitigate slow including the named or the ones your going after in assasinate trips. I also don't recall seeing any of the regular stuff hitting for more than 300ish.<br />
<br />
So far I haven't really see any reason for anyone to do hard. You get 71 points vs 51 points so about 1/3 more but it's sure as heck alot more than 1/3 more difficult from what i'm hearing. Mobs hitting for double. Mitigating slow vs no mitigation. From what i've heard they are also more resistant with a fair bit more hps. Haven't heard of anything good enough from either augments or items dropping to warrent the effort for hard. You should easily be able to cruse threw normal missions if you have any chance in the hard ones. Failed my first adventure, collect 25 something or others, because 2 of us went ld for 15 minutes right before time ran out. Since then we seem to be averaging ~45 minutes to do the easy ones when we often have 75 or 90 minutes to do them.</div></div><hr />

Lol, same thing happened to me, but a little worse. We had a 60-65 6 person group with a 60 druid healer, and a 61 Pally tank, doing a Takish adventure where you kill 59 mobs. Entered the dungeon, and there was a mob by the door. Monk threw a shurkin, and there was 2 mobs, one right on top of the other. They ran over and started hitting for 898 so fast we dropped like flies. Not sure if this is a feature or a bug.<br />
<br />
Also not sure how the adventure level is adjusted for groups with different level members, but I think in the future I will stick to groups with most members at 65. I didn't see much difference between the mobs in this group or an all 65 group, and a 65 tank holds up much better than a 61 tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you pull the adventure with the youngest member do you get one suited to his level?<br />
  My first addventure was in MM and to assasinate someone.  Had to kill all the mobs between us and him because all the mobs see invis.  I hate to admit that we didn't get anywhere close to it, mostly because we had picked up 3 ppl I didn't know.  Next time I went in with my regular group, 61 warrior, 60 ranger, 61 shaman, 63 Pally, 60 cleric, and another 60 warrior, pulled another MM mission set to Normal.  In this one we had to collect 22 bone remains.  Seemed REALLY easy at first and all was going well until we got to the CHing and gating cleric (THAT BISH) she gated at 5% health and brought back about 20 more mobs, so we ran out of zone and back in, but we had lost precious time by then.  We laughed alot in there though, had a great time.  Our warrior said that the dungeons were like Las Vegas.  You never know what you are gonna get when you kick one of those bitten victims.  We had a blast.  I kicked one of them and he healed me, the shammy pet AND the mob, no one else in the group.  ROFL.<br />
  I really think Sony did a great job with this one, its packed with surprises and a learning curve for a change.<br />
  I do think that the 90 minutes is a bit short for us normal people, but I'm willing to look at it as a goal to work towards.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, same thing.  A 'feature' is a bug they dont intend to fix :D</div></div><hr />
