<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking to pick up some decent cheap upgrades for my Shaman, and clear some stuff from Timbo’s inventory that I just can’t bear to delete.  I included approx prices since I will try to buy/sell this stuff if I can’t find sellers/takers here – please let me know if my prices look about right.<br />
<br />
Seeking:<br />
<br />
2 Jaded Velium Rings (~250 plat each, maybe 400 for a pair?)<br />
2 Imbued Gold Ivory Earrings (about same price as above?)<br />
Chrysoberyl Talisman (~500?)<br />
Runed Mithril Bracer (~500?)<br />
<br />
Free to good home (price for sale in NFP):<br />
<br />
Sebilite Scale Gauntlets (200-250)<br />
Sentient Gauntlets (200-250)<br />
Braided Ivory Cords (300-350)<br />
<br />
FWIW, I’m also on the lookout for a Sarnak Battle Shield and/or a Square Helm for Timbo.  If you see either on /auction, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Many thanks,</div></div><hr />

I would be interested in the Sentient Gauntlets in nobody in Guild has need. I have a RL friend on the server that has a SK that would be thrilled. <br />
<br />
That is - if nobody in KoE is interested...   )<br />
<br />
Let me know....  thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are several things I'd like to buy from you.<br />
<br />
Runed mithril bracelet for my Shaman<br />
Sentient guantlets for my SK<br />
Braided ivory cords for my Druid<br />
2 Imbued golden ivory earring for my Shaman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sorry, I should've been more clear ;)<br />
<br />
The top list is stuff I'm looking to get for my Shaman - the bottom list is stuff I'm looking to give away.  So, I'd like to give the Sentient Gaunts to Bem's SK and the Braided Ivory Cords to his Druid.  I may have more Sentient stuff in the bank still, for Aziz' RL friend or Bem's SK, have to check.<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping me clean house!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DOH! I completely missed that seeking line. LOL. And I'll be happy to buy any of it and any Sentient stuff for my SK. I only have the helmet so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks Timbo for the guantlets and the braided cords. Very much appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aziz - I believe that I do have a 2nd pair of Sentient Gaunts.  Look me up in game.</div></div><hr />
