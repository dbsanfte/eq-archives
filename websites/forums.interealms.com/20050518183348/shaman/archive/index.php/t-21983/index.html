<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>frolan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not a Shaman question specifically (though it does involve my shaman).<br />
<br />
My gf is playing a High Elf Pally, and I'm working on a Barb Shaman.  I've noticed that she gains xp quite a bit faster than I do.  All of her and my experience was gained while grouped with each other, so the numbers are pretty controlled.  We both started at the same time and started gouping together in Paladul when we both were freshly dinged lvl 6.  Typically she will get 4-8% xp per kill (killing whites, yellows, and reds) while I will be getting 2-4% per kill.  Or more simply, by the time I dinged lvl 10, she was over half the way through lvl 10. <br />
<br />
I was under the impression that they took out the racial and class modifers except for the Iksar, Trolls, and Ogres and there weren't any class modifiers.  <br />
<br />
Am I wrong on this ,or does anybody have any input or hard numbers for any of this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Race modifiers still do exist for some races.<br />
<br />
From memory...<br />
<br />
+5%  Halflings<br />
-5%  Barbarians<br />
-15% Iksar<br />
-15% Trolls<br />
-20% Ogres<br />
<br />
The justification is that Iksar, Trolls, and Ogres offer greater stats, or other bonuses like regen, stunability, etc...   <br />
<br />
If it's worth it or not, is up to you.<br />
<br />
As far as I know , those are the only xp modifiers still in the game.</div></div><hr />

Ogres are 15% penalty, Iksar and Trolls are 20%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It was my understanding that large races (Ogres, Trolls, Barbs) had a 10% xp penalty, with the Ikky's and trolls having another 10-15% for regen.<br />
<br />
Whatever the penalty ratio, that's why.  Even Barbs get zapped a little xp wise, due to size penalty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ogres are 15% penalty, Iksar and Trolls are 20%<br />
<br />
Ah right, thank you, had those mixed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For some reason, I thought Vah Shir had a 5% penalty.  Otherwise, yes, the list is:<br />
<br />
Halflings +5% bonues<br />
Barbs -5% penalty<br />
Ogres -15% penalty<br />
Trolls -20% penalty<br />
Iksar -20% penalty<br />
<br />
and (maybe)<br />
Vah Shir -5% penalty<br />
<br />
(hopefully someone can confirm or deny on cats!  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Class bonuses still exist.  I think warriors get +10% and rogues get +5%, but I am probably not remembering that correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>frolan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Weeellll crap, I guess I'll go back to my Froglok shammy that I had levelled up to 21 before I quit a while back.  I was kinda wanting to stick with the shammy, but with the -5% xp, I imagine that the gap between our levels is only going to grow as we level up.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the input :)<br />
<br />
Hengorot...soon to be back to Frolan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I belive Vah'Shir do have a -5% .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kumtha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wondering somthing here. I have a Vah shir Shaman and Vah shir beastlord. The shaman is lvl65 and the beastlord is lvl 64. I dinged 65 with the shaman at the outer camp in PoV and was recieving 1% experience per kill at lvl 64. At lvl 64 with my beastlord it takes 2 or 3 mobs to get that same 1%. Is it a difference in class xp or a nerf in zone xp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I believe warriors and rogues might still have their bonuses.  When they removed the class based penalties, they felt bad about removing bonuses or something silly like that (never seemed to stop them before or after that).<br />
<br />
The exp penalty isn't huge, just an annoyance mostly.  Note that it does not affect AA experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">kinda off topic. trolls and iksars have the worst penalty  but get an inate regen, but since the patch that changed regen its been broken (as far as I know it still is). so trolls and iksars are getting 15% less exp for nothing anymore =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Balthag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The vah shir mod is +5% if memory serves.<br />
I remember it being higher than the Barbarian's -5%, but not 0%.</div></div><hr />
