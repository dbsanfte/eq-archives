<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Okuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was just having a conversation with my cousin who brought up his 2 level 65 characters.  It just spawned a question in my head.  Does anyone out there have all their character slots on one server full of 65 characters?  Ive heard a few people say they had 3 or 4 but never 8.  Im hard pressed to believe that no one has done it though.  Wonder how much an account like that would go for on Player Auctions lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">just a hypothesis, but average price for a 65 non critical overplayed toon class bout 200 - 300 bucks.  Multiply that times 8 bout 1600 - 2400 bucks, if they are all equipped, price drops if they arent, and price goes up if they are a &quot;needed&quot; class like ench, cleric, etc.  Also if they are fully time flagged price goes up again.<br />
<br />
So if you are talking just 8 level 65's and no flags, decent gear, not enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crystalflake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One of my friends has a brother that works on an oil rig most of the year, and his EQ account is shared by everyone on the rig, so, it's played pretty much 24/7. (not much to do on an oil rig!) Last I heard, they had level 65 characters in all slots on over half the servers..their goal is to fill every slot on every server, and frankly, I believe they'll manage it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sharing an EQ account?  That's against the EULA!  No one would ever do that ;-)</div></div><hr />

Im not too concerned about the price as it was merely a curiosity but if you think about it... When LoY came out, the first frog to 65 was a cleric WITH EPIC in ~3 days /played if I remember correctly.  He was PLed simply by a single necro from what I read.  If you did that with 8 characters and sold them regularly at your minimum of $1600 youd be making $24.3k/year.  $36.5k/year at $2400.  It would be possible to go even faster with more people PLing you and/or multiple accounts being PLed at the same time.  Not bad for playing a video game heh.  Yantis should hire me :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah it doesn't sound good at all to me.  Remember, /played time is actual time in game, not counting sleep or any non-EQ activities you may do.<br />
<br />
If that character sells for $200 plus your cost for the software, you just made $2.77 per hour for 72 hours' worth of work.  Grats.<br />
<br />
Even at $600, it's only $8.33 an hour.  If you have a high school education and can show up to work on time you should be able to do that well.<br />
<br />
OTOH it might make a decent supplemental income for someone... if SOE doesn't yank the rug out somehow, if the market doesn't dry up when EQ2 comes out, if... if... if...</div></div><hr />

Still funny how someone could feasably make a living (poor as it may be) by playing a computer game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Macro PL the chars, that way you simply add the $2.77~$8.33 per hour to your existing rate in an 8 hour work day and of course earn money you would not otherwise during the other 16 hours in a day.<br />
<br />
Of course your scripts need to me smart, or you could simply slap an IRC/telnet/email/txt/ client on front and bot from work.<br />
<br />
Hell, get the wife to do it while she is at home with the kids, maintaining the scripts and accounting for trains etc would take an hour a day max I reckon, and only 5-10 mins for each 'admin' session.<br />
<br />
20 to 30k on top of my salary for very little work sounds nice to me.</div></div><hr />
