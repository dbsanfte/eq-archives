<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I log on, new patch. I knew they were nerfing Monks innate AC, which I don't agree with, and Manaburn, which most level 60 Wizards agree is just a toy anyway, and not their most effective ability. <br />
<br />
Then I see down below.<br />
<br />
Paladins, and Shadowknights now have an upped DPS......<br />
<br />
Paladins, Shadowknights, Rangers, and Beastlords have an upped Dodge cap.<br />
<br />
Beastlord have an upped casting ability, and some other stuff.<br />
<br />
Wow, the new patch boiled down to &quot;Screw Rangers and Monks.&quot;<br />
<br />
I hate my Monk alt, don't get me wrong. It's boring, annoying, and just plain droll, but Monk AC did not need nerfed. Monka are supposed to be pullers, well, how the hell can they pull if they don't have the AC to draw the mob back to you? Hello? Did this lose anyone but me? &quot;Let's make a puller for the game who can't get hit because if he does he takes massive damage!&quot; Idiots, pure idiots.<br />
<br />
Now, on to Rangers. We get an upped dodge cap, cool. Now, every other class but Wizards and Mages get something better (And Necros and Enchanters, but Necros can get Chloro and solo to hell and back, and Enchanters have KEI, so waa.)<br />
<br />
Paladins and Shadowknights have upped, DPS, and that's great... except I already see Paladins slashing for over 100 consistently with two handed weapons. What more damage do they honestly need? They have the AC and HP to be a puller/ main tank, and they can do 100+ damage in one strike, but by god they need to do MORE!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Rangers sit back here, don't really gripe about it except on this board from what I see, and casually take it while Verant runs around with a noose tightening around our necks to replace us with a Beastlord.<br />
<br />
This was the most worthless patch to date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well the answer to that is simple. Monks weren't designed to be pullers. Rangers.... pullers and peelers and in an outdoors environment there is no better. For years that was the way a ranger got groups. As for why a monk should get penalized.... your damn right it needed to be done and I'll tell you why. Have you ever compared the stats? A Lvl 51 monk in acrylia reinforced armor with higher AC and HP then a ranger twink. No leather class should ever have more AC then a equally equipped chain class. Monks get FD for a reason and that reason isn't so they can pull. Rangers got high DPS in return for lousy AC and HP. Monks got higher DPS and natural haste in return for even lower AC and HP... that was the base principle. Not a bad premise..... if you keep to that formula. But the simple fact is... they didn't. Most monks can tank better the most rangers..... and that should never ever be. No leatherbound char should ever be able to take more hits for longer then a chain bound class. In return for a high DPS and specilized weapons with astounding rates and criticals when using H2H they where supposed to get lower AC and HP. Thats just the way it was supposed to work. Verant nefing the monks..... its way overdue..... and it's not as big of a nerf as should be done in my opinion. But either way... it's a good start..... next stop... nerf those cleric hammers..... next stop... fix ranger archery.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Higher AC, yeah, ok, I agree, they did. I made an Iksar Monk I am going to delete, or might have already deleted, can't recall, because it was boring. I had him in full Crystalline Silk at level 4, and he was still going down half life against a mob. At level 4, my Ranger wasn't going down that low. So, Monk can tank better than a Ranger my ass. I'll put me tanking against a mob before a Monk any day. Cleric hammer, bah, screw it. The only two Clerics I group with don't use it anyway. Too much downtime for them to med in their opinion, smart Clerics. Fix Ranger Archery? HAH! Verant's just going to keep giving to Beastlords until Rangers become a supposed Obsolete class.<br />
<br />
I guarantee it. <br />
<br />
You know, the only good Rangers are the Psychotic ones. Not stupid, but psychotic. Psychotic as in soloing the Solusek Goblin King at level 39 (Shouldn't be able to be done by an untwinked Ranger, but I did it), or soloing the Netherbien SwarmLeader at half health at the same level and pulling it off. Those are the Rangers that will NEVER be obsolete, no matter what they give to Beastlords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Believe what you like.... but a higher AC on a leather class then on a chain class is just wrong. As for nerfing into obscurity...... No. There will always be people willing to play rangers no matter how much they get screwed. Either people new to the game, people that don't know how much rangers get screwed, or rich people that can afford to twink the holy hell out of it. So yes.... a ranger twink may be able to tank better then a non twink monk... Maybe... at low levels..... But thats assuming the ranger is a twink... and an uber one at that. Sure.... give me 200K and I'll twink my ranger up to be a serious ass kicker and not have any trouble. Get a full set of Kael armor.... CoF..... fungi...... epics.... couple of black acrylia weapons for soloing.... few other things... sure.... with enough money you can solo with any charachter. But money should never be a requirement to play a charachter. As for me....  I'm a poor ranger.... that was my first char.... I got stuff I couldn't possibly loot.... so I'm a bit of a twink..... but I still die more often then any other class when grouped with people that don't know what they are doing. Meatshields that are afraid of agro...... meatshields that don't think they need buffs...... meatshields with pathetic weapons and 50K worth of armor.... clerics slow on the heals and buffs.... chammy slow on the buffs.... enchanter that doesn't get that mezz off in time or a meatshield or monk that breaks mez..... So sure.... I die alot... and yes I have long suffered fools. So yes.... Verant rapes rangers...... yes... verant seems to have taken the ranger principles and pawned them off on the beastlords and then fixed in them what needs to be addressed in us. Sure.... thats all true. But Verant isn't going to change it...... they won't even fix the glaringly obvious ineqquities.... let alone the subtle ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm a poor Ranger too, but I don't rightly care. I do have decent gear, but it's nothing special, except for a couple pieces. Those being some things I busted my butt for, and got lucky on a couple trades.<br />
<br />
I still go solo, and act psychotic as I can. And if I could log the hell on today, I'd try to get something done, but Verant screws up there again. <br />
<br />
I didn't twink any character I have lower than my Ranger with any money ever spent. But, I did twink the crap out of a shaman with drops from Sol A, Netherbien Lair, Runnyeye, Najena, and the Crystal Caverns. My Ranger is also the first character I had, ever had, on EQ, and my strongest. He will ALWAYS be my strongest, I don't care. I like him too much to drop him straight for any unscrewed class.<br />
<br />
Best thing about being a Ranger in my opinion. No matter how badly Verant tries screwing me, I can crawl back up and /rude them while I progress.<br />
<br />
And one day, I swear, I will be standing over Innoruuk's broken, bloody, beaten, shattered body holding up my Shattered Emerald of Corruption. I won't settle for ANYTHING less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Malevant Faeshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't see this as a &quot;screw Rangers&quot; patch at all.  Fletching *was* easy to raise up to 180ish, I don't like the change, but if they are feeling the need to add a little pain to the benefits, let em stick it there.  Defense cap raised to 240... that's huge.  At 56 I will gain something like 40 actual AC from this, which is more of an upgrade than any sort of gear upgrade you could name.<br />
<br />
Siriath, you have to keep in mind that a lot of these changes were done with respect to the 50+ game.  While I intensely dislike ever playing the level card, it is the case that 50+ monks were taking damage better, and avoiding more hits than Rangers by a noticeable margin.  The last Monk who did not tank as well as me in an xp group was something like 5 levels lower than me.  The comparison at level 4 isn't really a valid one to base a complaint off of, imho.  I believe that most of my characters have been level 4 for under 2 hours tops; you don't balance gameplay for that, you balance it for the high end, where a significant number of players noticed problems.<br />
<br />
The only reason I can think for complaint is the BST boosts, but those don't hurt us at all.  I cannot remember the last time I was ever in competition with a BST for *anything*.  What makes them better is good for them, it doesn't hurt us at all.<br />
<br />
I've been through crappy patches, and I've seen some collossal crap thrown our way.  I won't even get into what folks who played from *before* Kunark had to deal with.  If they had given any more to us this patch, I would seriously have believed the message to be fake when it was posted up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye.... I say Verant screwed us not about this particular patch but rather about what seems to be a general policy. As for level 4 ikky monk.... sure they may have gotten to half health but think about how fast they regenerated that with the ikky regen boost. As for the rest of the patch.........I don't begrudge beastlords or even paladins and shadow knights any improvements they get. My only quibble is with Verant for not giving rangers commiserate boosts. As for beastlords by themselves.... no I've never had to compete with a beastlord but that is mainly because they are great solo'ers especially when twinked. Yes I do look at thier spell list and drool. Yes I do look at thier ability to solo well past 30 and drool. Make an iksar beastlord and twink it a bit and you can solo forever. I know a 57 beastlord that still solos quite a bit. I don't have a problem with Verant giving them these abilities...... but I think that they do need to stop worrying about the other classes and start fixing the one they have to long ignored. As for monks tanking..... if you ever get the oppurtunity..... play a 50+ monk for awhile.... especially 53+... that thunderkick disc is niiice..... And no... they don't get spells like rangers do but when you have mend and the ability to bind wound to 75% the only downtime is when you go to buy more bandages or possibly waiting for mend to pop. I have solo'd mobs in constant battling that I could never solo with a ranger even with KEI and good gear. I'm talking a Lvl 53 Monk with acrylia reinforced armor and a goranga spiked club / stave of shielding. Same thing with watching a high level beast lord..... if I had to clear a room full of spawns I would take a single beastlord to duo it with over a wizard who are supposed to be the masters of room clearing. Yes I do find similiarities between what bsts can do, get, and are to what I think rangers should have and should be able to do. I look at groups in 50 and especially 55+ that would rather have a monk then a ranger. Now I'm not talking a dungeon group where they just want the monk to pull. I've gotten into arguements with some monks just like the arguements I have gotten into with warriors. Simply put... with good equipment..... a monk makes a fine tank if it can keep agro which is hard to do against a ranger since monks don't have a taunt ability. And as I have said... no leather bound monk should ever be able to tank better then a simularly equipped ranger. No I give the example of acrlya reinforced because it is widely available and because it's fairly enexpensive and because that just happens to be what the monk was wearing when I compared. A twink ranger.... with CBoL, and Frosty.... with worked dragon spine chest and legs.... with crystal chitten arms and boots.... and a hero bracer/ice forged shackle bracer duo..... now by most accounts this is good gear...... even really good gear.... and yet a monk of the same level wearing common cheap gear has better stats. Not just AC and HP but better stats on everything except int and cha. That is why monks are recieving this minor nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kelliani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm rather happy that you aren't an official representative of the ranger class, Siriath.  How can you possibly say that this patch screwed rangers?  We have been given 2 important improvements in this patch, and the only thing that can be perceived to be bad is the fletching change.  Hmm.  Dodge cap and defense cap increases.  Yeah, those are pretty huge.  Your logic in this escapes me somehow.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I looked and looked and looked for whatever you were talking about with knights having an upped DPS.  Umm, do you mean this?<br />
<br />
<br />
- Decreased a monk's ability to mitigate damage (please see the Developer's Update on www.everquestlive.com for more details) <br />
- Improved the ability of Paladins, Shadowknights, Warriors and Bards to mitigate damage in some situations <br />
- Upgraded Warrior dodge cap to 190  <br />
- Upgraded Paladin, Shadowknight and Bard dodge cap to 170  <br />
-Upgraded Ranger and Beastlord dodge to 170 and defense to 240  <br />
<br />
That's all defensive stuff.  Nowhere in the patch message did I see a mention of knight offense improvement.  If you can dig that up from the message, I'll be happy to review it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When I said Screw Rangers, I didn't mean &quot;We're going to rip their clas apart and make them worthless.&quot; I meant, &quot;Ah, well, let's see, for the last 7 or 8 patches we've done nothing for Rangers other than Up the Dodge Cap and Defense Cap (Which is HUGE I agree), and finally got off our asses and fixed Warder's Protection (Which again is huge). What else can we do? Ah screw it, we don't need to do more, we'll just keep giving everything else to the other classes like new spell lines and the like.&quot; Now in the sense they were screwing us over, but more like, &quot;Ah, well, we can't think of anything else, so screw it,&quot; kind of deal. I don't know about you, but I'd like to get a few more spells that were decent in my selection (SK Harmshield comes to mind here, though I know we have nothing like it in our spell lines, just an example). Nothing out of line from what we already had, but maybe, like people keep saying, an upgrade to Feet Like Cat, maybe a Dex buff that starts lower leveled. I could use a Dex Buff right now myself. <br />
<br />
I didn't mean, in any way, that they were taking things away, but that they were leaving us behind and, seemingly, trying to pull other classes to the forefront. It's not meant to be taken like we're getting jipped in the way you may have thought. Just that we're not getting anything near what half the other classes are getting.<br />
<br />
Edit: I saw a typo somewhere and couldn't find it. Someone, please, point it out if you can see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nothing wrong with this patch for us imho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ytrill Stonebow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/agree Kelliani &lt;wave&gt; (225 Defense...gonna beat ya!)<br />
<br />
/agree Rounlin<br />
<br />
Manaburn and monk mitigation needed to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Although there are MB teams that target Kunark dragons for the benefit of the community rather than &quot;their own wallets,&quot; as VI put it, that skill nonetheless trivialized the encounters. As for monks, sorry -- they have no business tanking high-end boss MOBs. And they still do a fine job pulling, even after the change; our monk did his usual bang-up job in ToV last night with no problems.</div></div><hr />
