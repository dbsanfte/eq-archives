<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We had a SUPER time with a zone in bug heh. Basicaly zoning in while leved and zoning in while walking ports you to different places. Our ROGUE got killed /boggle. Looks like it could have been fun, but it was 4 am, and people werent on the ball. Perhaps they fixed the zone bug today, i know they at least fixed the gatekeeper guard which was hitting for 65k a pop (/charm!)<br />
<br />
Found a nmed kobold who likey the goblins... and a goblin who doesnt like the kobolds. Both kos, perha rooted non attackable mobs. Kill one to raise faction with another. Also a dual dagger wielding invis mob wanted 4 parts from mobs deep inside to make a temper to imbue your weapon... I wonder if this is the first of permanant item upgrades we will see. Which would explain why they screwed up bane, if bane damage can be added to existing items now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A mob that hits for 65k.  Sounds like an enchanter's dream if it was charmable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">from what i've gathered, there are 6 or 7 of those guards. as you kill them, the one's left alive hit harder. apparently they don't have the scaling done right, and yes, they are hitting for 65k, and wreaking havock at the zone in.</div></div><hr />
