<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, there are two main ways I have tried to fight - <br />
1. Tank with spell backup - Basically, hit 'em with affliction, tainted breath, and walking dead, then melee them to death. Add in a spirit strike if needed. <br />
<br />
2. Root rot 'em - affliction, tainted, root. Sit &amp; mem. When root breaks, if at 50%, melee to death. <br />
<br />
Third, which I do not do would be to reapply root till death. <br />
<br />
Which one is the most worthwhile hunting? Should I be meleeing at my level, or root rotting? Should I try #3 and let them rot all the way? At what point do I cut the melee? <br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like #2.  First, I don't recall slows being worth it at 21- I generally skipped them.  #2 seems to be a nice combination of letting DoTs do their job, getting mana back, and melee (which is important, as you want to make sure to keep weapon skills and defense maxed throughout the levels!)<br />
<br />
If monsters aren't lasting the full two minutes for an Affliction, I'd skip it.  Also, I seem to remember Flash of Light was a nice spell to have open at this time- a nice &quot;Get out of jail free&quot; spell- assuming you're solo'ing in outdoor areas (e.g. won't train other people.)<br />
<br />
You're coming up on what I found to be some of the toughest levels for a shaman.  Level 23 in particular was just brutal for me.  Things will get better if you tough it out, though.  :)<br />
<br />
One other suggestion- might be a good time to get a group if one's available.  I'm pretty much a solo'er myself, but even I jumped at groups in the low 20's.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Almost forgot... melee becomes more important solo'ing at higher levels.  Once you get a pet, you'll quickly learn that oyu can't let it take the hits (it's too weak.)  It's good at dishing out damage, but terrible at soaking it up.  You need to be able to take the hits, which means you need all of the AC and HP you can get- this underscores the need to max your defense skill at every level.  I'd definitely melee until the low 40's (until your defense caps at 200.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Approach number 2. East Karana is a good place to apply this method at that level. (Better yet go to SK, HHP or LOIO and get in a group.)<br />
<br />
Argoth of Drinal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What I did soloing those lvls was to use the lvl 14 dd, and basically root-kite mobs to death, and then med up in a safe place.<br />
<br />
I know, not very efficient, but I read books/cleaned the apartment during downtime and it was fun for me that way :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmm, I had no problems with #1 . . .<br />
<br />
Keep in mind I have relatively high AC/HP. I basically would open with a slow, then stick tainted and affliction while meleeing. I would finish most fights at half mana/half hitpoints fighting very dark blue/even mobs.<br />
<br />
I found root/rotting to be terribly inefficient as I was constantly OOM at the end of a fight with nearly a full health bar (which can't be cannibalized at 21).<br />
<br />
I'm now at 32 and I have yet to encounter any of these &quot;rough spots&quot; that everyone is talking about. Maybe I am just lucky, I dunno. I will say that 24 will change your shammie's life :) It only gets better from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My strategy was very similar to your first method. At the lower levels, I never had much success with root/rotting. Root was way too unreliable for me to count on it. As soon as I sat to med, root would break and I'd have to get up and melee or cast a spell anyway, so I just learned to cope. Fights still went well. I used my best poison dot, meleed and added in a nuke when necessary. It wasn't bad and my defense/offense/weapon skill stayed maxxed for my level. I did group alot as well, so I still levelled decently fast. Once you get regen and canni, things will go better. If you are having some success, though, with method #2, go with that, as it does sound like the better all-around strategy for maximizing the damage to the mob, minimizing damage taken from the mob and regaining mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Most efficient for me was to root/tainted + affliction, when tainted runs out throw another one on , when that runs out, cast slow then go melee. At your lvl I would reccomend Paludal Caverns, in about 9 hours of good grouping (or soloing) you can be 24/25 and have new spells :) good loot too (As much as 3pp per corpse, with some banded drops)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I personally never had a problem with strategy #1. I used #1 exclusively until lvl 24 or so. I would simply pull with slow (I used Walking Sleep until 30) and DoT with Tainted. Beat it down with my spear or hammer. Never had any troubles unless I got some adds. This method was much more mana efficient for me. I could pull a few before I had to med. <br />
I still use this strategy at 38, I sometimes have to use root/rot depending on the mob or pet kite. But if I can handle the beating I slow and pummel them with my pokey stick and Cujo. <br />
Either strategy is good, it really depends on the mob. I say master both techniques it will make you a more effective Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">quite frankly, 20-24 are hell levels of a type.<br />
<br />
Soloing through this period is hard (i was in luclin/marus seru, so i had a pretty hard time from high ac/high hitting mobs).<br />
<br />
Affliction and TB really dont do enough damage, which is a serious bummer.<br />
<br />
24 changes EVERYTHING of course!  <br />
<br />
EB = 200hp total in 42 seconds, we get a 150dd, regen, a very cool rain spell, several helpfull buffs, and of course canni.<br />
<br />
ahh.. canni, Always memed, and always will be memed.<br />
<br />
I suggest grouping and bieng a healer, thats what i did in Neth. Layer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is the second post I have seen today where a low level shaman was not using slow.  From level 5(!) I have been slowing mobs.  ANY decrease in attack speed helped.  At level 5-45 you can melee just about anything if it is slowed.  <br />
<br />
When leveling my shaman through level 20-30 (in Loio) I met 4 shaman who did not even know they had a slow spell.  Slow is our make it or break it spell, use it...all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have to disagree, the low amount of damage avoided by using slow at low lvls is not worth it most of the time. If you are fighting and only winning by the small amount that the slow would save you, fight easier mobs. <br />
<br />
At higher lvls tho, slows make a huge difference most of the time. If I am in a good group pulling single blues tho, I won'w slow most times tho, the mobs just die too fast. Since about lvl 30 or so I have pulled with a slow and been glad I did, the only time I didn't was through lvl 40, pulled with melee debuff to try to max my def, almost there.<br />
<br />
To sum up, Targar's is the first slow spell that I really like, and I actually still use it at 41 due to lower resists and still pretty similar to Torgor's(or whatever the lvl 39 slow is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">At level 21, it actually makes a huge difference.  If I do not slow, I am getting about 1 for 1 - he hits me one time for every time I hit him.  <br />
<br />
If I cast walking sleep, plus boost my agility and dexterity, on average, i get about 4 to 1 - that is, i am doing 4 times the hits he is. <br />
<br />
thats a HUGE difference with only 3 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hate to argue here, but considering that walking sleep slows for a max of 35%, this is not acurate. If you are talking about only swings, not attacks landed(which is all the slows effect) the most you would see is MOB swinging at you about 2 times for every 3 that you swing at him. <br />
<br />
At lvl 41, I can swing a little less than 4 times for every 1 of the MOB, that is with Torgors(approx 60% slow) on the mob, and quickness on me(30% haste) <br />
<br />
Agi only raises your ac a little bit and dex determines how often you proc, neither are going to make a huge difference when you solo a mob.<br />
<br />
My previous point is, that for the mana and time spent slowing the mob, and maybe getting resists, you could do better casting a heal on yourself every 3 fights or so. Later on, the slow makes a big, noticable difference and coupled with the relatively high hp/ac that this board has helped you to get, you will not get hit very often, or for very much damage. This is why people tend to say that shaman get much better with levels, the relative effect of our spells increases greatly with leveling. This is also why it is much easier to solo a shaman in her 40's than in her 20's(esp that stupid lvl 23)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually,Agility increases the speed you swing with as well, from my understanding (and I certainly have seen that as well). <br />
<br />
I understand what you are trying to prove with math, however, I did a test.... (again, this is HITS, not SWINGS). <br />
<br />
With no buffs, the hits went:<br />
MOB<br />
ME<br />
MOB<br />
ME<br />
ME<br />
MOB<br />
ME<br />
MOB<br />
<br />
With Walking sleep, feet like cat, dextery aura (or whatever it is), I do:<br />
MOB<br />
ME<br />
ME<br />
ME<br />
ME<br />
ME<br />
MOB<br />
ME<br />
ME<br />
MOB<br />
ME<br />
ME<br />
ME<br />
MOB<br />
<br />
Again, these are ACTUAL figures from a fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Agility does not effect swing speed (neither does dexterity, or any other regular stat.)  <br />
<br />
From an ancient Brad post:<br />
<br />
&quot;In working with the people doing the strategy guide for Kunark we decided to provide them with general information as to what the stats do. <br />
I'm going to post them here. <br />
<br />
This is a change in the sense that we were not going to discuss them or release more info. We changed our minds. <br />
<br />
That said, we're not posting any formulas, and it's absolutely true that some stats have considerably more direct impact on gameplay than others. <br />
<br />
We're posting this for clarification, and because previous explanations have not been accurate (manual, etc). We will not, however, engage in debate and our stance on how much some stats affect game play is that it's by design to inhibit some aspects of twinking. Are there better attribute systems out there? Yeah, but we're not going to change something as fundamental as a stat system in EQ after the game's been out for more than a year. <br />
<br />
Anyway, here you go: <br />
<br />
DEX: how quickly you learn weapon skills; how often weapon will proc; how quickly you learn rogue skills; how hard you hit with bows <br />
<br />
STR: determines how much you can carry; influences maximum and average damage; influences how quickly you learn many offensive skills <br />
<br />
STA: affects how many hit points you have, how long you can hold your breath <br />
<br />
INT: directly affects how quickly you can learn most skills; affects the amount of mana for bards and all mages, as well as shadow knights <br />
<br />
WIS: affects the amount of mana the priest classes have, also rangers; also affects how quickly you can learn many skills if your wisdom is higher than INT. <br />
<br />
CHA: affects the amount you pay for goods from NPC merchants, and how much they will pay you when selling; affects the saving throw on certain bard and enchanter spells (charms in particular) <br />
<br />
AGI: affects how quickly you can learn some defensive skills, how difficult it is to hit you as well as how much damage you take when you are hit <br />
<br />
-Brad&quot; <br />
<br />
Quickness / Alacrity / etc. effect swing speed by the following amount.<br />
<br />
Quickness:   30%<br />
Alacrity:  40%<br />
Celerity:  50%<br />
<br />
Slow percentages are as follows (stolen from here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=771)):<br />
<br />
Drowsy = level/4+10 <br />
Walking Sleep = level/4+20 <br />
Tagar = level/2+20 <br />
Togor= level+10 <br />
Turgur = level +15<br />
<br />
