<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh good lord... Eudin is there heh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He is?  We're f'd</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Posts under the name Edtu, but he signs his posts as &quot;Eduin&quot;. He started posting on the 3rd page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Eduin can be harsh but he is rarely wrong - unlike VI/SOE/Abashi/Absor/...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ed's been doing a very good job, not insulting, and listing very valid arguements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yah, he's being VERY civilized and rational.  i always said that while he was here, his presentation was pretty poor in a lot of cases, but what he said always had a lot of merit.  its a shame he isn't here anymore, but i have a feeling he'd scream at a lot of people if he were. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I kinda doubt any decent cognitive argument in our favor will be noticed between the pages of class envy griefers posting their 2 cents applauding the &quot;nerf&quot; (that is &quot;fix&quot; in VAKspeak).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I love how just 2 people can hijak a conversation and out-shout the views of 40 others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">six more days until EQOA...can't wait...I think..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Eduin owns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;Ummm... I'm not a Shaman, and I've never been to the planes, much less tier two. Having said that, I have faith that play testing was done prior to release. Therefore, if Shamans (Shamen? Hehe) suddenly can't slow mobs in tier 2, it is probably intended that way. Maybe you should have a different class debuff the mob before casting slow? Seems to me that this may be the way to use slow without excessive time constraints or using too much mana. &quot;<br />

rofl  , im sorry , i had to bring this one back for us all to enjoy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That thread is useless.  Every person posting against us is someone who admits that they know nothing about the issues.<br />
<br />
When I don't know anything about something, I usually stay quiet.  Better to remain silent and thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.<br />
<br />
I agree, Eduin owns.  I haven't seen such level-headed, accurate posts in ages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OMG!<br />
<br />
Litgruv, I am amazed by your poster's wisdom... <br />
<br />
From now on, I will INSIST on a chanter casting tash first, then let them die from the aggro, while my slow is still casting...<br />
