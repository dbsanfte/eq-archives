<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ensnaring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to start a new shaman, but before I jump into it, I wanted some input. I have pretty much no idea at all how to play one.<br />
<br />
Is this the most commonly accepted Shaman message board?<br />
<br />
Also, I was thinking about Vah Shir as a beginning race. Sure, they don't have the regen benefits of a troll or the STA of an ogre, but do they make that large of a difference?<br />
<br />
If there is 1 race that would be the best, I'd play it, but if it's based largely on one's own opinions, I'd like to go Vah Shir.<br />
<br />
Also, what should my starting loadout be? Anyone have any common stuff I should aim for? And yes, this is twinking, not just what easy simple items will get me by. Nothing uber, but any general loadouts Shaman's start with?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a WEALTH of knowledge on these boards, you will find ALL your answers here, believe me. <br />
<br />
You will be told AC &gt; Wis, you will be told Troll &gt; all (I disagree, I play a barb and an Iksar, I just prefer them over merely powergaming) <br />
<br />
This is about the best board you will find on the shaman class, and I do believe the search works now....<br />
<br />
Either way, welcome =)  Always good to see new faces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would utilize the search feature, nearly every question you've asked has been covered fairly well.<br />
<br />
1) To my knowledge, this is the best EQ shaman community on the web.  I sometimes read the shaman forums at Casters Realm, but I love the Crucible.<br />
<br />
2) The races are fairly even, but they do have advantages and disadvantages.<br />
<br />
Troll - widely regarded as the most powerful race (45% of Crucible shaman responding to a poll said they would choose a troll if they had to restart). Innate regen, can use the JBB, snare necklace if they worship Inny, slam.  Disadvantages - large race (can get stuck without shrink), can't wear jarsath, sebilite scale, IGS, faction in the old world.  Exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Barb - most common shaman race due to evenly balanced wis/sta/str for starting stats.  Can wear IGS, jarsath and JBB.  Good faction in the old world, but nightblind until level 9 and infravision.  Cute polar bear.<br />
<br />
Ogre - big advantages - frontal immunity from stun and incredibly high starting stamina. Can wear JBB, slam, large race so size can be a problem.  No innate regen, low starting wisdom, poor starting faction in old world.  Exp penalty.<br />
<br />
Iksar - hotly debated.  Strengths - highest startest wisdom, innate regen, innate 40 AC (at level 60 ?), forage, start with 100 swim, good newbie area.  Disadvantages - no snare necklace (must worship CT), no slam, no JBB (big!), exp penalty, low starting stamina.<br />
<br />
Vah Shir - moderate starting stats, no slam, medium race, can wear JBB, get sneak (pretty cool for questing) and safe fall.  No innate regen, no exp penalty (that I know of) can't wear fungi tunic (but can wear the regrowth tunic from the FG caller quest).  Pretty rare and cool looking.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think the races are fairly equally balanced, play what looks like fun.<br />
<br />
Standard shaman starting gear (if I had 5 plat for every time I typed this out...)<br />
<br />
Ears - forest loops<br />
Helm/arms/boots/gloves - JB if applicable<br />
tunic - regen is goal, iksar ceremonial chestplate is good<br />
mask - enshrouded veil, arctic wyvern mask<br />
neck - ivory collar from chardok (inny snare neck if Troll)<br />
belt - flayed turmoil skin belt, smited girdle, spider belt<br />
legs - leg choices suck...really<br />
back - mammoth cloak<br />
wrists - save up for those nice ones from WW, pricey<br />
shoulders - obulus death shroud? starting out I wore a lizzie mantle<br />
melee - jade prod, slime harpoon, howling harpoon, wraithbone hammer<br />
shield - clay guardian shield, SBS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Vah Shir are a large race :) Meow!<br />
<br />
Vah Shir get a great newbie zone, lot's o' quests, tons of mobs (i.e., leveling fodder).   <br />
<br />
Your choice of race really dependes on playing style if you ask me.  Power gamer and stats/abilities most important?  Just want a decent race that looks cool?  Want to be evil?<br />
<br />
Some other equipment suggestions:<br />
<br />
Shoulders:  Tattered Mantle<br />
Rings:  6ac/65 hitpoints<br />
Rygorr is great shaman armor<br />
Weapon:  Spine Chill Spear/Ebon War Spear<br />
Ears:  Orc Fang (if you cannot afford Forest Loops)<br />
Shield: Charred Guardian Shield gives you some AC and nice Wis (very affordable these days), may want SBS or Clay Guardian for higher AC if you can afford.<br />
<br />
Most of the totemic armor is not that difficult to quest, though you need to buy Dufrenite(sp?) gem for each piece, which runs about 170 pp if I recall.  The Totemic Helm has some WIS and decent AC, totemic legs not to bad either.  The Totemic BP is very hard to get because of rare drop from Grizzlenot.  I believe any class can quest the totemic if you can talk to the quest givers in Lake Rathe, and it is not no drop, so you can use a higher level character to quest it for your newbie shaman (or just buy it).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
GOOD HUNTING TO YOU!<br />

As someone already said, go AC over Wis (but get some wis )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;I'd like to go Vah Shir.&quot;<br />
<br />
THAT is ALL you need to know about race selection!!!  Grats on yer new kitty shaman and check the board a bit for info on other stuff.<br />
<br />
The only threads to avoid are ones that have the three dreaded letters &quot;JBB&quot; in them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ac/hp items over WIS generally is a good idea.  Moreso for a low level shaman IMO since the mana gain per wis is very small at low levels, plus it'll get you in the habit early of resisting the temptation to be a Sha-dr00d. :p  <br />
<br />
Dunno what the base stats for Vah Shir are, but it's hard to go wrong putting your starting points in STA.<br />
<br />
Tons of equipment threads all over as well as the magelo profile thread.  Take a gander at those threads and the profiles to get an idea of items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ensnaring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What's a JBB?<br />
<br />
And does anyone else have any starting equipment advice? Y'know, stuff that'd make my life alot easier in the starting, but isn't all too hard to obtain, like the examples Shabby and Gloriana gave (thanks!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ensnaring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Helm/arms/boots/gloves - JB if applicable  <br />
<br />
What's JB and WW for wrist slots? :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The JBB is Jaundiced Bone Bracer. The most sought after Shaman item available. Right click : Winter's Roar 250+ DD <br />
very costly but, effective solo/situational item. Usable by all Shaman races except Iksar.<br />
Also JB is Jaundiced Bone Armor wearable by all Shaman races except Iksar. Very nice Shaman only armor. <br />
<br />
<br />
However, the JBB has been known to cause your PC to crash. Some players have even developed Carpul Tunnel syndrome from all the repeated right mouse clicking ! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just kidding ! <br />
(I'm an Iksar)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ensnaring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was leaning toward troll a little, and wouldn't mind playing it over Vah Shir though.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone thinks that's a better choice then? Considering that I'd enjoy both, would that give Troll the edge?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Decided on Vah Shir :) <br />
<br />
But it's still early enough to change of course, unless anyone has any ideas why Troll is so much better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Troll over Vah'Shir<br />
<br />
Snare necklace (Innoruuk worshippers), regen, and can wear Fungi...Vah Shir can't until 51 (Fungus Patch Vest). Higher Sta, Str....not saying Trolls are better, I just find them more fun to play and they get more toys. Both can wear JB armor. <br />
<br />
<br />
Plus old model Trolls have a serious rectal itch problem, kinda endearing if you think about it. Trolls are more fun to roleplay IMO. You can throw the dictionary right out the window with Trolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Like Stormrazor said, trolls are considered an excellent shaman race because:<br />
<br />
* Have innate regen (since shaman can convert hitpoints to mana, this is HUGE for shaman)<br />
* Trolls that worship Inny can quest for a necklace which casts a low level snare.  It might be a low level snare, but it still adds an extremely valuable spell to our line up<br />
* Trolls get slam<br />
* Trolls can wear fungi<br />
<br />
The benefits of a Vah Shir are more subtle, sneak is cool, safe fall is moderately cool...but regen is godly.<br />
<br />
That being said, play what looks fun to you and don't look back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just love my Var Shir Shaman. Now that she's lv42, what kind of regen gear should I be keeping my eyes out for? [Crossing fingers hoping this thread doesn't become another JBB battlefield.]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Iksar Ceremonial Breastplate is a good alternative for those who can't afford/wear a Fungi. I believe Vah Shir can wear Ikky BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Vah Shir have a bunch of nice quests, and a *great* selection of zones.  It can make your first 30 lvls or so a blast.<br />
<br />
None of that makes it any easier at 60, but by then the differences in races are pretty much moot anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah...Cats can wear the Iksar regen bp.<br />
<br />
No clue why they can't wear a Fungi.  Seems kind of ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Maybe the Fungi acts like catnip?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think Verant made the Fungi un-wearable by Cats because they didn't want a bunch of level 1 Kitty twinks with Fungis on. So introduce the Fungus Patch Vest - recommended level 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What exactly is the Fungus patch vest?<br />
<br />
Is it a kitty quest that can be done at 51 that yields a tunic similar to the fungi?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It is a quest ! Its stats are similar to Fungi (identical I believe). It can be done sooner than 51 but the regen effect doesn't work or you can't wear it until 51. Not sure which. <br />
But it can worn by VahShir</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think I would go Kitty if I were to be a &quot;good&quot; shaman. I still prefer troll for my &quot;evil&quot; side. Presonally, I rate sneak &gt; regen. It really does make a huge difference questing and selling. The kitty newbie areas are great and they have a LOT of really nice quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The fungus patch vest is done in a ring of fire type format. It is a single group encounter but from what I have read a 50's group is the minimum for it.  It is not just a Kitty quest. Same exact stats except only large races and the level restriction.</div></div><hr />
