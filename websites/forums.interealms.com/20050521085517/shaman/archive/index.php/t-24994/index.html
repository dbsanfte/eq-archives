<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, I was accused of hacking by the GM's on the VS server after I petitioned for help when something went wrong doing a 8th Coldain shawl hand in to get the container to combine the armour in. <br />
<br />
I was accused of quoted from the email:<br />
<br />
These included, but were not limited to: trading with an npc in one zone,<br />
less than 5 seconds after trading with an npc in another zone. Moving to a distant zone in a time-frame that is not possible (this was not the zone you were bound in). Creating a corpse in a zone you are not bound in and being able to loot said corpse in a time-frame shorter than that which is possible even if resurrected at the exact time of death.<br />
<br />
These actions are said to have all happened on the same day (14th Oct) and this was the day I petitioned for help. The GM's have flat refused to give me any more details of these events.<br />
<br />
From my point of view at my screen I did not see anything like what is in the log and I did not and have never tried to hack EQ.<br />
<br />
The fact these actions do not seem to make sense and that the only way I know of to make a Corpse is to die and I don't remember dieing that day. Also since I believe that I am accused of these actions taken place after or around my petition, I am confused how I could die and not lose my buffs or the Heyokah title.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas what could have caused this or what further action I can take to prove my innocence?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you didn't do any of the actions the GM's are accusing you of, I would suspect there is another character named &quot;Ragack&quot; or possibly &quot;Ragackx&quot; on your server, and when they queried the logs both of your actions showed up.  Possibly even GM-Ragack.<br />
<br />
Another possibility is they had a clock-issue on whatever server keeps the logs and it appears the timestamps on the log messages are mixed together.<br />
<br />
A third possibility is that you have leet mad haxxor skeelz.<br />
<br />
If it happened to me I would send an email to &quot;Contact your GM&quot; and plead my case.  If they didn't respond favorably in a timely manner I'd go buy WoW.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kilgaroz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A guildy of mine recently had a similar situation, though the accusations were different.  His post:<br />
<br />
Yea so today has been a bit frustrating. I woke up this morning and checked my email and I had an email from a GM stating that one of my alts had been used to remove items from someones account and that my account would be suspended for 7-10 days pending review for banning. This supposedly happened on 10/21..Well I haven't been on this alt in a while or so and I never used him to remove items from anyones account, so I guess I got hacked and someone used my account for their purposes? Sheeit I dunno, but it looks like I'll be away from the game for a few days if not permanently.<br />
<br />
He got access returned to him about 2 weeks later, they never responded to any queries about the situation, never explained what had happened.  Another guildy who was using a game pad to auto-forage for Leatherfoot Haversacks got warned about AFKage, seems like the GMs have a MiB - sized bug up their collective arse lately.</div></div><hr />
