<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jorilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings all :) <br />
<br />
I am a 38th season Barbarian Shaman playing on Fennin Ro. I've been checking out the boards for a couple of days and I have to say this site  is excellent :) <br />
<br />
Although I have been playing EQ for quite some time (with an 8 month break recently), this is my first time playing a shaman.  I have a 44 druid on my account (go ahead, laugh...I do lol) that was my main but since creating my shaman 2 months ago I decided that druids suck...hehe :p <br />
So, my plans are to level my shaman and make her my main. <br />
<br />
I set a goal for myself regarding equipment by the time I reach level 50 and I was wondering if I could get some opinions. Like I said, I've only been playing her for about 2 months and I'm still learning :) <br />
<br />
Here's what I currently have, along with a goal profile -<br />

<br />
<br />
I would greatly appreciate any comments/ideas from you <br />
<br />
<br />
Be well and safe hunting :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes your goal profile shows you're approaching the shaman like a shaman and not like a druid, except perhaps the RMB and the Black Pearl Velium Ring. The focus effect on RMB won't be useful to you unless you get level 60, the spell avatar and are addicted to casting it, think more HP/AC than that and you'd be better off with a second ac/hp ring than the dex/agi one. I wore wis rings for the longest time then finally put on the Velium Fires and wished I'd done it sooner.<br />
<br />
Best of luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ardilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am also a new Shaman in my 38th season but I'm new to EQ as well (only been playing since 3/3/03) However there is a really great mask you can get by doing a pretty simple quest.<br />
<br />
Here is the mask: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16394<br />
<br />
and here is the quest: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2203<br />
<br />
The only hard part of the quest is going to Temple Droga (I did this quest when I was lvl 30) but what I found to work is cast Invis on your self and then find the guy in the temple.  Once you complete your interaction with him simply gate out of the Temple.  To make it even easier you can even bind yourself if PoK near the NPC you have have to give the book to in exchange for the mask.<br />
<br />
For the time (it only took me about 1 1/2 - 2 hrs to complete) and the price (free) its a GREAT upgrade!  Good Luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do you have a way to transfer some items/pp from you druid to your shammy?  The main things I would do differentlt are the....<br />
-face (chrystal spider eyes)<br />
-shield (Sarnak Battle Shield)<br />
-finger (get AC/HP)<br />
-wrist (dump the RMB for better AC/HP)<br />
All else looks good, and please bear in mind that those changes reflect MY style.  There are other styles out there that work just as well, if not better than mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jorilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the advice :) <br />
<br />
I just dinged 42 last night.  I also revamped my goal profile a bit and updated what I currently have....is this more on the lines of what I should be aiming for? Any comments would be greatly appreciated, thanks :) <br />
