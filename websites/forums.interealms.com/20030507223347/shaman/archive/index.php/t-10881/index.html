<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>schuleta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am only 16th level, and this is my primary character on Zebuxorok. Grpak: Troll Shaman (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=556529) <br />
<br />
I have worked up smithing to make my armor, and tailoring to sell leather padding to raise money. <br />
<br />
I was wondering what the community at large thinks is better the Plat Fire Wedding Ring (5 AC, 55 HP), or Jaded Plat Ring (4 AC, 20 HP, 20 Mana).  With Canni I approaching, should I dump the mana for the xtra HP? <br />
<br />
I know this is low-level cr@p for most of you, but I would be thankful for any advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
Doing leather padding is a great way of making pp and quite respecable for a boot strap shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh I applaud you in your endevors, lots of lower level players these days simply beg higher levels for extra stuff, so you really are a big step ahead of the race.<br />
At any level, the ac/hit point rings are the best option for most shaman; at low levels, hit points are so much more important than the relatively small amount of mana you will get from 2 jade  rings. Also as you climb higher in levels, the hit points help you cann better.<br />
Good luck on your hard work and I commend you.</div></div><hr />
