<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">That is my goal, how does that compare to other various classes? I have been 59 for like three weeks, almost 60 but I do not care muich, it will come. 4,021 hps right now, all auction house, quest, no dungeon higher than Muraudon(been to BRD but nothing from there yet). I want, and think it will be doable, for 4200 unbuffed at 60, before we even start getting the uber items. Most rogues I know at 60 are low 3,000's, and I cannot understand why they like this, I simply do not lose to rogues of the alliance, unless I am very much already hurt. Hps = chance to live and do damage. I can take a pretty big pounding before i eat dirt. A few % to crit or dodge just doesn't cut it for me.<br />
<br />
Our guild warrior is 4400 ish, and we have a damn warlock on track for 4,000 unbuffed hps as well. Assume Pallies must be similar to warriors?<br />
<br />
Do peeps just not like stamina?<br />

we gotta load you up with some stamina gear man!! Hehe.<br />
<br />
We only have one guild warrior at 60 and one at 50-52 I think, and I spend a good deal of time tanking myself, I need the hps, and with my dodge/evasion, I can do it pretty damned well, for short periods of time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm I cant check right now my server is down. I just updated chest and must be at 3750(one of the hate pallies mil hehe)or so on hps. But i dont have any enchants. I used to go to crazy with new gear so wouldnt update them. <br />
<br />
What are the best enchants? 100 hp health on chest? and the stam wrist and bracers? What about the other slots I'm still a bit of an echant newb. I do want to fix my hps a bit though. I caught my mana up but lost some hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe I don't hate Pallies really, it probably is envy, I can't take 6 people beating on me for 20 seconds and calmly walk away. Too many of them though, that tends to get annoying after a while, then again, ton of rogues too. I think the battlefields will reveal the incredible power of the Paladin, and really knock the horde for a loop.<br />
<br />
best enchants on chest I have seen is 100 health or + 3 to all stats. I have + 3 now, just need to get items for our enchanter to enchant. Although, + 3 to all is nice. + 7 stam on bracers, and I think 7 on my booties.<br />
<br />
I may be shooting myself in the foot, but I love random pvp groups where people are astonished at a rogue with that many hps, if they only knew how ghetto I really am!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I read that AC makes much more differance in this game than pure HP does for tankability. Don't know if that means anything to you though; and if you're a pvp'er a fat lot of good that ac does when a mage throws a fireball up your ass anyway :\<br />
<br />
Anyway my gear sucks on all my characters :p I think the 33 shaman here has more ac/hp than my 35 hunter :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Level 39 Shaman - AC focused (2655).  HPs only 1590-ish but I got decent int (2300-ish mana) for a dumb cow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, massive pvp last night in TM, the few one on ones I had with level 60's I won, everytime, including a Paladin battle, best I have ever had, multiple shields, she potioned, I bandaged while she healed, etc. Was pretty close but i got her with almost half hps.<br />
<br />
Then we got rolled by about 8-10 level 60's and support crew, I was the highest horde at 59 hehe. Fun stuff.<br />

<br />
About 3680 AC and 2300hp, and 3200 mana...definitely an AC/Mana build so far...<br />
<br />
With Shaman, and I suspect Paladins, I like my AC....hp is nice for a pool but I can always toss a self-heal in and about the only time I ever have any issues is with more than 3 beating on me...<br />
<br />
I believe currently according to the display my AC allows me to mitigate about 47 percent of incoming damage...I would rather mitigate the damage coming in than have a huge hp pool<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would rather mitigate the damage coming in than have a huge hp pool<br />
Heh - I assume Mill would too, but as a rogue his mitigation options are pretty well limited.  Sounds like his &quot;mitigation&quot; is to give an attacker more health to fight through while he chews you up like a wood chipper (with the occasional band-aid thrown in for good measure)!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Mitigation is good for PvE, when you know you aren't going to run out of mana/hp battling an NPC as it lessens downtime.  However in PvP, mitigation is far less useful because of spells.  It's better to increase your surviveability against everyone (by increasing mana/hp pool).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My stats as a  level 43 shaman.<br />
<br />
AC = 3100<br />
Mana = 2650<br />
HP = 2000<br />
<br />
In PvP Mana and HP are most important stats. Resists and AC are both equal in PvP regardless of stats and level. In pvp only shields can effect AC. We have a pure defensive warrior that uses a shield and sword combo and he can tear apart 2 handed weilding paladins. He has defeated paladins much higher level than him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Problem with pvp is as Krup stated, no matter what I do, my mitigation is 22% or so, raising it to 25% if I had the best gear is not worth sacrificing 900 hps.<br />
<br />
I'm not the best because I kill quickly, er, actually I am. My hits on a pally for instance are really low, 150 ish normal hits and maybe 500-700 evis, but I hit fast and poison.<br />
<br />
In Pvp, the person with the most hps always has an advantage.<br />
<br />
Uthgar, I am starting to come around for warriors, the smart ones seem to do really well. I think perhaps too many people are in eq mode of autoattack and relax.<br />

2546 Mana<br />
3064 Armor<br />

I'm an alchemist too so I usually have at least armor, hp and agility potions going.  These would add 250 ac, 120 hp and 15 agility to the above stats.  Having the resist (absorb) potions going helps alot too, mages hate them  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At 45 I've got about 2800 unbuffed hp (3500 bear form), but I've given up a lot of mana for that with a mana pool of about 2300 unbuffed. My AC is about 980 (3600ish in bear form), I've actually got more hp/ac in bear form then my bros warrior if he isn't using a shield.<br />
<br />
4k hp unbuffed at 60 would be a nice goal, pushing me pretty close to 5k bearformed. Would be nice, but I've still got a long way to go too.</div></div><hr />

Hps: 3300 and change when in MT role (swap +crit for +stam gear)<br />
<br />
I use the lesser absorption enchant on my chest and love it.  It's a 5% chance to absorb 25 points of damage and I believe it applies to all forms of damage. In other words it's like having a magic/melee shield on at all times, but it stacks with a shield as well. Every other slot gets +stamina. <br />
<br />
With my current setup I have abilities at the following defensive skills:<br />
54.5% - raw AC mitigation<br />
5% - absorption<br />
5% - block (spikes to 11% whenever I'm crit upon due to talents, which is nonstop in instances)<br />
6% - dodge<br />
11% - parry<br />
<br />
I can take one helluva beating in instances right now and I need to upgrade a bunch of smithed slots yet. We recently beat UM with 4 people (48, 47, 46, 41), with me at the end tanking Archadeus and one of the elite golems by myself, holding aggro and self healing.  Damn I love being a MT. :)</div></div><hr />

Haven't done any pvp since getting dire bear upgrade, before that I was using cat form and it was nice up till 40. <br />
<br />
I usually hit for about 125-200 or so normal hits, but pretty slow against  even con mobs. <br />
<br />
Last time I went to a pvp battle, the lag was so bad it was pointless. Hoping that they fix this because the large scale fights would be a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />

Good to see someone else using this.  I'm an enchanter, and talked our usual warrior into using it over the 50 hp enchant (as soon as I get the 100 hp one it's gonna be a tougher sell), but it seems to me that a chance at absorbing that much damage is more useful overall -- not like priests can complete heal anyways.  Need to do some parsing to see *just* how much it absorbs in an instance run.<br />
<br />

Level 54 priest<br />
2080 hp<br />

I figure I can hit 6k mana by 60 w/o really upgrading anything else, so hopefully some more upgrades and I'll be looking at 6500 when I get there.</div></div><hr />

I was heading in the Int/Spirit direction until I really noticed that I only had 550-ish HP.  Now I am about Int/Sta.  In the past week I have swapped out a lot of gear, gained 1 level and doubled my HPs.<br />

My level 38 Hunter on the other hand only has 1660 HP, but I am concentrating on Agi with him.  Right now he has almost a 21% chance to dodge.  :)  Need more Monkey items for him.</div></div><hr />

This is one of the few classes I think really needs agility, but, that is because a hunter caught is dead. I still think hunter with hps is better, but it isn't terribly apparent like other classes.<br />

60 hunters are one of my favorite foods btw, really, really easy to take down unless they jump you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I agree about spirit, Zatriz.  I worked out the effect of spirit once I learned that 4 spirit = FT1.  Say I work hard and get +100 spirit vs +100 sta, that's FT25 opposed to 1000 more hps.  25 mana every (second?  2 seconds?  what's a tick in wow?) means I'll get another 800 or so hp heal 20 ticks or so faster.  I think I'll keep lots of mana potions on hand, keep the hps, and do a good job of mana management.<br />
<br />
Alliance on our server are getting pretty bored and storming xroads more often, so I've gotten to play with em a lil more.  Smart hunters keep me snared and snipe me from far away, if I don't snare them right back, of course.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Spirit is also only really useful when you're not doing anything.  Mages get a Talent that allows some percentage of their mana regen to work while casting, but it's pathetic.<br />
