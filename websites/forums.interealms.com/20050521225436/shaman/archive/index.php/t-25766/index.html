<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tonight I bring you a story... The details are fuzzy, as it was 6:30 in the morning and all, but it went pretty much the same as I will describe.  This is the story of a pick-up Tipt expedition that would soon become a 5 and a half hour roller coaster through hell.  <br />
<br />
So I get a tell from a warrior wanting to know if I want to join a Tipt group.  I figure, sure why not? I get there and we have a group with a War, Bard, Enc, Cleric, Ranger and myself.  So we buff up and start our pulls, the kills are pretty easy and we start working up the steps looking for a mob to pet.  One pull gets an unfortunate add.  Chanter mezzes, ranger breaks, and the mob aggros me 'cause I slowed it.  Chanter mezzes again, ranger breaks, mob proceeds to beat on me again.  Chanter mezzes, warrior breaks, I go down.  There's the first death of the night.  Rest of the group is alright, though.  I get rezzed/buffed, and we keep on working up.  We get to the bridge with no luck on a pet, but it was no problem.  We pull the mob on the side, I throw sinia, slow it and get aggro.  I look around, no warrior to be found.  Instead he's just sitting there AFK.  I manage to keep myself up until he comes back and we kill the mob.  No biggie, just one AFK.  Pull the next mob, wait a few seconds, then slow.  Boom, aggro again and no warrior to be found.  Death #2.  Rez back in, get rebuffed and we move across the bridge, kill the next golem and then suddenly everyone has to AFK at once.  5-10 minutes later, everyone gets back and pull the second golem.  We back it up some, but our ranger in the back gets hit by the respawn in the back.  I get to work slowing the add and the chanter mezzes it.  Again, the ranger breaks mez, twice and I start getting pummeled again.  The chanter mezzes it again, but it gets broken again, only this time, by the chanter.  The chanter has happily dotted her own mezzed mob.  The warrior, who was still on the first mob, can't seem to hold enough aggro and it comes after me, so I go down.  Death # 3.  So I get another rez, and again, everyone has to go AFK.  Everyone comes back, we start pulling, we get a respawn behind again, and we manage to pick up a second add.  By some miracle of Moses, the mezzes don't get broken by someone.  The war, however, is completely oblivious to the fact that there's mobs around and it just looking off into space.  While we wait for him, the chanter is juggling mezzes and amazingly enough she doesn't die in the process.  Finally, we start killing them off one by one.  Next mob is a pooka and luckily we can pet it.  Another round of AFK ensues.  By the time everyone gets back, we have three adds and the chanter is kiting her pet around, yelling for someone to get it off, when in fact it's still charmed and was just following as told.  She finally realizes this and we start getting to work on killing the adds.  The warrior goes up to one and starts beating on it.  The mob starts beating back, so he runs off and starts &quot;kiting&quot; the mob for the snared pet, which doesn't quite work because the pet can't keep up.  The mob finally says screw the warrior and goes after the cleric.  A few well placed hits, boom, down.  Everything gets mezzed, I call the cleric, we start killing again.  The warrior again can't seem to keep aggro, someone else breaks a mez and I take the beating.  Death #4.    We start pulling the hill, and the cleric declares an RL emergency as his dad's car has broken down and he needs to get picked up.  We finish our mobs, and the cleric gates out.  I figure I can handle the healing while we break our way back down to the entrance since we've got the pet.  So we head back down the bridge again and start killing.  The bard pulls one, I slow it and get aggrod and the warrior just fidgets about.  I start spam healing myself to stay up, the bard yells for him to tank, but he doesn't move, instead he freaks out about &quot;what are we going to do?! we have no cleric?! What now?!&quot; Mob DPS catches up with me, boom, down.  Death #5 and wipe #1.  <br />
<br />
So the bard pulls the corpses to the ent, we find a new cleric and we begin again.  This time, we manage to make it up to the bridge with no incident.  We move up the next hill and the bard and I hold back a little before the momma room.  Sure enough, before I even get to ask who's gonna invis, there goes the rest in the group running straight into the room and setting off the trap.  By yet another miracle, we only get two mobs.  We clear through the rest of the room just fine and start up the next hill, getting a pet on the way.  We get to ghosts and again, in runs the group before I can get a word out of my mouth.  By miracle, we get only one mob.  We work ghosts, and the pet breaks, so the chanter is down there running in circles with her pet, not stopping to cast anything.  The ranger thinks about this for a second, and goes ahead and roots the pet.  The chanter then lets out a stream of obcenities at the ranger for being stupid enough to root the pet.  I casually say &quot;rooted pet &gt; dead chanter,&quot; seeing as if he hadn't rooted that pet, the chanter would have gotten rolled without a doubt.  We finish ghosts and now comes the fun part.  We move to the middle of the room where the hail mob spawns and the bard says to go ahead and hail.  The warrior then runs up and proceed to smack the hail mob.  The bard and I are like &quot;***?&quot; and we tell him to just die.  But no, the ranger has to start shooting off arrows at the thing and seeing the war close to death, here come the heals from the cleric.  The chanter finally gets it mezzed and all and we tell the others to camp out just to make sure aggro's cleared.  They come back in, regroup and the bard pulls the next mob.  As if the previous 5 minutes weren't enough, the chanter then sicks her pet on the hail mob, right as the bard pulls.  The warrior then starts smacking it again.  I go to slow the mob the bard pulled and get aggro since the warrior was busy elsewhere.  The cleric heals me and grabs aggro from my mob, I heal the cleric, but little did I know she had also healed the chanter and so we all got aggro on the hail mob.  And so death #6 and wipe #2 came about.  <br />
<br />
Chanter leaves, ranger leaves.  We grab a druid and another chanter. Luckily, we get through this trial completely flawlessy and Tipt is won, though not without death #7 on the boss, heh.  We kill the last few mobs, cross the bridge and kill the pet.  But it couldn't end that nicely.  Suddenly, our druid is dead.  We look around and sure enough he ran right off the cliff next to the port out.  <br />
<br />
And so that was the end of Tipt.  Unfortunately, I couldn't quite remember all the little details and annoyances of the group as it's 7:45 now and I haven't had a single bit of sleep.  But trust me when I say it was a group that would make your IQ go down.</div></div><hr />

That's when I would have gated out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sama it wouldnt have taken me that long... after the enchanter dotting the mezed mob would have been enough for me...<br />
<br />
pick up groups are the debil especially for trials like tipt and vexd.. best to wait it out and get a group of friends that you know can play and try it with them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What can I say, I was bored and I felt sorry for the bard.  He's the only one who seemed to know what the heck he was doing.  I would have felt bad if I left him to deal with those guys on his own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went through tipt 9 times before I finished my flag (which, incidently, was this past saturday), the group you had was a bang-up job, to be sure...but I can see things I would have done differently.<br />
<br />
1. your warrior sucked...no ifs, ands, or buts. to run through tipt, you should be able to chain slow at least for 2 casts before grabbing aggro. and thats before debuff, in my experience, only the cragbeasts are really resistant enough to merit a debuff, everything else, well, to quote someone somewhere &quot;Malosinia has the exact resist rate of Turgur's, if you can land sinia, you could land turgur's&quot;<br />
<br />
2. tipt respawns, obviously, you need to keep moving as fast as possible. I've only been in one tipt run where respawns caught up and wiped us. we were at the enraged matriarch, and we took too long on killing the little ones. mom spawned, and we had a repop in the tunnel where we pulled her, half-way through the fight.<br />
<br />
3. enchanter pet is nice to have, but slap some sense into him if he doesn't know how to do it right. my tipt success was done with no enchanter. the first &quot;flinty cragbeast&quot; you encounter can be charmed for a nice pet, just take the normal precautions with it. debuff it, and make sure the ranger keeps it snared.<br />
<br />
4. make sure you stay out of the way of hail mobs when people smack them. let the rest of your group die, and rez the cleric afterwards. explain to them why its really a bad idea to hit a hail mob, and then gate.<br />
<br />
5. ghost room/matriarch room/empty room before boss are safe spots after they are cleared. go AFK there, and try to aim for nowhere else. if someone goes AFK unannounced, there really needs to be a good reason...like someone has an eye out. you can be honest and say &quot;bio pls&quot;, and &quot;mom is yelling, need afk&quot;, and people will understand.<br />
<br />
6. you don't really need to fight your way out of any expedition. just leave the expedition, and you'll be ported out in about 30 seconds...if you have bodies in there, they will pop out in 15ish mins.<br />
<br />
not trying to make your life any harder, just pointing out some differences..I'm generally a patient person, and I'm just offering advice if you try to help someone else with tipt, or anyone who is doing tipt is reading this thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tipt was designed to keep the idiots in your 1st group from getting KT.  Any chanter on charm duty having a dot up is an idiot.  Additionally, the only safe AFK spots are in the rooms, if they AFK'd outside the room, then they deserved to die.<br />
<br />
BTW, did tipt this weekend on my mage (lvl66, elem/time geared).  Had a 14k/3kAC/25% shielding Paladin tanking.  Amazing how trivial it becomes.  We did wip though.  Got to riddler and bags took 1-2 minutes to spawn and the even though the turn in was correct, the pookas spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Any enchanter ever with a dot up is stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those two statements have got to be among the most accurate things I've ever seen posted on these boards.<br />
<br />
You lasted a lot longer than I would have. I'm too hot-tempered to take that kind of crap.<br />
<br />
Next time, don't waste your life feeling sorry for someone else (ie. not gating because you would have felt bad for the bard). Just get the hell out of there. If the bard had any sense, he'd have found a way to get out with you. If you would still feel bad leaving someone behind, carry a gate potion with you and give it to the person you're feeling bad for. That usually sends a rather clear message.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ssnafu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dang, Koush. You have been hanging out with Jnais too much! Kudos to you on preservariance. Um... you gonna to be awake for your final epic tonight?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Scary that I probably know who some of those clowns were.... <br />
<br />
And yes, you better not miss your epic fight tonight casue you overslept.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LOL Jnais has cursed me with numerous corpses.  Grats me for getting morans KT flagged! Thank god the zone is empty now.  I've done Tipt about 25 times or so now and I gotta say it was pretty amusing to watch these guys.  Was actually a good thing it took so long, too, 'cause I wanted to pull an all-nighter before my flight anyway.  As for the epic, I can only hope that the bus taking me back to school gets there when it says it will. Grr...</div></div><hr />

    Death # 3. So I get another rez, and again, everyone has to go AFK.<br />
<br />
That's when I would have gated out.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thats exactly what I would have done also. Left.  I just don't have enough time to spend all night with folks like that anymore (unless they are newbie friends.. hehe).</div></div><hr />
