<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone been there recently?  I had a hard time slowing mobs with Turgurs at 54 when I used to be able to slow easy at 49.  I want to chaulk it up to bad dice but it became very annoying.  POH is very easy and it didn't really matter that much but it was just really strange. I ended up having to use Plague o' Insects most of the time. Then Maestro ordered a round of McFlurries for all of the patchers which caused main to lose aggro very easily and a game of ping pong ensued :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
However drops were in high abundance, if we only had another 4 hours ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aye, my last trip to Hate came at a time when the Random Number Generator hated me--appropriately enough, for Hate.  <br />
<br />
Most things resisted at least the 1st cast of Turgur's.  Even at 49 and 50 I hadn't had that many resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Think it might just be a bad streak of luck.  Hope you didnt try slowing Maestro :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I was there the other night. I was able to slow most things on the first floor but the second floor was a waste of time for me. I am 54.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went there first at 49 and again recently at 51 (stayed on first floor) and I couldn't slow anything. Even after i got the chanter to tash and I cast malosi, turgurs would be resisted. I was wondering if I was just too low level or if I was just going through a long period of bad luck. heehee I was beginning to hate Hate! ;) All I could do was stand around and occasionally drop a heal on the chanter or cleric, which wasn't very exciting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, well I'm level 60, a lot of stuff in Hate I can slow fine, but I'll try to break it down for you.<br />
<br />
Clerics of Innoruuk are hard to slow, normally can be done after malosi and tash.  If someone can malo/mala, that's a definite plus, but if not, let the mage try malosi'ing if there is one.  Mages normally have an easier time landing malosi on the same mob.  If not, wait till the chanter tashes and try malise/malisement (keep both memmed so u can chain/alternate between the 2).  Once malise landed, then you can probably land slow.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the point is Clerics of Innoruuk have fairly high resists and have to have their resistances debuffed before trying to slow.<br />
<br />
Spite Golems, forget about them, they're immune to slow.<br />
<br />
Ahsenbone drakes, they're fairly resistant, and can generally be slowed after tash but... you have to be in melee range to be able to land something on them.<br />
<br />
The rest on first floor, except for nameds, is pretty easy to slow imo, like spectres, rats, evil little imps, chests, kira-whatevers, revs, ghouls, etc.<br />
<br />
Second floor is a nightmare to slow.  It can be done, but mobs have extremly high resists.  Need chanter to tash (level 56 tash if possible), bard for occlusion (level 55 mr debuffer song lasting 18 seconds so you might wanna let him chain it until slow sticks), shaman for malo or mage for mala.  Once tash, occlusion, and malo/mala have landed, then you have to chain malosini till it sticks as malosini does not generate much aggro.  If succeeded, then you can slow.  By that time, even if the slow is resisted, you shouldnt get aggro as the MT should have pissed it off plenty during the time it took to land all the prior debuffers.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, Innoruuk is slowable too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Wow thanks for the info.  I felt bad because after buffs are up I was just landing resists all night.  Luckily I have my trusty spear which never gets resisted..well almost never. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can actually slow Spite Golems with Insideous Decay and Plague of Insects. Its not that great of a slow, but it helps. I do it all the time. <br />
<br />
But mobs in Hate do have a ton of MR and most are difficult to slow without landing a good malo on them. The second floor totally sucks unless you have someone with an unresistable malo/mala to break their MR. At 59 I can't slow anything on the second floor without an unresistable debuff landing, then casting malosini.</div></div><hr />
