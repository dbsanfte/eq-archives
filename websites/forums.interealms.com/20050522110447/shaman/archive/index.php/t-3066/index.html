 <br />
okay here is what i got so far, click the second profile to see what im getting (or will get very soon)<br />
<br />
please all your super wis shaman out there leave your imput on what i should go for....<br />
<br />
ps..looking for a place to hunt at 45..(have max def, and a JBB, lots focus items)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Swampserver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ok I don't want to hurt your feelings or anything but if I were you I would seriously try to upgrade your gear a bit, it's pure garbish.<br />
<br />
Seriously what do you want you are allready uber enough for a lvl.60. Hunting? head to dreadlands or greater divide maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ditch the boots and the serpentine bracer (I don't care what focus effect is on that crappy thing).  <br />
<br />
The rest of the gear is stunning for your level, I don't know why you keep posting here for gear advice when your gear is better than a lot of 60 shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gloriana, I think you answered your own question.  Although, I also tend to believe that you post here so much because your sig is better than the rest of ours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Something must be screwy with Magelo's calculating system.<br />
There's no way his AC/ATK can be that low with the gear he has.  Even naked, there's no way it can be that low.<br />
<br />
But yes, you have damn good gear already. <br />
There are things I would suggest upgrading but I keep remembering you are pre-50, so many of them would not do you much good.<br />
For future reference, however, JB Helm could be upgraded to one of the Velious quest helms, and Eboots (while nice for the Haste and WIS) could also be replaced with Velious quest (maybe you can switch between them when you want to melee).<br />
Looks like you might already be doing this, but after you land your DoTs switch out the Serpentine for the JBB.<br />
And if don't mind taking the WIS hit, trade your harpoon for a Gorgana Idol.<br />
<br />
That's about all I can offer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is a great sig, isnt it?<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
Saraquael is working with a company to offer coffee cups, t-shirts and mouse pads illustrated with his drawings.  I think I'm just going to have to get a Saraquael &quot;Gloriana&quot; coffee cup.  And maybe mouse pad.  And maybe a t-shirt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Besides the fact that it looks like a Scottish Elf ? ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I'd go a little more AC but that's just me.  I DESPISE the whole Grape Ape look to be honest (nathsar) but that's just me.  JB Arms.. maybe ditch the GEBS as no self respecting shaman wears druid boots ;)<br />
<br />
JMO and I continue to state I'm an HP/AC disciple.</div></div><hr />
