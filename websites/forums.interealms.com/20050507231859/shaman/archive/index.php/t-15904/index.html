<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I ground out 60, scribed torpor (what a feeling), went on a long grind into SolC and found a ring event with a spider that if you can get to you should definitely do for fun and was given the earring drop that has good stats and 1 hp per tick effect. Yaeth 118R also dropped from the main spider.<br />
<br />
Now it is off to 61 for the new pet. I did notice that while the last blue bub of 59-60 took forever it took about 1/5th of that time to get one blue bub into 60.<br />
<br />
No real reason for this, so no responses necessary, just wanted to actually get it off my chest that I made it through 59, by far the worst level I have encountered.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">64 is the worst level ever :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Welcome out of hell Karshak_rn!<br />
<br />
64 is the worst level ever<br />
<br />
59 was the worst level ever.  61 to 65 were easier than level 29 and 30.  64 took about 12 hours in the deep hobgoblin caves (easiest Tier 1 xp to be had).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>butuglia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">59 by far the worst level. Actually 54 to 60 was far far worse than 60 to 65. I did 60 percent of 64 in about 10 hours in pov with troll penalty. Blehh shudders thinking of level 59 again,,,<br />
<br />
And btw grats on 60 cool level to attain</div></div><hr />
