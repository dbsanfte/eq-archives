<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Prexus_Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Mainly looking for best bang for buck for AAXP and Regular XP ...  Both have Omens, Mage is VT and Equivalent Gear and Shammy is baz / PoP tier2 geared or so, 150+ AA on mage 5 on shammy.. been trying like mad to level to 65... Want Q pretty Badly...  <br />
<br />
Anyway, was trying to think of places that I can run this 2box effectively for max Experience.... Thinking maybe NC with mage pet taunting / rooting and dogdog chewing on the rear, can use that strategy in the instances in Draniks too I think... Maybe Harbingers.. I'm gonna go try Harbingers tonight, and maybe NC....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone got any more ideas? Main toon I'm trying to level is of course my shaman. Mage more for pet tank and nukes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dogs and elementals don't work well together.  Use just the magician pet.  66 air pet is mighty-mighty, anyhow, you won't miss dogdog too terribly.  If you can, get Spirit of the Leopard!<br />
<br />
Harbingers is lower level than NC I think.  Do NC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Never had a problem w/ mage pets tanking and dogdog chewing away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/pet taunt off<br />
<br />
he won't pull agro from a mage pet.<br />
<br />
I would skip the instances as NC seems to give better exp. and there are many camps that are single pullable and pose little risk to your setup.  A solid group there or even WoS if you can find one would push you into 65 a lot faster tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, the last time I bothered having a magician pet tank for me was when I still played my magician, I apologise if my information on that is out of date :)<br />
<br />
What I recall was that pet agro (in it's last incarnation while I was working with it) was so heavily proximity based that no matter how much Taunting was done, no matter how many procs or how much damage, the closer pet would be the one tanking.  Since wolves are smaller than elementals or skeletons, that was always the shaman pet, who was least able to take the beating.  So shaman that I played with never bothered with the dog.<br />
<br />
It's good that the situation has changed, I guess they've cleaned up that agro code :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Prexus_Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I went ahead and sat in NC at the Pack / Pixt camp, between the two I was able to kill the death howler PH's with enough time to med / heal / rebuff before the next one came thru. Got named twice, got a minor rune and a regular muramite rune and that mask that seems to drop every time !  Only thing that's dicey is that the 66 air pet knocks the bejeebers outta the mobs all the way up the walls, and sometimes they get too close to the adds in front or behind where I have my camp set up, so I have to root them occasionally.  Having dogdog chewing on the back isn't really working, the air pet knockback make it so hes actually chewing from the front after about 30 seconds... But the riposte isn't too bad on him, and with taunt off he doesnt get aggro unless I have to throw a hasty root on a fleeing mob.... and he happens to be too close.  <br />
<br />
I'm curious if WoS mobs might be better xp... Or are there some other areas ? I'm looking for highest per mob xp gain.  Any more ideas I'd love to hear them.   Thanks !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Do /pet guard on one side of the canyon.  Pull to the middle and sic the pet once the mob is there, so that it pushes right up the wall.  That camp is a good one for you, I think, until you get the much stronger Quiescence &amp; Yoppa healing.</div></div><hr />
