<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I know I shouldn't have bought persistent minion at my level of AAness, but heck, I like the puppy, so tried it out.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that no rent mage summoned items stay on him no matter how long you're logged out.  Now if I could just somehow remember to always suspend him before I log...  Hmm, maybe I should make a hotkey that suspends and then camps - then at least I just have to remember to use that instead of /camp. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, it was something I kind of wondered about and hadn't seen posted here, so thought I would make it known if others were thinking about this AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I refuse to use the new pet until they make it stronger.  The level 68 SK pet, Son of Decay, hits for 65 max, which is 4 or 5 more than ours hits for.  Ours is level 63, theirs is level 60.  And most people will agree that SKs are not a pet class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, the new pet situation is rather unfortunate, although that's independent of persistent minion.<br />
<br />
Sadly, the new pet is the only 66+ spell I have atm. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Another handy thing about Persistent Minion -- the suspended pet will stay with you when getting rezzed across a zone line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With Persistent Minion and /pet hold, my only wish is that old Plane of Mischief was still around so I could get him dual wielding BLAM STICKS again.  Raises his max hit to 75 or so and let's him proc a knockback DD.  Then you toss on some nifty +dex armor and a haste item or 2 and you got a pet to finally be considered.</div></div><hr />
