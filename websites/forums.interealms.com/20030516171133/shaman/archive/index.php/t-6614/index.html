<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, this is my first time posting here.  Really didn't even know this place existed until recently.  I'm going to post an introduction on the main err...General site, but I thought I would ask a question here first.<br />
<br />
I two box with a monk (lvl 53), who should be epic sometime soon.  Anyway's i'm only 44 at the moment, for reason's I will explain in the general post.<br />
<br />
Anyway's I was wondering where if anywhere that Duo could go for some nice xp.  Luclin is pretty much out, as it eats my second computer up.  I also only play during prime time, so Chardok, HS, and the Hole are alway's and I mean always camped.<br />
<br />
The places I have tried are BW:  This is ok, but I can't seem to find a place were I don't get adds, plus I think I (the shaman) need a few more lvls to hunt here with the monk effectivly.<br />
<br />
The Hole:  Like I said before this is usually camped on my server.  However, if not it is an awesome place, but once agian I think I need a few lvls to adequatly hunt here.  The El's are notorius for resisting root at the best of times, and with me being only 44 they pretty much do it all the time.<br />
<br />
Chardok: Camped<br />
<br />
HS:  Need more lvls<br />
<br />
Dreadlands: Yettie Caves, (Glaciur).  Is ok, but xp comes about as fast as a snail on valium.<br />
<br />
So that's about all iv'e tried, and any suggestions would be great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kaku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">COM(city of mist)  is nice place  i duo with a 48 monk or a 54 monk other times there and i was 44 , i like the backside of Com , atleast on 7th hammer server the place is empty most of the time( atleast when i was there) unless there was a reaver raid,  i believe i was there till i was 51 or 52, sow works there and your are able to bind others there so no nasty CR to worry about. just my thought on a place GL !!!!!</div></div><hr />
