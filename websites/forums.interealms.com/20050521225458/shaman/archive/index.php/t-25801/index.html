EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath beta NDA lifted. <br />
<br />
So tell us about it you people from beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just based on my short term observations - it is a BEAUTIFUL expansion. The zones and mobs are absolutely gorgeous.<br />
<br />
At one point, I climbed a huge mountain - the higher I got the snowier the mountain got. At the top, there were two beautiful, oriental, gold dragons. It was amazing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice looking art, I am really looking forward to this expansion. Dragons are the untimate to me. Nothing wrong with killing &quot;Gods&quot; but lately the models have gotten a bit boring on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, nice pics. Interesting they'd use an oriental theme.  I'm not crazy about the Giraffe/Dragon models, but that golden dragon is stunning.<br />
<br />

:D:D:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So how BIG is it?  And no, I don't mean instanced stuff either.<br />
<br />
Is DoN the second coming of Kunark/Velious or is it closer to LoY?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heh the picture of the DE corpse in the screen above that one is the body of the guy who said that about 5 seconds after he said it lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's rather large actually. It has mid level/low level zone up to a zone where you probably want to be 65+ or maybe even only 70 to walk through. Alot of yellows to 70 just wandering around in some of the places. Everything looks great, encounters look great, it just looks like it's going to be incredibly fun. I didn't get to do beta much because of school, but I got to see a good deal of it and I know my way around now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wow, amazing shots ... thanks for posting! Interesting oriental theme going on, and the giraffe-dragons (while a bit odd looking — since when do dragons have goatees?) are ten times better looking than the walking-snake-people, rock-monsters, and emaciated elf-ghosts we got bombarded with in Gates of Discord. Intriguing.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Haxot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">eh, I prefer the anglo/western dragon models.<br />
<br />
But oriental dragon theme'd is a hundred times better then this cross-dimensional trip and magic continent popping that's been going on ~_~<br />
<br />
Eventualy,, it starts to lose touch with the basics. <br />
<br />
Will be odd, conquering DoN whiletaking on mobs from another dimension... ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How much do the various mobs (including yard trash) mitigate slows throughout this expansion?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wow that looks amazing.... too bad I'm now 3 expansions behind behind quitting. They throw the expansions in, I might come back.. :)<br />
Everyone else have fun. I'm glad SOE realized where it should be.<br />
*edit*<br />
Yea, your right Gloriana Excelent right up. I'm debating  if I want to come back to try this one. It sounds like they actually put some effort... listened to everyone. Still features I'd like to see doesn't look like there in there, but we'll see. <br />
Good luck on everyone who gives this a try. As much as *I* want to, I will probably indeed pass this one up.<br />
<br />
Eat a peach, be happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">well, I've kinda been a little low on HD space, what with all the naruto anime stored on it, so I don't have any SS's to share this round, but it really doesn't look like I need to.<br />
<br />
the zones are beautiful. what more can I say. the shots posted by Boon sum up alot of the new models.<br />
<br />
I like the interpretation of &quot;Kirin&quot; (kind of difficult for me to explain, but think &quot;Japanese Unicorn&quot;)<br />
<br />
I think it will be a good expansion. still...pushed out a bit fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i've never seen a dragon IRL before. what are they supposed to look like?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">well, I've kinda been a little low on HD space, what with all the naruto anime stored on itLOL, I'm downloading episodes 51-75 as I type this. Rock Lee vs Gaara = ****in ownage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">nice pictures, the seahorse dragons look crap though.<br />
Edit. Reading that write up I might start playing again just to see this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have ALL the episodes up to 120, 121 raw was released yesterday. so yeah....running a little low :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">BTW, the giraffe looking things are probably supposed to be Kirin.  They aren't dragons, but they kick a lot more booty IMO.<br />
<br />
  Kirin tend to be more reclusive and less well known, but they are FAR wiser and much more powerful, it's just that they aren't known for using that power much (cause they're wise you know, and that means wimpy and hesitant). ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I would think they are Kirin as in the first screenshot I took the thing is called A_Kirin_Wanderer_00</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well so they are.  Dang reading comprehension just shot me in the foot again (and they said I'd never use that school stuff in the real world... or was that me who said it?)<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Somethin just occured to me.<br />
<br />
  Bandolier + TA + 1.5 = TEH WIN!1!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Bandolier appears to be primary, secondary, range and ammo. <br />
<br />
Anyone have any confirmation that Bandolier will allow us to equip 1.5 and click TA?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I did not get to test it while in beta but I think with the Bandolier it would take 3 button presses to slow with the TA, press button 1 to equip TA, press slow hotkey, press button 3 to reset to 1.5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">You can set bandolier to autoswitch by just clicking the weaponset you want. So you could have 1.5 up, click the list for TA, slow, then click back for 1.5. It really only takes a couple seconds because it switches weapons instantly if you have autoswitch activated. So basically 3 clicks like he said. It's really nice to switch out proc weapons, stat weapons, and TA easily. Potion belt is pretty crappy cause I haven't been able to stick any of my clicky items in it. I think you can only use stuff like tinkering shrink devices or invis devices along with potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hrm, bandolier might also make those throw potions somewhat useful.  My main problem with them is that it has to be in both ammo and range, so takes time to swap them in if you want to maintain the stats/focus effect of your range item.<br />
<br />
  Though I did hear the resist rates were pretty bad on most of them.  Maybe we'll get some new ones that aren't so bad though if they do indeed raise caps on TSs (and include alchemy/poisonmaking/research in the deal).<br />
<br />
<br />
 And yeah, if you remap your hotkeys just right, you could make it so it is something like:<br />
<br />
Q:  Swap TA in as main weapon<br />
A:  Click main weapon<br />
Z:  Swap 1.5 in as main weapon<br />
<br />
<br />
  so with a quick 3 button press down the side of the board you cast off a mana free slow and barely notice the loss of 1.5 stats and effects.  Only problem would be accidentally hitting the &quot;A&quot; key while you have the 1.5 up and kicking off the HoT (a shaman accidentally CAUSING health... man, canni-death is rollin in it's grave)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did the beta very extensively and found everything that i slowed - slowed after proper maloes/tashing first...never got the &quot;can not be slowed&quot; message.......BUT..that was in beta and everything changed there daily.<br />
<br />
Some things Idid not like:<br />
<br />
LFG window displays player AA amount...this will hurt many players from getting groups imhm.<br />
<br />
Dreedlands zone looks like nothing but grey boring.....other zones are nice.<br />
<br />
Pet pathing was a big problem.<br />
<br />
And last but not least...there are dsome see invis mobs at some zone zone ins :-(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>leibeast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">*feeling happy* that i choose to do levels as i got runes, and heavily AA=)<br />
<br />
i had a feeling that beyond making me a better player (in terms of abilities and durability etc...) for my level, some day it would actually matter....<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
sounds like aterriffic expansion, can't wait to get it, and Wooohoo on the bandolier and potion belt...most excellent!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">nothing against those who recently got to 70 and don't have a lot of AA's but I kinda wish they had an option to enable people to see your aa's in the lfg tool. <br />
<br />
IE default is no one sees it. But if you enable it anyone looking can see yours. Would help for classes like tanks to differentiate between a paper tank and one with defensive aa's completed. It does make a huge difference - expecially for some classes.</div></div><hr />

I know a tank on my server.<br />
He has around 350 AAs.<br />
He has max tradeskill AA<br />
every<br />
single<br />
tradeskill<br />
AA<br />
Salvage, the works.<br />
<br />
Aye, a very unique case, but jsut somehting to show you may wind up with a paper tank even with knowing how many AAs they have</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">max Tradeskill aa's is 141, by my count. He could still squeeze in LR10 ID10 &amp; hp stuff!  No damage aa, of course, or +attacks stuff, so his agro has to be terrible...</div></div><hr />
