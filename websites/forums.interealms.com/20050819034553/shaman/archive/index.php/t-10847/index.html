<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>a11e</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 2-boxer.  I have played most classes together at one time or another.  When I select player combinations, I like to look for synergies.<br />
<br />
There are a few combinations that I have found work really well in some situations (outdoors for example).  Once in a while, I find combinations that can work well in many areas.  Sometimes combinations only work well together for a certain range of levels.<br />
<br />
One of the best overall combinations I have found is a shaman and a necromancer.  Granted, the necromancer gets more out of the pairing than a shaman gains.  Necros get better mana regen (especially at lower levels - shaman don't start to catchup till later in life).  This allows the necro to cast alot more spells than a shaman can.  <br />
<br />
In this grouping the necro provides the damage and snares while the shaman buffs, slows, regens, helps crowd control with roots, heals, SOWs and occassionally gets to cast a DOT or nuke.  Most of the time my shaman has less than half mana while my necro is approaching full mana.<br />
<br />
So why do necros think a shaman is the best possible duo partner?  Shaman fill in the few gaps that necros have.  They provide all important regeneration, slows, spot heals, buffs, SOWs for outdoor work and traveling.  Shaman's excellent armor and stamina allow them to be the puller (when FD splitting isn't a requirement) and tank a bit permitting necros to pile on the DOTs.<br />
<br />
My biggest beef about EQ is the built in downtime.  Nothing worse than having to med for extended periods of time.  Necros get the best mana regen in the game.  Higher level shaman have the second best mana regen.  The beauty of 2 casters is that when you want to vacate a location, you can just gate out.  You can also bind right outside a dungeon should you wish to.  This reduces downtime a great deal.<br />
<br />
If you do a search on the necro boards, shaman are selected as the best partner for a necro by a wide margin.  Having played this combination, I can see why.  Both classes are arguably among the most powerful in the game in their own right.  Together, they are even more so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i just like to group with the cute dark elf females that are so sweet to me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did this combo for  a very long time until my dear friend necro quit eq for school.  We could do just about anything together, and probably did at one time or  another hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what about a chanter with DC and a shaman ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">DC is so five minutes ago.  <br />
CoD (High level charm) is current.  <br />
If such a chanter actually deigned to group, they would group with a druid not a shaman, because the druid can snare the charmed mobs, making the entire thing much more safe.  Plus if there are animals in the zone, the druid can add a charmed pet to the mix.  <br />
<br />
Necro/Shaman combo is undeniably strong.  I have done it many times, tho less since my good friend who played a necro quit.  It was simply amazing how well we stacked.  If the situation called for root n' rot, we could both contribute well.  If the mob needed to be tanked, I can handle that.  If we needed CC we both could handle that part.  He eventually got the group manatap spell but we found that just slowed the duo down as it cost too much mana to him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fumeden Ex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My brother plays a 63 shaman, and we almost always duo together.  This is a really powerful combo, I swear there isnt too much we cant do.  Mobs hit too hard to keep his pet alive?  np, root/rot (id also like to mention just how awesome pet discipline is) .  dead in CoD? cant find a cleric?  no worries, between the 2 of us we have a bank of alts for sacrificing and ill take a 93% rez over no rez anyday.  For even more excitement, throw in a cleric. awesome trio..tanks need not apply, in fact we routinely turn tanks away (not guildies tho ) in favor of mages/druids/another shaman or just about any other caster, mage or cleric being our favorite......ahhh surround me with necros and mages and im a happy shaman.</div></div><hr />

At level 64 I'm going to bet there's less than 20 shamans serverwide who DON'T have horses.  Horses = medding while canni, case you didn't know =)  And yes, shaman are best mana regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'll take Torpor over the pact line for mana regen, thanks. I'll take the necro pet over dogdog, however. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact I've never even seen a horse in EQ except on the occasional mob model where it's built in.  I've never had the model on.<br />
<br />
I'm one of the elite 20!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">CanniV:<br />
It takes 1924 hitpoints from the Shaman to give them 1200 mana back.<br />
<br />
Every 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
So, thats 1k mana in 3 minutes, after a Torpor.<br />
<br />
1 minute = 10 ticks. So, without using anything BUT CanniV thats 33 mana/tick.<br />
<br />
Now, toss in Canni 4's.<br />
<br />
Self: Reduce Hitpoints (148) <br />
Self: Increase Mana (82) <br />
<br />
For ease, lets just say you cast Canni 4.... 3 times a minute.<br />
<br />
that is neg 450 hps, and pos 240 mana/min, and once every 3 mins you will lose another 200 mana for torpor.<br />
<br />
So, in 3 minutes, you gain 520 mana, which is another 17 mana per tick.<br />
<br />
So being conservative, we've goten to 50 mana/tick.<br />
<br />
Oh, and our mana regen stacks with all enchanter mana regen buffs.... like KEI... Necro's doesn't.</div></div><hr />

nope, you're just not using all means at your disposal to the best to your groups ability.<br />
If you don't need the FT 20+, that's fine.  But if you can't swap spells after slow because you can't sit down without drawing aggro from the tank, that's just a waste of potential.</div></div><hr />

1066 Mana. EXACT SAME RATIO AS CANNI 3-4<br />
<br />
Not to mention that lich only does 66% damage to necros, so SoS is really doing like 41 a tick.</div></div><hr />

exploiting a mobs inability to summon you through the teleporter is bad mkay?</div></div><hr />

I hate them, i hate the way they move, the way its a pain to cancel spells (cant duck), annoying graphics, way they get in the way targetting, take up a buff slot etc... Ive read the posts on horses and how to get around the issue somewhat, but i just dont like them.<br />
I dont run out of mana, and dont consider myself not to doing my job properly.<br />
Just a personal preferance.<br />

that is because  you don't canni dance during fight; shaman's regen rate = 1.5-2x necro's mana regen rate <br />

Horse &gt;= Canni5; especial for those don't have torpor yet or below lvl60; I don't understand why you don't love this, I have enough mana before get canni5 too but I still use canni5 everytime it pop since I can nuke more than before which is part of fun</div></div><hr />
