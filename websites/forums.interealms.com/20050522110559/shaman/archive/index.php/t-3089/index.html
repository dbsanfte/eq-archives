<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tekish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was at work surfing the net and came across this little babby.<br />
Regent Symbol of Innoruuk<br />
Neck slot<br />
Effect: Clinging Darkness (snare)<br />
Type: Triggered <br />
Charges: Unlimited<br />
<br />
Having a lvl 51 druid I know how helpfull being able to snare a MoB can be. No runners in dungeons, more time to cast spells on the run etc. etc. <br />
<br />
My bro rerolled a BL, and even tho he is lvl 17 I could cath up pretty fast.<br />
Bearing in mind i'm not familar w/ this spells snare speed I was wondering if any of you inny worshipers have this and if you think its worth dumping my 25 cat man shammy and rerolling just for it.  I know I would loose access to alot of towns but hey, that troll regain is nice too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is.   Plus you will get regen.   I dumped my shaman at 35 for it and I don't regret it.  I am 60 now and I use it everyday when duo'ing and soloing in dungeons.  I don't know what I would do without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, depends. I've gone 55 levels with people telling me Cazic Thule was the &quot;wrong&quot; choice for a troll deity. /shrug<br />
<br />
If you think you can get your new character to 25 again quickly, fair enough, go for it. No single item makes or breaks the shaman class though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fubah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">honestly.. i think this item sucks = /<br />
<br />
I had it since lvl 20.  I rarely use it, of course.   First... the mob STILL tries to run a bit after you snare it, since the snare is so low level and not even close to druid's lvl 1 snare.   Second... Casting it is like.. 6 secs.  and it gets resisted quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I think it's not worth it to reroll for it..<br />
I now wish i made an ogre shaman though heh..  only 3hp less regen at the high end, but unstunable from front makes it worth it imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sentok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not sure it's worth re-rolling, but I can tell ya about the neckpiece.<br />
<br />
It's got fairly decent stats in and of itself. AC, wis.<br />
<br />
It lasts 36-42 seconds, and is not a huge snare effect. They still run, just not as fast.   It takes 6 seconds to cast, so channeling it is tough to do if you are the one getting beat on. <br />
<br />
Biggest thing though, is that I get resisted fairly frequently on it. Maybe 10-12% of the time. <br />
<br />
It's a nice toy to have, as is the troll regen. It's a little over-rated though, it's not a game-breaker.  If you are looking to do a regular group, and you don't have a snarer, it could well be worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fubah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">LMAO almost same post and same time even...<br />
wacked! twilight zone no doubt!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I gotta hit post faster so I can get the glory, and not look like a copycat :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tekish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm 2 yes's and 2 no's, hehe.<br />
I dont like making a char over again and then I would have to buy all the spells again for 250-300pp but this item just seems really sweet :) <br />
Decisions Decisions</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tekish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Another question I had about this spell:<br />
Does anyone know if mobs that can not be rooted or snared will be effected by this spell? since its a dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you plan on being absolutely insanely uber some day, believe it or not CT is the way to go.<br />
<br />
You will be able to do Iksar quests for Cudgels.  Just look them up, asses the 20 played hours you'll have to put into faction repair, and decide from there.  They are phenominal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you think you can get to 25 quickly then go for it. I'd kill for snare, even if its a low level snare, and gets resisted. It's FREE ! <br />
When it sticks it's gravy ! When they get low on health and try to run its like they are rooted, it's awesome ! <br />
<br />
But don't be mistaken, after using a druid for so many levels you'll be disappointed in Clinging Darkness. But a low level snare is better than no snare at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">/sigh<br />
<br />
lv 4 darkness is not the same as &quot;sanre&quot; that you see druid/ranger using.<br />
<br />
just make a necro and try it out.see how much it slows a mob .witness it yourself, you won't believe it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It stops runners fine.  Yes, most mobs will made it a couple steps before they completely stop, but only a couple.  Then they stand there with their back to you waiting to be eaten by your poodle.  This is one of my very favorite items, and makes dungeon soloing an order of magnitude safer and more convenient, especially in dungeons where mobs have that mystical indoor SoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye! And SoC!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I rather use a swollen fungus beastgland for the emergancy snare. OTher then that, better off with CT, and get the fear items.  fun places to exploit fear =). <br />
<br />
<br />
Iksar cudgels are nice tho. and Ez enuf to get once you have the faction. Too bad the EFFECT STILL DOESNT WORK!, those bastards. <br />
<br />
<br />
im an iksar and im amiable in Paineel so im like who cares =). <br />
<br />
<br />
Btw those fear necks are fun to use. <br />
<br />
not that useful but fun!<br />
<br />
Still waiting for the jbb.  THo spear isnt as good rather have it as a proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Rerolling is totally worth it in my opinion...especially at 25 bro. Stopping runners without root is an incredible advantage no matter what anyone is going to tell you. Your not going to be wasting any hp for you or your pet from a rooted mob....cast time= not bad enough to not channel through 90% of the time at higher lvls.....effect duration= recast as many times as you need....in theory you could keep a mob snared indefinitely with clinging darkness depending on resists.<br />
<br />
I use it -all- the time if there is no one with a better snare present...its worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It will stop runners at very low health and that's about  all it will do unless you count a 30 damage DOT as something. It will stop giants at least up to those in BW or GD, never needed to use it in Kael as was always grouped. The same with Seafuries, BW Sarnaks, stuff in TT and EJ and most stuff of that level.<br />
<br />
It is almost worthless on EARLY runners, unless they are dotted they won't stop because health isn't low enough.<br />
<br />
As far as snaring on full health mobs I use this to pull junk so I have something to use my gate hammer on and it won't even snare a S. Ro Orc enough to be noticible.<br />
<br />
Added This is not saying that it is not fun and useful, just that it has limits and it doesn't replace our Popiel Pocket Druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Another CT vs Inny thread .. <br />
<br />
My answer is CT .... fear necks own in all the right places.... Loio, BW, and my latest trick non-named snakes in da grey....<br />
<br />
Now .. on to more IMPORTANT matters... when the hell they gonna finish the 3rd fear neck.... heh .. that would OWNZ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It's damn cool in any indoor zone with shaman mobs. Nothing like having a shaman get loose and bring back some friends to spoil your evening... especially when they run fast enough to catch up to you and your mad dash for the zone.<br />
<br />
Doesn't seem awfully dependable but in most duo/trio situations you'll get a few tries to cast it and more often than not one will stick. It it bounces a few you can still root it, but I find root even less reliable.<br />
<br />
Definately not a game breaker though. It's a toy and should be thought of as such.<br />
<br />
/agree Gheff !<br />
When the hell are they going to complete the rest of them?!?!?!? I know you trolls have it rigged because you fear my mighty Ogre Yalup!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sepisis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I never used this thing when I was lower level.  Mid levels in DL I didn't click it.  Post 50 I use it almost every fight.  I solo and duo with a monk a lot so my necklace gets constant use for stopping fleeing mobs.  However, its not ensnare.  Its not even close to snare.  It wont let you kite or give you the ability root rot with the ease of a druid.  It barely slows the mob down.  The only thing its good for is stoping runners.  Still,  its a nice ability.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you're power leveling with that druid 25 levels is nothing big (hello SolA).  SLN, thorns, chloro and 3 gobs beatin on you keeps that defense skill up.  Just be sure to stop every once and a while and raise your casting skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Max snare on clinging is 30% and 30dmg so not great but better then no snare at all i guess, a bit short duration though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dredak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I use my snare necklace CONSTANTLY.<br />
<br />
Like someone else mentioned, I duo most often with a monk friend of mine.  An amazing combo, and I use this item in almost every fight.<br />
<br />
If you are the sort of shammie that seeks out large groups all the time, then someone else will most likely be on snare detail, but I avoid large groups usually, because I get much better exp in 2 or 3 person groups, or soloing.<br />
<br />
The thing to remember is that it is really only useful for stopping runners, especially in dungeons.  The other thing to remember is that this is a BIG DEAL if you have no one else snaring.  Root can break or just not stick, and then its train time.  Who needs the aggravation of chasing mobs through a dungeon trying to get em rooted?  Especially those miraculously indoor-SoWed ones.<br />
<br />
As far as being resisted, i have never noticed this being resisted more often than root or my druid's snare.  I use it again and again and again and honestly it sticks more often than my druids snare or root, or my enchies root either, so I don't understand where this 'oft-resisted' argument comes from.<br />
<br />
OMG this item helps so much, I don't understand when folks naysay it.  I don't see how a fear necklace would be near as useful, so please enlighten me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't know so much naysay on the most part but an understanding of what it can and cannot do. You know how it works, I know how it works but still there is a general perception outside of Shaman that this will make you a ShammiedR00d.<br />
<br />
I'm not a big fan of building a character based on a single piece of equipment anyway but if one must , do it on something like a JBB or Fungi and not on this trinket. It's good indeed but not THAT good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I gotta say I love my snare necklace and wear it about 80% of the time. Its invaluable for soloing in a duo. The stats are not bad. In my case it gets resisted maybe 10% of the time and I can almost alway channel thru and get it to stick after the 3rd attempt. <br />
<br />
I got mine at 24 and have used it constantly all the way to 48. I can't see that changing either. <br />
<br />
Cazic thule would not be bad either. Fear necklace and easier access to Cabilis and the iksar shammy quests. Either way, as long as you are a troll life is gud.</div></div><hr />

It's near useless outdoors but makes dungeoning so much easier.<br />
The duration is short and the cast time long but if you don't leave it until the last second there is plenty of time left.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If you don't solo, the necklace would be of not a lot of use for you. If you DO like to solo, it is very handy. The snare necklace makes shamans ability to solo in dungeons tons better. Throw it on mobs with SoW early in the fight to get rid of SoW. Now the mob wont be so fast. Start casting it near 35% health. You should be able to land that, get in two bracer blasts, then reapply snare (this is the safe way and should give you time to redo it if this one is resisted...if you wanna risk it you can get in three bracer blasts usually). The snare necklace makes soloing in some spots viable and much easier. I solo in the Illis jail in Sebilis sometimes. Without the snare necklace, I don't know if this would be that  viable. It isnt that great of an idea for a shaman to go chasing his mob out of a cell and run into another two illis and a krup or something like that hehe. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, if I were your level, and level 25 is quite easy to get back to, I would reroll the character yes. If you ever like to solo, and you don't want to be confined to root-rotting or kiting like you may have done lots of with your druid, then the snare necklace (even though it is not even as good as the lowest level druid snare) is a godsend.</div></div><hr />
