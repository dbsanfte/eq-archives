<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darngudlukenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was grouped with a druid last night who kept saying that he could one hit kill me in a duel (me 62 shaman most spells but any of the 60s vs. a 65druid) so at the end of fight i said fine ill duel him was a pretty quick fight i owned him with myself self buffed and unbuffed pet after the fight he started whining saying druids are underpowered and shamans get everything?? then the rest of the group aggred with him. since when did people start thinking that shamans are way overpowered and druids are way underpowered this is the first time i have herd this dont know if it was just the people i was with or if all druids think this. but what would make them think druids are underpowered lol? then the rest of the night i had to listen to him saying how druids need  quote &quot;uber pets&quot; heh. i told him that is what charm is for =P. guess this is kinda a pointless thread but i am unable to play everquest right now and am very very bored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as druids and balance goes i think druids are fine. They are pretty effective healers and descent nukers. Thrown in charmed or dire charmed pets and they do quite well.<br />
<br />
As far as using pvp for balance thats pointless. There are too many other variables in pvp and things are different as far as what's useful and what isn't. A good druid tho should do well in pvp. Effective heals and nukes combine make them formitable foes. Compair equally skilled and equiped/aaed shaman and a druid and i'd say the shaman should win simply because neither should be able to kill the other till they run out of mana and the shaman will outlast the druid on mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Any druid that says thier class is underpowered is an idiot.<br />
<br />
Their heals are second only to clerics.<br />
Their nukes are 3rd best, behind wiz and Mage<br />
Their dots have a -100 resist mod to them, making them harder to resist besides the fact that the are good dots to begin with<br />
They get group and self ports<br />
They have snare, one of the best utilities in the game<br />
They are one of the best soloing classes<br />
They make an incredible addition to a group, and in most cases can replace clerics as main healers.<br />
<br />
Sounds like the druid you faced was whiny that he/she didnt have slow.  Just tell him/her to give it some time; Im sure that eventually the folks at SoE will get tired of hearing druids bitch about that and will get slow too.  And probably find a way to nerf slows effectiveness more than it already is (ie mitigation)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There's a lot of retarded druids out there who make assumptions like this based on a very narrow view of the game and almost no data or experience to back it up.  In fact, there are a lot of retards from every class (even shamans omg!) that think this way.  Just realize that some tard you meet in a pick-up group is not necessarily indicative of the views of his entire class.  I think there is really only one class that has a right to complain (hint:  it isn't shaman), but that's another story.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, A druid who's a couple bricks short of a wall isn't going to beat you in a duel. If you're at about the game level I am though, A druid is most likely going to be able to kill you by first using thier Ro's Debuff to cut 70ish off your fire resist (the debuff itsself is a -300 mod) then nuke your ass down with summer's flame.<br />
<br />
There was this one punk druid who kept talking **** about how he would own me in a duel (happened to be in my guild at the time no less)...Throughout the Fight he kept chain casting that Storm spell (stun) on me which I kept resisting, didn't try to debuff my resists, and used Winter's Frost (yeah use cold Nukes on a shaman, that's smart). Basically I annulled him 5-6 times, landed Malos, Malosinia, Greater Immobilize, and Procced Tash on him. He did manage to root and kill my pet, but that only served to distract him anyways. Pets dont use thier owner's resists in non-pve enviornments.<br />
<br />
We were in West Freeport, and druids tend to carry a lot of phat lewts around, so I crippled him for good measure (encumberance = Ghetto Snare!).  I then proceeded to keep him constantly blind while I followed him around beating his ass down with my Mace of Confusion. Nothing More degrading than spending 5 minutes not being able to see what's going on, and slowly wandering around knowing someone's only toying with you :D<br />

<br />
3100 without bard song or improved damage, using their level 65 cold nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">&quot;Under powered&quot; vs &quot;Overpowered&quot; vs &quot;balanced&quot; is all dependant on <br />
&quot;point of view&quot; and really what you look at, and also when your looking.<br />
<br />
Here's my own completely personal point of view playing level 65 Druid 280ish AA, and Level 65 Shaman 250ish AA.  It's also dependant on being in elemental level guild.<br />
<br />
Group Desirability.<br />
Pre-new Heals/POP:  Druids way underpowered.   Shamans way overpowered.<br />
Reason: druids werent good at any of the traditional roles: main heal, slow, tank, dps.<br />
<br />
I'd get random tells in zone on shaman from complete strangers &quot;are you lfg&quot; and never on druid.  <br />
<br />
POP: Druids little underpowerd.  Shamans little overpowered.<br />
No slow = No POP Group especially at elemental level.<br />
<br />
Druids issue is mainly issue with KR being 600 Mana for 4750.  A druid is way behind efficiency curve with a cleric when it comes to XP grinding.<br />
A Cleric with Mana Regen 7 and 4k Mana Pool, makes a better main healer then a Druid with Mana Regen 24 and 5k Mana Pool.<br />
And XPing in Elemental Planes, Enchanters/Shaman are the only good options.  Bard 50% is too light for average xp grind.  BST 65 can be issue with landing it fast if you dont have a debuff line.<br />
<br />
Still find my group looking for slower (Enc/Shaman) in Guild Chat then looking for healer (Cler/Druid).  Further complicated by average raiding guild #s.  We have a &quot;ton&quot; of shaman at 8.  and 7 Chanters.  Some of which don't really XP often.  During Heavy Time Zone XP time....<br />
Id peg it at 5 to 8 slowers most of the time in guild xping.  On other side, we got probably twice that number of clerics and druids especially when you include the cleric bots.  At any given time there's usually 10 to 15 Druid/Clerics xping.<br />
<br />
Biggest issue, is that the dynamics of what a raid needs number wise, doesn't usually fit what a guild needs xp group wise.  I would suspect in most raiding guilds, shaman have a far easier time getting a guild group than druid.<br />
<br />
LDON:<br />
Druids Relatively Balanced.  <br />
do well competeing with clerics.   they also preform decent DPS <br />
at elemental level especially in burst depeartment.   About only complaint is outdoor only spell lines and LDON being indoor.<br />
but they are equally valuable to a cleric in LDON.  Better here, worse there.<br />
<br />
Shaman: don't usually compete for main healer role.  Though they can<br />
with Quiessence do the role well.  They compete for slower spot with bards, bsts, and chanters mostly.   Depending on group dynamics = which is best slower.<br />
<br />
You can do 2 Shaman no cleric/druid group better than you can do 2 Cleric/Druid no slower.  Roughly equal in terms of getting a group, maybe a tiny edge to shaman in guild chat but I chalk that up to Bards being way underrepresented in EQ, and BST being underrepresented due to newness.  <br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Soloing:<br />
<br />
In some ways Shaman better, some ways Druids.<br />
Shaman can kill summoners more reliably than druids.  Shaman who Cann Dance can out XP per hour druid (especially if they have Jbb/Fungi)<br />
in the 50's.  Druids however can quad which while it may not be as much xp per hour then a shaman can dancing, is a heck of a lot easier in terms of player effort over time.<br />
<br />
Do a quad, then sit and med and relax, go to bathroom, watch tv, play video game, etc while waiting for mana.  While shaman to reach that level of XP has to continually be working for Cann Dance advantage.<br />
<br />
Shaman could also solo mobs in luclin era that would crush a druid.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Raid/Guild Desirbility<br />
<br />
Druids were way underdesired pre-pop new heals.<br />
After new heals, they got some recruitment, usually though only as a substitute for a guild being short clerics.   Wood was a major improvement here.  MGB Wood, can be a very valuable asset to a guild.<br />
<br />
PS Edit/Add: the other issue was mainly spell dropping and normal AA levels at the time.<br />
Pre-POP you needed Mazarins + POTG &gt; Aego/Ancient Aego.  <br />
Mazarins was very rare.  Plus not as many MGBs available.  This meant<br />
many guilds just MGBed Aego and didnt care about the druid line.<br />
<br />
POST-POP.  Kazad is a lot easier to get than Mazarins.  Virtue/Nine equally rare.  And heck Kazad + POTG &gt; Aego/Ancient.   Plus more MGBs<br />
this has made Druid Buff more valuable than it used to be.<br />
<br />
Shaman: dont stack as well as druids in some ways.  But if a guild is short shaman, they hurt more than fi they are short druids.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Overall:<br />
I think pre-pop, shaman were one of the highest powered classes.<br />
now a days they are balanced.  POP added some power to the shaman class, just not as much relatively as to other classes.  This has leveled the playing field quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Druids were underpowered, but really got more than most as of late.<br />
The biggest flaw lately is still the Harmony line's outdoor only tag.<br />
And Karana's Renewal being too inefficient.   ((Shouldnt be equal to CH of clerics.  just its not close enough))<br />
<br />
EditPS:  AA totals are NOT a good judge.  As thats usually reflective of play time.  In my guild it looks like this:<br />
1) 500s/Maxed AA: 1 Necro, 1 Rogue<br />
2) 400's = 1 Warrior, 1 Shaman, 1 Bard<br />
3) 300 = 2 Druids, 1 Pally, <br />
<br />
So if you try to judge it by power, rogues are tied for the most powerful class.  With warriors not far behind...  NOT</div></div><hr />

<br />
I realize that is your own view but what a buch of self-fullfilling arguments you have there.  <br />
<br />
First you compare Shaman to Druids in power in grouping situations but then mention they don't compete for the same spots in a group.  (Which they don't)... <br />
<br />
You also limit your sections to small ranges of levels and parts of a characters life that support your arguments only... for instance soloing.  Between similarly equiped non uber shaman and non uber druid twinks who do you think will reach mid 50s first with just soloing?  It would be no contest with druids with what you admit as &quot;easy&quot; xp of the quad kite which druids can do much earlier than when shaman become reasonable in the xp soloing game.<br />
<br />
You don't seem to cover the most important fact about raids and since you are an elemental guild this should be a major part of your growing up and current status.  With 8 shaman in  your guild I doubt you play your shaman on raids much as druids stack much easier on raids and would offer much more than a 4th shaman... this is true today as it has been since the dawn of time.  Shaman were desired on raids, yes, but after 2nd ,even 1st if you had a good one, there isnt much to do on raids.  Druids with crit AAs can put out some impressive dmg on raids.  I remember with my old non uber guild the druids criting 2-3k at least once a major fight... usually much more.<br />
<br />
<br />
And even in group desireablity LDON overpowers druids more than the prior expansions because of succor if things go bad.  (hey unless your lucky we all have had those bad groups).  <br />
<br />
Plus during PoP druids did rise considerably with thier group desireablity.  Druid or Cleric needed for xp grinding in the lower,  more populated tiers.<br />
<br />
Shaman group desireablity is based on flashy numbers during most of eqs content.  Slowing is the only real reason we have group desireablity as shaman buffs have decreased in value since the original incarnation in Kunark and we really dont hold much over the other slowing class... we just do it because we are more &quot;durable&quot; or because chanters &quot;have enough to do.&quot;  Just old stereotypes that really dont have that much of a basis this side of raiding and elemental planes.  (where the majority reside)<br />
<br />
Anyways nice post and peace.</div></div><hr />

Reply: True.  I wasnt comparing for the slot.  But just how easy it is to find a group in general based on which char got tells from randoms, and what I see LFG repeated in guild chat.   It's not that Shaman autoget groups in my guild, but it is that I see Druid LFG repeated over and over by druids a lot longer than I see it for a shaman.  Again this is mostly because there are more druids &amp; clerics then slowers in guild by a significant margin.<br />

Reply:  True.  The only thing about that though is more a reflection to my viewpoint on level game than it is balance.  I've almost completely written off the pre-50 Game in terms of balance.   While that may seem harsh, you spend a small fraction of your played time under 50, compared to 50+.   Its also a personaility thing.   I'd rather be underpowered temporarily, and permantly overpowered afterwards than vice-versa.<br />

Reply: Actually Im 2 boxing both on raids.  And multiple shaman have been a major guild asset in our strategys and approach.  It was a little bit of an issue at first when we all that that slowing was a shamans only job, but for the last 6 months It tends to work better than most think on this board.   It's been benefical any number of ways<br />
1) Debuff on Off Tanks.  On multi-pull events its very easy to each take one tank.<br />
2) Never run out of MGBs, which on some events its easy to lose a lot, and you may not have a lot of time to waste on rebuffing.  <br />
3) Damage.  A few shaman usually focus on damage quite a bit between dots, and nukes and crits.  They put out better damage than most beleive.   BA items, and Bane really help too.<br />
4) HOTs.   a 3 Second Quiessence that heals 1800 is sufficient to cover a whole group on a 30 Second Reuse AE.  So when theres not enough group healers for each group, shaman do this job better than druids.<br />
5) Spotting MA/Spikey Damage.   As a shaman I can sustain spam heals of 1500+ for longer than a druid can sustain his 2000 ones.   Alot of fights I get off 2 or 3 Can5s, given me a significant mana pool edge.<br />
6) RGC Spotter.  <br />
7) Debuffing the Super Resistant Mobs.   MithMarr is a totally different fight when u got lots of people spamming sinia/slow.<br />
<br />
Last night, we were wishing we had shaman #6 on a low 5 person shaman raid.<br />
<br />

<br />
Reply: Guess it depends on your group.  On druid I evac about 1 in 20 dungeons.   But its a lot different when you are in an elemental group<br />
doing normal settings.  I'm spoiled because Im looking at a group where the lowest person has 5500+ hps usually 6k+.  When you start looking that almost every priest has LR5 they can survive agro quite well.<br />
Throw in tanks with 9k,10k+ hps and they dont need a heal as fast.<br />
Hell, even when i have a bard/chanter who needs to mez.   AE Slow<br />
and with ID4 LR5 my shaman will hold up to 4 mobs mixed slowed/unslowed quite well.   Anyway, before I get bashed as &quot;out of touch&quot; the point I'm trying to make is that Evac is an ability that scales inversly to the power of the group.  The more powerful the group the less valuable it is.  In a very powerful group, it has very little value.<br />
<br />
Hrothgar Quote &quot;Plus during PoP druids did rise considerably with thier group desireablity.  Druid or Cleric needed for xp grinding in the lower,  more populated tiers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reply: Strangly enough I find this truer in elemental tiers.  Most of the shaman I know in guild when they go to the between tier (Sol Ro)<br />
dont usually worry about having either.  If you have a split puller in sol ro<br />
(Necro, Sk, Bard, Monk) having anything besides a shaman is unnecessary.<br />

<br />
Reply: I dunno.  I find my shaman's healing really has become more valuable.  Quiessence rocks now that I dont have to worry about snaring/slowing someone with torpor.  Also my ability to off tank Xping has become important.  I can slow it to a mangable level, and maintain agro without swinging ((so no riposotes.  I've been tempted to parse my damage taken to compare to other melee classes.  I wonder how we stack up since we dont have to eat riposotes.))<br />

You're saying the 4th shaman replaced by a druid is better because they can heal well and they can nuke better.. Usually on almost every raid that we do lately anyone who has a heal throws it on the mt or similar, I can cast tnargs for 8-10 min w/o oom.. how long does the druid cast his fast heal spell for? 2 min maybe? when the druid dies and comes back I bet it takes a lot longer to go to fm.. druid are cool don't get me wrong.. :)</div></div><hr />

But druids have a much better CH and much better burst dmg.  That is why they would be &quot;better&quot;... at 4th shaman all you are doing is patch healing pretty much... Can do some good dps length wise and with rains but if you had a choice for a 4th shaman on a raid and a dire charmed enabled druid which one would you pick if you needed dps?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont' see many situations where druids use their ch, usually you need heals in between cleric chs just to push mt over the top, and when the druid dies the dire charmed armadillo or whatever it is will be loose and mad right? I'm not sure on this but I think so, and I wouldn't want adds like that.. I know what you are saying about the dps, they provide 500 more damage per nuke instead of our 1k damage per nuke, I don't know casting time but they are similar if not theirs slower and cold based.. (65 druid nuke).. I don't see it as that much of an advantage to not have the 4th or 3rd shaman.. <br />
<br />
also their dots suck they are something like 263 damage per tic for like 450 mana and lasts 36 seconds or something like that, so we get 1 more tick out of ours and much more damage.. <br />
<br />
For the last 2-3 weeks we've had me and another at all the raids as the only shaman, today we had 7-9 at any given time and it rocked.. we paired up and helped do designated tasks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">When talking Druids vs Shaman in damage on a raid. it really depends on what your talking about.<br />
<br />
VS trash mob clearing.  Druid all the way.  Dots arent used.  And Druid nukes are more DPS than Shaman nukes.  However, yard trash tends to die so fast anyway who cares.  You could AFK the whole fight and no one would likely notice. <br />
<br />
VS Boss its a toss up and depends on boss's resists.<br />
Druid dots are worse.  but land far easier.  And dont have the agro shaman poison dot has.  They nuke better.  However, shaman mana regen advantage can kick in on some boss fights.  Plus if you can land them well you can do 1000+ per tic on dots alone.<br />
<br />
When it comes to healing.  Again it matters what your talking about<br />
<br />
Being Part of a Chain....   Druids can do this.  Shaman can't.<br />
<br />
Spot Healing...  Thier Base Spot is 1750, Shaman 1300.  Fully AAed 2082 vs 1547.  Thiers is better.  However, shaman can do more of them.<br />
Shaman can also drop quiessence on someone and keep it up the whole fight.  Or if your spotting a non-mt, can use Quiessence.<br />
<br />
AE healing.  Here's where queissence shines.  if you max haste it to 50% <br />
and extended it.  Your talking an 1800 heal with 3 sec cast for only 200 mana.   Basically quiessence becomes the AE heal.  Because for each person healing, druid is using Spam Heal and shaman is using Quiessence and equally keeping up with the AE.... until you realize that the druid is spending 500 base mana per person they are covering... and the shaman is spending 200 base mana.<br />
<br />
More often though, both classes will be healing first, dpsing second.</div></div><hr />

Both are very middle of the pack now a days in terms of class balance.<br />
<br />
Both classes could use a minor tweakage.<br />
Shaman should have some improved mana regen.<br />
Druids Karana's Renewal should be 500 Mana, Harmony should work indoors.<br />
<br />
Both of these are based more on what other classes can do and a bit of history.  Like Harmony originally being the best lull (AOE, Unresistable, Duration), nerfed to (Resistable, and Single) but still longer lasting than Pacificiations.  Then nerfed again to same duration.  Originally it was balanced being outdoor only vs its advantages.  Lost all the advantages, kept the disadvantage.  <br />
<br />
Mana issue is on another thread.<br />
<br />
Neither class is &quot;uber&quot; ((Bard/Chanter). or majorly in need of help (Monk/War)<br />
<br />
Out of 13.  I'd put shaman 7, Druid 8.</div></div><hr />

I'm only 56 and theres no way I feel I need a mana regen increase. My druid at 58 sure as hell could use one though. Both have ft1 and no aa's, with mana pres 3 items btw. Harmony indoors would rock, not just for druids but obviously for rangers also. Would really push rangers up in terms of desirability IMHO for ldon.</div></div><hr />

You wouldn't see the mana need at 56.  Or increase.<br />
Like in other thread, I'm mostly talking another AA (Either another Cann direct, or hastened AA) or a Level 63-65 Cann 5 Spell.<br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16870<br />
<br />
Basically what happens at the end of the game, is that the large number of mana increasing spells, and the improved efficency really erodes the power base of the shaman.<br />
<br />
For example, currently a shaman in LDON at 63-65 can nuke more often than other classes.  However, not enough more often to make balance the fact our nukes are weaker.  An increase in mana regen = increase in quantity of nukes = increase in sustained dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree indoor harmony would rock, but I don't like the idea.  Druids and Rangers are outdoor specialists.  They still offer a ton of things for indoor groups, but I'd rather keep the &quot;outdoor emphasis&quot; on these classes.  (and I do play a druid in addition to my shaman and warrior)<br />

Heh... DEATH.  On trash mobs if your slowing one poison dot plus epic... maybee a rain at the end.  You not going to go full out as a shaman on dots unless your soloing because it is instant agro.  <br />
<br />
The whole healing argument hinges on the fact that the shaman has some form of torpor... it is easier to get at 65 but that is 65.  While it is easier to get to than in the past it is still the minority...<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what you are saying about the dps, they provide 500 more damage per nuke instead of our 1k damage per nuke, I don't know casting time but they are similar if not theirs slower and cold based.. &quot;<br />

And people always forget about the druid crits...  Plus thier buffs are arguably beter at 65 than the one that we have left... focus line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Man heh you have really no idea do you ?<br />
SHAMAN WHERE GOOD PRE POP.<br />
Kunak we rooled = people didnt have any resist. I remember In the start nobody knew what a diamon and blue diamon where for beside good cashh items, aleast i didnt heh.<br />
Velius we got our malo and peopel started really to fear us and we could have some fun blinding people at same time we fell them up with  our dots hehe.<br />
<br />
But after pop came out we are nada in pvp, How will you get you dots in even with malos on people who are elemental geared up? They can be so damm unskilled in pvp , but you cant kill em. due to there resist.<br />
<br />
That said, Druid vs shm. Well again druid dont really need good gear to beat us, just alot of aa. and they will cure our dots, dispel our malo every time we cast it on them, then we are harmless to them. what can the druid do to us? well he can nuke us for 2k, they even got a good fr debuff to give us.<br />
I ll give you , if we can root after debuff and get our dots in. Well then we can kill any class easy still, Even clr. Most classes have trouble killing a cleric, but with malos root and aa pets on here, when she is at 50% life and dotted they die easy sins our pets stun them like mad and they cant get there heal off... that goes for druid aswell..Wiz still instant gate from me and die in a non pvp zone like pot. sadly there i cant loot there cashh heh.<br />
<br />
In mass pvp a shm will do dispel with the ench. malos and heal his group member. We dont wast our mana on getting our dots in on raid buffed people. sins the melee on our team will kill faster then us. so even there our fun goes in pvp..<br />
<br />
The hardest class for shm to pvp is palladin for sure, He got a spel who will cure what ever you cast on him. en old days it was a pain even to kill a palladin sins he could heal you dots away, he even had a CH in his back hand if you should get him down the first time. That said, palladin have allso a hard time to kill us tho<br />
<br />
Then we got SK, well they can allway`s use there good  maxed AA HT on you, who hit for around 4.6 k dam, in good old days you had a chance vs a sk with HT up. Just needed to be over 75 % life the hold fight, then he couldnt kill you with his HT..that was a rule i allways used when i fought a sk and it worked pretty good.<br />
<br />
in the bottom of the one i fear less to fight 1 vs 1 is necro, rangers and rogs.<br />
 Beside the necro can LB you. you can just dispel his dots. Necro have a tendens to relay there pr resist on dmf hehe.. Malos /malo overwrite dmf. so its like a 120 debuff they get on them in there pr resist. so get you 2 best dots on him and then run out of range from the necro, no reason to stand and look at him Life drain you, just run oor of his range and he will die. If he have a necro pet with him. you just slow it, that goes for every pets. Remember our slow can only be cured.<br />
<br />
Ranger heh. ranger like to dual wield on you, so ofcourse you have your ds potions with you and you right click ring 10 if you got that one or you have done the quest  where you get ally  in chadok and get awarded a  ring with 5 charge 25 ds on. so all in all you will have around 45 ds or more when you fight the ranger, Even ranger with full EP gear tend to have low pr resist , so the chance of you getting dots in on him is good. as he stand there duel wield on you, you just channel af few torpor on you self and let him do the work for you.<br />
<br />
Same deal with the rog as with the ranger. you just face the rog the hole time, never turn the bag on the rog heh, they do some crazy crit BS sometimes who can heart you.<br />
<br />
That`s the life on a pvp server now for a shaman<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The only class that can kill me is a wiz(manaburn), SK(ht), or necro(lifeburn).<br />
<br />
I have not died in a 1v1 pvp fight to any other class since I hit lvl 60.<br />
<br />
And when I say we are 1 of the best pvp classes, I really mean it. Can anyone kill us without insta uber dmg? no. I can outheal any class that comes up against me. If someone that I know I can't kill comes up, then I'm not afraid to cut my losses. Bards are one of these. chanters are another(as long as I'm unprepared). But other than that.. we have mega mana, mana regen, pets, and the pet AA. Do NOT forget about the pet AA during pvp combat. Having 5 pets bashing you at once is insane for interrupts.. and while those pets are on you can toss on a quick nuke(you never know when it'll land cause resists suck pvp). I am known through most of my server as being a good pvper, and I really don't know how that reputation got started.. but I just go along with it. It's not really me. It's my class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>FinlokVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">For the most part i agree with soldier.  I dont really consider myself a good pvper though and my gear isnt really all that nice.  Here is how i interpret shaman pvp from my experience:<br />
<br />
Bard - Would have to be really dumb to lose to me.  <br />
<br />
Druids - Usually have a larger mana pool and can outheal my damage and land nasty nukes and dots on me. Their dots are much harder to resist than ours.  They have a nice fr debuff (unresistable i think) which combined with nukes take my hp bar down fast.  Our superior mana regen is only good assuming we can get away form the battle long enough to cann and heal.  <br />
<br />
Paladin - With cursaders touch they can clean off all our disease/poison dots.  I know for sure i couldnt nuke a paladin to death so i consider beating one to be near impossible.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights - I stand a chance against one assuming HT is down, they dont have great resists and if i can catch them offguard and im in a zone where they cant use thier steed.  <br />
<br />
Enchanters - I dont have alot of experience fighting chanters 1on1.  The few fights i have had have been pretty frustrating with mez/mana drain.  <br />
<br />
Mages/wizards/necros - Assuming i can land a dot or 2 on them i feel comfortable fighting them.  Level 65 mages with pets up are scary.  I have a tough time channeling with the multiple pet thing they have.  Usually the outcome of a battle versus these classes fo me depends on who gets initiative.<br />
<br />
Rangers/Rog's/War's - Assuming they dont have horses and strong resists i feel like i have a chance versus them.  Rangers with AM3 are still scary despite the nerf.  A rog on a horse is very scary.  Even if i land dots on warriors they have so many HP it takes me a long time to kill especially if they carry cure potions on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Oh, and 1 more thing. Be smart when fighting druids by keeping up dot slots and clicky buffs.

torpor or so heh.<br />
<br />
Bards surely rox in pvp aswell, they can run away all the time if getting low. but mostly they jsut manadrain you and dispel you. then they dot kite you, as a shm u can heal that away, with cani 5, torpror2. Bards normally got killed by MB and DT otherwise i dont see how a good bard die.  Bards surely should be nerfed alot in pvp heh !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never :&gt; However I don't look at size of crit as anything more than Eye Candy.  In essence Crit AAs add 19% to your nukes.  This applies to both shaman and druid nukes.  So it really doesnt change the principle<br />
Druids nuke harder than Shaman, but a Shaman can nuke more.<br />
<br />
((though again I'm still of the opinion that the game has increased the first gap, and shrunk the 2nd gap.))<br />
<br />
I will also say that part of it is.  That more druids go for nuke AAs then shaman do.   Nukes were one of the first AA I focused on for my druid, with my shaman it was much farther down the list. <br />
<br />
My first Quote:&quot;Plus if you can land them well you can do 1000+ per tic on dots alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hrothgar's Reply Quote &quot;Heh... DEATH. On trash mobs if your slowing one poison dot plus epic... maybee a rain at the end. You not going to go full out as a shaman on dots unless your soloing because it is instant agro. &quot;<br />
<br />
Thats not entirely true.  But you can't take this out of context either.<br />
I was specifically referring to what you can do dps wise, when you try to stack large numbers of shaman in guilds.   Part of the key to realize is the DPS focused shaman is NOT slowing the mob.  Bane + Blood with BA4<br />
would average around 800 Damage per tic alone.  Put a warrior with a Blade of War up there.  And don't slow, and you can pull this pair off.<br />
((At least against mobs with normal resists.  If you are getting more than 1/4 spells resisted you will cast too often to live))<br />
<br />
A shaman who has to debuff would be smushed trying to stack dots this heavily.  However....the same applies to a druid.<br />
<br />
Doing Warlord in POEB the other day...  We only had 1 druid not assigned to healing duty.  She tried to keep up all 3 druid debuffs<br />
Hand of Ro, Ros Illuminoation, and the Dot/Debuff Ros Immolation.<br />
Warrior has Blade of War.  She must have died at least 5 times.  And that was all she was casting. <br />
<br />
So if a druid is debuffing they cant go all out on DPS (nukes/dots) either.  Its no surprise that most shaman think DPS = Death because few guilds have the luxury of enough shaman that some can skip debuffing.</div></div><hr />
