<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok. I'm organizing this raid in honor of a druid. A druid who wanted 15kpp for a jade reaver. This druid admitted to gouging and trying to get all he could for a necessary quest piece. Why? Because he had to do it to get his.<br />
<br />
So I propose a City of Mist raid to get as many Rangers and Druids their Jade Reavers as possible. This is my own little way of telling this druid (and all other price leeches) what he can do with his Jade Reaver (or 15kpp by now, more likely :/ ).<br />
<br />
Anyhow, if there is enough interest I will start forming up groups. I think two good groups would do it, and three would be preferable.<br />
<br />
The goal is to save as many people as possible from the horrors of the player-mangled economy- er, get reavers for as many people as possible. And, of course, to have a good time, 'cause that's what it's all about, right? :D</div></div><hr />

Ugh - I hear you concerning the price gougers.<br />
<br />
Sign me up too. Can log on early to bus the kids to EJ to get everyone set up to be there on time.<br />
<br />
From reading - looks like these bad boys are on the Black Reavers. Highly MR, but I will add my mana any way I can.  :D <br />
<br />
Or - ifn you like - I can bring my Warrior, Petunia (42), although she might be a little low. But - she is yours for the hunt if you need her.</div></div><hr />

I've been looking at aucs for one too, and most people want 20-30k for what used to be sold for 600-800 before people realized they could make money off the needs of the rangers and druids. I'd love to know that I helped in at least one person avoiding having to pay that much for it.<br />

<br />
If i can be online at that time count me in if Petitioners are allowed to go. I'm a level 54 chanter so perhaps I could be of help.<br />
<br />
Also looking at the responces didn't see alot of chanter activity. I know that one beast we need to charm for the chanter epic is there so this may encourage some others to go as well. I'm not sure if it morphes into something after you charm him. But if not we can do this for as many chaters that need it. Just kind of charm him around like a hot potato. I do need this piece but will gladly stay at the back of the line for other koe members.<br />

The Wraith of Jaxion spawns at the final building (the one that the last reaver and Neh'Ashiir spawns in). The wraith has a placeholder, and it goes around the<br />
building. Keep killing everything in that last building once you have cleared the reaver, and the Wraith of Jaxion should spawn eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Lantanamoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hi y'all :). I'm a friend of Aolwenye, Lorilea and Gallandro. Was talking to Aol today about this raid and she told me to sign in here. I'm a lvl 52 druid and would love to join y'all on this raid. I won't be able to make it on till about 9pm central. I hope that won't be too late but if it is I would look forward to joining y'all on another raid some other time. Hope to see you all there tonight :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gallandro Strongbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">if you have room, id love to go =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If I can get on in time(still really not sure about the time difference here) I will help as long as I can.<br />
<br />
And I agree the price on the Jade reaver has gotten way out of control.  2 of them about a year ago shortly after the Epics started for less then 2k.  It is not even a good weapon but the need by two classes as sent the sharks into a feeding frenzy.:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Great response! It will be great to have you all there. :)<br />
<br />
Start time will be at 8:30PM Eastern (5:30PM Pacific). We'll form up groups at that time and move in.<br />
<br />
In the event that CoM is already being raided we should have an alternate plan (sorry for not thinking of this sooner. ;)). Does anyone still need to kill the corruptors in EK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Traz Blackwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I just wanted to say thank you to all who attended tonight. While we didn't get any reavers, I had a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Special thanks go out to<br />
<br />
Khallim, for stepping in as a puller for our second run.<br />
<br />
Anguus, for going out of his way to help us out when we needed a cleric.<br />
<br />
Aiyrra, for being our automatic castle door opener. ;)<br />
<br />
And extra special thanks to Baracus for stepping in as raid leader while I was having serious computer issues. :)<br />
<br />
So next time around we get 7 or 8 reavers. That's how it works, right? ;)</div></div><hr />
