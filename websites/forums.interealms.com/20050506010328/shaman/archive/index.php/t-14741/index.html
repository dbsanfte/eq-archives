<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lately I've been thinking about coming back into game and starting back up. Anybody think it's worth it? Or is the game going down hill now a days? <br />
<br />
Just been awhile since I've played and I've been thinking about coming back.</div></div><hr />

I think it is much better than it ever was before, though of course that is a matter of personal opinion.<br />
<br />
I actually took 3 years off and started a character on a new server.  It has been like a whole new game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here, almost exactly.<br />
I'm actually *enjoying* myself now...or I wouldn't have stayed.<br />
<br />
For anyone thinking of coming back who no longer has their account:<br />
<br />
http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/235838.asp<br />
<br />
$30 to get all the expansions and a brand new shiny account key.<br />
<br />
Damnit, I don't want to think about how much I paid less than a month ago for the whole damn thing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have been playing since opening day, and I think its better than its ever been. Also leveling is much faster, downtime is much shorter, and items are much cheaper, which adds up to more fun in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lots of fun to be had, wether ya like to farm for gear, tradeskill, powr game to 65 or just hang with friends. Not much for the newbs starting neccesarily in the way of other pure newbs but ya level so fast that it doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">EQ is the best it's ever been right now.  Unfortunately I'm bored with it once again.<br />
Such is life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, even the true blue untwinked newbies have some pretty nice little armor quests in most starting cities now. A heck of a lot better gear than cloth, mesh, or patchwork armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Keltsett, Were you on the Cazic thule server in the guild Oracle of Virtue?
