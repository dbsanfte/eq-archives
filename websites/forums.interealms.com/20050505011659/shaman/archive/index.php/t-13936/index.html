<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The recent change introduced on the TEST server seems to have some people in an uproar because it may become no longer more efficient to solo than to group. It and several other things have set my mind to thinking up new and interesting challenges for SOE to add to the game.<br />
<br />
1. Solo Challenges - Instance Zones seem to be the new &quot;thing&quot; for MMORPG's so why not expand on this and create dungeons that are meant to be soloed by a specific class. Every class should have their own set of challenges to tackle using skills that only they would have to complete it. (Like a Shaman needing alchemy to complete the challenge.) Rewards could vary or be chosen by the player and should diminish as the overall experience level of the player increases.<br />
<br />
2. Group Challenges - Along the same line as the solo challenges, create instance only dungeons that require a specific combination of classes to activate. Having players go LD in the middle might cause some problems, booting the players out of the zone but the point of the challenge would be to have certain classes overcome it together. Some might argue that this would cause too much frustration but then nobody is being forced to experience the challenge.<br />
<br />
Each idea would work even better if there were some variables thrown in so challenge would be different if done multiple times by the same player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They don't want people soloing, they've said it over and over.  I don't see all the point of all the complaining about this though, they didn't lower the exp gained when you kill a mob solo, they just upped it elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The group thing is part of some of the rumors about the new dungeon (though I remember hearing about instanced zones in PoP too, definitely none of those around), we'll see if it works out.  Would be pretty fun though, zone in, work your way through a zone, and out the other side.  Imagine having your own Chardok to completely wipe out =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, actually they *did* lower the experience gained when you kill a mob solo.  They said so.

<br />
<br />
Ya know what?  I PAY to play this game.  So why the hell is sony making it so I cant play it the way I want?<br />
<br />
I prefer soloing.  I find soloing to be incredible boring and very lonely.  Given that, why do I prefer soloing when Im lookin for exp?  Because when Im soloing the only downtime I have to deal with is my own.<br />
<br />
Last night is a great example.  War, rang, Me, cleric, Enchanter Wizard at the docks in PoN, hunting silk for wars bow and getting a little exp to boot.<br />
<br />
Warrior was afk about 20 minutes each hour taking a smoke break.  Ok, Im a smoker too, but damn it when I smoke during group time I make it damn fast...and not sit there like I dont have 5 other other people waiting on me.<br />
<br />
Cleric was AFK about every 10 minutes dealing with her daughter, who is 4 and trying to get her into the bath, then ready for bed, then IN bed, then get water blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
Chanter was trying to research tradeskill stuff, so she was never paying attention and almost caused wipes every multiple pull.<br />
<br />
Ranger was doing just fine.  Was there, attentive, and ready to go.  Go ranger boy.<br />
<br />
Warrior also got tells from the guildleader of the guild hes was trying to join and talked to them for about 30 minutes too..over an hour span.<br />
<br />
So in the course of the 3 hours I was there we did about 75 minutes of actual exp time. I got about 8% of an AA while there.<br />
<br />
I could have made that 8% in about 15 minutes if I was sololing.  But, if I want to be in PoP, I HAVE to group.  Trying to go solo is an option right now, but it carries with it a large downtime after each kill.  Now they are planning on making it WORSE by lowering the exp I can get if I solo in PoP.<br />
<br />
IF they exp changes they have on Test go live I expect them to be buggy as hell and probably broken for about a week after patch.  (think about it..dividing one exp kill 5 ways between 6 people and then adding in 80% is going to break the damn hampster that is running the servers brain.)  I tried it on test..made 3 characters with /testbuff and had a friend make 3.  Grouped them in FM..a zone that he and I grouped in with alts of ours every time, so I know the exp rate it gives.  Was it better?  Hardly.  About 1% extra every 3 kills or so.  Hardly worth screaming about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Once again they nerf soloers, why don't they just make it so when you log on you are automatically ported to a group, buffed up and ready to go?<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jorgan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I PAY to play this game.  So why the hell is sony making it so I cant play it the way I want?<br />
<br />
It's their game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am going to have to agree. Sure it's their game, but they are making a game for people to enjoy. What the hell are people going to enjoy if they are foced to do something they don't want?<br />
<br />
BTW , go rangers! I prefer them and paladins and SKs as tanks over the warrior anyday ( well given the exception if the ranger at PoP isn't super uber with at least 5k base HP ) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">People who prefer to solo are not being shafted quite as badly as they think they are.  Yes, soloing in PoP will assuredly be worth less experience.  At the same time, though, alot of the older zones will open up again.  I'm pretty sure I could do some serious damage in Santus Seru at level 65 and the experience would be pretty good -- if I wanted to solo.  So think of it this way; less exp in pop soloing but probably more exp overall since you can pretty much OWN anything that walks outside PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Some people want 10k hits and a spell that does 20k damage too.  They think that will make them happy playing the game.  Why do you think Sony does not make that change?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thorzian you whiner.  Ever think about disbanding the slackers from the group and getting some real group members interested in killing things?  Geez.  You'd think that in 3 hours of keeping that group you would have grabbed a clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like the change myself. I've done quite a bit of solo'ing, but that was typically because it was easy and I could afk when I wanted/etc.  I always hated those groups where you didn't have the perfect &quot;Kick ass&quot; group of Tank/Cleric/slower and 3 damage.  Now I can grab whoever is lfg and still get pretty good experience.  Makes me needing the perfect group a lot less of an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like the change. It doesn't ruin soloing at all - the only nerf for soloing is in PoP zones, everywhere else it will remain the same. In fact, many places will be *better* because more mobs will be dark/light blue than before.<br />
<br />
The thing I think they're trying to address is, certain classes being able to get insane amounts of experience solo, and soloing being preferable to grouping.<br />
<br />
This will not stop people being able to solo, and solo effectively, but it will hopefully make grouping preferable, increasing the grouping bonus should help offset some of the additional downtimes mentioned above.<br />
<br />
I think having grouping be more effective than soloing is perfectly acceptable for a multiplayer game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">MMORPG in no way should be about grouping. Its a natural part of the game yes, but just cause it has the word MMORPG stamped on it doesnt mean that you &quot;have to&quot; be grouping with others.<br />

Massive Multiplayer.... Kinda like the world and life, but am i wrong cause sometimes i wanna go out in the woods and be alone and commune with the peace of the world and nature and the universe? Should i have a job that pays less because of this? Should i have less in life or suffer any penalties?<br />
<br />
No, it would be ignorant to say yes would you not agree?<br />
<br />
SoE has stated they like to &quot;encourage&quot; the group experience and thats fine and dandy. Give groups bonuses, im tickled pink about it. But this is the second time they have hurt the soloer to make the grouper more enticing which i feel is the wrong approach. Rewarding 1 sect of people by hurting another is never going to win you friends or loyalty or respect, which is what customer base is all about.<br />

<br />
Correct, they are trying to address a serious issue ( as serious as a game can be anyway). Quaders and charms are completly off the scale and THEY need to be adjusted, not everyone. Apply penalties to  AoE spells or something, put in a lil line of code for wizzies that if you kill 4 all at the same time that a penaltiy is applied. I dont know , i dont code for EQ, but i am highly confident that a fairly simple solution can be brainstormed that is more productive then this path.<br />
<br />
Why my concern? I certainly dont make more AA then i can when im in a fast pulling BoT group. Buit sometimes i enjoy not having to keep other people buffed, just as sometimes i enjoy it. Plus there is a fact that im not a lil kid anymore and i dont have time these days to spend a 30-60 min lfg then 2 hours grouping. Sometimes all i can do is get on and play solo. I would simply like to not be hurt more cause im being hurt enough as it is.<br />
<br />
In alot of ways its not a reward for grouping and being with people, its a reward for spending all your time on their product. <br />
<br />
Lets just sit back for just a few seconds and take a look at this argument actualy....<br />
<br />
&quot;I think having grouping be more effective than soloing is perfectly acceptable for a MMORPG&quot; ( i picked this one cause its a common theme is all )<br />
<br />
 Why? What is the reasoning behind making us spend time together? The answer I get from people are along the lines of &quot; cause its good to spend time with people &quot; or &quot; Its a good experience to keep dealing with people, it builds character &quot; or something sociological like that. Thats a cute answer too, but lets really look at it. Your locking yourself in a lil cave playing on a picture box and cutting yourself off form the REAL world, so you can be more &quot;social&quot;. /boggle. If this game is such a social experience, why not win the game by shutting it off and going down to the pub for a drink or out to a party to meet people. The ultime plane of power... real life...<br />
<br />
If this game is supposed to be such a social experience, then why is it almost every group im in is much more concerned in pulling mobs then talking.<br />
<br />
/join Group<br />
<br />
me: hi guys, great to be here.<br />
group welcome : we need uber shaman buffs, keke &lt;(^-^)&gt;<br />
Me: Sure coming up ... all set.<br />
Me: so how is everyone, hey i was wondering miss cleric, how is it being a cleric, you find it fun or boring , i was thinking of making one<br />
cleric:<br />
me:<br />
cleric: Dropping the heal bomb on %t<br />
me:<br />
cleric: So when we hitting X mob tonite<br />
me ?<br />
cleric: sorry mistel i wasnt paying attention, did you say something?<br />
<br />
<br />
Its all about the mobs and killing things, come on, lets not kid ourselves.<br />
Friends are great, guildies are great, but if its not a select few people that everyone knows each other, then there tends to not be a whole lot of chit chat. This is the character building experience? This is how we are supposed to act to other people in a game thats supposed to be about fun? I think not. So a argument that a MMORPG is supposed to be about grouping i feel is not a very valid one cause of the reality of it how it plays out. Its about one thing, keeping you playing their game. I personaly dont like being put in a place where im manipulated into a desire to be in this lil world. I like the choice of coming and going, grouping or not and that freedom is coming at a price it seems from SoE and thats my debate.<br />
<br />
Btw, notice i said debate here, as in a intellectual analysis. As in im not going to huff and puff and throw my hands up and pout and scream bloody death cause of such changes. Worst case is ill slide over to WoW or something else cause it suites me more.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thats my take on it, as warped and abscure as it may be, but its is my own.</div></div><hr />

Litgruv, for the most part I agree with your post. I mostly group, but sometimes I only have a short time, or I just want to be by myself.<br />

<br />
I can't see anything that means that you can't solo any more, and moreover, do so effectively. For the people racking up solo AA in PoP, it may be less effective than before, but soloing will still be a way to get experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There are plenty of blues in Sanctus Seru, and Ssra, and the Deep, and other Luclin zones now.  People don't kill them for xp, because the xp isn't good.  It has nothing to do with the fact that they aren't blue, it has a lot more to do with things like the &quot;close to level&quot; range xp bonus; Luclin mobs have high AC and HP for xp mobs; Luclin zones are mostly designed for crap; and Luclin ZEM's.<br />
<br />
I am ALL IN FAVOR of getting people spread out and outta the Dreadlands of Valor.  I just don't think this is a good way to do it.<br />
<br />
--<br />
The soloing part is a typical Verant overnerf.  They don't like quadders, charmers, and bards getting xp many times faster than xp groups.  So, what do they do?  Come up with a nerf that hurts those people a little tiny bit, while hitting the much slower root-dotters [who aren't much of a problem, because they won't out-xp groups with the new group changes] with a sledgehamer.  As an illustration: a hypothetical 1/3 solo xp nerf hurts the guy making an AA per 15 minutes by tacking on 5 minutes per aa.  Whereas it adds 30 minutes to the guy who took an hour and a half.<br />
<br />
I am ALL IN FAVOR of helping out the group-dependant classes.  I just don't think this is a good way to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No no , dont get me wrong bro, im not preaching that OMG we cant solo !!!! <br />
<br />
I cant speak for everyone ( thank god ) but my angle is that Soloing should be just as good as grouping. Really my desire is not to be a good thing for soloers, im thinking grouping needs bumpage in the EXP it earns. truly i can still solo, they arent making PoT mobs  root prood, of PoV golems summon now, which would truly hurt soloing. More so im just trying to bring awareness to the trend thats going on by debating the minor changes that are in PoP. <br />
<br />
Ill be honest with you, ive come to the conclusion that exping needs to move so much faster, that its the game itself and its content that needs to slow you down, needs to make you WANT to slow down, not the work of the game. I mean if people wanna level to 65 to be at the end, great, let them, but then make level restrictions on weapons. Like lets look at the Soulstripper. Here is a mob that is so cake to do by 65, but by 65 this isnt really a good weapon, so basicly you are going to sell it if your camping it, or give to a alt.<br />
<br />
Why not make the mob level resistant? Only 55 and lower can land spells or something like that. Make it only lootable up to 55 and only a 55 can use it. meaning if you try to equip it at 65 it wont work. The only exception would be if your were the person that looted it at 55, so you can use it for the rest of your life.<br />
<br />
I dont know, but atleast its a creative approch at the situation other then forcing people to spend hours after hours leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">That's called the Fironie Vie server, if you want that Lite.  Go give it a shot.  I personally despised it, when they had it on all servers (in the Warrens, and Stonebrunt), but maybe you would like trivial loot code.  And soloers can still solo, can still gain exp.  Every since the inception of this game, and Brad was still in charge, the focus is on grouping.  You dont go kill Rallos Zek solo, eh?  Yes, some classes are more adapted to solo then others.  But guess what?  If this goes live, they still will be.  I like the idea that groups can get equal OR better exp then a solo'er, when the whole game was designed around grouping.  And if wasnt, then everyone would be able to melee, heal themselves, drop 1k nukes, port themselves about to any zone, and buff themselves.  But, again, not one single class can do all of that.  It's divided among many classes, to encourage grouping, and in the case of Rogues and Warriors, for example, it's REQUIRED they group.  They can not solo at all.   <br />
<br />
Anyways, Im rambling. :)   I think the change is a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">MMORPG in no way implies you have to group.  It does not support a grouping arguement either.  Solo should be more XP.  If the mobs weren't meant to be solo'd by kiting, then they should summon.  How difficult is that?<br />
<br />
I like the new grouping bonuses.  Leave the ZEMs alone, and all will be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">MMORPG?  Why the hell are we tlaking about a generalized group of games?  We SHOULD be talking about EQ game focus.  Kiting wasn't envisioned when Verant created the game and Brad HATED it.  He thought that soloing was evil, but he refused to push for coding that would preclude that option.<br />
<br />
The thought that soloing should have more reward than grouping is ignorant.  The game focus in UO, AO and several other MMORPG's is soloing, but that doesn't mean that EQ has to have the same focus.  Grouping is EQ bread and butter.  With the change to Tier 2 and 3 in regards to flags, soloing and grouping are going to come into direct conflict.  You CAN'T let a level 65 soloer take the mobs from a group of level 60's, it violates the precenpts that the game was built on.  Therefore, SOE changed the EXP for soloers in the planes to discourage competition in zones that are not designed or populated for soloing (look at OT and DL, they're designed specifically with soloing in mind, and have the population and size to allow that).<br />
<br />
The party was great for soloists in PoP, lasting 6 months and netting thousands of AA points.  Looks like it's over now, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">it does seem like the ZEM nerfs are unnecessarily harsh.  33% seems over the top.  PoP zones are tuff, they deserve to be good exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The massive ZEM in PoP was to induce people to buy it.  It was a gimmick.  It worked.  Now, unless they want 90% of the playerbase to be crammed into those zones 90% of the time (with all the nightmares that entails), it's time to make those zones less attractive.  Because, honestly, anybody who hasn't bought PoP by now, isn't going to be put off by this exp nerf.<br />
<br />
Nothing more and nothing less than profit maximization.  It's not like they suddenly looked up and said &quot;hey, would you look at that, we made the PoP zones the only attractive ones for the post 60 crowd!  Let's fix that!&quot;  They've taught the EQ playerbase that the best bump in power your character is going to get will be if you preorder the expansion and get its benefits before the nerfs hit.<br />
<br />
Opening up the exp level range will, I believe, be more of a boon to the soloer than the pop exp reduction will do harm.  THAT decision, as massively overdue as it is, came as a very pleasant shock.</div></div><hr />

Honestly i though FV was just a RP server with no no drop items. They Have level restictions and such too ? Hmm might be worth loging on and running to the bazaar to see what the deal is ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Egads! Me thread has been hijacked! Perhaps there is another thread in which this discussion could continue? I really wanted feedback on the solo challenge idea.<br />
<br />
BTW, it is meant as a part of the whole picture. It is not something to encourage soloing all the time rather give a player of a particular class a set of challenges to complete which should show mastery of the class. Think of it as an extension of the epics except it doesn't involve convincing large groups of people like guilds to run around and assist with the gathering of drops from mobs. <br />
<br />
It would really be an activity that could be engaged in when a group could not be found or a player really wants to push him or herself. If the challenges were set to certain levels, there would be diminishing returns in experience that would make the challenge not worth the time so soloing would not become an exclusive activity.<br />
<br />
Solo play happens so it should be a part of the game experience. Neither grouping nor soloing should be the exclusive focus of EQ.</div></div><hr />

I feel bad for people who exp in seb and nice places like that for low 50's, 2 man teams of level 65's are going to churn those zones up for cash now since they can make AA.<br />

Oh well, reate new content, or just let them back in to the zones we pushed them from. Choice is pretty easy i guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">everyone would be able to melee, heal themselves, drop 1k nukes, port themselves about to any zone, and buff themselves.  But, again, not one single class can do all of that.<br />
<br />
Actually this class exists, its called a druid--yeah they dont melee all that well, but you didnt say that :)..that and they nuke for a bit more than that heh .<br />
<br />
To the original poster, if you want single group type encounters...ever try the OTHER trials in poj?? you know there are what 5 other ones?  Not sure til when they are dk blue now, but in a week or so they'll all be dk blue to 65.  THere will never be solo encounters...<br />
<br />
As to other issues, i'm all for upping group exp, but why do you have to nerf solo exp?  Whats the end goal to make one kill solo worth LESS exp than killing that same mob with 5 other people??<br />
<br />
My theory is this is just a way to slow down everyone getting 65/full aa's before they release the next expansion; opening of content is to pacify the people who have everything already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, what a gem.... <br />
<br />
guess what, you can play the game however you want, you're just going to get less experience than people that play it the way SOE wants us too.  You made the worst argument ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Thorzian you whiner.  Ever think about disbanding the slackers from the group and getting some real group members interested in killing things?  Geez.  You'd think that in 3 hours of keeping that group you would have grabbed a clue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I was whining.  Everyone does once in awhile.  Pardon me.<br />
<br />
And yes, I also thought about disbanding.  But this was a guild group and I had already told the warrior that I would help him get the silk he needed for his bow.  I dont know how you feel about it, but when I tell a guild group I'll help Im there to the bitter end.<br />
<br />
 Speaking as the father of a 6 year old, 3 year old, and 1.5 year old....a parent has NO business playing a game (or doing anything else) while the young children are in the bathtub!! <br />
<br />
Well, the story was that her husband was in charge of baths that night, but was apparently unable to handle it, so she was having to make multiple trips to get it all sorted out.  I know the cleric IRL and she is an excellent mother; not one to drop the kid in the tub and scoot back to the pixels.  But the argument you make is valid anyway...<br />
<br />
You made the worst argument ever.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the stunning insight.  I guess it ranks one step below your post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'm a solo player. EQ fills that part of me that wants to live alone in a log cabin without having to speak to anyone for weeks on end. In Los Angeles, that's hard to do.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I really don't care how they dole out the experience. I've already adapted my play style and pace to fit my preference. If I have to spend more time at each level because I'm soloing in a group oriented game, so be it.<br />
<br />
I wonder though, for future MMORPGs, would there be any merit in having a couple of servers dedicated to the lone hunter? I'm sure implementing this would be unlikely, but it would also serve both play styles.<br />
<br />
There are a LOT of people playing Everquest alone. It's not like we're a rarity, in all honesty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Hello ?<br />
You guys finding XP group that want you to slow stuff ??? Wow !!!<br />
<br />
I have trouble to find good xp group in high PoP xp zone (elemental planes are the best xp zone) already because of the slow mitigation. Groups prefer taking a wizard instead of a shaman that can't do much and beg me for a Fo7.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I like the slow mitigation concept. <br />
It's cool to not have uber_god01 gimped by our 75% tugur and still beeing a challenge and still needing to be slowed because of his insane dps. <br />
But for xp mob, slowed or not, that doesn't change anything.<br />
The tank will need the same amount of CH during the fight. <br />
<br />
So if SoE wants me to be a social shaman and group with folks, they'd better make me damn sexy to those folks (and I m not asking for bigger boobies)<br />
<br />
Until then I ll be a soloing shaman because my slow &gt; DPS added to the group by a dr00d<br />
That, or accept invite to random newbie pickup group in Dreadlands of Valor &amp; Bastion of Trains once the solo xp nerf will be live...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">i have not followed this very well, as i am only lvl 54.<br />
<br />
but isn't the simple solution probably just to be in a group and not be playing with them?<br />
<br />
come on, SOE is really not that smart.  lets say you group with someone and spend the entire night in different zones.  game says you are grouped, i bet you get the exp bonus.  imagine what quad'ers would do if the game thought they were in a group of six, but 5 of them were in PoK?<br />
<br />
and i don't know, can you be grouped and be in trader mode at the same time?  people renting out traders just so the game gives other people group exp?  constantly changing /leader so you can constanly have people grouped?<br />
<br />
or find another solo'er in zone and group with them, then kill stuff by yourself.  isn't there a range that the person has to be in to get exp?<br />
<br />
perhaps i am all wet, but players have been beating SOE at their game for a long time.  i doubt it will stop now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">thought about this some more.<br />
<br />
what difference does it make if the exp comes group or raid exp?<br />
<br />
prob see some enterprising young one collecting plat in PoK, using the 'raid' option and managing soloists just for group exp.  (at least it would be better than running a random game in bazaar)<br />
<br />
what would it be like if soloists got a 60% gain, instead of a 30% cut for killing the same mob?</div></div><hr />

Massive Multiplayer.... Kinda like the world and life, but am i wrong cause sometimes i wanna go out in the woods and be alone and commune with the peace of the world and nature and the universe?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Sorry Bonestopper, you don't recieve an exp bonus if you are the only one in the group recieving exp.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">So let me get this straight the only penalty for soloing will be in PoP? If so thats ok with me...I hate trying to solo there!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">For me, the game is about four things:<br />
<br />
Soloing<br />
Duoing<br />
Single grouping<br />
Multi group raiding<br />
<br />
All of these aspects have their pros and cons. Each one has its own merits and its own time and place. Each one has its own peotential rewards. To me it is pointless to say which is the &quot;right&quot; aspect. They are all the right aspect some of the time and the wrong aspect some of the time. If you have never soloed a dragon, you probably should, even thought the risk hardly justifies the affort. If you have never killed a god, I gotta tell you its a great feeling the fist time you and your guild achieve it. Do you have people you trust implicitly, and know will cover your back, when their is just 2 of you?<br />
<br />
I cannot really relate to people who exclusively solo - lets face it there are far better dedicated &quot;single player&quot; games out there - why not play them? Of course, the fact that I cannot relate to them doesn't make them wrong, nor me right, but exclusive soloing is not for me.<br />
<br />
Its about striking a balance. There is a chanter on my server who has well over 400AA. Now his having 400+ AA doesn't really effect my game, but it does, to my mind, represent an imbalance in the game that would probably be better off adressed in some way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">As someone that plays a druid, warrior, and shaman all I can say is it's about time Sony started to do something about group xp.  I don't care if they nerf PoP solo xp a bit (don't care if they leave it alone either), but they really need to do something with group xp.  <br />
<br />
It took me a week or two to get my druid from 51 to 55 soloing...it took me a few months to do the same thing with my warrior.  (and that's with a good group of friends that has been grouping together for the past 6 months and knows how to work together - chanter, warrior, mage, druid, necro, and either beastlord or shaman)<br />
<br />
The game xp is currently very soloing oriented, and it's about time they start addressing this imbalance - especially for classes like warriors that can't solo effectively past 50.  (and I have about 250k of gear on my warrior...and he still can't solo effectively 50+)</div></div><hr />
