<br />
This is what i used to get quite a lot.<br />
Was told that its apparently Windows (XP esp bad ) leaking memory.<br />
No one really seemed to know an easy solution to this so i reinstalled Windows and now seems to be working fine.<br />
Sorry i know this isnt helpful if youve got a ****load of stuff on your pc but i run EQ off of its own hard drive so i only had to reinstall that drive.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was getting that a lot when I would be running two accounts. I dropped in another 512 stick a couple months ago and havent seen the message since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Now I have another problem. I got another stick of ram, and whenever I try logging in both chars my computer reboots. This seems more likely to happen if my computer has been on for a while. I took out the second ram and it still does this. <br />
<br />
Could my videocard be overheating? It feels warmer than usual (I think). What can I do to prevent this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On a side note, I'm running the two accounts on seperate hard drives, since that was suggested on this forum. Don't know if that would effect this though.<br />
<br />
I really hate that my computer seems that it should be able to handle both at once, but after a bit will shutdown/restart. Ugh... Help please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ollesk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">this has happened to me, i would get to character select and my computer would reboot, i believe this was due to me running TeamSpeak and/or Kazaa/Winamp, after i closed both those down it seemed to run fine, my computer is a peice of crap, 933mghz windows me, 383ddr ram, geforce fx 5200 bio 256mb</div></div><hr />

Right click the &quot;My Computer&quot; icon go down the pop up list to &quot;properties&quot; and click it.<br />
A window should appear with 7 tabs along the top of the window. You want to go to the &quot;advance&quot; tab. Under &quot;Advanced&quot; you will see it broken down to 3 sub areas. The one you want to look at is &quot;Performance&quot; and click the settings button. That will open a new window with 2 tabs Visual Effects and another one named Advanced. Click the advanced tab and once again the window is broken into 3 groups. Virtual memory is the bottom one and is the one you want so click &quot;change&quot; The window will open for Virtual Memory anf in the two white boxes in the center of the screen you can increase the numbers. I leave the maximum size alone and just increased my initial to match the maximum.<br />
<br />
XP users<br />
<br />
1. R-clcik my computer and click on properties.<br />
2. go to the advanced tab.<br />
3. Under Performance click &quot;settings&quot;<br />
4. Clcik the Advanced tab on the newly opened window.<br />
5. Clcik the &quot;change&quot; button<br />
6. Increase the &quot;initial size (MB)&quot; limit to meet the Maximum.<br />
<br />
After doing this it should provide a noticable improvement in your resource capabilites of the PC depending on your maximum available MB you can allocate.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps some. If you have something other than XP i would do a google search for &quot;page filing&quot; and include your OS type.<br />
