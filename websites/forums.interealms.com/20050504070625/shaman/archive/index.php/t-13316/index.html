<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I seen varying opinions of what is good xp per level.  At 58 I'm basically grinding out 4-5 hours a day consistantly.  A lot of this is solo, but I do group with guildies and people who don't seem to have their heads stuck up their back sides.  On average at this level solo i can get 1% regular xp and 1% AA every 2-3 kills, this is with 20% going to AA.  I feel this is good.  I've done PoJ, PoN, and PoD.  By far I've found prisoners/sentries in PoJ to be easier.  These numbers are based off of grinding on DB mobs.  If I duo with someone, it takes about 2 1/2 times the kills for the same XP.  This isn't bad because we pull a lot faster than solo.  I've read the post's in the lvl sections where people claim to bet getting better xp, but when i read it I note that their lvls are a bit lower.  Of course fighting the same mob a lvl 54 is going to get 1-2% per kill.  I know it slows down.  The only way I can think of getting 1% per kill now is fighting white or yellow mobs, not impossible, definitely doable as I've done it, but not worth the return IMHO.  I can fight 4 DB mob's in about the same time and with the same mana as it takes me to kill old yellow.  So...  Is this good and consistant, or should I be doing something else?<br />
 :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 58, you're very close to 60.  The level 60 spells are great if you can get them and it's good to have that level to successfully slow PoP mobs.  If you have your innate running 3 and regen 3, I'd suggest pushing directly for regular EXP and push to 60.  Then, get flagged for PoV and get into a good group in the caves or by the castle.  I think that would give you MUCH more AA than you're currently getting, for less risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">60 &gt; aaxp<br />
<br />
I got 1% aaxp just to have a little bit... but i'm staying 100% regular till i'm at Least 61.  the 61 pet would just be nice to have,  but then i think I have some 62 spells.. so i gotta get 62.<br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Both valid points on getting to 60, and believe me I want to get there as quick as possible.  If everythings stays the same  should be about 2 weeks of hard grinding.  But back to my original question.  Is 1% every 2-3 kills avg?  Or is there something else I should be doing, and someplace else I should be hunting?  At 52-54  It was 1-2% per kill in the planes.  Now at 58 it's 2-3 sometimes 4 kills, if LB mobs are in the mix for 1%.  Is this the norm?  Especially since I'm not flagged, and not likely to get flagged until 60.  Had a group wanted my buffs but not in their trial group.  Needless to say they did their trial without my buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">People exaggerate when they post how much exp they are getting in a particular spot.  They think they are getting better exp than they really are because they just look at how much exp they get over a few kills, not a long period of time.  Here is what you do to determine what the best exp is for you:<br />
<br />
First, find a potential spot.  At your level I was soloing katta guards, which were excellent exp at the time.  The exp there hasn't gotten any worse, but it MIGHT be worse in comparison to PoP.  You'll have to test this for yourself.<br />
<br />
Once you have your spot, WRITE DOWN your exp (use a UI that gives you percentages) when you start.<br />
<br />
Set a timer for 1 hour, and just go at it.  Take note of how many mobs you kill per spawn cycle (at katta guards I think I could kill 4 or 5 w/o my friend's fungi, 6 or 7 with it), and any other information that might be useful (did you die?  If so, why?  Is it unavoidable?)<br />
<br />
At the end of the 1 hour, write down your ending exp.  See how much exp you get per hour.<br />
<br />
Find another potential spot, and repeat these steps. In one afternoon you can try out 5 or 6 spots and see which one is the best, then spend the rest of your time there.<br />
<br />
Here are a few things I looked for while I was still leveling up:<br />
<br />
1)  Plenty of spawns - Waiting for respawn KILLS your exp.  You don't want a camp where you can clear the entire thing and then have to wait for more to spawn.  In katta, at either the bank or twightlight zone in, I never succeeded in soloing all the spawns before repop.<br />
<br />
2)  A safespot - You do not want to be forced to sit somewhere where you get roamers or trains.  1 unexpected add can usually be handled, but it lowers your effeciency and thus your exp.  If you sit somewhere where you get trained frequently, your exp is going to suck from constantly having to run to the zone/die.  This is why the right castle camp in PoV sucks.  It would be an awesome camp except for the stupid bridge overhead where trained mobs path back over.<br />
<br />
3)  Spawns near your safespot - Long pull times mean slower kills and less exp.  In the best camps, you can just target your next victim and cast slow without having to move.  Fungus Grove was an excellent exp zone before pop, for this reason.  You have a patch of mushrooms that I couldn't quite clear before repop, no roamers to aggro you and few trains, and the mobs were all in a nice little cluster, waiting to be killed.<br />
<br />
4)  Easy, low-risk mobs - Dying is bad.  Dying will hurt your exp gain more than anything except falling asleep.  When PoP first came out and I was hunting in PoD at 60, a string of unlucky resists usually meant death or running to the zoneline.  Dying or even having to zone really sets back my exp gain, for me.  If it takes you a minimum of 10 minutes to find a rezz, summon pet, rebuff, and get to FM every time you die/zone, and you die/zone once an hour, your exp was just cut by 1/6.  That sucks.  Fight easy mobs that you know you can kill consistantly.  I leveled from 54+ mainly in katta and FG, and my combined deaths for those two zones is probably no more than 10.<br />
<br />
5)  Exp per kill vs. Time to kill - Pretend you have two mobs.  One mob will give you consistently 1% per kill, and takes you on average 85 seconds to kill from start to finish (you should be timing these things!).  Some mob in pop gives you 4% per kill, but takes you 7 minutes to kill.  Which is better?  The first one.  Do not be fooled by big exp gains.  Quite often, more easy mobs will give you better exp than a few big mobs.  Time yourself and take notes.<br />
<br />
6)  Any special weaknesses/strengths on the mobs - This doesn't come in to play much since most mobs are just warrior classes, but there are a few special cases.  The one I will pick are FG mushrooms.  They have 2 spells and a proc.  The spells are a slow and a stun, and the proc is a 200dd (I think?) and has a big mushroom illusion with it that roots you.  The slow makes FG a real pain for a melee to solo, but has absolutely no effect on a shaman.  In fact, you WANT them to slow you, because when they are casting their slow they aren't hitting you.  The stun and proc are annoying, but they are easily avoided.  How?  All 3 of these spells are based on disease resist.  We get a juicy DR buff and there is a lot of cheap DR gear available.  Once you have 180 DR, you are immune to mushrooms.  They just sit there and try to slow/stun you and never melee.  This enabled me to do 4 at a time at level 60.  FG is obsolete now, though, so this is just an example.  I honestly don't know of anything like this in PoP that can be taken advantage of.<br />
<br />
A few more things to consider:<br />
<br />
Are you soloing or grouping?  I have found, that in general, I get better exp over time when I solo than when I group.  This is because when it is just me, things are very predictable.  I know I can pull a PoV golem every 6 minutes (not sure on my actual time, I haven't had a chance to try them since I got the new dots and Q), and I will never die.  I can do this for as long as I want, only having to take a break every few hours for a kei refresh and a smoke.<br />
<br />
When I am grouping, though, things are far from predictable.  The number 1 thing to ask about your group is:  Does it suck?  All it takes is one incompetent person and your exp gain can be killed.  If the healer, tank, puller, slower, or crowd controller sucks, the group will probably suck.  I am very powerful in an exp group, but even I can't save a group consistantly when there are 4 unslowed and unmezzed mobs brought by a crappy monk.<br />
<br />
At your level, it will be very hard to find a group that can match your soloing exp rate, simply because the characters are not as powerful as they will be at 65, and the person behind the toon probably isn't as experienced as they will be at 65.  You'll need more support classes (2 or 3 people - slower healer CC) at your level than you will at 65 (My normal group is myself and 5 melee - I am all they need to function).  That means less slots open for damage dealers, which means slower kills and less exp.  Also, having 3 people doing support roles means it is 3x as likely that one of them will be afk during a pull, LD, or just plain suck.  With just me as the support person, I KNOW I can do my job and never screw up.  At 58 in a group, you don't have that luxury.  You have to depend on other people.  Soloing, though, you can solo forever and never die or mess up if you are competent and follow the rules I posted :)<br />
<br />
Man, this post is getting off topic.<br />
<br />
To sum it up:<br />
<br />
Try out lots of different spots, and get numbers.  Don't just say &quot;hmmm I think my exp here is better,&quot; get a timer and a calculator and figure it out.<br />
<br />
Soloing is almost always going to be better exp for your level.  However, I liked to group plenty because I made friends and I don't get bored as easily with people to talk to.  2 hours of soloing and I usually get bored and log, but I can go for 10 hours w/ my guildies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Both valid points on getting to 60, and believe me I want to get there as quick as possible.

<br />
<br />
First, do not touch AA exp until you are 60.  One point for run1 (enough to outrun frogs in seb) is ok but after that stop.  I'd even say get to 62 before you go for canni5, since you get all those spells and they are so easy to get, also easier to get a group and flagged for pov.<br />
<br />
Second, don't worry about getting flagged until you're 60, at least.  You might as well wait until 61 since 60 isn't a real level.  Yesterday I joined a group as a replacement shaman and they said all kinds of nasty things about the last shaman, only because he was 59.  I know the guy and he is definately competent, but a sub-60 shaman is just out of his league in PoV, and you're basically an exp leech.  Wait until 60+<br />
<br />
Third, those exp numbers sound like what I was getting in Katta at 58, but it has been over a year so I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Exp sucks compared to PoP.  You can't single pull the shrooms until 60, and by that point you'd be much better off with a group or trying to solo in PoP, the exp is just through the roof compared to anything previous.  Plus they go light blue at 61 or 62 I believe, so you've got a pretty narrow window.  If you can't find anyplace else, it's at least some exp, but in general if you want to really gain exp, get in a PoP zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think 1% every two or three kills solo is a bit low.  <br />
I can see that in a group and kill three times as fast.<br />
<br />
I use the Quartz UI and that gives a % amount on EXP.  <br />
<br />
At 58 I am pulling in 6-7% per half hour on yard trash in PoN with a group.<br />
<br />
Group composition is where it's at.  Get a Cleric, Beastlord (Kitty Crack) an MT that can hold aggro properly and 2 more DPS and you will crank through the exp.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don’t mean this to be negative at all, just an observation.  But after reading this post I almost feel like I’m playing a different game.  It seems strange to me to see the game broken down into nothing more than numbers.  I certainly enjoy gaining levels, but it really doesn’t mater to me if I’m getting 1% experience per kill or 1% per night.  I just log in with my shaman and have fun.  I’ll group with friends, solo or work on trade skills.  Basically I just take what comes along.  Last night, for example, I grouped with friends in the Tower of Frozen Shadow to get a specific drop for one of our group.  After about six hours I think my xp bar went up 1%.  But I had a great time.  On the flip side of the coin, I teamed up with a couple of friends last week in one of the LoY zones and gained 84% of level 53 in two evenings.  Tonight I may log in and spend the evening sitting on a dock in Ak'Anon fishing.  <br />
<br />
Is my take on the game a minority view?  I wouldn’t be surprised, as I usually find myself in the minority in most things I do. *smiles*  I guess I’m just wondering if this type of analytical break down of xp is the focus of a lot of players or if this information is just used for those times when players decide to put away their fishing poles and skinning knives and earn some experience before returning to something else in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Calabar, what Jinheim is talking about is sometimes referred to as &quot;min/maxing&quot; - playing the game like a numbers game to get the most benefit.  If I'm logging in with an eye toward gaining XP as quickly as possible, yeah, I'll min/max and crunch the numbers, and I think of most of the factors he mentioned (short pulls, fast pops, no adds/trains, relatively low risk, high reward/unit time).  I often do this when soloing, because I see no point in soloing if I'm not making significant progress toward some goal.  <br />
<br />
But Monday nights I have a PoN grind set up with some friends in their 50's.  XP sucks rocks at 62 (like 4% per hour or less ), but I keep in touch with my friends and relax a bit.  Other nights I participate in guild raids, which do almost nothing for my XP.  Or I'll work on tradeskills, help a friend with an epic fight, etc.  XP is not my goal on these nights, and min/maxing wouldn't apply.<br />
<br />
Yet other nights I'll be after loot - cash or items - and will treat that differently as well.<br />
<br />
So no, I don't think you're alone in the way you feel, but I think most of us in analytical fields (which, frankly, is most EQ players :-) have thought about the best way to maximize XP from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Calabar, what you're both talking about is running.  You both enjoy running, but Jinheim is interested in what his time is in relation to other runners and what he can do to improve his time.  It doesn't take away from his or your enjoyment of the game, it just shows that you have different focus then he does.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, when running alone, Shaman time sux(am I pushing the analogy too far?).  Our DPS isn't good enough to keep up with most other classes.  We're one of the best long distance solo runners out there, but we're not good in the sprints (guess that's why there are no Dorf Shammy's)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Howling Stones was our old stomping ground in the mid to high 50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thank you for enlightening me.  Perhaps I should read more posts like this one.  The gods know I could certainly use a boost to my experience bar.  Wait, I&#8217;m a Vah Shir, I don&#8217;t worships a god.  *shrugs*  Anyway, I&#8217;ve always been slower to level then just about anybody I know in spite of playing about forty hours a week.  Maybe I need to set aside some time to focus on xp and see if that works for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't bother Min/Maxing my exp anymore.  Too much of that stuff will make you want to stop and say to yourself, &quot;what the hell am I doing??, this isn't fun at all!!&quot;  Then you find yourself at the account screen looking for the cancel button.  I have seen it happen enough times.  I have played EQ since april 99 and believe me I have seen many Min/Maxers get burnt out.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is do something fun, do something different.<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Nothing wrong with min/maxing as long as that's not all you do.  I'm tired of being 62, I'll probably be doing a little of that in the near future ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">At 58 I found the gnoll cave in JPF the best experience solo, easy low risk kills and decent PP to go with it.<br />
59 - 61 I would think DR in PoJ is the best spot for experience, but I don't think you can solo it.  Lots of cash value drops so (best spot in the planes IMHO) to safe up on spell money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">DR in PoJ<br />
<br />
DR?  Sorry, new one to me.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Er, &quot;Dungeon Room&quot; or basement?  Soloable at 61 if you avoid the damn banshee trap, but adds are frequent and plentiful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think DR = Death Row.  On Mith Marr, we call it Mauvin's Hall or MH.<br />
<br />
If you pull to the entrance hall, it's not too bad.  You'll have to deal with getting 2 mobs after the first one, and they hit pretty hard unslowed.    If you grab a partner, it should okay.  <br />
<br />
Adds weren't a big problem and the mobs don't run.  However, if you plan to fight outside the area, be careful.  The high guardians will assist the mobs.  However, trains from people talking to Mauvin was a pain. <br />
<br />
For the 60 to 61, this is probably one of the best exp/loot camps IMHO in Tier 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Calabar, I'm with you but what do I know? I'm just a frelling newb. I only started playing last June and have only made it as far as 44. But I do have fun playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If you're having fun playing, that's all that really matters. ;)<br />
<br />
That said, sometimes you get frustrated being 'stuck' at a certain level or just really want to hurry up and get that next AAXP pt for a new ability or whatever and wanna grind out the xp as fast as you can so you can go on to do something else fun.  Those are the times when you min/max.  <br />
<br />
Like everything else, it's all about balancing the xp grind for levels/aaxp with everything else.  There's no right or wrong way to play EQ.  There may be better ways to achieve a specific goal in EQ though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I agree with Sciek - make sure you enjoy what you are doing! I think its very doable to get from 1 to 65 figthing only boring mobs in boring outdoor zones but is that really what you want from this game? And make sure you know why you want all that exp because its easy to outlevel your friends and then your exp will really take a dive while you wait for them to catch up.</div></div><hr />
