<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jusiel Truegard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm sure somewhere on this page is the answer but I can't find it.<br />
<br />
A friend of mine is trying to MQ the PoA step and the person that has the part from PoA has a faction problem with the lady in Erudite.  (She cannot sneak either) <br />
<br />
My Question: Does the open trade window ...and casting invis afterwards on the one with bad faction work for epic turn ins?<br />
<br />
Thanks, J</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can no longer turn in items to NPCs while invisible, so faction raising would be required to do an MQ with this person.  The NPC is on True Spirit faction, which there are only a few ways to raise.  I found a quest on Allakhazam which may work.<br />
<br />
There is an NPC named Solomen in the room with the undead knights that give DF quests. This NPC when hailed spouts some info. If you say &quot;I AGREE&quot; he will give you a note to take to Erudin to a Camin Rah who spawns in the inn. Giving him the note gives Exp and True Spirit Faction gain..after doing this 6 times, went from dubious to amiable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There was something in a patch message a while back about something they put in to help people reset their True Spirit faction.  As this faction is used by the Shaman epic, they've had problems where they need to reset it back...  Anyway here's the message that was in the patch message:<br />
<br />
&quot; There is a fellow named Moltak in Sol Temple. Killing him gives a negative faction adjustment with the True Spirit faction. BUT, if you have a very, very bad faction with True Spirit, killing him will also reset your faction to a more tolerable level. So don't mess with this fellow unless folks on the True Spirit faction are willing to kill you on sight. &quot;<br />
<br />
If the Erudite is on Truespirit faction, a quick trip to Sol Temple to kill this guy might solve the problem.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The above posters have some good points.  However, here's my take.<br />
<br />
I'd gotten the MQ from a cleric friend who was not kos but was dubious.  <br />
<br />
So long as they're not kos there should be no problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Araya Le'Bon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep....dubious works just fine.  My wife's cleric had the stone, was dubious, and I held my breath while we did the turn in.  No problems.</div></div><hr />
