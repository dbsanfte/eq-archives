<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>libeck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all<br />
<br />
I two box a 63 monk and a 57 (almost 58) Iksar shaman.  When I do hit 58 should I<br />
<br />
Spend a bit of time getting Canni 5 ? (have 5 AA so far)<br />
or<br />
Rush to 60 to get Canni 5 ?<br />
<br />
Also when I get 58 and Partial Complete Heal do you think I could two box in PoV ? Monk is fairly well equiped (some NToV gear) with 50AA <br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Answers are:<br />
<br />
1) Go straight to 60, then get Canni5 OR get the 61 pet and then get Canni5 (Canni5 can not be got at 58, by the way, it's 59 minimum)<br />
<br />
2) Yes, a 63 monk and 58 shaman could tear up PoV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You need level 59 minimum to get AAs.  I would get at LEAST 60 before cannibalize, because Torpor's such a big deal, not to mention Malo.<br />
<br />
But then 60 goes really really fast and True Spirit's a big plus, so you might as well get 61.<br />
<br />
But at 62, you get a new heal that lets you act as prime healer in groups, and you open up 2 new zones with great XP...<br />
<br />
plus from there it's really easy to jet to 65 in a couple weeks with very casual play due to the big XP in the tier 3 zones.<br />
<br />
I'd say get 62, then decide.  If you don't have Malo/Torpor yet, just go to 65 and worry about getting Malos and Q instead and save yourself the worry.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you don't already have Torpor and Malo ready to scribe, I'd say shoot straight to 65 and then work on Canni5. I went to 65, started working on AA, and picked up Q. Honestly, Stoi does the job well enough to get you to 65...and then you can buy Q which is a sick spell. Q and Canni5 are just insane togeather...I'll be getting SCRM and QB2/3 soon; can't fathom what things will be like then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>goose</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Honestly, if you already 60, you might as well grind out the 2-3 weeks it'll take you to reach 65.  It really does go very very fast once you try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sharlok_Bonespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd say it depends on the type of player you are.<br />
<br />
If you're the type that wants to be IN the light after the tunnel, then as many folks have said, get to 65 as fast as you can and then work AA.<br />
<br />
If you're the type that thinks that getting there is half the fun, I'd level to 60 and then work AA for a while.  That's what I did, and I really enjoyed the change of pace.  I had Cann5 and SCRM before I hit 61, and I haven't regretted getting those AAs vs. getting level exp one bit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would get 65 then work on aa but its all a personal choice there is no real right or wrong way to go about it. its all up to you but 65 is the best imho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I didn't bother with AA's till 65th and don't regret the decision at all.<br />
65th spells are worth having, AA's are just nice to have as icing on the cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">BTW, I misspoke above.  You can of course get AAs before 59, you can't get CLASS AAs before 59 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Suggestion, go for 60/61 range.<br />
<br />
Between the chance to get, and use Malo and Torpor, and the 61pet, makes a world of difference. Canni5 changed my style of play, and Malo/Torpor made life wonderful. All added together, and the roses smelled like roses, and that is a good thing.<br />
