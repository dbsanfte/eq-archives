<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tonight, I had a major problem with my PoP EP progression flags, I'd met all the conditions for Saryrn preflag, but preflag mob wouldn't respond to me.  I couldn't get any solid answers or help out of my guild (raids were done for the night, everyone was all bouncing around, I don't really blame them), so before having a psychotic episode, I turned to crucible channel for help.<br />
<br />
Thanks to you guys, I got my flags straightened out.  You guys are always there to lend a hand to your fellow shaman, and I just wanted to say again how much I appreciated you guys being there for me.  If I'd have logged with that problem still there, it would have driven me absolutely nuts.<br />
<br />
So, thanks a million guys.  I owe ya.  :D</div></div><hr />
