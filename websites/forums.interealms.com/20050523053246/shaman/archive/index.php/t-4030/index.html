<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a dilemma.  I own two accounts.  One with a 45 bard, the other with a 55 shaman.  I'm not sure which one I want to play, and which I want to sell.<br />
<br />
I like playing both, and I do a good job at both (at seperate times...I'd go crazy 2-boxing them  ;)  ).<br />
<br />
Shaman only has fear and a CoM fight (I think, it's been awhile) left for epic.  Bard has only done the one-man running around stuff for epic (So I still have all the tough stuff left).<br />
<br />
Bard will be able to get mucho exp in AE groups and in soloing.  Shaman will be able to get mucho exp soloing.<br />
<br />
Only one shaman is needed on a raid (although more helps for buffing), whereas bards are still useful until you've got more than one per group (not that you'll ever see that many  :b ).<br />
<br />
I know this is a shaman board, so it may be a bit biased, but what do y'all think are the pros and cons of the two classes in respect to each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say go w/ the one that you like best.<br />
<br />
Shammys can get groups fast, and solo well, and bards can get groups quite fast as well, and are fantastic charm solo'rs, as well as bieng able to do AE groups, as you said.<br />
<br />
More then 1 shammy should be brought for a raid, because if you only bring 1, hes gonna be rezed ALOT...<br />
<br />
example: Shammy Malo's, shammy Malosini's, Shammy slows...on 4th or 5th try the mob finnally gets pissed and kills the shammy...well, whos slowing now?<br />
<br />
Most uber raids will use several sham's to avoid having this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know which I like best though.  :p   Of course, the not having to twist constantly is nice....but there's still canni-dancing.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, it'd be hard to two-box a bard and any class, they require a lot of attention to play well. I have a lvl 54 bard and a 58 shaman, but on the same account. I love my shaman, I haven't played my bard in a long time. I'd say whatever you enjoy playing more.<br />
<br />
Pro's of keeping the Shaman:<br />
- Very powerful solo<br />
- Higher level, easier to get to 60<br />
- Don't require as much attention as a bard<br />
- MUCH easier to get epic<br />
<br />
Pro's of keeping the Bard<br />
- No really super expensive, rare spells (weapons and armor are a different story)<br />
- Sell the shaman for more money than bard<br />
- More diverse than shaman, have a wider range of capabilities<br />
- Nobody calls you boo-boo when illusioned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am finding that stackability of shaman in high end raids (luclin) is not that big of an issue. In fact, because of all the duties I have currently, I find myself wishing all the time that there were another shaman or two around to help out lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hiho<br />
<br />
Go with what you have the most fun of. Thats what it should be all about. Or if money allows keep both accounts or move 1 char to the other account.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Think I'm gonna sell the bard soon as I get him to 51.  The lure of epic, levels, and already having pretty good gear is just too much (well, as soon as I scrape up enough for a jbb).  Although the whole &quot;paying out the butt for spells&quot; thing sucks.  :p <br />
<br />
I feel kind of bad for releasing an ebay bard on the server...but at least my guild and friends will know to be wary.  :D</div></div><hr />
