<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
Exciting news. I've been invited to attend a small gathering of guild leaders and class community leaders in San Diego the weekend of June 4th. <br />
<br />
This is a GREAT opportunity for me to bring shaman concerns/issues/questions directly to the people who can make a difference.<br />
<br />
I want to take the next week and a half to poll this community, to gather our top issues with the current game and proposed expansions. Until Friday, I would like you to just brainstorm on this thread. I'll print that thread and take it with me so the developers can see a broad spectrum of shaman issues and concerns. <br />
<br />
I know that we are all very passionate about the game and shaman, but I'd like to ask everyone to view this as a chance to do something positive. If you want to vent, please start a separate thread, try to keep these threads as useful as possible.<br />
<br />
Starting on Saturday, I'll attempt to narrow down our concerns to the top 10. We can hone and refine our top 10 until next Thursday, June 3rd. Big thinkers, number crunchers -  our issues need to be succinct, try to think of the best ways to make complex issues easy to understand.<br />
<br />
I know we had a lot of great ideas in the Voice proposal and some of them came true (improved blast heal, improved heal over time, improved balance of the Nihli). You worked hard, we made progress, let's do it again. <br />
<br />
You guys know I love the Crucible and our class and I am really grateful to have this opportunity!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Finailized list (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=1080) <br />
<br />
Proposed AA's for OoW (http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=shamanbalance&amp;message.id=937) <br />
<br />
Just to kick it off. Ill add more later, im too tired to do anything truly productive ATM :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Since Gloriana is going, I would like to include this short message:<br />
<br />
Bring back Winged Courier!<br />
<br />
;)<br />
<br />
But seriously, though I am much less active on the boards and in game, my concerns for shamans remain the same.<br />
<br />
1.  Our current spells and abilities are poorly tuned overall for today's fast-paced and high-intensity encounter styles.   I would like to see future shaman spells and abilities developed with these types of encounters in mind.  Healing, Damage, Debuffing all need to be developed with the encounters in mind.<br />
<br />
2.  Stat buffs are useless.  With the level of gear available now, it is quite easy to max your statistics.  Add in the ability to increase them with AA and the common statistics augs from ldon and pretty much anyone who is level 65 can max their statistics with the set of stat buffs that came out with kunark.  Please do not give us spells that only upgrade pure stats like AGI and STR in the next expansion.  Please consider adding some of the new item effects and effects that were added with the melee retuning (such as combat effects and direct increases to hit percentages).<br />
<br />
3.  Non-ancient cannibalize upgrade that is accessible to the masses.  We've been over this a lot of times, there's plenty of suggestions out there about how to make cannibalize improved but without overpowering.<br />
<br />
4.  Damage Over Time spells and Mob Hate.   There is an inordinate amount of agro generated by damage over time spells.   Please review the amount of hate generated per DPS vs pure melee or direct damage spells.  Using our only dot that is suitable for todays content, Bane, I can do a steady 70dps for 30 seconds (2100 damage), if the spell isn't resisted.  During this same period, I could also cast velium strike 3 times and do 2775 damage, for SIGNIFICANTLY less agro, for more damage.  I have been in situations where I am getting summoned for my 70dps dot over meleers who are doing in excess of 200dps.  This is very broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Non-shaman related.<br />
I agree with the poster below, for the love of god, give clerics a self only invis at high levels, sheesh.  :p<br />
<br />
Leadership AA that allows you to see group members mana bars has been a popular request from a necro pal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess I will post more tomorrow, this is from the top of my head. First, reposts of two of my older threads. Much of these still applies.<br />
summary of shaman problems (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20192) <br />
GoD encounter design (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=20141) <br />
<br />
Basically shaman have still gotten fewer upgrades then any other class, we still have problems with short fights, our mana regeneration is still problematic to use and encounter design is still way to one-dimensional.<br />
<br />
On the bright side Nihil is pretty decent and the zones that did get their MOBs changed to less damage and more HPs are much more shaman friendly now.<br />
<br />
I would like to see a way to make my mana regeneration mean something - regular cannibalize as an AA would help a lot. As is I loose time from casting spells that actually do something. And time is something I find myself having less and less of with every new zone.<br />
<br />
I would like my stat buffs to mean something outside of Uqua, even if that means changing them to non-capped similar effects.<br />
<br />
I would like to see an ability for shaman that stacks and is useful on a raid - the spirit shift AA and the rain heal proposed in the above link are pretty decent ideas for stackable shaman spells.<br />
<br />
I would like to see a bit more healing power, both for shaman and druids. Upping daluda's mending a bit would fit pretty well - also the proposed spirit shift AA (mainly for groups) and a rain heal (for raid healing) would be new, unique and helpful to where shaman are currently lacking.<br />
<br />
Give clerics some sort of traveling ability already. Making the resurrection class(es) the worst at traveling does not increase the challenge, it only increases the tedium. Since clerics seemingly would like to solo (I do not know why the would want to thought) please give them something akin to our disease DoT line, possibly castable only on undead.<br />
<br />
But most importantly content should be a lot more varied then it is at the moment. I fail to see how one can even consider class balancing - the whole concept of which is &quot;well, class A can be better at X and class B can be better at Y&quot; - when large parts of the game and in particular the current expansion are based on a single encounter model.<br />
<br />
One more request: please tell us what you consider to implement, tell us if/when you decide to implement or not implement it and tell us why you reached your decision. The current silence is a lot more aggravating then any explanation could be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Never got to play with that spell, sounds pretty cool though.  I second the concern :P<br />
<br />
  Between the One Voice and the 2 threads on EQLive (Man.. never thought I'd actually use that damn board so much) we got a nice starting point indeed.   Narrowing to a top 10 or so will definately take some serious work.<br />
<br />
<br />
   With interests so widely varied, I'll be general with my own desire.  I want a TOY ability.  Something flashy and fun with a semi-practical application (Like WTD, Divine Arbitration, AE Taunt... things like that).   And I also want a well defined role in which I dominate.  Get those 2 for shammie and we're golden.<br />
<br />
<br />
   Of course, more than that I would LOVE to have buffs of very meaningful capabilities.   The whole reason that a shaman could be a battlepriest at one point was our melee centered buffs, which we could also cast upon ourselves for effect.  An unbuffed shaman was NEVER remarkable.  But we had easy access to almost every buff that anyone would ever use, and so we never WERE unbuffed.<br />
<br />
  Nowadays I only cast focus on myself.  Acumen and SoW are clickable items that I own, and I don't need any other abilities.  Haste is outdated, and without a meaningful haste or an amazing weapon, FA is useless on me compared to something else in that spot.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If they coudl manage to put every single fix to our class out in the form of a buff (with at least the next to best rank being vendor bought), then I would be completely exstatic (and of course since that means limited by time and mana and buff slots, they should actually BE overpowering if all combined in the proper conditions)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It doesn't have to be 10, Caanus, that's just a goal :)<br />
<br />
I also like some of Murtak's suggestions which are not shaman specific. Earlier this week, someone had the suggestion that it would be great to add a &quot;raid motd&quot; to the raid window, those kind of ideas are also welcome (all your ideas are welcome).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That reminds me. Please please please add a timestamp to the guild MOTD. My officers love to forget that and 30 people each day ask if it is current or not. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With interests so widely varied, I'll be general with my own desire.  I want a TOY ability.  Something flashy and fun with a semi-practical application (Like WTD, Divine Arbitration, AE Taunt... things like that).<br />
Uh . . two of those three are among the most powerful AAs those classes get. Not that I am saying we or them should not get it but DvA and AEtaunt are not toys.<br />
<br />
That said, how would an AA that damages you and heals your target (near instant cast time) sound to you? (WHat I call the Spirit Shift AA - for the original poster of this ability see my above link).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I know what you mean about a toy ability...I remember when SoV was about to come out and I heard we were getting Bear Form. I really really looked forward to it and paid WAY too much to buy it the first opportunity I had.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind an upgraded Bear Form (perhaps the source of our passive mana regen?) if it could be shrunk tee-tiny. I haven't turned myself into a bear at all for at least a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well..<br />
<br />
Glori you know my position on alot of stuff. <br />
<br />
Buffs with effects outside of capped statistics that also have Deminishing returns anyways. Meeles should be hopping up and down with glee when a shaman walks by. <br />
<br />
The ability to meele with some small effectiveness. Or without going into specifics. a return to Battle preist status. (One major way to do it. is make Rabid bear a toggle With like an additional 50 a tick regen. And instead of all the stat buffs on it. give strikethrough and increased chances to hit and closer to max damage. But also take Mana regen Down a tremendous amount. Like -50 mana a tick while Rabid bear is going.) Similer to the old rage line. Meele but with a cost. <br />
<br />
DOT paradigm changed from all up front mana cost changed to a mana per tick cost. so that useing dots as DPS doest throw away mana in shorter fights. Then give us a new dot with Big nasty teeth. Like 1000 a tick for 5 ticks. Sure more than a wizard. Unless of course the wizard Crits. Or casts twice and crits twice...<br />
<br />
Lessen the complete dependence on Clerics for all things healed. <br />
<br />
A retuning of small group raid xp. Let folks get standard grouping xp in a raid of 12 people or less.  That in itself would lessen class dependancy becuase then you would not be limited to shoehorning 6 people for a group. <br />
<br />
And stress upon the devs. that anything beaten to death with a stick is boring. We should have variation of all the expansions combat styles. From long luclin fights with amazing AC to The Velious era Major MR stuff to the Bog nasty casting of Kunark to the DPS on angel dust of GoD. And add in variable spawns. Or mutiple chances for different mobs to spawn all over the place. The fabled spawns was a fantastic idea. Do it lots more. All over. <br />
<br />
And finally get away from designing encounters / loot aquisistion/ Flag reciving for only a single route of success. Instead get back to a more RPG feel rather than a Tactical wargaming feel. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wasn't really calling those specific abilities &quot;mere toys&quot;  I was just referring to abilities that have unique attributes and being something noticeable that almost everyone knows about them.  The bit of calling them toy is a concession to being willing to take somethign with little to no game effect :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Was thinking the same. I actually love using bear form + shrink only 'cause I like being low to the ground. (Oddly, I seem to get less lag when I do so) <br />
<br />
If they did so, I'd like to see a new bear graphic though. Same graphic as the PoS bears. :)<br />
<br />
One thing that doesn't get mentioned enough is seeing our stackability on raids improve. I guess because stating so is pretty vague though a lot of the many many suggestions Shamans have offered would probably indirectly help our issue with stackability.</div></div><hr />

I also want our buffs to cap out at like 1 hour as well-should help to keep me from being a buff bot-plus make em group. Actually as I have said before I wish all buffs capped lower, Gettin so sick of waitin for someone to go off and get kei.</div></div><hr />

And the other stuff people said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I know this is a minor concern, all things told, but its an easy one to relate.  Advanced Spirit Call.  Yes, they fixed the -stats- on the ASC dogs, but ASC is useful in different circumstances than SC is.  SC gives push, and rage-tanks well.  ASC gives pushless dps and rage-tanks poorly.  Try to convey that shaman are the only class in EQ that permanently loses an ability by purchasing AA.  Suggest that the 2 effects both be available by hotkey, but tied to the same reuse timer (since 8 dogs isn't what we're supposed to have).<br />
<br />
Then, try to get them to actually express the role they want shaman to have.  We've listed lots and lots of concerns - its not like SOE doesn't know about our lists and problems now.  Ask them to explain *their* vision for shaman, so that we as a community can tailor our responses and requests more appropriately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I would not list 10 things.  I would be very wary of adding particular specific complaints.  I don't want them saying &quot;hey your pets now have innate SoW and dual wield, and we fixed the spirit call AA's, we are off to fix knights now, see you in 2 years!&quot;  <br />
<br />
I'd stay big-picture.  As currently designed, the shaman class is all about efficiency.  Everquest, pre-PoP, used to be a game that was all about efficiency, and the shaman was a powerful class.  Now, efficiency is largely irrelevant to Everquest, and therefore the shaman class is largely irrelevant to Everquest.  Everquest today is a game about fast damage dealing, fast healing, tanking, and occasionally pulling/cc.  Those are the -only- viable roles in this game.  The shaman is a poor choice for each and every one of those roles.  Therefore, the shaman class is a poor one in the EQ of today.  You have said before that people hate long, efficiency based, Luclin style fights.  Fine.  But the shaman class must become significantly better in FAST damage dealing and/or FAST healing to be a worthwhile class in the new EQ.</div></div><hr />

(1) Concerns of game<br />
(2) Concerns of Shaman<br />
(3) Ideas for new aa for shaman in OoW<br />
(4) Ideas for boosting shamans role currently<br />
-in terms of spells,aa, mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I just posted this on the &quot;finalized&quot; thread, but I will repeat it here. <br />
<br />
One idea I had would combine a new AA ability with an improvement many shaman are asking for, increased DPS, and not require a new spell. <br />
<br />
An AA that doubles (pre-crit) the damage of Spear of Torment. Since we already have items with Focus effects on them that ONLY affect this spell, why not an AA as well. Double the damage to 1350. Make it crit-able too, for 2700. Up the mana as well, if you wish, since we get mana savings for it through Ornate or EP gloves. This might even make these items more desiable to shaman (I still wear gloves from VT, since the EP chain are a minor upgrade, at best).<br />
<br />
<br />
Make it deep in the tree. Make it require FoM3 or the Gates version of FoM. I would head there now on my tree if it was available, and I have TONS of pre-Gates AA I still want to finish up (I am around 190, including maxxed Taanan Mastery, which cost me 18 alone). Make it 10 points. I don't care. But its something we NEED to maintain a level of usefullness in groups. Velium Strike doesnt cut it. Period. I dont even mem this spell. Current SoT is a drop in the proverbial bucket compared to other classes. Rangers have better nukes than this.<br />
<br />
Shaman have a lot of &quot;duties&quot; in group before they can start ading DPS. Debuffs, maybe a heal, whatever, byt the time that is done, there isnt time for a DOT, or a VS in the games current direction. A quick nuke that does a reasonable amount of damage for our level is the answer. It would also greatly increase our &quot;stackability&quot; on raids. As it is, I swap between my puny heal and my puny nukes on most raids, and end up feeling fairly useless with both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">One thing that has always bugged a cleric friend of mine is his utter lack of utility...he cant SoW, cant invis, cant even cast See Invis for crying out loud...sure they have heals and Hp/ac buffs locked down but they sure dont travel well. Pacify/move/pacify/move gets old really fast and he ends up getting tired of it so he simply plays a warrior now and just plays dumb thug.<br />
I dont think making it a bit easier for them to travel would be out of wack...heck even granting them basic invis would be a step in the right direction.<br />
For bards, I think they need to look at the instrument playing graphics...bugged for 5 years now, thats just shoddy programming.<br />
Also repair of the old shaman quests for Initiate Symbols would be nice, I know it was a pet project for a Dev back in the day, but I would love it if I could right click summon a hammer on par with the first hammer that clerics summon...it would make my day in fact :D Seriously the emphasis on Quest in EQ needs to be brought back and less on &quot;collect 100 of your closest friends and healers&quot; Make the Epic V2.0 something that is soloable by all classes, make it last longer, harder to get whatever, but make it so I dont have to rely on ultra rare drops (Sk, mages), go to places that require 50+ people to have a chance to not wipe (Fear back in the day, or even now if you screw up and spawn a Ire blind) or that require you to make enemies and step on toes....make it more story driven (like our epic was in the beginning, you used to get the spear as a reward for showing Rak the error of his ways if my memory serves right) and wow, maybe you will actually sell an expansion based on its quality, not just cause your force feeding it to the Ubers and wannabees.<br />
As for shaman issues, meh even at my point in the game, LDON..tier 2, pickup raids, occasional jaunts to HoT, NToV, etc there are issues...I am essentially a Ferine Avatar b**ch with some haste action when VoQ from a buff bot fades. Sure I can main heal ok, but the masses really dont know that shaman can heal well simply because most dont want to. Also I really want DoT aggro explained to me, why a tick of Crit/focused Bane that does 998 points (for example) pulls aggro from a warrior using EB weapons when a wizard had JUST (literally) critted for over 5k...if its a programming bug, fix it, if its &quot;working as intended&quot; then why is it intended that way?<br />
I really do want some sort of buff that 1) matters and 2) that has a timer longer than 6 min base and a 1 min refresh. Useless_Stat_Buff_Level_66 wont even be on my list, and sadly I know it will be there when OoW comes out.<br />
As far as &quot;bones&quot; they can throw us while they are fixing the big picture, I could really dig bash, dual wielding base pet (my typical LDON days sans mage in the party are wacking greenies for pet toys, not cool when people are giggling at the shaman looting rusty weapons for his pet), and maybe looking at giving us some of our old melee priest life back.<br />
I love EQ. I could literally choose it as the only game I would ever play, but man, it needs some fixing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Lots of good suggestions up there, though I don't agree with all of them. But the point I'd like to make is:<br />
<br />
Don't even bother bringing up stat buffs. Stat buffs have ALWAYS been useless in EQ. It just took a long time for people to realize it. Above 140 or so, the only effects any stat buffs have are a minimum amount of damage extra from strength, a tiny bit of HP from Stamina, and maybe slightly faster procs from Dex. <br />
<br />
If we even MENTION stats, its going to divert attention onto them in a way that I can't see turning out productively. If the Devs bring them up, just divert, divert, divert. Talk about buffs in terms of game actions, not innate numbers--How can we improve ATK?, How can we improve DPS?, How can we improve Mana Regen?, whatever. <br />
<br />
Good luck, I hope this turns out to be something worthwhile.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Add a -40 resist modifier to Bane and BoS.<br />
It's pitiful when so many mobs resist our best method of damage, while other classes land theirs much more easily. Particularly painful with the extra long recast on Bane.<br />
We already have these spells, so its hardly stepping on anyones toes to make them actually land regularly.<br />
<br />
Double the hps of dogdog so he doesnt die in one round. This won't affect dps.<br />
<br />
AA suggestion: 50% chance to land a crit heal for 2 minutes, reuse timer up to 60 min. The point of this is to allow shaman to backup heal on single group bosses without overpowering us on regular encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Stacking Shaman healing.<br />
<br />
If there are three shaman on the raid, what do they do?<br />
<br />
If three clerics work at healing the tank, casting their Complete Heal spell with a 4 second interval, then they each contribute massive healing toward the raid's success.<br />
<br />
A shaman's best healing is done with Heal over Time spells.  If one shaman casts a HoT to supplement the healing on the tank, he can make a small contribution toward the raid's success.  But the other two shaman cannot help.  Their HoT spell does not take hold.<br />
<br />
A possible solution would be to allow Heal over Time spells to stack.  Each would take up a buff slot, so it would be necessary for the tank to leave some buff slots open.  This leads to tactical decision making:  what buffs to live without in order to have HoT buff slots available.<br />
<br />
This would take some coding, but this should not pose a great problem.  Multiple copies of the same DoT can run on the mob.  The same coding would allow multiple copies of the same HoT to run on the tank.<br />
<br />
Three shaman casting Quiescence on a tank would provide 1050 healing per tick.  This would hardly be overpowering, with slow-immune and slow-mitigating mobs that can triple or quad for 1000 per swing.  But 1050 per tick is supplemental healing that can make a difference.  It would mean that the second and third shaman can contribute genuine healing toward the raid's success.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Since Gloriana is going, I would like to include this short message:<br />
<br />
Bring back Winged Courier!<br />
<br />
;)<br />
<br />
But seriously, though I am much less active on the boards and in game, my concerns for shamans remain the same.<br />
<br />
1.  Our current spells and abilities are poorly tuned overall for today's fast-paced and high-intensity encounter styles.   I would like to see future shaman spells and abilities developed with these types of encounters in mind.  Healing, Damage, Debuffing all need to be developed with the encounters in mind.<br />
<br />
2.  Stat buffs are useless.  With the level of gear available now, it is quite easy to max your statistics.  Add in the ability to increase them with AA and the common statistics augs from ldon and pretty much anyone who is level 65 can max their statistics with the set of stat buffs that came out with kunark.  Please do not give us spells that only upgrade pure stats like AGI and STR in the next expansion.  Please consider adding some of the new item effects and effects that were added with the melee retuning (such as combat effects and direct increases to hit percentages).<br />
<br />
3.  Non-ancient cannibalize upgrade that is accessible to the masses.  We've been over this a lot of times, there's plenty of suggestions out there about how to make cannibalize improved but without overpowering.<br />
<br />
4.  Damage Over Time spells and Mob Hate.   There is an inordinate amount of agro generated by damage over time spells.   Please review the amount of hate generated per DPS vs pure melee or direct damage spells.  Using our only dot that is suitable for todays content, Bane, I can do a steady 70dps for 30 seconds (2100 damage), if the spell isn't resisted.  During this same period, I could also cast velium strike 3 times and do 2775 damage, for SIGNIFICANTLY less agro, for more damage.  I have been in situations where I am getting summoned for my 70dps dot over meleers who are doing in excess of 200dps.  This is very broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Non-shaman related.<br />
I agree with the poster below, for the love of god, give clerics a self only invis at high levels, sheesh.  :p<br />
<br />
Leadership AA that allows you to see group members mana bars has been a popular request from a necro pal.<br />
<br />
Henora hit the &quot;nail&quot; right on the head on most of the problems. <br />
<br />
I think there are two issues here.  IMMEDIATE fixes and future direction. <br />
<br />
For the future I would hammer on our favorite topic of short fights vs long ones and Sony's insistance that any shaman upgrades would further trivilize old world solo content.  I say so what..if a shammy, necro, druid, whatever wants to farm old world content it has no bearing what so ever on the current and future role of the high level shaman.  The sooner we can get the developers to acknowledge that  the sooner we can get the long-term balance issues addressed.<br />
<br />
Increasing our burst DPS is in my opinion our IMMEDIATE need.  I disagree with a few of the shaman here on the Crucible regarding healing.  I do not see that as our most pressing issue.  Raid stacking fix: it is increase burst DPS.  Getting exp groups: it is increase burst DPS to compete with the Beastlords and charming enchanters who are getting the groups.<br />
<br />
If I was sitting down with the developers I would point out the redundancy issues of more than a couple shaman on a raid - that needs to be addressed IMHO.  Next, I would point out the shaman are having trouble getting experience groups in the more difficult and new content.  The groups are really better off taking a beastlord or chanter as things now sit.  I'm not saying that shaman are broken, its just that with slow mitigation the other classes currently bring more to a group.<br />
<br />
I do not believe that increasing our fast heal by 200 hps is going to help us on raids or to get chosen for experience groups since we are rarely asked to be the primary healer.  IMHO Sony has decided, and I think that's pretty aparent by their actions towards druids that there should be 2 major healing classes.  That's fine with me.  But talking pure balance NOW Shaman heals become less important to an exp group or raid than pure DPS hense Beastlords<br />
<br />
But, back to our current situation before the next expansion....I see a few very easy IMMEDIATE fixes that Sony can impliment NOW that are not unbalanced (in my opinion).<br />
<br />
1) Innate duel wield and better attack for puppy<br />
2) Reduce casting time for our DD's.  Ideally increase damage but easier sell to ask for reduced casting time.<br />
3) Increase FA duration<br />
4) Increase talsman of Alac (rename it lol) ... to 60%<br />
5) Make GOD canny spell non-ancient<br />

LDoN adventures are the same way though, you're still better off hitting BoT/Valor/Storms/Tactics because the experience/loot is much more rewarding, for a lot less work.<br />

Bump the LDoN experience up, bump the PoP experience down. Proper risk VS reward, but the devs don't make EQ anymore, the management with their hands grabbing for our wallets do now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have only 2 issues that I feel need attention.  (specifically related to recent content!  slow mitigation, fast paced fights...  I'm not talking about velious stuff...)<br />
<br />
1) the shaman is of marginal use on raids<br />
2) the shaman is of marginal use in most exp groups<br />
<br />
If the class is made fun/useful in those two aspects again - however it's done - I'd sign back up.  I don't even much care HOW the usefulness is given back to the shaman class.   My class was made inconsequential  - and that's why I quit.<br />
<br />

As just a &quot;casual player&quot; now (you know, a member of the majority of the player base here, and even more &quot;casual&quot; very soon, if I even bother continuing at all), I'm not necessarily concerned about the shaman class being &quot;fun/useful&quot; again, I'm more concerned with the content being &quot;fun&quot; again. To be honest, if all the classes were broken badly, but the content was fun as a result... it wouldn't matter at that point really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No more useless stat buffs!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">My biggest problem with the game as it stands now is how it tends to lock raids/groups into a specific format for success. Its aggravating to have to do nothing until X clerics log on... no one gives a damn if X berserkers are on. Required classes are getting dull. Break the cleric lock on high end raiding, or add an npc cleric mercenaries or something lol.  The thing I like about city of heroes is you can group effectively with about any combination. Keeping a group alive can be done with either healing, superior tanking w ae taunt, ranged dps/snare, debuff/cc etc. Anyone can rez through one shot items, and the classes that can rez as abilities do so in different and unique ways.  Theres lots of routes to success. With eq, for about anything, its tank/cleric/blah. As more people leave for other games, it becomes harder to do anything, which leads to less people logging on, which leads to more quitting. <br />
<br />
Other than that, standard issues with shifting content style marginilizing my class, piss poor spell drop implementation in GoD, boring same old crap spells/abilities, and crappy RVR encounters/quests. Oh, and tell them to put some kind of npc that tells you if the rings in earth are up. I hate doing these things for placeholders. Spying on other guilds shouldnt be required.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. That works in a single player game. In a multiplayer game soloing is not nearly as much when everyone else runs circles around you, killing five times as fast as you. Grouping is not nearly as much fun when you have trouble finding groups because you do not contribute adequately. Every accomplishment is dimished when other classes can do it ten levels sooner.<br />
<br />
Obviously a perfect balance is impossible. We have to (and can) live with a certain amount of imbalance. But to say balance is not important for a multiplayer game is wrong in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Well, basically my standpoint is, we can't be the &quot;generalist&quot; class we once were.  The game has grown intensely in terms of how powerful mobs we face (trash mobs/boss types) later in the game.  With levels being pushed to level 70, it'll be even more so.<br />
<br />
So how should we move away from the generalist mentality of our class?<br />
I'm not totally sure, however:<br />
<br />
BUFFS: Should NOT be our primary focus.  I know some here view buffs has a bread and butter area, but honestly, buffing is an inactive role, that can really cause a lot of &quot;zzzzzz's.&quot;  With limited spell slots, I really don't want to be dancing memming numerous spells and watching tells constantly (like we do that enough as is).  Having that said, it doesn't mean we shouldn't buff all together.  A couple non-stat buffs that last a LONG time, not this 6 minute length with long recast time, junk.  And personally, I don't think we need more stat buffs, even if the cap is increased.  Because gear has proven to make them obsolete, and even if gear in the next expansion won't reach the cap, our current PoP stat buffs, can top it off just fine.<br />
<br />
DEBUFFS:  Here is where I really think we can shine, but it's been basicaly ho-hum.  Yes we slow well and debuff resists well, but how about something more unique and fun?  Curses all the way!<br />
<br />
DAMAGE:  Damage has, and always will be key.  Everyone can do it in some notable fashion at some point, except two classes: clerics and shamans.  DD's may not be the area for mass improvement (although some minor improvement perhaps), but DoTs are.  750-1k a tic with LOW AGRO.  Some wizards are nearing the 8k crit range with nukes, but it doesn't necessariliy mean they get summoned and smashed.  But if a shaman casts a dot and does 350 damage on first the first tic, it can.  It's not right.  It's not fair.  My proposed damage is fair.  It still takes time to do it's full potential.  DD's from wizards, mages, druids, etc. will still out damage it.  They'll just lose more mana doing so (that's the balance).   Bottom line:  People love having people who can do damage in groups.  Let us show them we can too.<br />
<br />
HEALS:  This is a shaky department, where many are torn how it should be improved.  Some don't even want improvements.  But we ARE priests.<br />
I don't know how many times I get stuck in a main heal situation.  I don't feel confident about my heals.  They don't need to be allmighty heals.  I just need heals that brings me confidence, whether it be direct or HoT, and stop needing to say to the dead tank, &quot;I tried to keep up, sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's my take on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Really minor, but nice would be the option to remove helm graphics.  Just the helm, I prefer to see faces.</div></div><hr />

Heals, good god heals.<br />
pets, sow+duel wield, even the druids ultra crappy bear has innate sow.<br />
Increase shaman melee dps to something that resembles melee dps. back in the day shaman were able to melee for some noticeable damage. these days its laughable.<br />
Dot agro is off the charts, fix it or explain why one of the worst dps classes in the game has such an easy time swiping agro from all the other classes.<br />
I recently got a tell from an exguildie (I left the guild when I hit total shaman burnout) they were raiding and had no shaman along...the tell wasnt to ask me to come cause they  needed me, it was to tell me all the shaman loot was rotting. if that doesnt tell you the class is broken what does?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">A quiesence wears off combined with Macnairs idea of heal over time's stacking could be interesting although maybe overpowering who knows. And, a ferine avatar wears off message would be nice perhaps.<br />
<br />
&quot;AA suggestion: 50% chance to land a crit heal for 2 minutes, reuse timer up to 60 min. The point of this is to allow shaman to backup heal on single group bosses without overpowering us on regular encounters.&quot;<br />
That sounds pretty cool with perhaps some tuning.<br />
<br />
My idea for an aa which I said in another thread was pet avatar, makes the pet immune to damage for a period of time and hit for around 300s. I thought would be cool solution for pvp and our lack of damage, but perhaps Blazz's idea for a double spear of torment dmg could be better. I still think with pop it should have been upgraded to 925 dmg and not just given a lame less fizzle upgrade.<br />
<br />
Fix Blind!, or perhaps revamp it to make a mob miss more on hits like in FF but not so overpowering.<br />
<br />
Bearform with mana regen would give benefit to an old spell, although the concept is quite druid like.<br />
<br />
Bane, -30/-40 resist would be nice, already pay for having the spell( as someone put it) by the recast. <br />
<br />
Perhaps remove recast on ferine avatar or make it effects stack over the stat limit with some more noticable effect.<br />
<br />
Detrimental spell haste still looks one of the nicer possibilities in OoW, however failing that perhaps just a quicker casting/recast on malos.<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear, make it hastened rabidity a worthy aa which shamans want to purchase, whether this means altering the reuse of rabid bear down to 30 mins and scaling down from there, who knows.<br />
<br />
Group-regen, regens 7% hp each tick and cures certain counters, although perhaps this is just barking up the tree of group quiesence.<br />
<br />
Hmm how about charisma when cast on a person and that person dies, the person has a change of being rezzed with the buffs he/she died with.<br />
<br />
Just a tongue in cheek idea, imagine if a buff was cast on you, and each tick it increased in strength. Imagine a buff which it progresses to 300 atk nearing the end of its duration.<br />
<br />
Regarding changes in game;<br />
Increase variety of mobs,high hp low hp. Mobs being able to stop players casting beneficial spells, or detrimental spells. Or stop a melee character being able to melee. Mobs with traits, invising, critting mobs, illusion proccing mobs, (fantastic idea in the griegs end.) Mobs that silence, and mez. Mobs that increase in size as their hp goes down, and with that increase their hitting, mobs that reduce every person in a groups hp to 10%.Or a mob with 2 distinct names, can if its a set name come back to life on death, or another name split with halved damage at 75%, or a different name which starts with reduced damage and splits into 2 big hitters. This would enforce a mastery feeling, if that makes sense.  Although, maybe GoD has all this, just Ldon had such a lack of variety I just wanted to point it out.<br />
<br />
Ok will stop being weird now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stat buffs are something that is entirely too easy to do, has too little effect and frankly gives an easy out to the Devs.  Stat buffs are worthless over 65.  Well, ok, perhaps not &quot;worthless&quot;, but, at 65+ we already have all the stat buffs we need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Bigger, faster heal, and group heal.<br />
<br />
2. Improved cannibalization. (AA skill cannV is ok but cannIV is a joke)<br />
<br />
3. Bigger, faster, less mana intensive DD spells.<br />
<br />
Ok, I have to stop here. I am getting angry just thinking about this stuff.<br />
Everytime I go on a Time, Elemental or GoD raid (Lord even on exp groups) I watch as every class has some new, useful aa, spell, or function that makes their class interesting to play and which is vital to guild stratagy. I am so tired of casting malos, turgurs, and patch healing over and over, for ever and ever. Give us something special. Throw us a bone!<br />
<br />
rant off, sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I sorta like the idea of stacking Heal over Time spells.   It'll make the 15 buff slots a LOT more painful, but I can picture a couple attempts at least to take on mobs with a tank using minimal buffs (Virt, 7, BSS, DI) and trying to stack the others with 1 HoT for every raider that can do so.   We normally field 3 to 5 shammie, so it's mean about 1K healing a tick.  Not amazing, but pretty notable.  And it'd make a shaman with BoT capable of getting a tank to sustained 770/tick if situations demanded it (assuming they allowed the spereate spells to stack per person like how our DoTs are)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I am pretty sure allowing HoTs to stack would not fix anything beyond being able to have 2 shaman use them in a group. On a raid the main tank will be scrambling for buff slots as is and 1K or even 2K per tick is barely noticeable.<br />
<br />
And even if that small amount of healing was useful clerics would be doing the HoT rotation, not shaman.<br />
<br />
The best suggestion for a stackable raid heal I have heard so far is still the rain style AE heal. Exact numbers to be worked out but heals a similar amount to Tnarg's/Daluda's, centered on your target, hits the closest 4 damaged players.<br />
<br />
It has zero chance of overpowering us for groups unless we somehow mana to have 4 injured players in range all the time. It stacks just as well as straight healing. And you can pretty much target it on the clerics, the melees, the tanks, the casters, whoever tends to stand in a certain spot.<br />
<br />
HoT stacking on the other hand still has stacking problems, is possibly not even useable in a large amount of encounters and helps us exactly in the few situations were shaman are still fine (or possible in SoEs view overpowered) - long steady fights.<br />
<br />
Its like asking for a better disease DoT. :p</div></div><hr />

If we don't explicitly say we DONT WANT them, they will be added.  I agree, they are a logical, cookie-cutter spell upgrade.  They are already pasted into the shaman Omens spell upgrade slots on Lucy.  Have you forgotten the POP anti-STR/DEX spell ruckus so soon?<br />

If I have learned anything from playing EQ it is not to assume anything in regards to spell upgrades.  I see things on beta or added on test and think ...this won't possibly go live, it's terrible.  Well, terrible spells have and do continue to be pushed live.  Don't assume that the devs know or care we think stat buffs are useless.  Tell them we do.

The only thing I'm worried about mixing stat and things like strikethrough together are stacking issues, and that SOE may make them last as long as FA.   I've liked Ceno's idea of rehashing Focus in the way he did.  I think that would be the better approach.<br />

Isn't it DAoC that have their buffs last forever until you die?  I seriously think SOE should consider going this route.  Of course, HoTs and bard songs wouldn't fall under that.  Buffing isn't a challenge, it's tedious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Gloriana, I LOVE the idea of relevant buffs, its one of our prime roles as shamans.  I am a bit worried that soe will simply raise the stat cap and say 'voila, done!!'<br />
<br />
/agree.<br />
<br />
If we are to buff, we want:<br />
<br />
1.  Worthwhile buffs.<br />
<br />
Raising the stat cap is NOT going to make stat buffs worthwhile, unless of course they completely revise the effects of stats, revamp the entire line of stat buffs to take this into account and rebalance the entire game around this new system.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.  Long lasting buffs.<br />
<br />
For gods sake, Enchanters big buff lasts up to 4 hours.  Clerics big buff lasts up to 4 hours.  *** happened to us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Yes in DAoC buffs are on a seperate pool. A concentration pool. When you die that pool is broken. However, the downside to that system is buffs have no range and since daoc has no zones except for dungeons and capitol cities. <br />
<br />
Players can park a buffing character in a safe spot and forget about them. Unless the toon goes LD or something. Buff bots are the norm for almost every player in daoc. Especially if you want to do well in rvr.</div></div><hr />

I'm still all about &quot;yes&quot; to a new group FA that lasts 30 minutes!<br />
I am not in the least opposed to something like that, but what I am opposed to is straight out of the box +10-20% upgrade to our current stat lines...seriously if someone at level 65+ needs more stats than what we can currently give them (Primal Essence/IoS/FA, regular assortment stat buffs) then they have issues that need to be addressed and more stat buffs are not the way to do it.<br />
Now give me a Dex buff to replace Daiku that adds Strikethrough, or give me a Stamina buff that adds some regen, then I am all for it.<br />
Level 66-70 NEEDS to be the place for stuff like that...consider this, when your /con ing a GOD even level (70), if your power level isnt something amazingly more than it was 5 levels ago, then why bother to grind to 70?</div></div><hr />

I will really appreciate if you mentioned about GoD Spell.<br />
It is all ND and rare, so when we found the spell for Non-exsisting Class, we must leave it and permit it to decay.<br />
This makes us tired and to lose our motivation too much.<br />
Of course this is not specified in Shaman class issue, so it might not fair that you mention about it as the adviser of shaman.<br />
But this is one of the troubles of ours as I think.<br />
<br />
Sincerely</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">We used to be proud of our ability to regain mana. Nowadays Canni V is all that keeps us in the running.<br />
<br />
We used to be the best overall melee buffers. Nowadays we are dead last, below rangers and paladins (above paladins on raids).<br />
<br />
We used to be unrivaled in long endurance fights. Nowadays long fights (the few still left in the game) allow us to pull close or in rare cases break even with the classes who completely outdo us in 99% of the other fights.<br />
<br />
Added to this we still have all of our concerns of raid stackability.<br />
<br />
I would like to see ALL of the above adressed. If that means changing the way some spells or AAs work so be it. If that means introducing a dozen new AAs and spells so be it. But if the trend that has been going on since Kunark continues for even one more expansion this class will be close to dead. Currently it is only the high end that is close to snapping. With 5 more levels, doubtless shorter fights and more slow mitigation for everyone, and yet again less of a power increase for shaman there will be no need for shaman other then a single buff bot per guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">IMHO, this is what shaman need:<br />
<br />
1) debuff mastery: this has always been our domain.  We should once again be the masters of debuffing, either slowing, crippling, resists whatever, we should be returned to the position of debuffing masters.<br />
<br />
2) healing.  We are priests..hybrids should NOT do a better job of healing than us, but atm, paladins can out heal us.  This is sad.  No primary priest class should take a back seat to a hybrid.<br />
<br />
3) buffing:  We once were the kings of buffing..ppl sought us out for our buffs..not anymore.  We should be returned to our prominence as the kings of buffing.<br />
<br />
4) dps: I'm less concerned with our damage output than some of other shaman.  We have never been major damage dealers...not as critical to me.<br />
<br />
5)pet: i'm tired of having to carry a bag of daggers around..omg, fix that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">2) healing.  We are priests..hybrids should NOT do a better job of healing than us, but atm, paladins can out heal us.  This is sad.  No primary priest class should take a back seat to a hybrid.<br />
I would go further then that. No healer should lag so far behind another healer as shaman (and druids) are lagging behind clerics now. Content-based or spell-based, we heal at best half as well as a cleric does, slow or no slow.<br />
<br />
A wizard who nukes half as well as a wizard is not considered a nuker. A puller who brings twice as many MOBs as a real puller is not considered a puller at all. A tank that takes twice as much damage as a warrior is not considered a tank. Even necromancers do not mez half as well as enchanters (on the limited content they can affect).<br />
<br />
Yet it is ok for clerics to outheal everyone else by a factor of two or more. Clerics are not even a class without utility - ressurection, root, stun, spell haste and pacify is by no means a weak utility spellset. The only thing I can see them lacking in is travel convinience and soloing power. Let them have SoE and improved invis, my entire disease DoT department and snare to go with it for all I care, just reduce the gap in healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Hey Murtak - maybe we should ask to be placed as far behind in healing as other slowers are behind us.<br />
<br />
I'd &quot;settle&quot; for healing 5% less than a Cleric.  Remember, according to the Dev's, 5% is a huge difference.  Frankly, if I was 75% as effective as a Cleric I'd be THRILLED.<br />
<br />
So, take all our heals, make them heal 150% of what they do now.  That makes us heal 70% as well as a Cleric.  I'd be ecstatic.  I could actually function as a healer in a majority of the content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">My solution for stat buffs - make all caps separate for worn vs. spell.  Similar to mana regenerations and HP regen, and voila, our spells have meaning again (at least they will do something on our stats, doesn't imply they have meaning in a fight :) ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Here's a few ideas off the top of my head (EP+ geared):<br />
<br />
Up our defenses.  Enchanters and Shamans have about the same amount of hp.  Only difference is AC.  They have rune.  Many times they can / will outtank us when being beat on when using rune.  I suggest that our dodge cap be raised to compensate<br />
<br />
AE Malo / Mala:  Enchanters have AE tash.  I dont see why we cant have some sort of unresistable ae malo<br />
<br />
AE slow:  Remove the 5 mob cap on Tigirs<br />
<br />
Buffs:  Fo7 is not balanced compared to other class buffs.  Dru/Clr hp buffs give an additional effect (dru=mana regen, clr=ac, fo7=?)<br />
<br />
DoT aggro:  Fix it so SCS3 works on DoTs<br />
<br />
AAs:  We dont have any AAs that are really specific to the Shaman except for Cannibalize (rabid bear is a joke).  I would like to see something in OoW that defines our class.  (Like AAs to help improve our debuffing capability)<br />
<br />
Our primary role is supposed to be buffing / debuffing.  I feel that our healing capability is in par with other classes with the recent upgrades we have received.<br />
<br />
Minor Stuff:<br />
Make it so Balance of Nilih doesnt overwrite Turgurs<br />
Give our highest lvl pet innate dual wield + a long duration pet buff<br />
Allow our pets to be shrinkable again<br />
Make group shrink /mgb /tgb'able with a yes/no option like aexloc<br />
Where is our AA refund for the healing ward?!</div></div><hr />

Our heals have been upgraded appropriately compared to the Druids.  If it got upgraded more, then druid heals will need to be upgraded also.

<br />
Since you've seen fit to do so, I'll have to correct it.<br />
<br />
First, our heals are not balanced against Druids.  Never have been.  They are balanced against Clerics and further against our &quot;class defining&quot; ability of Slow.<br />
<br />
Second, not I, nor anyone on these boards, have ever asked for Cleric healing.  Thanks for playing.<br />
<br />
As I said earlier, you can multiply every heal spell we get to heal 150% of what it heals now and we will *still* be behind DRUIDS by the same amount that Enchanters are behind us in Slow.<br />
<br />
So, if by &quot;appropriately&quot; you mean completely out of proportion with the reality of the current high end content, then of course, you are correct.</div></div><hr />

I'm all for addressing priest class imbalance, difficult though, as clerics would need some kind of extra utility or DPS in groups, or groups won't want them over shamans/druids, &amp; if you increase their DPS the paladins howl - see the hammer nerf.<br />
<br />
Nobody is looking for the main healer role, I can see bigger healing happening though, difficult as it would be, it's still probably the easiest way to balance us against GoD &amp; OoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stated in a post of mine, we should have the confidence in keeping people alive.  Maybe you do, but I don't.  And I don't think many here either.  You are forgetting warriors are reaching 12k+ now.  Hybrids are reaching 10k+.  I don't have the GoD heal, but even so, it would still only heal a fraction of their hit points.  You simply can't depend soley on crits.  I've also stated, the many times during raids, I can find myself as a main healer.  If I have a warrior in my group and he ends up tanking an off mob, I either have to A) ask for help, and hope someone listens B) punch heal keys as fast as it lets me and pray he lives, and hope the mob doesn't turn on me for excessive heals.  <br />
<br />
Heck, many times in Time phase 1 trials, I'm the only shaman in the bunch AND have ended up as main healer of a group.  If someone in the group melees a mob (ranger, paladin, monk, warrior, etc.) I have to yell for beastlord or chanter (if any present) to slow, because if I stop, that person WILL die.  It doesn't take long for an unslowed mob to pound someone to the ground. <br />
<br />
There is no reason for us not to be able to heal AT LEAST a third of a person's health 10K+ without the use of crits.  It's absolutely ridiculous my heal can do as little as 15% or less.  Mobs are going to hit even harder as the game progresses.  Slow or not.  Just because it's slowed, doesn't mean the 2-4k hits that do land aren't going to hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">We were never the kings of buffing.  We were only ever the kings of buffing ignorant people who never looked at a parse and assumed that all those pretty green numbers must mean a lot because they meant a lot in D&amp;D.  Right now, we are more powerful buffers than we've ever been.<br />
<br />
However, I would like to see something done about the absurd inconvenience of FA, there is zero reason it should not last as long as KEI.  I am not opposed to getting some useful buffs, but keep in mind (a) buffs are not the reason we became weak, (b) buff slot limitations and (c) buffs can be very easily botted, and we need things for real shamans, not just some warrior's alt bot.<br />
<br />
Really though, most of the things here aren't going to help.  Adding AE this, buff-that, pet the other thing etc, is not going to change the fundamental fact that our class is designed for long, efficiency based fights, and there aren't any of those fights in EQ anymore.  Pre-PoP and post PoP EQ are two seperate games.<br />
<br />
In the new game, there are 3-4 roles available.  Fast damage dealer, fast healer, tanker and sometimes puller/cc'er.  Every class has to be good at at least one of them.  We suck at ALL of them, and that needs to change.  Now, I would love it if they fixed that and then fixed a bunch of other little things too, but if they don't fix that, the rest is meaningless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">For a number of years I was actively a part of the SCA, Society for Creative anachronism. For those not familar with the group they do medival recreation, including combat. Having fought quite a bit in full armor, I can tell you anything that slows my attack speed would also negatively impact my defensive abilities quite a bit! The difference between a blow landing on you or not is less than the space of a heart beat. <br />
<br />
1. In game this could be reflected as an AC debuff included in slow. A 10 to 15% reduction in the AC of a slowed mob would be sufficent to reflect this without being to overpowering. <br />
<br />
2. Our best debuff is a level 53 spell from the Kunark era. That was 6 expansions ago! It is LONG past time that there was an upgrade to this. <br />
<br />
3. I get a bigger HP boost from a 49 cleric spell than I do from both my 62 level focus and sta buffs combined. I thought Shaman were supposed to be the kings of buffing.<br />
<br />
4. Slow Vs. Heal, this is one of my biggest gripes. Slow is at a 75/70/65 ratio, while healing is at a 100/64/47 ratio. It would be unfair to clerics to close this gap for Druids and Shaman, YET it is fair to Shaman to have other classes so close to us in slowing abilities when they can bring so much more to a group with CC and DPS?! These ratios are way too far off from each other especially when you add in the slow mitigation introduced in PoP, and the change in game dynamics towards plowing through short fights. <br />
<br />
5. No disrespect intended to the Devs, but the propsal for a healing rain spell I have seen here on the Crucible makes me picture an angry Tank. Let's face it Shaman rain spells are limited to 4 targets and 3 waves historically, and I have yet to see one cast that did not get a couple resists before expiring. I can just see the same coding being used for a healing rain and the Tanks dying because they resisted it! My rain spells are the least used spells I have.<br />
<br />
6. Dogdog. I got a second account and PLed a Warrior so I have an EFFECTIVE pet. <br />
<br />
7. Stat buffs (STR, DEX, AGI, STA, CHA) if the Vision of our class is to be buff bots then give us more stat buffs that are effective on the below 49 crowd, otherwise they are useless.<br />
<br />
8. Canni. 2 new variant lines of this spell line could do wonders for the desirablity of Shaman in groups. Variant 1, a targetable version of Canni that would convert the targets HP to Mana for them. Variant 2, a group version of canni taking hp from all party members and returning mana to those who could use it. If I can't heal enough to cover a single hit from a mob, then I can Torpor/Q the Cleric and Canni them so they can heal. <br />
<br />
9. If we look at Druid/Ranger, Cleric/Paladin, Necro/Shadow Knight, and Shaman/Beast Lord. None of the other Hybrid classes have a greater desirablity in a group than their parent class does except the Beast Lord, since that class brings both slow and high DPS. <br />
<br />
The &quot;One Voice&quot; of the Shaman class has been crying out for a long time now, so long that the cry has become a Scream. We want to be a contributing member of any group we are in. Is that too much to ask for? Many of are number have gotten tired of asking for this, and canceled their accounts giving up on the hope of ever seeing this. I love my Shaman, as do most of the others who post on the Crucible. But to be a 1 trick pony when that trick is being nullified, and seeing our beloved Shaman being reduced to buff bots is fueling both the anger and the heartbreak we are feeling over our class.<br />

<br />
I agree with most of what you are saying, but this part bugs me.<br />
<br />
Those are rather unfair comparisons.  I'd take a Pally over a Cleric for tanking.  I'll take a Ranger over a Druid for DPS.  I'll take a SK over a Necro . . . period.<br />
<br />
Now, would I take a Cleric over a Pally for healing?  Sure.  A Druid over a Ranger for healing?  Sure.  A Necro . . . wait  . . . n/m.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the casting abilities of a BL are close enough to ours in the important areas that they have become more useful than us.  We bring nothing to the group on a mob by mob basis that a BL doesn't with the exception of healing, and our healing isn't strong enough to be meaningful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">I too would like to be the king of buffs again but in order for that to happen, I would suggest moving into a line of buffs that affect your skills rather than stats.  We already have an atk buff (by all means make it group), why not have something that buffs offense, defense, avoidance, accuracy or backstab (not holding my breath on the last two) but numbers that actually mean something to game mechanics. To complement this, the number of buff slots should be increased. <br />
<br />
As for dps, spells similar to the Bane line are great - minus the recast time. I don't really think it's necessary to make them much shorter than say 4 ticks. But a resist makes it too situational waiting for it to refresh. I don't normally keep a dot loaded and it's loading time does not make it practical to do so during a fight in most cases.<br />
<br />
For healing a group HoT would be swell. However on encounters that require an MGB heal rotation, I'm often too busy doing other stuff (such as curing group and non group members) to really want to get involved.</div></div><hr />

Why is it bad for me to want to be able to prevent as much damage as a cleric by using slow+heals as a cleric does with just healing? That will still leave the cleric with a big edge on multiple pulls, resistant MOBs or if he brings a slower to the group.<br />
<br />
Even with slow we still heal worse then druids. Clerics are playing in a  league of their own at the moment. One cleric will outheal two shaman, without having a slower in his group, not over a single fight but over an indefinite period of time. Being that far behind clerics pretty much means we are not healers anymore, not anymore then beastlords are tanks.<br />
<br />
What you're saying is that the shaman should have the role as  main healer + slower in any given group?  Or maybe you just missed the word &quot;main&quot;?<br />
What we are saying is a shaman should, on single non-resistant MOBs, prevent as much damage as cleric, by using both slow and his heals.</div></div><hr />

They are both better since the retune and I think they are great content but requiring the guild to drag everyone threw it is a major hastle and should be changed. We are getting burn out on both ends. The tanks and clerics are burned out after thier billionth time doing the trials and the &quot;non essential&quot; classes are burned out about not being able to get into them or failing them.<br />
<br />
Ideal situation would be to leave tipt/vxed as they are and add a raid equivilent flag. Add a new mob or take an exsisting mob and make it cover the tipt/vxed flag like smith does for the sewers. This would be the perfect situation allowing both large scale flagging for the guild and yet allowing single groups either on thier own or for guild individuals who missed the raid event to be flagged. You realized how silly it was to force everyone to do all the kod'taz trials recognize this one too.<br />
<br />
Class Balance<br />
I know this is a tough thing to do but I think there are some things that must be kept in mind. Foremost in my opinion is that no class should be the only option for something in almost any situation. Clerics shouldn't be the only viable healer, Warriors shouldn't the only viable tank, monks shouldn't be the only viable puller etc. Now this doesn't mean shaman and druids should be able to heal as well as clerics but it does mean that it should be possible for a shaman to do nothing but heal and keep a tank alive. More difficult? Sure. More risky? Sure. But it should be possible which currently it isn't. This doesn't mean you should be able to take a second string healers and a second string tank and do any content either. Unfortunately you've taken something thats already difficult and made it more complicated by adding abilities that effect encounters in inconsistant ways. Warrior disc like defensive and evasive have different amounts of effectiveness depending the min max hits, attack of mob, ac of tank etc. Slow's effect varries depending on length of fight, mobs dps and mitigation level.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong differences between the classes, advantages and disadvnatages are important and we shouldn't all just be cookie cutter copies of each other but there should be more than 1 viable class for a roll. Especially for critical roles like healing and tanking etc.<br />
<br />
Itemization <br />
There are still pleanty of area's where itemization is kinda strange. Why does every mob under the sun in the ikkinz raids need to drop a class specific weapon? Not personally there yet but all reports are they rott so fast your head would spin. The other items aren't as bad but do you really need 9 mobs that all drop the same 4 things? Also things like Vxed itemization. The 2 named that are closest to zone drop 3 items that are melee/plate items. Sure there are some other nice drops for other classes but you'd never know it since the named only spawn on the far end of the zone.<br />
<br />
Augments as loot is a mixed bag. On the one hand dropped augments are a nice way to upgrade what you have but as the only item to drop they are kinda a disappoint especially when they have limited appeal. Pet focus augment as a raid drop aren't too hot. Endurance augments in general seem to be pretty ho hum. Pretty much every melee i've talked to at the level to get these augments says I've got so much endurance already I wouldn't was a slot on endurance. Hps/mana/end, hps, or mana etc augments seem to be fairly popular but the straight up end ones just seem totally worthless. If endurance is suppose to be the mana for melee's why not make all augments endurance AND mana so it covers both options. Yeah I know that hibrids can benifit from both but with so limited disc the end doesn't really seem to matter.<br />
<br />
Shaman Specific issues<br />
<br />
Healing <br />
This ties in with my previous statements of no class should be the only option. Shaman's healing is currently peged at 47% of that of a clerics. For both our pop and our GoD heals they are 47% healed in the same amount of time and are less mana efficient. As I'm sure some people will note shaman have slows which are very effective at preventing dmg delt and that is very true. The problem is it is so effective that verant has decided that ability is too powerful to be allowed to exsist to it's full capability universally. That has evolved from magic resistant mobs, to slow immune mobs to slow mitigating mobs. On a mob that doesn't mitigate slow a shaman can be a very effective healer especially if the mobs dps isn't that high to start off with. A longer fight improves the situation too. In a situation where the mob doesn't mitigate slow, the fight goes long and doesn't do alot of dps shaman are very effective healers. Probably even more so than clerics. Problem is that situation pretty much describes things that are already trivial anyway. As an elemental geared shaman bastian of thunder is trival to me but it really should be anyway.<br />
<br />
When you move forward to more current content the mobs start hitting harder, mitigating more and in god the fights get shorter. All these things make slows less effective and our healing effectiveness doesn't improve any to make up for it. This is especially true when facing things like the Phixxt Annihilator or other simular mobs when clerics are already having enough trouble. Extreme dps mobs like this are typically immune to slow or highly mitigate it because it would be so powerful on it them and are just so far beyond a shaman's ability to heal in any situation that it's hopeless. Druids really aren't any better off either. I beleive both druids and shaman need thier heals improved to be closer to clerics for the now staple 3.75 casting time heal. Currently clerics can heal for 3275, druids for 2100 and shaman for 1550. Making druids and shaman 64% and 47% effective respectively. I'd propose druids are upped to 80-85% or ~2600-2750 for thier heal and 70-75% or ~2300-2450 for thier heals. Obviously the mana cost of thier spells needs to be increased too and once again the efficiency should be closer to clerics but not ass good. For efficiency i'd propose 90% for druids and 85% for shaman. <br />
<br />
I know some clerics will instantly scream bloody murder that we'll be able to replace them as healers but thats the point. Shaman and druids should be viable healers. Clerics don't how ever loose the title of being the best healer. They still have the best CH spell. They have Divine arbitartion, Divine intervention, Group heals and groups and regular HoT's, 1 casting heal, Spell haste buffs and Bulwark of Vie. They have pleanty of other things they do to make them better healers than druid or shaman even with the proposed heal improvements in addition to bring other things to the table.<br />
<br />
As a shaman we also seem to be missing any sort of group heal. I'd like to see an aa ability group heal simular to Paragon or Wood. Maybe some interesting combination of heal and end regen or temporary attack/ac buff. <br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
<br />
For the most part shaman buffs have really fallen behind. Stat buffs really haven't ment much for a while. They are either capped out from gear and augments already or provide such limited benifit anyway that they are worthless. Our only really worth while buffs are both pretty weak. Focus provides less hps than virtue or 9 and they both have other benifits. Granted focus stacks with both but we contribute less than other hps buffing classes. Even a paladin can buff hps better than we can. On the attack side avatar is very short duration. For direct comparison bsts Ferocity provides more attack and the resists on it are definitely more useful than the stats on avatar. For a less direct comparison Spirit of the predator provides half the attack but last 13 times as long and is a group buff. Significantly easier to use for a spell that doesn't give up that much effectiveness.<br />
<br />
The most popular opinion seems to be to add effects simular to exsisting effects like avoidance, precision and others melee effects. They seem to stack with out a cap found so far and are only on top end items currently. Also group and or longer duration on avatar would be more appropriate. More hps on focus would also seem appropriate.<br />
<br />
Damage<br />
<br />
Currently being weak in the healing, buffing, debuffing category leaves shaman looking for anything they can do to contibute which brings us to damage. Shaman are fairly limited on thier damage options. Our nukes are weak to say the least, Especially after not getting any upgrades at all during GoD. At this point in the game Clerics out nuke us and Hybrids are pretty close. Rangers best nuke is 840 dmg and shaman are just at 925.<br />
<br />
Our dots are better but limited application. Dots are only viable in longer lasting fights because they take time to work and require stacking multiple dots to accieve good effect which also takes time. Having enough time for dots to be worth while is becoming less and less common in the fast paced game that eq has become. Even in those situations where the fights do go long enough for us to use dots effectively we are still limited in thier usage because of aggro issue. I don't know the specifics of how it works but I do know that 2k of damage from bane in 5 ticks a noticable amount of aggro and can pull aggro of tanks if I'm not careful while wizzards nuking for twice that in a single shot seem to have less issues. How ever it works dots generate alot more aggro per point of damage than nukes do. Shaman aren't asking to be wizards but the situation is getting a bit out of hand.<br />
<br />
Mana regen <br />
<br />
Another area that seems to plague shaman is high mana cost spells do due to what is now largely a perceived superior mana regen ability. For example compare shaman and necro dots. We used to share poison dots but now shaman get blood of saryrn at 320 a tick for 535 mana and necros get 335 a tick for 500 mana. Not to mention faster cast time and resist adjusment on necro spell. Compair ldon dots and it's much the same. Shaman are 420 a tick for 490 mana and necros are 430 a tick for 470 dmg. Once again the necros get a resist mod on thier spell too.<br />
<br />
Or look at buffs. 1800 mana for focus of the 7th which really only provides 544 hps for 80 minutes for benificial components while Blessing of the nine cost 1700 mana for 618 hps, 32 ac and 8 mana a tick and lasts 100 minutes. Druids spell is better, lasts longer and costs less?<br />
<br />
Now that we've looked at spell cost why do i call our superior mana regen ability perceived? Way back in the day when SoV first came out and shaman got cann 4 initially Passive mana regen was limited to C2. There was no c3, let alone c5. There was no mana regen in druid buffs. There was no beastlord let alone Spirital xx for mana regen. There was very limited amounts of FT and no clicky mana regen buffs. There wasn't even horses. You had to do a good old fasioned sit to med. At that point cann 4 did put shaman a head of everyone else. Since then how ever passive mana regen his improved several times over and yet cann 4 hasn't been replaced. Since it requires us stopping what we are doing and standing still and casting cann 4 is less and less usable and doesn't provide nearly as large a benifit as it used to.<br />
<br />
Cann v is a very useful ability and does provide shaman a descent boost in mana but averaged out it's 30 mana tick or less compared to the potential 100+ mana a tick a caster can be regening anyway. It's still a great aa to provide mana on demand and help out over time but doesn't justify the perception we still have.<br />
<br />
The need spell in GoD, Ancient Chaotic Pain, is a definite step in the right direction to allow shaman to actually use thier improved mana regen. The problem is as an ancient spell it isn't availble to most shaman and yet all shaman suffer from higher cost spells. Probably the simplest solution is to make the spell a regularly obtainable spell in god and add a new spell for shaman as an ancient. Maybe even an improved nuke that you forgot to give us in God.<br />
<br />
In the end shaman just seem to be a generalist class that had the one thing it did well nerfed pretty majorly and hasn't kept up with the changing pace of the game.</div></div><hr />

No disrespect intended to the Devs, but the propsal for a healing rain spell I have seen here on the Crucible makes me picture an angry Tank. Let's face it Shaman rain spells are limited to 4 targets and 3 waves historically, and I have yet to see one cast that did not get a couple resists before expiring. I can just see the same coding being used for a healing rain and the Tanks dying because they resisted it! My rain spells are the least used spells I have.Now you're just getting ridiculous.  Have you ever seen one of your tanks resist your Q or Tnargs or a Complete Heal?  Of course not, because heals are beneficial spells.

I want them to hear that in order to continue this customer relationship with their players, that they will need to give the Devs and creative gaming people the power to fix the game.  No more BS GoD expansions, because we have already voiced (Many Ubahs leaving, refusal to buy, etc...) our opinions.  EQ will not survive much more of this Exec run crap.<br />
<br />
I want Shaman to be fixed, but I will be patient if they can actually fix the game first.

:P<br />
<br />
  Definately a step in the right direction with those 2 changes, can't wait to see what they shift all the rest into.  Seems that they are planning something with what was initially our Malos, sinia and Malicious upgrades, effect was completely stripped from them.<br />
<br />
  Poison dot is HUGE (689 a tick), cold DD is about 1.2K, cast time still lengthy, but damage is nifty.<br />
<br />
  Group haste is still only 50%, but category is set as a dex buff, really confused by that one.<br />
<br />
  On focus, is that melee damge only, or spell damage as well?  Rizlona line for bards does spell damage and specifically states spells, I figured the melee one would specifically state melee as well, so MAYBE it is multi-purpose, not holding my breath on that though.<br />
<br />
  I guess the only question left is what will the pet and debuffs be like, and are these percentages enough to be truthfully noticeable.  I'd really rather have the effects be something you can identify without having a parser running.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off bear in mind those are Omen spells, directed towards the progression to level 70, and doesn't in any way bear relevance to that content at release...ie Daluda's vs GoD...nor does it address the abilities that other classes will gain during the same expansion...  Who is to say that other classes may not gain &quot;ability buffs&quot; on par or similar to our own that bring other qualities to the mix or how the EQ mob environment will change.<br />
<br />
The list however...<br />
<br />
Content needs to be addressed. An example is if in a single group scenario a mob that can't be slowed yeilds 1400 dps with spikes of near 2k, and shamans, druids and clerics of the appropriate level, AA, and gear heal 450HPS, 650HPS, and near 1k HPS respectively then how are shamans supposed to heal unless they are the 3rd healer?<br />
<br />
Tal of Alacrity should be 60 percent NOW, and its duration should be increased and mana balanced to match.<br />
<br />
Balance of Nihil if its duration is to remain 90 seconds as it stands should be a neg 55 resist, not 40 like a chanter (We don't cast tash!), or else in some cases is not a viable substitute, and in other cases forces us to consume even rarer spell gems to keep options available.  For those with right clicks this can be exceptional limiting, for those without them it can be downright crippling.<br />
<br />
Puppy should have auto dual weild like EVERY other pet capable of doing so, and should have its hps boosted by 50 percent, not so much to tank for obvious reasons but just to survive a single round of combat due to lantency affecting tank placemtn, enrage, or those new and cute melee AE's from mobs, just from a GoD xp group perspective.<br />
<br />
Ancient Chaotic Pain should be accesible to players, it is one the few spells that is class changing from a RL player perspective, and not merely a slightly more powerful varient like most classes.<br />
<br />
Our DD's are pathetic, it shouldnt require AA spent along a &quot;tree&quot; to to address the imbalance.  Even the omen listed spell does the dmg of a cleric 2 expansions ago, in a worse element to cast in, with a cast time of 7.8 seconds.  The listed poison DD that was enumerated in the Sdat as a progression has sub 900 dmg, with a horrid ratio, and a disapointing cast time considering its anemic punch.  Rangers will be nuking for 1k base in Omen as it stands, Wizards from will nuke near 3600 to near 4300 with their Omen Ancient DD...clerics will have nukes ranging up to 1700+ for their ancient spell.<br />
<br />
The dots listed don't in any way address their aggro generated due to applied counters, nor does it change the reset of the MR/Curse DoT, nor does it alter their lack of resist adjustment to prevent them from bouncing.  Even with Tash and Malos overwritten with sinia, Bane still bounces on a consistent enough basis to be sad.  Aggro needs to be addressed, and the spells need innate resist mods<br />
<br />
As for healing the ratios are merely remaining the same throughout.  In addition part of the healing equation is predicated on the shaman ability to slow as an innate part of that formula.  However in no way does healing suffer resists like turgurs, nor does healing require a precursor single mob buff on the tank to have it reach potential like Malos/Sinia, nor is the healing ratio affected by how quickly in the fight it needs to be cast to reach proportional effectiveness.  Shaman slow + shaman heal = Cleric Heal...in theory, however mitigation, resists, and precasts of a resist debuff prior to slow has a tendency to throw that off a tad~  Nor does that address that the clerical Vie spell healing is further thrown off kilter due to the affects of that spell vs healing per second required...in some cases Vie &gt; Slow vs unsloweable mobs.<br />
<br />
The Malo and Sinia line need to have DR resist debuff inclusive and the Decay line removed.  Shamans by nature are required in most if not all circumstances to keep up Cannib IV, HoT, Heal, Slow, Malo(s)/Sinia, and FA at a minimum, leaving 2 slots open only.  If we choose to overwrite with Sinia, Cast decay to actually utilize VP without it being more than a form of distance taunt, or have a 2nd slow loaded, or load up one of our anemic but conversely aggro rich dmg options then we are just SoL on that front!  If mana needs to be bumped a bit so be it, but simply put we have no more spell gems to give for the cause!<br />
<br />
FA is merely an extension of a similar facet to our Cannib issue and our buff duration fix... tedium.  Between the first 2 spells alone we click buttons like bards and are glued to the keyboard and mouse suffering carpal tunnel in the hopes to wrest every ounce of effectiveness out our characters, WHY?  If we even go AFK its not like we get to leave mana song on, we merely come back to a broken FA cycle.<br />
<br />
How does any of those spells affect shaman stacking on raids?<br />
How do they affect our relative healing abilities vs. content proposed<br />
How is slow being addressed in Omen to account for a retention of those ratios?<br />
How is dot aggro being addressed, and moreover how are we supposed to have space for more than 1 without TA or other clickies?<br />
Why do hybrids STILL nuke as hard as we do in far far less time?<br />
Why is button management and frenzied clicking inherent to playing a shaman?<br />
<br />
The list goes on but I'm sure your getting the idea...hope this helps some, but I don't envy you the task Gloriana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Fix (note i said fix) the duration of our Avatar line finally. 6.5 mins is just silly.<br />
<br />
Let some of the changes, if they work out after tweaking, trickle down to other high-end spells pre OOW. So when a 10% damage factor in OOW-Avatar really works and makes the spell more worthwhile, let the lesser versions like Ferine Avatar and so on have relatively lesser factors - for example 8, 6, 4 percent for the lesser versions.<br />
<br />
Or if you find a way to fix issues like problems with DOT-usage, apply that changes (relatively smaller of course) to some of the lower DOTs as well.<br />
<br />
Not to be misunderstood, of course a OOW-shaman will have more tools and will be more powerful than a shaman only in GoD or PoP, no problems with that. But i do not want to be forced to buy OOW to balance my class in it's CURRENT state.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind that other classes get upgraded GoD spells too - this is not a shaman specific fix. The modifications to our stat buffs are a different thing. Hmmm . . that reminds me, I will have to go and check if any other classes get similar effectsd with Omens.<br />

Melee damage (which is fine by me). It is the same effect as on the rogue damage disciplines.<br />

If my tank is not grouped with me he will resist Torpor. Also not I mentioned using the existing coding for rains. Do I think resists on a healing rain are likely, no.

<br />
<br />
The healing ratio that factors in slow, is valid through Velious/Luclin. By the time you add slow mitigation and the higher resists from PoP and beyond conbined with the amount of damage the mobs can do in a single hit, we have a dead tank by the time the Shaman can get the mob slowed, and start healing. When an 8k hp tank can be reduced to 50% health from a mob quading in a single tick, what hope do we have of keeping him alive with a 1.3k heal? That first tick we were busy slowing the mob so we don't start healing till the second tick of combat. Anoth quad from the mob and our heal going off means that 8k tank is now at about 1.3k hp, and drawing low health aggro on top of everything else. <br />
<br />
I am not including healing AAs in the above, since we should not have to have AAs in order to heal. To put it in the simplest terms, AS A HEALING CLASS I SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP SOME ONE ALIVE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">The healing ratios in relation to slows were rarely balanced in mob situations, sometimes this was to a shamans advantage against easy content and other times it was not.<br />
<br />
In order for the heal ratio introduced in PoP to hold true a shaman must have a 75% slow landed on the mob near 70% of the fights duration to have our 47% fast cast heal hold pace with a clerics.  In Tier 3 and down this gives a large enough margin of error and with mob resist factors at level 65 this isn't an issue.  However once mobs begin to mitigate that formula is skewed.  If a mob mitigates slow 75% then the mob must be slowed 95% percent of the time for that ratio to hold true...once slow is mitigated more than that and shaman relative healing power begins to suffer tremendously.<br />
<br />
What was misconstrued was the healing vs. slow ratio so I'll explain~ Pure healing suffers no resists.  Slowing + Healing suffers resists from the slow portion of the equation, takes time to reach the required ratio due to cast times, requires additional spell gems, and takes mana to do so.  <br />
<br />
As for the Omen spell list in comparison to the upgrades placed there and in relation to other classes, with the exception of the buff changes incoorporating the new properties...NOTHING HAS CHANGED.<br />
<br />
The spells are a mere continuation of the same problems we currently face, the same resist issues, the same ratios, the same problematic cast times.<br />
<br />
If you look at that spells list and think &quot;hmmm those are nice numbers!&quot; and conclude that those will fix shaman issues, then I'm at a loss as to what to say to you at this point.  The new buffs are merely a tentative babystep in the right direction...BL's will still grant more raw hps than us due to the almost non-existant benefit from stam these days, and just to add insult to injury Rangers will also grant more hps :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Oh and Benedan mobs rarely quad.  Mobs at higher level typically need to be armed in order to do so...ala vxed/tipt chanter charming.  Mobs if melee based can triple attack which does give some this impression, but most xp group content, with some rare exceptions of named, only double and triple attack.<br />
<br />
Secondly if your 8k tank is being doubled or tripled in a single combat round even with aa your not going to keep him up.  Unslowed mob delay has dropped even more and stands between 1.4 to 1.3 seconds from Ikk down in GoD.  Even with the mob slowed your tank is going to die from 2 round spikes separated by 2 seconds or less, and in that instance your tank is in the wrong zone most likely.<br />
<br />
Third from SoL through to current expansions content is balanced from the top down now.  If you enter GoD from Vxed and up you are expected to have a solid mixture of AA and foci, if not SoE doesn't think you belong in this zone, and they are right.  If by that point you don't have the aa and foci then you contribute very minimally to any group in comparison to others who do belong there.  Luckily there is plenty of content to enjoy that will give both the foci and aa you need.  This in no way just applies to shamans, so its not like we alone are being made to suffer this~<br />
<br />
A concise list if I wasn't making myself clear:<br />
<br />
-New shaman haste.  60 percent, 40min duration.<br />
-New Tal of Alacrity.  60 percent, 40min duration.<br />
-Resist mods placed on dots to help prevent bouncing even post Malos.<br />
-Reduction of aggro on PR/Curse counters similar to past DR adjustment...ala Disease Cloud/SK aggro nerf~ (SCS won't be enough)<br />
-All PR dots from level 60+ should be based on 5 tick duration and have their dmg adjusted accordingly per tick. (Necros as well)<br />
-Introduction of an accesible version of Ancient Chaotic Pain<br />
-Adjustment of FA to reduce the annoying tedium of keeping it up...weither its a group version, longer duration etc I don't care, I just want something done!~<br />
-Malos/Sinia line to include DR component and removal of the Decay line.<br />
-Balance of Nihil resist mod placed at neg 55<br />
-Nuke cast time reduced to 6.1 and dmg bumped while ratios remain. (top end nuke of 1100 to 1200 is appropriate)<br />
-Buffs duration extended to balance with others, ie Fo7 and similar and subsequent to be nearly 50% duration, ie near 2 hour base time Fo7 etc.<br />
-Daluda's bumped to 1700 or 1800 or so base.<br />
<br />
These are not next expansion suggestions, these are for GoD and previous content in relation to other classes experiencing them to retain our parity and ability to contribute in a meaningful manner again.  Then if they want they can continue those percentages in Omen once they are fixed, however patching 1 expansion by attempting to fix it with a subsequent and I'm sure richly bug ridden one is unnacceptable.</div></div><hr />

If it was a buff - the person (there wasn't group spells really at that point in game) wanted the spell and saw a direct improvement due to it being cast on them.   If it was a negative type spell - Slow - Dot - or Damage, there was a noticable effect in which groupmates wanted me to cast those spells.    In OoW - I would like get that same feeling back - other than the one trick pony of  resist/slow combo.<br />

That is not true. Even 100 Str/Dex/Agi are barely parseable, let alone noticeable. And I doubt anyone would notice a couple hundred HPs if they could not actually see them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Hannduvdeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">DoTs - for the love of god (not GoD) reduce the aggro, and add at least minor resist adjustments to our 60+ DoTs.  It's bad enough that aggro is fubar in relation to nukes (spell casting sublety didn't seem to help much at all), but trying to land them even after Malos drives me to the point of not using them alot.  Which brings us to...<br />
<br />
Nukes - a bigger one.  Nothing on the level of wizards, but something so when I'm one of the spare tire shaman I can feel like I'm actually contributing to the raid/group.  Either a bigger fast one or an even bigger slow one, I'm flexible.<br />
<br />
Group FA - don't make it mgb'able if that's the issue for not having made it before, but this *really* would reduce some of the tedium.<br />
<br />
Heals - since I've barely touched GoD content I currently have no complaints here.  Sure, more would be nicer but at my point in the game (Ele) I'm doing fine.<br />
<br />
Canni - no mana issues here.  Can4 can be a pain (*rimshot*), but nobody is forcing you to use it.  When I need the extra mana, it's there.  Can4 + Can5 meets my personal needs.<br />
<br />
Stat Buffs - the current stuff on test looks good to me.  Not over the top, just adding some usefullness to fairly useless stat buffs.  Just don't gimp the duration, keep them on par with the 60+ buff durations.<br />
<br />
Bearform - like others I also have a fond attachment to bearform.  An upgrade would be appreciated.  I like being a polar bear, sue me.<br />
<br />
Rabid bear - One of the AAs I most looked forward to long ago and at almost 400 AAs I haven't bought still because it was never 'fixed' imo.  Stupid long re-use time for something that doesn't overpower us in the slightest.  Make it 30 min base re-use.  Let me get my fun melee delusions almost whenever I want.  A GD bearform (kodiak) for rabid bear would up it's Fun factor by a ton too but I understand the limitations.<br />
<br />
Puppy - face it, most shaman love their pups.  We know we aren't a 'pet class' by your definition, but we still love our pups.  A minor AA to improve his damage for a short time would be nice and fun.  I know you gave us Spirit Call, but those are extra pups, not our real pup.  Maybe an AA that makes him hit 100% of the time for 30 seconds or a minute, re-use 15 min, insta cast (constant Spirit Call interrupts are just SO fun).  Something to put him into overdrive every once in awhile when you *need* max dps.  Call it True Spirit Quickening (in honor of that never used spell).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">I didn't read everyone's post so these may be covered already.<br />
<br />
Melee skills need an improvement.  Clerics can bash better than we can and it was a bone SoE threw to them to help them out while we've had slam since level 1 and it only does 1 damage and hits very rarely.  Our melee dps is so low and we were supposed to be the battle caster.  We can tank stuff so why can't we do decent melee damage to it?  I don't want to have the damage of a true melee class, but I'd like something to put us above clerics.<br />
<br />
A decent throwing skill to go with our short term GoD throwing potions.<br />
<br />
Better heal spell.  We have a sub par &quot;blast heal&quot; which takes too long to cast along with costing too much mana.  We need something with a short cast time and less mana.  If we need to chain cast it when a healer dies and go OOM soon after it is no good.<br />
<br />
Mana costs for spells need to be lowered.  Yes we have Cannibalization, but in the high end game it only cuts our utility.  We don't have passive mana regen so we need something to help cut down on all the hotkey pressing of Canni.<br />
<br />
An upgraded version of Cannibalization whether it be an AA, new spell, some sort of passive regen buff, or anything to get us away from spamming the Canni 4 button over and over again.<br />
<br />
Stat buffs need to be removed for newer expansions.  This is not a viable option for a spell anymore.  Once you get to the elemental planes or progressing through GoD you already have maxxed or close to maxed stats.<br />
<br />
A real role for groups.  Since SoE has taken over the shaman role has been very blurry and not defined.  Yes, we are the top slower in the game, but is that our only job in this game?  If so make it known and cater to that one job instead of beating around the bush.  Clerics get new heals every expansion, why shouldn't we get something to help us slow better, faster, and more efficiently with every expansion?<br />
<br />
We need a reason to be invited to groups.  I've seen Beastlords and Enchanters get invited to more groups than a shaman.  We have to trade our soul for a group now.  It is better to lose the 5-10% better slow to get more dps, mana regen, or crowd control.  If has become almost a task to log on and sit LFG for hours on end.  Shamans just aren't a wanted class anymore since we can't keep up with the fast paced environment.<br />
<br />
Shamans need better nukes.  Comparing Spear of Torment and Blast of Venom we can do more damage with a 54 spell that nukes for 5 more damage, has a shorter cast time, but a higher mana cost than we can with our same line of nuke we get at 61 (Spear of Torment) that costs less mana, higher cast time, and does 5 less damage.  This really needs to be looked into.  Why should a lower level nuke do more damage even if it is 5 more damage.  Every other class gets an upgraded damage nuke instead or the opposite.  We are close to if not the worst nuker in the game and that is the only option for damage we have now.<br />
<br />
Our pets need innate SoW and Duel Wield.  Carrying around bags of weapons is just a pain in the neck and casting SoW on a spirit wolf is just a dumb idea considering the spell being cast is Spirit of the Wolf.  Our pets also need something to increase their dps.  It's almost pointless to use our pets anymore since they put out such a low amount of damage.<br />
<br />
DoTs need to have some sort of aggro modifier on them.  I can take aggro some just about any tank by stacking a couple DoTs on it even if they have an Enraging Blow weapon and the mob is at 70-80%.  There should be no reason for our DoTs to generate so much hate.<br />
<br />
A weapon summoning item for our pets if they don't get innate Duel Wield<br />
<br />
The initiate quests finished.  Only one of them was finished and it'd be nice to get the others done.  Other races have been added that can be shamans that don't even get an initiate quest.<br />
<br />
If I can think of anything else I will post it here.</div></div><hr />

I still like the suggestion earlier in this thread of a aa that say have a 5 mins reuse, and I dunno say a 45 sec duration which makes you crit on every heal you do and every tick of a heal over time. Would be able to account for burst damage and difficulties.<br />

I said missed having the &quot;feeling that casting spells had direct impact on the target&quot;.   You are right as based on player research, almost any stat buff has a marginial impact short of direct HP.   But at the time in our early lower levels, it felt like casting the buff was worthwhile action.   That's what I miss and I really don't care how its brought back ... such as ATK or Damage increase focus effect spells or whatnot.  Doesn't matter to me as long as the spell has worth to cast much less leave in spellbook.   <br />
<br />
Are you saying that is somehow different then it used to be? Itemization certainly is far from perfect but not because many people use many of the same items - that has always been the case. <br />
<br />
Yeap - I am.    Very little of drops today are outside of the standard - Clr/Dru/Shm.    I struggle to think of any Shm only drops in last couple expansion much less Shm and Race based items.    Does this take some extra time and attention - Sure.   At the very least there should be more class only drops - esp given that you can turn items in nowadays for focus effects, hence it doesn't have to rot completely.  And this doesn't touch if something was based off God as well.   At the very least, CT worshipping Shamans should have the last quest medalion released</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">To answer some of the questions above.<br />
<br />
Our top end nuke in OOW will be around 1200 as of right now. Compared to the wizard who is 4200+.<br />
<br />
Our top end quick heal will be around 1600 while the cleric will be 3300+.<br />
<br />
BST and Chanters get dmg modification effects on their buffs as well. Some not as much as ours, but with stackability, buff slot limit, and other added effects, ours are still not worth using.<br />
<br />
Ferine Avatar will give a 10%+ dps increase on most melee. Yeah, some who have extraordinary atk wont get as much benefit, but you can't balance for that. The 10% dmg increase on the new Avatar spell isn't an improvement.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, that is all OOW ****e. This thread is about current problems. These are future problems. While we should complain about these new spells because they don't add anything, this thread should focus on what is wrong now.<br />
<br />
For me, what I would like to see which would keep me playing at all are:<br />
<br />
Merge Malicious Decay with malos/inia line. Adjust mana cost slightly to compensate.<br />
<br />
Look at Dot aggro and damage. It's not even remotely on par with nukes even if they run full duration, so with the current state of the game of fast paced fights they are a pitiful joke.<br />
I would like to see the aa crit line for dots increased to 6%, 12%, 18% at the minimum to compensate for the increased cost in aa's and because of the overall less effectiveness compared to dd aa's.<br />
<br />
Nihil resist mod to -55%.<br />
<br />
Overal, slight improvements to our dd's. reduce cast time, increase dmg slightly. Something that makes us nuke better than a hybrid.<br />
<br />
ToA needs to be 60% like SLTW.<br />
<br />
Daluda's mending needs to be bumped between 1700-1800 at the least. 47% of cleric healing means nothing. % difference relative to another class's power results in only 1 thing, 1 class viable with that ability.<br />
I don't mind the gap widening slightly in relationship to the top heal, but keeping it at 46% is moronic. Any person with minor math skills will be able to see what already ahs happened over the last few expansions. The problems will only get worse.<br />
<br />
Those are issues that if resolved would keep me playing. Mind you, they really wouldn't make me happy, they would get us where we should be at.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">As has been mentioned many times, one of the things that hurts shaman the most is our core reliance on slow. The way things stand right now (mitigation, fast fights, need to debuff MR before slowing), there is little reason to pick a shaman over a chanter/beastlord/bard with regard to slow. Any of the slows is &quot;good enough&quot;.<br />
<br />
What would be nice would be for shaman to regain slowing primacy. Balance of the Nihil made some good strides in this direction. Its fast cast time and resist mod make a big difference. The resist mod should probably be increased to -55 or so, to match the level of resists one would get with Malos + Turgur's. Also, the recast time should be reduced to 3 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
That takes care of making the spell better. Shaman would be able to land their slow faster, and it would reliably land without debuffing.The other problem is mitigation.<br />
<br />
The core problem of mitigation is that it brings slows closer together. By making mitigation multiplicative, the gap between the various classes has narrowed considerably. With a partially effective slow (assumed 50% mitigation), the narrow 5% margin we have over enchanters narrows to 2.5%, and the advantage over beastlords is only 5%.<br />
<br />
With &quot;partially effective&quot; slow mitigation:<br />
<br />
Shaman: 75% x 0.5 = 37.5%<br />
Enchanter: 70% x 0.5 = 35%<br />
Beastlord: 65% x 0.5 = 32.5%<br />
Bard: 52% x 0.5 = 26%<br />
<br />
In my mind, the best way to make shaman slows preferable in a meaningful fashion is to allow them to bypass one level of mitigation on everything but bossmobs. This is for shaman slows ONLY. Please note that single group named do NOT count as bossmobs. Example: Chavoor, a Vxed named that currectly makes slows &quot;slightly effective&quot; for all classes would get a &quot;partially effective&quot; slow from a shaman.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
<br />
1) Increase resist mod on Balance of the Nihil to -55, and reduce recast time to 3 sec.<br />
<br />
2) Allow shaman slows, and ONLY shaman slows, to bypass one level of mitigation on everything but bossmobs</div></div><hr />

<br />
There seems to be a large focus here on increasing DPS by improving our nuking ability (as well as heals, etc.).  I would suggest the following as an alternative:<br />
<br />
1) make DoTs burn mana per tick instead of all at once.  This way, you only burn mana for damage that was actually done.  So if you land a bane, and the mob dies in 15 secs, you only lose 1/2 the mana.<br />
<br />
2) reduce aggro on DoTs.  A shammie with a 30-ish DPS DoT should not be able to pull aggro off a melee kicking out upwards of 200 DPS.<br />
<br />
And, of course, the obligatory bug-fixes:<br />
<br />
1) fix rabid bear<br />
<br />
2) make group version of ferine avatar<br />

Its no longer wether or not gems are &quot;strategic&quot;, its simply if you don't have the right clicks you simply can't load what you need to, ie decay for VP and necro/sk utility, a 2nd dot or nuke in GoD when I'm in group support mode, a 2nd slow erodes my ability to mem a root etc.  Right clicks should be a bonus, an additional advantage, not a necessary requirement to actually load a needed spellset, and yet currently they fall into that category :(<br />
<br />
The best suggestion I can make is that someone email them to have EQ computers set up for this meeting!  Bring some parsers just to be on the safe side :)<br />
<br />
Show them how a shaman operates in zones, especially GoD, and notice the problems we encounter in groups there.  Give your guilds some notice so a group can be ready to go, then log on your account and SHOW THEM!  Show them dot aggro, bane and blood bouncing, healing in Ikk, our nukes firsthand in all their glory etc.  Show them our spell sets, and then remove your right clicks and don't use them, and have them pick a spell set :)<br />
<br />
If you want to show them how shamans should operate in GoD show them Ferubi deep in.  Slow lands fully on everthing but named and then mostly slows, and the power level of the class is IMO balanced there to complement other classes.  Its a zone where every class can make a positive impact if played well, and its balanced for the level of players who benefit from the gear as well.  Risk vs Reward is nice, with CR's being tough but not impossible and it makes crawling the zone fun.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts :)<br />
<br />
Oh one more thing, if druids have group buffs starting at low levels how come no group HoS or group Kragg?...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">Oh and Benedan mobs rarely quad.  Mobs at higher level typically need to be armed in order to do so...ala vxed/tipt chanter charming.  Mobs if melee based can triple attack which does give some this impression, but most xp group content, with some rare exceptions of named, only double and triple attack.<br />
<br />
Secondly if your 8k tank is being doubled or tripled in a single combat round even with aa your not going to keep him up.  Unslowed mob delay has dropped even more and stands between 1.4 to 1.3 seconds from Ikk down in GoD.  Even with the mob slowed your tank is going to die from 2 round spikes separated by 2 seconds or less, and in that instance your tank is in the wrong zone most likely.<br />
<br />
Third from SoL through to current expansions content is balanced from the top down now.  If you enter GoD from Vxed and up you are expected to have a solid mixture of AA and foci, if not SoE doesn't think you belong in this zone, and they are right.  If by that point you don't have the aa and foci then you contribute very minimally to any group in comparison to others who do belong there.  Luckily there is plenty of content to enjoy that will give both the foci and aa you need.  This in no way just applies to shamans, so its not like we alone are being made to suffer this~<br />
<br />
<br />
Granted Quads are not common, but using them made the point. I was not refering to Gates content. Teir 2 PoP has mobs that hit for 900+, and was actually what I was thinking of when I wrote this. I cannot comment on anything in Gates, because I have not bought that expansion. I am watching the comments here to see if Shaman actually can bring something to a group in Gates now that the revamps have been done, if we can then I'll consider buying it since they reduced the price.</div></div><hr />

On the flip side, if a group wants to take on large group - go off to area in which gangs of mobs spawn (all at once). I see no reason that even at level 65 (or 70) why a area could not be spawned similar to LDON does now for a group. To be honest, my wife and I get our alt's together nowadays just to spawn a LDON so we can team up for a dungeon run together. The game does not HAVE to be about time sink Raiding at the highest levels.<br />

<br />
I like this idea. With the group experience bonuses the groups would be better experience but everyone could solo while waiting for a group. Yep, sounds good. <br />
<br />
If we are suggesting solo zones, then why not give an xp bonus for soloing in those zones.? It would reduce the time sink for those who either can't find a group due to time of day, amount of play time, and other limiting issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">People bring up a very valid point.<br />
<br />
  Have the other classes also seen their ancient spell line change?  I am pretty sure it is still a nuke for wizzies and a buff for clerics etc..<br />
<br />
  Why did ours change from Ancient Avatar, to Ancient Canni?  That's equivalent to Ancient: Cleric heal, Ancient: Necro Lich, Ancient: BL pet buff, Ancient: Mage pet, Ancient: Enchanter mez, etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Haakim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">Number one for shaman has to be an improved role in fast, high dps fights.<br />
<br />
After this there has been a lot of great ideas posted, the ones I like are-<br />
DoT aggro reduction.<br />
Bane resist adjust.<br />
Pet dual wield.<br />
Buff effectiveness. Damage mod? Avoidance? Something beyond worhtless stats.<br />
Group haste at 60% please.<br />
Group FA, or even just an upgrade with longer duration. (With something other then stat increases as well of course.)<br />
<br />
The negative side of shaman class is basically this- It's easy to see all of our capabilities languish because of slow and cann. We pay for those two abilities in almost every other spell line. When slowing mobs becomes less important we fall. As for cannablize, mana regen buffs have closed that gap as well. Its time to re-examine how much we pay for slow and cann.<br />
<br />
I do have a couple ideas that will add a lot-<br />
Targettable cannabilize. It's time has come. Either a big AA cann every 3 minutes ala cann5. Or a new cann6, casts like cann4, but does 500 damage to the mob and gives 100 mana back? This would make me so happy, knowing that i am contributing some damage to a fight as i cann. Play with numbers however you like. In practice it may be too powerful, i don't know, but it's such a nice and elegent extension.<br />
<br />
Number two, is a new debuff. It slows the mob by 50%. Everything, all inclusive. Melee rate, cast rate, rampage rate, proc rate, Run speed. Every damn thing. Ok, 50% can be overpowing is some ways, for some fights. Maybe 40%? A new disease &quot;slow.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Gakal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">I would like to see:<br />
<br />
1. Most important in my eyes is some way to add fast dps in a group environment.  This does not have to be nukes,  I think 3 tick dots would also do the trick.  Maybe about 1000 damage per tick. And with a resist modifier like the new slow so they can actually land.<br />
<br />
2. An improvement on our pet.  Let it last more than one round of combat.  Give it a poison dd or stun proc and innate dual wield. The dps does not have to be vastly improved but I get sick of having to constantly recast and buff my pet each time it gets hit.  I would also like to see a way to customize our pets more.  Maybe race or diety  specific models.  While a wolf for a barbarian works, a wolf for a troll shaman does not fit.  As a troll i would prefer to see a hynid type GoD model or a wart hog style model from plane of tactics.  I still think a /namepet command so you could permanently name your pet would be fantastic.<br />
<br />
3. Either no more stat buffs or make them worthwhile.  The only buffs that seem to get used by shaman these days are Focus, FA and talisman of the tribunal.  I would love to see buffs that shaman could bestow on melee that gave them more agro or a proc effect.  As we are no longer needed for our slows with so many other classes almost up to our level I would love to be invited to a melee heavy group due to my ability to augment the dps of others.<br />
<br />
4. Please, please, please fix rabid bear.  This has bugged me for so long I can't even remember.   If you do this I promise to stop sending SOE daily /feedback about it :) . Even just letting it stack with all other buffs would be a vast improvement.  Lowering it to a 30 min timer and letting it stack with all other buffs would be perfect and let us be battle priests again.  Is that too much to ask?  Oh and give it some really wicked graphic, not just some brown teddy bear.  I wanna see red eyes and saliva, after all im supposed to be rabid right?<br />
<br />
I have to say I don't hold out much hope of SOE doing any of the above.  I expect to see more crap disease dots that will never be used due to the new short fights that EQ has adopted.  Upgrades to our dex, str and charisma buffs that are so useless they make me want to cry. Nukes with such long cast times and mana costs that the mob is dead before your first one lands.<br />
<br />
Still us Shaman can dream can't we?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>sharden_1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">I finally re-registered so I could post here.  In ancient times I was registered without the _1 and posted on such concerns as: Undue shaman agro due to slow (luclin era).   I don't know how many recall when SOE (and many other shm here) refused to believe us on the turgurs agro issue.   We finally had a post of hundreds long recounting tales of being summoned for 1 turgurs attempt over the entire raid (even after waiting till the mob was at 50%.   SOE finally acknowledged the issue and fixed it.   It's heartening to see the majority of the shaman here pulling together to get the class improved.<br />
    I've reposted my suggestions from EQLive since I'm not sure how many of you make it over there to check out the growing list.<br />
-- Regards,   Sharden    (Morden Rasp)<br />
-------------- posted on eqlive -----------------<br />
 I'm a 65 shm with 500+ AA that started way way back in beta 2 and tested all the beta's since then.  (In fact it was my suggestion back in the Kunark beta that dog-dog be translucent like the spirit wolves in EC, and my suggestion for %t and such macro's for tells).  <br />
    I have a few Time items and managed with a tight group to pass all the I'kkz trials.   When I finally got the Dualda spell we finished trial #3 and it was amazing the diffence it made... but it re-inforced that the group would have been better off grabbing a 2nd druid than me the shaman. (group: 1 war, 1 ranger, 1 cleric, 1 druid, 1 enc, 1 shm)   The base heal of Dualda's still needs an increase in heal and decrease in mana consumption.........   So far I haven't gotten Blance so I can't state how it's will effect my game.<br />
  (1) Malos + Turgurs   on mobs in Vxed and on will hit if I'm lucky when the mob is at 50%<br />
        -- Decrease resist modifier on either Balance so malos isn't necessary or the mana&amp;recast times on the spells I do have<br />
  (2) Either extend FA duration or remove it.  I refuse to mem it on most runs unless its a boss mob.  <br />
        -- Can't afford the lost spell gem!<br />
        -- dubious returns (parsed to 10% at best? I think) for too short a duration<br />
        -- shortest duration attack buff I'm aware of being asked for during raids<br />
  (3) Increase base heal value of Dualda's <br />
        -- or give us an AA to increase the heal crit rate<br />
  (4) Fast dmg dealing<br />
        -- either a fast fire nuke or bane type high dmg DOT with resist reduction + agro reduction<br />
  (5) 500+ aa's and I still don't have Rabid Bear nor plans to get it...<br />
        -- why ever use this when I can toss one partialy resisted nuke every hour or so and outdamage the AA?<br />
        -- what ever happened to Melee priest shm?  <br />
  (6) Blue con pet at 65 does 22dps with my haste spell  (at best) --- Make him inately dual-wield!<br />
        -- I use it for the buffer time he buys me.... and thats it...<br />
        -- give us a buff that can crank his DPS up to half of Bane per tic DMG<br />
           (casted like a DOT would be maybe per mob or duration covering 30 minutes)<br />
           (this would allow us to still try to slow mobs and heal while producing some dmg for the group)<br />
           (we'd have to watch his agro and probably back him off a lot to prevent his loss.... decent restriction)<br />
   (7) Canna4 destroys the social aspect of the game for shm<br />
        -- change the ratio so I don't have to do it as often and I can chat in between<br />
        -- Ancient canna is a step in the right direction but who has it yet?  not me....<br />
        -- Give us some sort of passive mana regen like the other classes so I can chat again<br />
  <br />
  As an example of my being the sole healer in a KoD'tz exp group we would pull a crag monster and the enchanter would mez it right off.  I would then malos and slow the mob.  The war would start taunting and I would cast Breath on him just before he broke mez.   If we did that every pull I could keep the group alive with my heals.  One mistake or resisted mez and we wiped.   On the partially slowed  mobs there I would end up OOM and the group would have to wait on me to canna it back up.<br />
   Then the one time we tried the Ikkz Annihlator with just the druid and I healing (both time gear'd) we both ran out of mana chain healing and we all wiped with the named at 40%.  I got one crit heal that entire fight.... just no way I could contribute enough even with Dualda's.   They could have done it with 2 druids.... but not a Druid + SHM <br />
    The peak of fun I had in EQ as a shaman was probably way back when on a multiple pull, the group or raid could count on me to slow + root park + off-tank adds.  It was a blast to spin around targeting mobs root them and slowing them before the group had even figured out that there were 5 mobs in the camp.    I'd have to stop the puller and say.... &quot;uhhh I have some parked around us dude.... don't pull yet! &quot;   That level of on the edge excitement is gone....   I have more fun botting my shm on raids while playing my enchanter or bard.....  <br />
    When a pally can nearly out-heal me, a ranger can outnuke me, a bst slow and melee the mob, (need I go on?)  The game doesn't need shm anymore....  its better to bot one for the limited HP FOS can give....  One reason I still play is my friends ask me to come along and do things like Ikkkiz trials, even though a 2nd druid would be better.   <br />
   I still remember the days the guild couldn't raid cause no shaman had logged in.......  those days are long gone.  In fact there's been quite a few Time runs where no shaman had logged in..... The guild really didn't miss them.... I'm not even sure they logged in a shm buff bot to buff FOS prior to starting the Time raids <br />
 <br />
 <br />
--- Sharden   (Morden Rasp)<br />
----------------- followup -----------------<br />
Thinking further about how I as a shaman could contribute to groups and raids I came up with a few more suggestions:<br />
(1) Virulent paralysis    ---   whats the point of this in its current resisted form??  With its long cast times and reuse timer I find I rarely cast this at all<br />
    -- To add to shm crowd control abilities make this a super fast cast timer so on mob inc I can select one of the mobs before it hits camp and stop it in its tracks for a set amount of time (perhaps mez cast time + a wee bit so enc can target it)<br />
    -- drop reuse timer a bit so I can use it if need be on every pull or every other<br />
    --  on non-rootable/non-snareable mobs give it a stun duration:  long enough for a mez to hit<br />
        (I could save the enchanter on GoD trials if I could cast it fast enough... stun needed though in tight corridors)<br />
(2) Allow mob Target ring to shade to a lighter color or ring it with a special color that indicates a Shaman has slowed it<br />
    -- no other class's slow will alter the target ring and con color like a shaman's slow<br />
    -- admitedly this is fluff but it would help multiple shaman in raids target unslowed mobs<br />
(3) Give shm a quick AA skill (like old-style rage line) that would slowly drain my mana yet while it was in effect I could off-tank a GoD style mob<br />
    -- downside is mana-drain,   up-side is I'm now crowd control again<br />
    -- gives me time to slow the mob or enc to mez it<br />
    -- duration 30 seconds and half mana drained during that 30 seconds<br />
    -- AA hot button so another of my precious spell slots isn't eaten<br />
(4) Remove short duration buff's or increase their duration<br />
    -- or..... drum-roll...... give us 10 spell slots!   like I said above: I won't mem FA unless its a boss mob.....<br />
       (how can i do DPS &amp; heal &amp; crowd control if I have to keep FA up in a slot?)<br />
       (at least put a slight colored glow to those we buff with FA so we can see if its still up)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">Lots of good points.  I've probably missed some of these since I haven't read the whole thread, but . . .<br />
<br />
Fix rain spells--they should be AE, and not hit 4 mobs once and the caster 3 times.  Resists appear to be a standard 22% according to parses (why?!?).<br />
<br />
Tigir's--make it AE, or give us a new AE slow in omen (NOT four target where we can't see which is slowed without having to sit there and compare mob hit speeds visually)<br />
<br />
DoT agro--insane, especially with crits.<br />
<br />
Raid sizes--72 to 54.  Okay, who thought it was a good idea to exclude 18 people?  Take that guy out back and send him to the ICU with a baseball bat please.<br />
<br />
Haven't checked it to confirm, but no matter what the lockout timer, a player should be able to be added to the raid which gave rise to the lockout timer--thus long LDs, log outs, etc. won't affect a guildmates ability to rejoin the raid.<br />
<br />
Mobs in ground--bad!<br />
<br />
Cornering--please fix that!  Still broken often<br />

To make a line of spells in the Burst tradition, id like to start with two suggestions:<br />
<br />
Burst of Defiance<br />
Lvl 54<br />
Increase damage avoidance 40% for 4 ticks.<br />
Recast 1 min<br />
<br />
Burst of the Berserk<br />
Lvl 61<br />
Increased chance to melee crit by 40% for 4 ticks.<br />
Recast 1 min<br />
<br />
Burst of Fighting<br />
Lvl 65 or 70<br />
Increase damage avoidance 40% for 4 ticks.<br />
Increased chance to melee crit by 25% for 4 ticks.<br />
Recast 1 min<br />

<br />
Why would you keep FoS memmed?<br />
 <br />
FOS -- for those rez'd or joining the raid (try changing spells with GoD or Time mobs swarming about)<br />
<br />
My lineup is:<br />
Dualda's - 1<br />
Bane     - 2<br />
Breath of Thrushar - 3<br />
Turgurs - 4<br />
root     -  5<br />
FOS     -  6<br />
Can4    -  7<br />
Malos   -  8<br />
Situationally I will mem FA in place of FOS and/or Stam in place of Bane (for those we've had to backflag since so many have quit EQ)<br />
<br />
   Of late only 2 shaman max have been logged in...  FOS is always up.  I get demands for FA (which I refuse to mem unless its the boss mob)  I don't want any more spells to swap out constantly.   It would would be great if we had 6 shaman logged in and 4 of them could do the spells you mention and the other 2 just buff...  <br />
  <br />
   We have 8 shaman in our guild but are lucky to have at least two that play any more.... Perhaps your approach would let us stack more shm but I for one wouldn't want a lineup of short duration buffs being requested of me by 40 melee types.....<br />
  <br />
    Another reason one keeps FOS up is with all the newly flagged Time recruits a few Time mob AE's....  and poof... most those new recruits need a rez and buffs.   The constant backflagging is hell and it seems we are spinning in place... but that's another story</div></div><hr />

I would love to keep Blood and Bane up all the time so I could potentially do some dmg, instead I find I can only keep bane up and with its resist rate it usually bounces...  then I contribute no dmg.    I've dropped root before (pretty naked feeling then) to keep FA up in its slot... but I'm usually in CC anyway and depend on a fast casting root I can chain if need be (something VP doesn't qualify for with it's cast and recast times).<br />
<br />
  If they gave us 2 more spell slots I'd be much happier with the short duration buffs.... that said what I guess Im looking for are spells that bring enough to the table that I will swap out say Bane for the new DMG spell.    I already cast malos only to see it instantly fade cause the mage has cast malosina on it.....(thus reducing the benefit of losing a spell slot to malos)</div></div><hr />

Have you thought about playing a bard?   <br />

The suggestions you made are good descriptions of really great bard songs, not *buffs*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know I, and I'm sure lots of others, don't have the wrist to play a bard. I used to have a bard as a main and he sat at 62 for over a year before I blew the dust off and managed to get him to 63 (didn't take much). Unfortunately, my wrist can no longer handle &quot;4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6&quot; with the occasional switch-up, for more than an hour without going &quot;No way, I'm done!&quot; (but I can type/code for 12 hours straight, with no problems)</div></div><hr />

<br />
  ** Increase the 8 spell slots we can cast from to 2 pages of 8 spells.  Like the macro pages where you can select page 2 with differing macros this ability would let shaman (or others) have Fast heal + debuffs + dmg on one page with rebuffs and fast buff spells (aka FA) on the second page.   A quick click of the page and you can FA that tank then switch back to page 1 and cast bane again.<br />
<br />
   The old logic of:   Only 8 spell slots available since part of the game is choosing which 8 to mem.  This logic is outdated in the current game, you've given the shaman for example FA with its low duration and long reset time (how can we mem all these plus rebuff our raid on the fly without un-meming stuff?)<br />
 <br />
   I really think its time SOE re-thought the 8 spell slot limitation.  If its too hard to fix the code to support more than 8 spell slots, just give us another page that only accepts buffs for meming.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u144"><b>Thorzek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p144">Moving from other thread to here per your request, sorry =P<br />
<br />
SOE needs to learn something here:  The game is scaling in a way no one saw coming.  The newsflash, though, is that this always happens in role-playing type games.  Power gamers will push the envelope, think of things no developer could plan for (CH rotation anyone?  kiting?), and generally ruins the best laid game plans.<br />
<br />
For years, they handled it well.  Summoning mobs took care of kiting abuse.  Rampage added the need to watch health besides the MT (and plan the rampage order).  Flurry ruins the best laid plans of mice and clerics.  Triggered adds kept offtanks on their toes.  Gaters made DPS focus on the MA's mob.<br />
<br />
Anyone who's played D&amp;D knows this game.  The 20th level party annhialates everything in their path.  A good GM resorts to some trickery - DS on the bad guy, maybe a deathguard/contingency/teleport, etc.  A bad GM just scales the numbers, making the bad guy 40th level, with a -40 AC, 800 HP, innate CH, dual wielding Rod of Flailing with oil of bluntness + perma-hasted.<br />
<br />
Now, SOE's chickening out.  It's hard to be creative and come up with new ways to challenge players, so they simply start pumping the numbers.  Bigger, faster, harder-hitting mobs.  Mitigate slow.  Immune to slow.  There's no new strat to learn here.  Now the game is about optimizing the group.  There are no more tradeoffs.<br />
<br />
It used to be &quot;worth it&quot; to choose one class over another to fill a role in a group, because that class could fill in other places.  It was ok to take a pally and not wait for a war, because the pally could hold agro better and mitigate the damage he was taking anyway with stun/healing.  It was worth taking a druid over a cleric because their healing was close, but the extra DPS they brought made the fight shorter anyway, so less damage to heal.  Shaman or chanter as slower?  Didn't matter - chanter had better haste + CC, shaman better buffs + healing help.<br />
<br />
The game is now about short, high risk fights.  Improving slow and debuffs won't do much for us, they will make more mobs that mitigate more and more often.  We need to join EQ2004.  We need better DPS.  Not outstanding DPS.  Not unfair DPS.  Not solo DPS.  Reasonable group/raid DPS.  There are many ways to do this, all within the &quot;standard&quot; shaman role:<br />
<br />
Overbufffs - group FA has been mentioned alot here, I love the idea.  Make sure it's /tgb-able, not like shrink.  Additional ideas on this line would be buffs that break the cap.  Diaku, Wrulan, Boar all get shoved to the back of the spellbook.  How about a spell that gives +30 to all melee stats over the 305 cap?  This would help the DPS + survivability of the group.  Group haste that breaks the haste cap.  None of these threaten to make shamans unfairly good soloers, they just make them more desireable for groups/raids.<br />
<br />
Actual DPS buffs - add +10% to all group members' weapon damage - a 50/42 weapon becomes 55/42.  A 20/20 goes to 22/20.  It's a straight 10% DPS boost for melees in group.  Not outstanding, but worthwhile to invite a shaman for now.  + DPS procs as buffs.  Low-mana, short lasting, so no bumming one from a buffbot before heading off on that 45 minute LDON.  + spell damage % increases.  Who says we can only buff melees?<br />
<br />
Pets - How about a pet that can do DPS &gt; 40?  Maybe 75% of the DPS of a BL pet.  How about a charm?  Bears only?  Animals only?  Druids get one, we get one early on but no upgrade.  A pet that's got mental issues, maybe doesn't like us so much, but that really perks up in a group of strangers - get a DPS bump for each additional person in the group.  No worry about solo imbalance there.<br />
<br />
DOTs that matter - Bane was a start in the right direction.  ToS is the model, but the resist rates make it not quite where it needs to be.  1000/tick for 3 ticks with a reasonable resist rate wouldn't imbalance us vs. the nukers, woudn't do much for the soloability of a shaman, but would be a fit in the fast paced DPS environments.<br />
<br />
All of the above improve the stackability problems shamans currently have.<br />
<br />
Unless our DPS comes exactly in line with other DPS classes, we'll need the secondary role as well, healing:<br />

better zing heal - 2.5k hp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>sharden_1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">Just a side-note on DOT damage...   I find lots of the melee types parsing raid damage against Time MOB's and then posting the rankings on our website.  Shaman usually show up at the bottom of the list or maybe if one of us was chain nuking he might rise up above dead last on the list.<br />
<br />
   The parsing of logs and DOT's not showing up at all cements the impression that shaman suck at DPS.  Not sure what could be done about that beyond bigger, faster nukes.   More DOT's won't fix that impression.   However it is fun sometimes to challenge the MT in our raid that I can cast 2 DOT's on the mobs 75% and pull agro off him.  All it takes is a few Crit DOT hits and baboom.... shm is the new tank (and this is with SCS3)<br />
<br />
   I do find I can stack 2 dot's (now that I have scs3) if I wait till the boss mob is at 50%.  However woe is me if the MT happens to die before the mob.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>downing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">I don't think that it is required to be repetative's on many other issue's for Shaman updating. We all know what has been happening with the decline in our effectiveness. The shaman class class has continued to fall below the upgrade's and power of other classes and expansion's. In order to correct this VERANT-WILL NEED TO PROVIDE WHAT WILL APPEAR TO OTHER CLASSES AS A UNFAIR UPDATE. Inflation of power has been growing at 6% and we are being given 3% raise's, so the update's will need to rather high. These are just thought to include with what all have already said.<br />
<br />
POINTS- SLOW, DOT&quot;S/DPS, HEAL (need help)<br />
<br />
SLOW- 1-an UNRESISTABLE SLOW (50%) that increase's per tick to <br />
(75%) there with be a resistance check on the 25% increase <br />
each tick, if the increase is resisted the next tick will be checked <br />
at the next % of increase. 2- an unresistable SLOW that will <br />
decrease the resistance per tick to allow landing higher slow<br />
(and this could be done on either the MR or Disease based) <br />
<br />
The SHM should be second to none in slow.<br />
<br />
DOT- The SHM is really the only class with the ability to take melee DMG.<br />
Several thoughts.1- DOT's that increase in ticks such as a splurt<br />
per ticks while engaged in melee(bonus to increase per length <br />
spent in melee. The LDON CURSE line, I believe is Verant's <br />
attempt at providing DPS and they fall short in the High end game. <br />
2. More dot's or revamp of some older in the posion and<br />
disease line spells, have been in the direction of higher DPS,<br />
yet fail to come on par with the required DPS need in the fast pace<br />
increase's in the gaming style.<br />
<br />
HoTime- 1- High heals that will increase hp's per tick and decrease the <br />
the de-hasting. 2- group HoTime(such as Q/stoic/torp) that <br />
grow in hp's per tick that the SHM doesn't walk and you get <br />
slight reduction in hp/tick that he/she does move. 2a- Or the<br />
heal would increase if the shm didn't move and maintain if he <br />
did move{ as the hate drew the mob} <br />
<br />
Any increase to buffs, debuffs, haste tied to shm health, as long as they maintain above 10%. Incremental increase, tied to movement or lacl, melee or health of shm.<br />
<br />
I have been a long time reader of the forum, and find alot of good posts.<br />
I feel these are not new problem areas, but are some new solutions. There maybe some lack of insite due to mid 50's lvl on PVP, I started PVP and have never gone back. I have watch raids on Blue server's of all time geared maxed stat guilds smoking through GoD. I've seen wear they struggled (spec UMPQUA, S.P.) And my hats off to &quot;Arch Overseers&quot; Bristelbane. <br />
PVP is slower to lvl, and that's not acomplaint. We have different tactics i.e resistance's. I'm rarely killed due to pvp, unless group hunted, but rarely get the kill due time required, because we are the ultimate in long fights( LOL). PVP does need major revamping and I will spare all of you that, but the with resists-oh my, shm's unresistable doesn't really help in ending the fight. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">seriously, i would ask; <br />
<br />
&quot;If you have broken content still after 3+ Years and multiple expansions later, (ie. http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=647 ) {and others}; WHY should i believe anything you say about fixing the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
that would be where i would start.  it would probably also be close to the end of the conversation too.<br />
<br />
i don't believe them.  i didn't buy LoY, because i do not believe them.  I did not buy GoD, because i did not believe them.  I will not by OoW, because i do not believe them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">I am sorry but these changes are all @#$% bs.<br />
<br />
Looking through the Lucy's Database for Shaman Omen spells (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spelllist.html?searchtext=omen-shaman) what they basicly did was fix the majority of our gripes and complains through OoW.<br />
<br />
So in order to get group 50% haste you have to be lvl 69. I am sorry but this is down right bs. If your want you class fixed buy another expansion and level 5 more levels, which I will pretty much bet that they are going to be the hell levels from hell, is @#$% bs!<br />
<br />
69 - to get a 1202 ice dd<br />
68 - 78 group sta buff<br />
67 - 1690hp heal<br />
<br />
I am not buying OoW to fix my class, fu and goodbye SOE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>Daltara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">More spell slots are going to be critical if they add a bunch of new short duration buffs. I'd settle for 4 more, but 8 would be even better. I dont want to be constantly trying to switch spells in the middle of a fight.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see better AA descriptions. For each AA, I want to see numbers. For example, Spell Casting Fury shows the exact chances of a critical blast. The description for Fury of Magic just says further increases the chance of a critical blast. I want to know exactly how much it increases. AA points dont grow on trees for me, and I'd like to have all the information before deciding which abilities to get.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a group version of HoS added for the lower level crowd. Something around level 51 or 52. Plus it would be nice to be able to do a MGB of that in PoK from time to time instead of Fo7.<br />
<br />
15 slots is just not enough for certain bard songs/effects, player cast buffs, mob cast spells, and heal over time spells. They should start by moving ALL bard songs/procs/effects to the bard song window. A new window for mob cast spells would also help. Would prevent mobs from killing buffs every time they cast a duration spell on me. Lastly, either move heal over time spells to the bard song window or allow it to occupy a 16th buff slot in the main window. This 16th slot would only be for the various heal over time spells.<br />
<br />
A new level of Suspended Minion would be helpful. Allow us to summon and fully buff a pet before zoning into an instanced dungeon and then recall the pet after zoning in. Would make Pet Affinity more uselful.<br />
<br />
There are also some bug fixes I'd like to see happen. <br />
1) Allow us to actually shrink dogodg.<br />
2) I have /targetgroupbuff turned on. When I cast a group spell on a player outside the group, the spell affects that player and myself. When I target my own pet and cast a group spell, it should work the same way. Only dogdog and I should be affected. Currently, the game treats this like a group spell cast on myself and dogdog isnt affected. I should be able to cast Pack Shrew on dogdog and not have to waste points on the single target version.<br />
3) When in bear form, my title goes away. I earned the title of Elder and it should be displayed when I am in bear form.<br />
4) Once I start casting a spell, NOTHING should cause the target to change. Currently, clicking on any health bar in the UI will change the target in the middle of the cast. Something else causes it to change, but I haven't narrowed that down yet.<br />

I would like to echo the sentiments of many here and just say that soE should be reminded that not all of their player bas plays 40 hours per week and not all of their player base is in an uber raiding guild.<br />
<br />
I concur that time effort could be spent fixing known bugs / issues rather than churning out new content for the game's elite<br />
