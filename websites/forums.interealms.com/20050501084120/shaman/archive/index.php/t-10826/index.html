<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading my old &quot;Kunark strategy guide&quot; when i come across the necro class  , i think , hmm necro might be fun to play with ,  so i read on ...<br />

&quot;Necromancers are not welcome in most cities. accept that fact , because it is going to be true for your entire career&quot;<br />
<br />
Wasnt it nice when this was the mentaly of EQ . &quot; This is how it is , dont like it play something else&quot; The EQ i see today is one that has bent TOO much from a fan base that in reality , for the most part , cant make up its mind. So instead of being the shinning becon and the backboneof the game , its bent and shrink to try to please everyone , creating a mess cause as i said , alot of the people they listened to , didnt know what they wanted/were talking about.<br />
<br />
Ofcouse that doesnt mean that no one should listen to anyone and that nothign should change.<br />
<br />
But does anyone else miss these days where it was a lil more simple , where class lines werent blured?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well others who have been around longer (June 1999 here) can weigh in with their 2 cents, but<br />
<br />
1) Hybrid penalties gone = good thing.<br />
2) Kunark = good thing. <br />
2a) Leveling to 60 = good thing.<br />
3) AA's = good thing.<br />
4) Melee Disciplines=good thing.<br />
5) Better tradeskill and more relevant TS's=good thing<br />
6) Epics=good thing<br />
<br />
BUT, <br />
<br />
1) Randomness and dissimilar spell drops =/= good thing<br />
2) Epic difficulty and effect dissimilarities =/= good thing<br />
3) Flagging / Forced time sinks =/= good thing<br />
4) Poorly thought out expansions, classes, AA's, items, et.al =/= good thing.<br />
5) Wily-nily and capricious changes =/= good thing.<br />
6) Focus in and listening to what amounts to less than 1% of your playerbase and making decisions on that filtered listening =/= good thing.<br />
<br />
The Djinni is out of the bottle. And it ain't going back in. Now if it looked like Barbara Eden in 1967 - woo hoo. But since it looks like abashi in a speedo (You're welcome for the imagery), the old gal (eq), she ain't what she used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well my point is more focused on the &quot; they have that , i want that too &quot; crowd<br />
<br />
The wizzies and druids that ask for a slow , the shaman that want a rez and whatever. Things that just DONT fit into what the class should historicly be.<br />
<br />
Now people expect thigns to be bent to their will , as for me , when i came tothis game i looked at what my class can do and will be able to do and based my class choice on that. never entered into my mond that i could bitch to sony hard enough  and have a shot at gettign ports or a rez.  You see what i mean ? class bluring and the envy of other classes just wasnt present  , atleast to my knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baete Oftendead</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do miss having clearly defined classes..back when The Vision was actually a vision for the game and each class....an the good old days when the &quot;End Game&quot; was 2 Dragons...and then 2 badly designed zones with horrid pathing and aggro that didn't require months and months to get in to.<br />

They've made alot of good changes to the game since then, and a few very poor ones...but it's still the best thing going.<br />

Ok Ric Flair.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the MILLIONS who play the South Korean game Lineage? Legion? would disagree with you. Course that game is designed for their mindset while eq attempts to make every pc a hero. <br />
<br />
UO fans would laugh. While they gank some poor slob. I suppose AC2 folks would as well.<br />
<br />
eq MAY be &quot;the best thing going&quot; but that's like saying you're the best looking person in congress. eq COULD have been much more. <br />
<br />
Litgruv - agree with you totally on the class blurring / distinction lines.<br />

You mean like actually be an RPG?  Have dynamic quests?  Have a dynamic world where people, mobs, quests, regions, cities, dungeons, vendors, etc. actually change on a regular basis along a pretty good story path with lots of player interaction such that each server would actually be a really different world?<br />
<br />
Yep - it could have been so much more.  I hope someone can merge the compelling qualities of EQ into such a game and make a TON of money doing it.</div></div><hr />

Worlds of Warcraft has the most hype (Blizzard and all), but there are something like 15 ! new OG's (on-line games) due out in the next 3 years.  Talk about a splintering of the gamers. One of the games actually encourages buying and selling of items found.  I'm not betting the farm on SWG, EQ2, nor Shadowbane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Slomoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I dont think that anyone EVER imagined that the game would reach the scale that it is at now. I doubt anyone at Verant/Sony/or the playerbase could have forseen a game that has grown at such a rate. That is the problem that has plagued the game since the release of Kunark. Its hard to find balance when there is a need to constantly add more to the game.<br />
<br />
Problem that most of the serious/powerplayers face are constant change to what they feel should be the game. In thier/our minds isnt it we who drive the game? Answer is no, its MOOLA and MOOLA alone. The evercrack analogy isnt that far off, give you a taste of the good stuff then give ya what makes the most profit.<br />
<br />
Days when it took several guilds to break Fear, then staying up all night to get on the list for repops. Hanging out waiting for spots to open for Najena(jboots) or CT(rubi). Those were good times. Personally, Ive always thought the fellowship was the best part of the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've only been playing since May of 2000. I've only been a shaman since August of '02. I didn't ever know J-boots as a drop or a lack of epics. But yes, I still feel a bit nostalgiac about the way /bold I /bold saw the world back then.<br />
<br />
Over all of my characters and hours played, I have consistently bitched about one thing and one thing only: WASTED TIME.<br />
<br />
I don't mean time sinks like the VT/VP keys necessarily, although &quot;farming&quot; is a term that makes me want to puke on general principle, I just mean all the hours and days of my life pissed away.<br />
<br />
I'm not an instant gratification kinda guy; but I do despise things that numb my senses (literally) with repetition.<br />
<br />
LFG!!!!!<br />
<br />
This game is centered around groups. FINE! I have no problem with that. But for God's sake give us the OPTION to make progress without a group. I've chosen my classes quite carefully because out of all the TIME SINKS I hate the most in this game, not being able to find a f-ing group is the worst. It flies literally in the face of the Vision to require a group, but not provide a means of guaranteeing a group as soon as you log in.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the dieties I'm a shaman now. Perhaps 3 times since I broke lvl51 has it taken me more than 2 minutes to find a group if I wanted one.<br />
<br />
Ports: Love ya druids/wizzies. Truly do. Had a 54 dr00d of my own. But the books are here to stay and THANK GOD! Now if they'd just put books in a few more places. Let's start with everyplace that has a bank. The banks are all connected, why can't we have stones to all the banks? Cuz that would make Skyshrine and Highpass less of a pain in the ass to get to. /sigh They're doing good.<br />
<br />
Boats: Fun the first couple of times. I hope they all catch on fire and burn to the bottom of the Ocean.<br />
<br />
Corpse runs: We did great with the planes, now lets go back and fix the old world. Corpse runs CAN be huge fun and can teach you a lot about the abilities of the classes. But most often they waste hours of valuable play time and BY GOD THE XP LOSS IS ENOUGH OF A PENALTY. I take death VERY seriously at this level. An unrezzed death (which happens more and more frequently if you hunt OUTSIDE PoP) is enough to make me quit playing for a couple of days in frustration because it very often means a couple of days of work pissed away. Or potentially hours and hundreds of plat finding a cleric.<br />
<br />
Not saying give anyone else rez abilities; just make it a bit freakin easier to get TO a corpse... once again, done in PoP. Let's be retroactive.<br />
<br />
Quest mobs now give back items that don't interest them. Boooya! farkin finally a bone thrown to all us die-hard questors who didn't use to like to read spoilers until they realized it was a monumental waste of time NOT to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rare drops&quot;   dear god please fix this. I would rather run around the WORLD collecting common drops and visiting new places than have to camp for 100+ hours (and counting btw) for an epic piece or two.<br />
<br />
so my point? Yes I miss some of the other stuff. yes there is more blurring of the class lines. YES they need to create more dynamic content, personalizable characters (how many shamans out there carry a SBS???) etc etc etc... <br />
<br />
Yes they screw the pooch a LOT.<br />
<br />
Yes, I believe they are overall trying to create a more enjoyable game than the one they started with.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to give it some time. I am NOT willing to buy another expansion just get an improved bank (which should be free) or the ability to start a new race (which should be free) or the ability to carry a neat new item (which should be free) or a LFG tool (which should be free)... as for the &quot;new zones&quot;.... PoP had lots of new zones too. I'm not sold.<br />
<br />
Fix the other ****; I've got time to wait and see.<br />
<br />
And good job on the stuff you've managed to fix so far.<br />

<br />
Will be hard to leave once Shadowbane, EVE, SWG ect come out.  <br />
<br />
I can honestly say I will never make it passed 60,  hell I never even thought I would even get close to 55.  But thanks to PoP I will probably hit 60 by the end of March.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>tetarn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">EQ did used to be something of a roleplaying game where most things were difficult to do and not everyone was level 60.<br />
<br />
EQ has been changed to be compatible with our fast-food culture. The game is hardly the same game anymore as it used to be pre-RoK. The game has been completely retooled because VI realised that a great many people play the game to raid, not kill the same mob 50,000 times in a row. <br />
<br />
Before it used to be difficult to reach high level, or at least much more difficult than it is now. Look at the changes over time though - hybrid xp penalties removed, more classes being given xp rez, hell levels removed, travel removed, race hate used to be an issue, on and on. That's not to say those are bad things to change - just giving examples of how just about every major change in game dynamics has made it easier. Most changes to game dynamics since RoK or so have been geared at herding newbs into the high end game quickly enough that they don't get bored and quit while trying to &quot;get to the fun part.&quot; VI has redesigned most of the game to put everyone on the fast track to level 60 regardless of skill. I don't think anyone would disagree with me when I say that being lvl 50 or lvl 60 used to mean you were a great player (or at least more so than it does now). Now it just means you play a lot.<br />
<br />
People used to see the low and mid levels as part of the fun, not just some bullbleep you had to go through to get to the fun part. IMO, EQ was mortally wounded with Kunark and is still heading the same direction. For some, it's a fun place to meet people and do quests and things, but for most people anymore it's just an uber contest. <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp... I realize probably no one is going to agree with me. But it's not the same game anymore, at least it's not played anywhere near the way it was. If you don't believe me, go down to Sol B next time Naggy is up, watch the noobs get their ageo, kei, etc., then none of them wait for assist and the raid wipe out. I realize that most people play the game to raid, but if you are going to make it that easy to get to high level, why not just enable people to start characters at level 50? (still waiting for them to sell that... start at lvl 50 for $50)<br />
<br />
EQ is still a great game. Just not as great as the game that it used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Biggest thing that has changed though I think is the players. PLayers now are 500000 times smarter and educated about online games, leveling, tactics, etc then they were when EQ launched. There was what, 8 servers on launch? About 700 ish people on at a time? Took how long to get to 50?<br />

better players? hmmmm dont know...<br />

But vastly easier than when a rubicite breast plate was heralded as the best one out there.... now newbs are starting with BPS with much better effects and HP... well regen was cool.... 19 ac was not....</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are unintentionally proving my point. Take naggy again, just as an example since it was around in the olden days.<br />
<br />
Compare the AC/hp of the MA... today vs. back then.<br />
Compare the DPS of the raid party.<br />
Compare the mana pools of the healers, then vs. now.<br />
Compare the buffs being used, then vs. now.<br />
And these raids still fail all the time. <br />
<br />
EQ started as a lot better game than it is now. Unfortunately, it has been watered down over the past couple years to widen its appeal.<br />
<br />
Harder mobs come into play with each expansion, but the game is not harder. Initially so, but expansions do not just come with new mobs, but with new items with which to kill the mobs. Initially it is harder, but after a few months it evens out, and you have the same old trivial content again.<br />
<br />
If the content isn't trivial, 'uber' mobs would not only spawn once a week, they would protect their own drops rather than a forced form of rarity as we see it now.<br />
<br />
Took how long to get to 50? <br />
<br />
Yes, exactly, it used to take a little skill and some time. Players today view it as a bad thing that it wasn't always an easy process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nastalgia paints everything in a better light.<br />
<br />
Of course, back then the same people were complaining about how &quot;The Vision&quot; was completely stupid since it did *not* care what the players think. People who were lower level then were complaining how they were shafted--and now they are higher level, and they complain about how they had it good before everybody hit 60.<br />
<br />
Where does the hypocrisy end?<br />
<br />
EQ is dymanic and it is ever changing in it's own way, which means it will never attempted to, nor will it ever succede if it tried, to make itself &quot;perfect&quot; to everyone who play. Every time EQ changes (or remain unchanged, for that matter) some would be outraged, and others would be over joyed. The player base is too wide to even attempt to try to make everyone happy.<br />
<br />
The only thing that remains constant about EQ is that the idea of &quot;if you don't like it, play something else&quot; is still there. However, most people are too hooked to see it as a viable option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hmm, I wonder if I have been misunderstood or stated my point too vaguely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any new online game, like DAOC for instance, shows how far the online community has progressed since M59-UO-EQ. You cannot make a game as simple as you used to, because there are thousands of players out there now, who learned the ropes in EQ. They will be much better at online games in the future.<br />
<br />
SWG for instance, it will not start with a few hundred veteran gamers, it will start with tens of thousands. EQ is responsible for this, which is good, and bad in my opinion. Good because it forces developers to make hard, deep content, bad, because people turbo level to high levels so fast, they drive the level up for any who follow.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I started EQ, I was already a veteran gamer of m59 and a little UO, but EQ really tought me patience, tenacity, and how to suck it up and level grind. Every game that comes out after this, is just easier now. DAOC was an absolute piece of cake.<br />
<br />
The online community as a whole, is much larger, smarter, and more talented as a direct, and indirect result of EQ.<br />

<br />
What I was getting at was, I think they designed a role playing game that was supposed to be fun at all levels, but their players over time decided that only the high levels were fun. So they recoded the game to hurry everyone to the fun part.<br />

<br />
Perhaps they were being 'shafted' in some way, but now they complain a lot I think because the first 50 levels are a joke. I agree that VI wasn't listening to anyone but themselves back then, but between not listening and listening to whiners... I'm not sure which is worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
EQ is dymanic and it is ever changing in it's own way, <br />
<br />
<br />
I fail to see much that is truly 'dynamic' in EQ, other than what is caused by mudflation.<br />
<br />
<br />
which means it will never attempted to, nor will it ever succede if it tried, to make itself &quot;perfect&quot; to everyone who play. <br />
<br />
You are right, the game will never be perfect. EQ is a niche game. It's great fun for some people but other people don't have the patience or would think it was dumb. My assertion is that EQ started out seemingly aimed at being an RPG, and not what is essentially becoming similar to a level-based version of Quake.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing that remains constant about EQ is that the idea of &quot;if you don't like it, play something else&quot; is still there. However, most people are too hooked to see it as a viable option.<br />
<br />
I wasn't saying I hated EQ or even that I didn't like it. I was just pointing out that it started out as one thing, and is now a different thing entirely. I happen to like both, though one more than the other.</div></div><hr />

Yes and no.  There are players that are smarter now.  There are players that are more wise in the ways of Norrath but still as stupid as day one.  and there are still true n00bs out there.<br />
<br />
Big difference between today's n00b and a day one n00b of release is the huge disparity of equipment.  There was no such thing as even a 1:2 ratio weapon, or armor with stats available to a noob at release.<br />
Remember the old days?  Armor progression at release: cloth, (tattered came in after release), rawhide, ringmail, banded/bronze, blackened/barbed, rubicite, and so on.  Armor progression today STARTS at better than banded.  Sellers are having trouble giving away blackened because of rygorr being so cheap in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Most noobs today are starting with an AC and HP of a release level 15-20.  Yes - the game has gotten easier.  I don't think the players are all that much more skilled.  They are more familiar with Norrath because every quest and every zone is fully documented in extreme detail at several spoiler sites.  How hard is it to go to a website, research a quest, and follow a recipe?  Kill spawn V at loc 5,4 in zone P that will drop item Z which you give to Joe NPC at loc 4,5 in zone Q.  Go to a map website and you can see where to go to get to those zones.  Voila - new quest done in 20 minutes skipping 10 steps of actual storyline behind why the quest was there.  In many cases you can skip the whole thing by buying the item for 100p in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have to admit, it gets on my nerves that I'm grouping with some guy in PoV who's played the game 6 months and acts like he levels too slow.  Here I am, thinking about the days when I scrounged and saved enough to buy a magic weapon so I could kill wisps... and die killing wisps... and finally make enough lightstone cash that I had a full set of banded at level 14.  I was proud of all that, and I worked my ass off for it.  It is kinda lame that there are people with Rygoirr who spent less time and effort on it than I did on my damned banded.</div></div><hr />
