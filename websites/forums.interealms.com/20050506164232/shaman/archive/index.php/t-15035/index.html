and for anyone who wants to ask, yes i used to play magic the gathering</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not really certain on his magic resistance, as we have always just gone melee and healer heavy. Rangers would definately be worthwhile, but in all honesty I wouldnt worry to much about it. Last time we downed him with only 4 things attacking Rak which were<br />
2 mage pets<br />
and<br />
2 shaman pets<br />
to add to this group we had a cleric, druid, and enchanter<br />
also had a rogue and a pally, but neither engaged because we dont listen when people go afk<br />
Insanely simple fight if your buds are 60+, which i assume they are since we talking manaburning wizards and such. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last time I did Rak was just a 65 war druid and me (65 shm)<br />
<br />
The druid was on his rogue to start with who opened the door , the war pulled Raks reaver outside and I healed while the rog camped to his druid. Finally he camped to his shaman to loot the tear :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wanna say he has 32k like most Kunark boss types.  He resists most everything but lures, but wizards have no probs burning him down.  <br />
<br />
He used to be scary, when I did my turn in at 57 (long time ago) I was dead on the first AE.  Last time we did him with a group and a half (I was 65) and I don't think his AE stuck once.  We tried all that mage goofiness but ended up just sending in all the melee and he was dead in a jiffy.  I have never been lucky enough to get to spawn him by killing the reaver.  He has always been up and usually in a bad spot.<br />
 <br />
By PoP standards he is pretty gimp.  AE hits hard, but not all that often.  2k used to be a deathtouch :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We tried all that mage goofiness  <br />
<br />
For some reason I got a chuckle out of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are some really good threads on this over in the quest section, but I figure I'll throw out what I noticed when I did mine a couple monthes ago.<br />
<br />
First, If he is up in a bad spot as mentioned above, kill him without out doing the turn in and spawn him off reavers if you're worried.  Fighting in the water sucks.  Second, he seemed very high MR, I never landed a spell on him.  However, bring a bard with you and he's cake.  With 150+ FR, you can resist all his AEs (although I did get smacked with an ice comet right after turn in).  If you resist everything, it's just a matter of wearing him down.  Make sure you dispell him, he may have a ds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We've done Rak 2 times in the last months for friends.  Both times it's been extremely easy.<br />
<br />
Keep your healers out of the ae.  Keep the ma on one side, everyone else on the other.  And it's easy.<br />
<br />
We had a 65 sk tank both times.  First time, I think he pretty much healed himself through the fight.  I was on my cleric alt, and I healed the ranger in the group once.  But not that ma.  2nd try I think I healed him once.  Might have been 2 times.<br />
<br />
Both kills with 2 groups or less.  No mage pets involved whatsoever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All you need for rak is...you, cleric, bard, rogue, and maybe a tank(depending on how your gear is since you need a bit of hp to tank)...  He's 100% resistant to magic and you wont be slowing him and pretty sure his other resists are like the reavers and they resist pretty much everything non lure.  If you want a fast fight add in an am3/eq ranger to trueshot him...in 2 minutes max he'll be dead :)<br />
<br />
When i did him he spent most his time casting the fire aoe (mostly resisted it) and casts various wizard spells..so melee output is pretty low.  Just make sure fire/cold/magic resists are buffed to the max and you're golden.</div></div><hr />

hehe when i did rak a couple of days ago, we had me, a 57 shaman, an enchanter, a 65 warrior, cleric and rogue. It was hell lol, at frist, we found that rak was already spawned, so we had to go up the lift to where all the golems had been (we had to clear em) The cleric had a bug and couldnt get up the lift, so  he had to heal from down there. I slowed him VERY easy, and then it was cake from there, his aoe had little effect when we had resists up.</div></div><hr />

Everyone says that this AoE does 2k so why does the spell information say differently? Also everyone says with 150 resist u can resist most of the AoE but its -100 FR so they may be taking in the fact that they are higher lvl i don't know</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno exactly.. maybe because when it lands it does the first 850 dmg then 850 again 6 sec later ?<br />
Anyway now, with a cleric and a good tank he is a total joke.<br />
neg 100 FR is not that hard to resist with good buffs and a mage DS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ya i was kinda thinking that too but still u would think people could tell the difference not sure if i could tell a 300 pt difference /shrug<br />

also like the sig wuddaru i33t lewts hehe</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hamenu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">the old walkthroughs with the &quot;mage goofiness&quot; are no longer needed. <br />
<br />
They don't really work consistently either. SOE messed around with the pet resists, and the fire pet is no longer immune to Rak's AE. The theory is that they keep making stealth adjustments, but no one seems to know for sure, and peope get very inconsistent results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I soloed rak a few weeks back (He was up on the bridge, I'd just popped over to buff some friends twinks and thought why not =), had 370ish FR, I simply buffed both myself and my pet up to the hilt and steamed in with rabid bear, quiessence on both myself and the pet with some TM's thrown in was sufficient till about 50% when I backed out and let the pet finish it off.  <br />
<br />
First go I lost (Got dispelled badly at ~80% and got hit by the AE lots), second time I won somewhat convincingly ending up ~50m.</div></div><hr />
