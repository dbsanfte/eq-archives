<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i hate verant, i hate them for putting the bazaar in. don't they know what it can do to people? i spent my entire bank account in the first day. i just sit there and look through the pages of things i could buy. i can't get enough.... i can't leave....!! i no longer care about leveling, new spells. i just want to BUY !!!<br />
<br />
ok well maybe it's not that bad, but i really did spend all my money, and i am so addicted to it. i was up until 5 am just browsing. i think i need a 12 step program... am i the only one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think you're the only one.  :)<br />
<br />
I know then when I would occasionally send tells to one of the million AFK traders, they would invariably reply within 30 seconds... meaning they weren't all AFK after all.<br />
<br />
How many times last night did I search for &quot;Forest&quot; trying to find Forest Loops listed at under 250 pp?  You don't want to know !!!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im afrade not I to im guilty of spending all my time in the bazaar spent about 25k already, but with all those items selers are compeating and im buy stuff for like 50-90% off to day i got SCHW for 500p and ikky BP for 2k and CC gloves for a super low price of 300p i could not help my self all these thins for so cheep just couldnt stop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Lol, me too bigguss, me too.<br />
<br />
I dont want to even think about how many times i searched for &quot;silver etched warhammer&quot;, lookin to find some under 170pp.<br />
<br />
I did the same w/ the forest loops and everything!  I even bought fine steel for 2pp, only to sell it to vendors for 5, lol!<br />
<br />
its kinda sad when you think about it, but making money is fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wobbs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">See, the EC trader is inside all of us. It just needed to be released.<br />
<br />
Or maybe its just greed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe, I haven't had any problem at all with the new bazaar. Since I have like 3 silver to my name and the black hole better known as the forge takes all my plat I haven't woried about equipment and such in quite a while. :) You just have to have your addictions prioratized.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>HerkeeLees</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I refuse to spend more than 30 seconds in the bazaar as I know I will not be able to stop buy/selling, but it is a wonderful thing. Today I got the last piece for my PoA quest, a sphinx hide that I would have never been able to get anywhere else...for 50pp. I auctioned for one for forever until finally giving up, then I went to bazaar and see 2 immediatly- 1 for 3k and 1 for 50pp. What a beautiful, beautiful thing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've made money so far.  Cleared out bank accounts and cashed in.  <br />
<br />
But I do feel a certain something telling me to log on and get back to the bazaar.  Wondering what deals I am missing . . . thinking I can use a new hat . . .</div></div><hr />
