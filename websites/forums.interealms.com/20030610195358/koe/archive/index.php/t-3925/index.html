<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This past weekend everything came together for the final piece of Falino's and my epic. Saturday we had several people help us come break our way up to Neh'Ashiir and made a camp for about 6 hours. We killed 4 Neh'Ashiirs and finally she dropped the darn torch. Coatlicue found a friend of hers that would be able to multi the cloak for me and I was SO happy. It was going to be completed in a few weeks and I was kind of stunned that it was getting so close. On Sunday I was contacted by a 48 Shaman that had a cloak. A friend had seen me the previous week auctioning in NFp to buy one. Well it turned out he wanted very little for it incomparison with others who wanted my last drop of blood. We quickly came to an agreement on an equipment trade, Falino was online, the person who was multi questing my embers was online, boom bah boom. Adelrune ports up to Sky, we go into the efreeti quest chamber, hand in the stuff, turn in to the Master of Elements and we get our spell! <br />
<br />
Spell: Summon Orb<br />
Level: 46<br />
Mana: 500<br />
Casting Time: 5 seconds<br />
Recast Time: 5 MINUTES (yes, 5 minutes)<br />
Effect: Summons the Orb of Mastery<br />
<br />
It has a 5 min recharge time but soon we were standing there with our Orb of mastery and our BIG PET.<br />
<br />
The Orb has the following stats:<br />
<br />
Item: Orb of Mastery<br />
Type: 1H Blunt<br />
Damage/Delay: 20/30<br />
Stats: +100 MANA, +20 INT, +15 STR, +5 DEX, +10 STA, +20 CR, +20 FR, +10 MR<br />
Special Attributes: MAGIC ITEM NODROP LORE ITEM<br />
Slot(s): Primary Hand Slot<br />
Weight: 1 pound<br />
Effect: Manifest Elements (1 charge)<br />
<br />
The manifest elements is what summons the epic pet. The epic pet is a bigger meaner pet than any other. It hits for 67, dual wields and double attacks, kicks and bashes, casts an elemental spell, and has a damage shield for around 50. Moe saw it kick (like a flying lick) for 170. We still have to play around with it so don't know everything yet, but man is it fun.<br />

I would like to thank everyone that ever helped us complete this quest. You know it is rare to see a Mage epic. How much more rare to have 2 Magicians in a guild with one? A great accomplishment for our guild. I am humbled.</div></div><hr />

Obviously the mage epic is not easy, and I was forced to ask for guild help several times.  From the week in Plane of Sky, to COM run after COM run after COM run, BW camp after BW camp after BW camp, well you get the point :-)<br />
<br />
It has been a huge undertaking under my part, as well as the guilds part, since I collected Torn Page of Magi'kot: page 1, over 6 months ago, I have been working off and on on this, and then working very hard since I got the Sky crown<br />
