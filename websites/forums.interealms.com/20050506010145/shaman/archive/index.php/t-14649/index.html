<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to figure out a problem I keep having. This is in tier 1 PoP groups. I get into a group and sometime after we start killing I will eventually have turgur's resisted. Of course this means that I am now tanking an unslowed mob. <br />
<br />
It seems that the clerics I have been grouped with think that they can wait till I am at 60% health and then start a CH on me. 60% of my health will not stand up to an unslowed PoP mob long enough for a CH to hit. I always die the first time turgur's is resisted. <br />
<br />
Of course if I try to explain that I need a  faster heal against an unslowed mob the cleric throws a tantrum because I am telling him how to play his class (no matter how polite I try to be).<br />
<br />
Is my equipment really that bad? Should I be able to tank unslowed PoP mobs that well?<br />
<br />
my magelo is in my sig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Your equipment's not terrible, it's your cleric that's the problem....and your taunter(s).  I find myself having to tank unslowed mobs from time to time after having bounced a slow, and there's no way that I can survive if the cleric starts to CH me at 60%.  Usually the clerics're smart enough to quick heal me.  Why can't your tanks grab aggro from you?  Any paladin/SK that's worth a damn should be able to get the mob off you (particularly since they're not getting beat on, giving them a free chance to land a stun or something).  Also try keeping getting off a root, so you can back off and try to re-slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gindaorshaman2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">have you tried casting some type of malosini on the mob first, then cast turgurs?<br />
and with a pally in the group, should be able to cast slow right away , they have super aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">there are a few pieces that could use some hp<br />
but, that has nothing to do with this,<br />
u shouldnt be getting aggro<br />
and the cleric should be using a quick heal<br />
i laugh when clrs try to ch me<br />
<br />
make sure u spam maloxxxx on inc till it lands then wait till the mob is 95-90 pct health before slow if tank gets ticked at u for not slowing quick enough tell him to get better aggro :D but if u have an sk or especially a pally u can slow as soon as u can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just do what I do.<br />
<br />
RIght off the bat, I'll malo(X) on incoming, then slow as soon as spell bar refreshes.  If after a few pulls it's obvious that 1). tank can't hold aggro or 2). cleric is incompitent, I'll tell them:<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok fokes I&quot;m gonna start slowing at 75%, so look sharp.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sometimes people get pissy, but if they do, explain to them rationally that you're not here to get killed, the tank is.  If he can't hold aggro, and the cleric can't hit you with some fast heals while you're waiting for slow to land, they need to keep their yap shut.<br />
<br />
If this still doesn't work for you, find another group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok this is OBVIOUSLY a stupid cleric who tries to ch a shaman... the most UBER shaman in my guild has only 6.6k hps.. I have 4.8 raid buffed so 4500 normally.. in a group you'r in, you probably have 2k hps so at 60% you have about 1200 hps.. the cleric is an idiot for trying to ch you.. shaman are NEVER ched.. if most clerics even now try to put a HOT on you.. that's even wrong a shaman needs to be SR or equivelent (fast and direct heal).. the only time you get a HOT is if you are canni ing down. I would never group with the cleric again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your good cleric bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Clerics who cheal shaman are in the wrong.<br />
Tell that cleric he's wrong.<br />
Tell him you need faster heals.<br />
If he doesn't like it, tell him he's a bad healer, and go elsewhere.<br />
Slowers are in hot demand for xp groups.<br />
Go find a good group elsewhere and ignore the bad healers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've had this happen before, but it was kinda my own fault. Was in a PoI group with a pretty good cleric, problem was that I didn't get agro often, and when I did I healed myself with stoicism first and then spammed sup heals if i needed to. Cleric started thinking the shammys on the ball, no need to worry about him, then bam, mob resists, then resists second time and i'm dead. This is with 2 sk's and a pally in the group mind you, cleric just didn't think she had to worry about me. <br />
We ended up trading those 2 sks and the pally for 2 pallies and a rogue, xp went much faster and i didn't die again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the feedback guys. I pretty much knew that trying to CH me was a bad idea but it has happened numerous times with different clerics. I just needed some moral support I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Clerics CAN effectively CH a shaman.  It will work, just not in critical situations like PoP unslowed mobs.  <br />
<br />
And especially with unslowed mobs with the cleric equal to the shaman (level 57) is only going to be able to spam a heal of either Divine light at 4.5 seconds and 900hp or Remedy at 3 seconds and 430hp.  <br />
<br />
Neither of those two heals will stand up to an unslowed mob in PoP.  Try to Malxx the mobs perhaps to help save yourself.<br />
<br />
At 57 you are pushing yourself to the limits in the planes.  Not totaly on the edge but in a full group of 57's you will be risking it.  Sometimes you die.  Sometimes you live.  Thats what happens when you test your limits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I beg to differ. At 56/57 with similar gear, I was grouping in PoP tier 1 just fine. I died occasionally, but it wasn't very often.<br />
<br />
A 57 cleric can heal just fine against an unslowed tier 1 mob too, if they're on the ball. When I died was usually when they were half way through a Cheal on the tank and didn't break it to spam heal me.<br />
<br />
I suspect some of the clerics he's referring to were a bit lower though. I've found that clerics tend to group above themselves, because there are so few clerics around, and they're highly desired for groups. People will usually take a lower cleric rather than no cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it is so much more important to have a dead tank rather then a dead shaman! <br />
<br />
Or is it<br />
<br />
Because it is so much more important to spam everyone heals and have 7min down time while the cleric meds up from oom.  Especially with the great heals like Divine Light!  <br />
<br />
<br />
/clerical angst off<br />
<br />
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt.  Clerics have to make the same choices other classes do.  What mob gets slowed first? What groupmate gets healed first?  The only difference is that clerics deal with the life and possible death of the rest of the group.  <br />
<br />
If a bounced slow makes you splatter then smack a Malx on the mob first.  If a cleric tries to CH you then ask politely for fast heals next time but be aware that they may not have any large enough quick heals to save you.  Also be aware that clerics may steal your agro to themselves with those fast spammy heals so they get to die.<br />
<br />
Just because you die doesnt mean the cleric is always at fault, horrible, a noob or whatever.  Take responsibility for your actions as well.  Have a quick heal ready for yourself, malx the mobs that you have trouble on, make sure you have all the hp buffs you need.  Talk to your group and try to make sure that everyone knows what to do in case of an emergency.  <br />
<br />
To answer Gurgul's original question of: <br />
Should I be able to tank unslowed PoP mobs that well? <br />
NO, no one can tank unslowed PoP mobs well at 57 unless they have very substantial hp.</div></div><hr />

Oh hey, I wasn't criticising that cleric. Stuff happens. I completely agree with you - sometimes you have to choose, and sometimes in the heat of the moment, you make the wrong choice. My point was that a 57 cleric copes fine in tier 1, for the most part. Things can go wrong wherever you are, whoever you're with.<br />
<br />
One thing to note though: When I was 58 and tanking an unslowed PoP mob, I often couldn't get even a quick heal off on myself, and even chain casting quick heals didn't usually help anyway. So yes, I did rely on that cleric to keep me alive. It's slightly different now I'm 62 with torpor and a better quick heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hail,<br />
<br />
Well, there are a few things you can do.<br />
Make a Turgur's resist hotkey.  Explain to the cleric that if you hit your resist hotkey (I just type /g resist myself) or type something approximating the word &quot;resists&quot;, to drop a fast heal on you, no questions asked.  If the cleric doesn't seem to listen, you can just start casting a Stoicisim on yourself before slowing.  Another thing you can try is rooting the mob before slowing, but melee heavy groups (esp. w/ AM3 rangers) won't like that much.  If you have a druid in your group, you could mabye sent him/her a tell and ask for backup healing anytime you say resists.<br />
<br />
I personally HATE being healed by others except when I'm on rampage (from slowing or debuffing too quickly) or when slow resists.  Any other times I expect to be able to take care of myself just fine.<br />
<br />
NO, you shouldn't expect to be able to tank unslowed mobs in Tier1 for very long at all.  I max out at in the low 5700's with raid buffs, and usually exp at about 5k-5400hp.  I don't expect to tank Tier3 mobs unslowed w/o help at 65, and you shouldn't expect to tank unslowed mobs in Tier1 at 57.  If the cleric doesn't understand this, find another cleric, or grab a 58 druid instead.<br />
<br />
Best of luck,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm 56.  I've been doing PoN lately.  The last time was with a paly as MT, with the paly pulling.  I've also done it with a pair of warriors on the docks.  I don't hit with Malo, just with slow.  Depending on the agro situation I sometimes will cast the epic just as the mob comes in range for the sole purpose of letting the MT build agro, although this is not my normal pratice.  I usually don't end up getting summoned until I hit the mob with Slow the 3rd time, but most of the time I have it stick the first try.<br />
<br />
I am really not trying to be flipant, or trying to imply that I've got better gear, timing, etc.  I really want to know if, based on other people's experience, I'm lucky I've only died once, and that in the maze.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If a bounced slow makes you splatter then smack a Malx on the mob first.<br />

Words of wisdom right there!   You're the only one that you can rely on 100%.  When sheet hits the fan in PoP, things go south fast.  Having a backup plan of blast heals (which doesn't work at 57) or spamming &quot;root&quot; (accept no substitutes, root is the only way to go till 64) on resist is key.  Preventative measures ala malx or stoicism pre slow are also good for testing the waters of new zones or groups.<br />
<br />
Stand right next to or on top of the tank, especially with warriors.  This will help him take agro as easily as possible <br />
<br />
Also if Malx is resisted, just try a slow.   The elapsed time should give the tank time to get agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you dont know the cleric then make the MT wait the 1-3 sec it takes you to get your magic debuff off.  If you get resist cast your slow anyways and alterate from there on out till slow lands.  Seems to work best for me.  <br />
<br />
Now for those Clerics that insist on casting a CH on you while that unslowed mob is beating you silly just remember if you die there are going to be peeps following you to the grave to keep you company.  &lt;evil Grin&gt;  I have yet had a group not wipe in PoP zone after I have gone down with an unslowed mob running about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Only other advice I could give is that the Root line of spells is your friend. I can't think of a time where a cleric used CH on me unless it was after the fight. Sounds like you get clerics with little to no experience with how to heal Shaman, or are just hard headed.<br />
<br />
When I get into a group with people I don't know I always have Root included in my memmed spells until I feel comfortable with the group.<br />
<br />
With a group of people I don't know I initially mem Malo(s), Malosi(ni, ia), Turgurs, Root, CanniIV, Rain spell, Fast Heal, Torpor/Quiessence. I personally believe 2 fast heals are better than using one slow heal (Kragg's is decent but I detest the cast time).<br />
<br />
If the group is on the ball I will switch out Root for another Rain spell or a Cold DD.</div></div><hr />
