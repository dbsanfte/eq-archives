<br />
I am a 16th level Shaman who in a previous life was all melee.  I am just now starting to group and was wondering for instance in PC what my role and mode of operation should be?  I realize it's all dependant on the group structure but any help would be great.  Also, I am finding the current tier of spells are so mana hungry that I am resorting to using the lower level spells to be more functional.  Is this always the case?  Will I ever have the mana to be able to use the current set of spells?<br />

There ya be, everything you need to know from all the old shaman on how to be a good shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Playing a shaman can be painful for the first 23 levels.  Things change greatly once you hit 24 and get regen and canni.  That's when you actually become a shaman.<br />
<br />
Most groups in PC will want you for a healer so your job is to sit, stand, heal, then sit some more.  Pretty boring stuff and really doesn't do squat for your skills.<br />
<br />
Learn to solo some now and use that time to keep your melee skills up, especially defense.  Most of my characters solo for the first 25 or so levels to get their skills up and I avoid PC like the plague.  You will level so fast in PC that it's nearly impossible to keep your skills anywhere near where they should be.</div></div><hr />

In general, below 50 all new spells were mana hogs when you just got them. This was basically how EQ was orignally designed.  The new spells resists more than their lower conterparts and  use more mana. Although the spells are more effective, usually you have to be more fugal at using them initially.<br />
<br />
In general the lower level spells stick easier on mobs and if you have a specific role like debuffing a mob you may end up using lower lvl version spell to stick the spell on the mob then use the higher level one for more effectiveness (As you grow up in level this becomes less an issue).<br />
<br />
Above 50, the model changed quite a bit with kunark. And most of the spells are usuable at the lvl you get them. Once you get torpor at 60 and canni 5, a lot of your mana concerns are greatly reduced.</div></div><hr />
