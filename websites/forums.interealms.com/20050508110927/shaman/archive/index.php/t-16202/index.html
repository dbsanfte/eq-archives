<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a level 50 Shaman and I find his soloability (not to mention group value) to be everything that people usually rave about and then some. Wearing mostly level-appropriate equipment (AC 877, HP 1559 unbuffed), my alpha pet and I can easily solo anything non-named in EW/GD and the spiders in Velks. And that's just straight tanking+Stoicism, no DOTs - wouldn't be fair to the mobs :)<br />
<br />
I am wondering what else I could try to solo tank at my level since the usual suspects in Velious are getting to be trivial. Not necessarily as a viable source of XP, just for fun :) I could also wait until 51 when I'll be able to wear the Tae Ew armor that is currently sitting in the bank - should put me over 1K AC self-buffed, if it makes a big difference...</div></div><hr />
