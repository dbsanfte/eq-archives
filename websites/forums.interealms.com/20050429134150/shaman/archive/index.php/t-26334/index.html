<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Basically I mainly want to know if a warrior's dps is noticeably better than a Paladins or if it's only a marginal difference.<br />
<br />
For the sake of argument, lets assume both are decently armored and using 2h swords.<br />
<br />
This is not about duelling or even PvP, it's about killing mobs.  I tried Paladin and found it frustrating and slooow to kill things, and am wondering if I try warrior will it be more of the same or will it be quicker?<br />
<br />
I understand warriors have some issues with needing potions and other stuff, it's not all rosy, but wondering about dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Warrior dps is higher, yes, they have alot of special attacks, usually rage dependant though. They can really be mean to rogues if they are smart with the use of overpower, etc.<br />
<br />
However, in pvp, and pve, paladin still will come out on top if properly played, too many lives and tricks. Lower dps, but massive survivability.<br />
<br />
Warrior will kill quicker, absolutely, but, you will also die more with the warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the response. The sense I get as a paladin is that it's like being a designated driver while everone else is drunk on dps power. I have to keep group members alive while they play the hero and unleash torrents of damage at the enemy. It's not too fun, for me anyway.<br />
<br />
Maybe warrior will be an ounce better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You will be a much better &quot;tank&quot; as a warrior, for groups, and pve sounds like your thing. Something to think about. You just won't be able to solo such big mobs, even if it takes a long time.<br />
<br />
The warriors I fight, are a hell of alot more scary because they can really mess you up if you don't kill em fast, paladins are a pain because they have so much time to kill you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A lot of it depends on how you spec. An armsman warrior is pretty solid for grinding levels and they seem to do pretty solid dps. A shield spec'd protection warrior is going to feel a lot like a paladin. Low DPS, long fights.  My friend started playing a few months after me as a warrior. His original viewpoint was that the class sucked, but has he's leveled he's started enjoying it quite a bit. With warriors talent selection seems to be very important, and unlike most classes they seem to benefit more from chaining kills. His main concern is aggro - which we're working on figuring out how to best maximize it.<br />
<br />
*edit -goddamn mac keyboads*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Like Cappi said; a lot of it depends on how you spec. A warrior is definately higher DPS than a paladin, and quite noticeably so, unless you go a pure protection spec, in which case you'll feel like a paladin, only without the heals and shields.<br />
<br />
The more I play warriors, the more I start to think they're talent trees are perhaps more diverse than most of the other classes I've played. If you primarily spec in one tree only, then your play style becomes quite different indeed. For instance, arms spec tend to do a lot more stance switching (thanks to tactical mastery) whereas someone like myself who went deep into fury and didn't get tactical mastery tends to try to pick the best stance and will only grudgingly switch if the situation aboslutely demands it. <br />
<br />
Weapon choices also become dependant upon trees, as an Arms/MS spec will go for big, heavy hitting 2hers most times, as opposed to a fury warrior that will generally dual wield. Most protection based seem to go 2H weapons, but I haven't played that much as with that talent tree, or met a lot of protection warriors.  'End-game' warriors (I use that term to describe lvl 60 instance runners) go protection spec for best instance tanking, and since there's nothing like AA's to keep you xping once you hit 60, I suppose there's no reason to keep a fun soloing spec going.<br />
<br />
Warriors can solo even con mobs (or even 1 or two levels higher) fairly easily, and if you can get them single, you can pretty much just keep on going with minimal downtime. Pick your equipment wisely, and don't skimp on upgrading weapons regularly. Also highly recommend being very choosy on your armour; get stamina on every piece, and I personally favour a balanced agi/str after stamina.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Soloing even cons and higher changes at level 60.  Level 60's in EP are not easy and I do not go from fight to fight.<br />
<br />
At level 60 you can grind on -4's or so and not rest much... mobs above 56 or so and you need to stop and eat.  And elites?  Forget about it if you are not fighting one that is about -8 from you.<br />
<br />
I'd argue that pallies can kill -4's not much slower than a warrior.  And yet even cons are what everyone thinks they should be able to kill and pallies talk about even con elite mobs.  So there ya go....<br />
<br />
In terms of builds and dps and such... I'm arms primarily with Mortal Strike.  It's not as great as it used to be, weapon damage + XX amount (can't remember).  With my hammer from the Princess in Maraudon and I mostly hit for high 200's/low 300's with MS, with occasional crits (seemingly rare) of 700-800ish.<br />
<br />
Using a shield +Thrash Blade, I can still pretty MS for 200's as an extra instant attack, which is still good.  You can fight with a shield and a 1h weapon even as Arms, imagine that.  No real need for macro-switching either.  Also, I often find that when grinding, the shield + 1h is a better choice with less downtime.  The beat down I take without the shield and subsequent eating required goes way up with a 2h and the kill time is not that much less.<br />
<br />
So anyway, in summary, I'm not convinced that a pally grinding xp on mobs -4 or lower (like a warrior pretty much HAS to do) is that much slower.  The fact that they can consider mobs of higher level and elites should tell you a lot.  As a warrior, you won't be grinding through even cons very fast, I assure you, don't be mislead.</div></div><hr />
