<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hope everyone is recovering well from the festivities of last night.  I also hope that you were all able to spend the holiday with loved ones close at hand.<br />

I enjoyed the evening with my in-laws and had wonderful food and drink throughout the whole day.  Thankfully I didn't enjoy too much of either, so I don't feel like death warmed over this morning. :)<br />

Bad thing about having thanksgiving at someone elses house though is the serious LACK of leftovers.  :(  Might have to setup a raiding party for MY parents leftover turkey.   MUST HAVE TURKEY SANDWICHES!!!</div></div><hr />
