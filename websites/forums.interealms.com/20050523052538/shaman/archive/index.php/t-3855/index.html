I got a Rune Etched Icewurm Fang for 3000 pp.<br />
<br />
Had to re-check the number of zeros as I wasn't wearing my glasses.<br />
<br />
12/19 Piercer? With a Proc? And + 5 WIS?<br />
<br />
I'm no rocket Shaman, but even I can figure out to haste self, slow MOB, apply dog, apply Epic dot, switch weapon, and commence to beatdown.<br />
<br />
You?</div></div><hr />

OTOH, fungi's go for 50-100k (I thought 100k was a bit silly) People really need to learn to standardize pricing a little... competition is good, when it actually exists.</div></div><hr />

So far, the bazaar hasn't been good to me at all.  If you want Cannibalize III or a slime coated harpoon, Luclin's Bazaar is where you need to go.<br />
<br />
Bleh.   For all of you that get great deals, are you logged in as a trader (ie in the bazaar for a long time) or are you just passing through?  I've only popped in for a hour or less at a time (several times), I haven't spent a lot of time there, but I know what to look for...and it's not there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Heeoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Prices are all down.  Too many of the same items for sale at once.  Supply and demand rules.  People are selling sow potions for 98 plat just to compete.  I bought a spine chill spear for 150 plat (lucky me) and talisman of the rhino for 50 plat.  Only 36 and my money is limited, so I had to pass up a lot of the bargains. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the bazaar is so crowded that hunting for items has become a bit of a hassle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only two more pieces of Scaled Mystic to get rid of, and hopefully I'll be getting my Kromriff Military legs and Coldain Military Wristguard this week.<br />

Who knows gimme a week I may have full JB armor for 500pp hehe. I wish lol.</div></div><hr />

 I have been doing the silver etched hammer and made about 280pp (found 4 so far) Not uber plat but if you are sitting in the bazaar anyway, might as well make some money.<br />
<br />
I also found a helm of rile for 50pp which sells to vendor to 74pp.<br />
<br />
Anyone have other good vendor selling stuff? Didn't the tunic from the FM giants sell well and the weapons too? can't remember how much they sold for so I have been leery to buy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Not sure if I got great deals or not but, I upgraded my gear pretty good and only spent 900pp. <br />
I picked up:<br />
Full Rygorr minus boots<br />
Arctic Wyvern Mask (couldn't find any Crystal Spider Eyes)<br />
Tattered Mantle<br />
Ivory Imbued Collar<br />
Spider Fur Belt<br />
Sentry Boots<br />
Spine Chill Spear<br />
Centi Warhammer (don't ask why, my 1 hand blunt is awful 126 I think, but it was cheap so I said what the hell) <br />
Made out pretty good for a casual, unguilded Iksar. <br />
<br />
I had 986 HP's and 814 AC with my old gear<br />
I now have 1047 HP's unbuffed and 851AC unbuffed and I got rid of that hideous leather looking Ulthork crap and my slow poking Jade Prod.<br />
I was hoping I would find a REIF or IKKY BP for real cheap but it looks like that is going on average of 4K on INNY. No typos damnit ! <br />
So I guess its back to farming more HG's to get a REIF and IKKY BP.<br />
The Bazaar is awesome and makes buying/selling so much easier than sitting in EC /auc'ing all day, I'd rather buy what I want and go lay the smackdown on some mobs than sit and haggle in EC. Call me crazy !</div></div><hr />

I can't really use it till 35, because my blight hammer is so overpowered at 30.  I'm killing level 26 exp mobs that have 700-800 hp and the proc is a 500 hp dot....  They run at 15% life or so...  Its insane :)<br />

When I get to 35, I plan to pick up my spear&amp;shield, buy a haste item and wander around auctioning for a pair of goblin toe boots!  (ok, D2 joke... never mind).<br />

That must really suck, getting it for so cheap. Unlike me who's not lucky enough to catch a typo or a bonehead selling it for that cheap. Silly me having to save up 4K for it !<br />

<br />
Anyway, ive made a decent amount of PP from doin the silver warhammer bit, other such items, and selling old crap.  The bazaar has been good to me that way...since im in Ten MTN's right now, the only drops are random cheapgem's and some traderskiller stuff.  Atleast i be able to stick the tradeskill stuff on the mule later ;\<br />

Well...to the point, best deal ive ever seen<br />

BURST OF FIRE FOR ONLY 1GP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

im not joking neither :P<br />
<br />
havent seen malo/torpor :( seen JBB's for like 18k, where they used to go for 12k...<br />

I was just surprised to see it being sold at all.<br />
<br />
/shrug  Damn bazaar is pretty addictive tho.  I find myself constantly refreshing the lists looking for deals.  I think I have spent 95% of my time there lately.  What a waste..... :(</div></div><hr />

My bank account is actually a little higher than when I started, but it has taken a lot of deals to get there.  :)<br />

One downside, I find myself justifying buying more and more expensive food.  Found some mind worm steaks (+5 sta, +30 mana, feast) for 6 gp... now I'm hooked and I can't find them for 6 gp anymore!  Bleh !!!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Best I've seen was BoN for 1k. Told some people but I don't think they bought it. A lot of the rare items have jumped massively. On Inny a Fungi usually runs 35-50k. Bazaar? 60k. Lots of cheap cheap CT goods though because people don't know what they're worth. :)<br />
<br />
There is a LOT of money to be made in the Bazaar. A LOT. If you're willing to keep an eye out and buy/sell for the right price the pp falls in your lap.<br />
<br />
Forest Loops were a cash cow for a while. Made 85-100pp on almost every one.<br />
<br />
There's quite a bit if &quot;price fixing&quot; to be done if you're clever too.<br />
<br />
Nice for those of us who are pp impaired.</div></div><hr />

I saw another 60 shaman on Terris Thule selling Malosini.  For hundreds, if not thousands of plat - I don't recall what the price was exactly, only that I was disgusted.  It was sad.<br />
<br />
I sent him a tell, but he was AFK. <br />
<br />
That's funny, someone kept sending me nasty tells last night...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">One other neat thing about the bazaar- I'm learning about items I never would have known about.  I never knew there was a right-click Burst of Flame ring (LOL), and there are a lot of nice weapons out there I hadn't heard about (shaman one handers with 1/2 ratios and stats for not that much money... nice!)<br />
<br />
One bad thing about the bazaar- I get to hear my wife laugh at how primitive the implementation is compared to her beloved UO (permanent player-made NPC vendors, as many as you want, on any real-estate in the world, and you don't have to stay logged on.)  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>WulfTyger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">we've been talking about this a lot in the serverwide.crucible channel.<br />
<br />
I think the record for Malosini is currently 19000pp.<br />
<br />
Best deal I heard of over chat was the guy who bought the Fungi staff for a reasonable price.... only to find out it was PRE-NERF. Grats to whoever that was, nice find.<br />
<br />
On my server, the biggest deals (or DOH!'s if you were the seller) are the Lodizal shield for 350pp and one of those really nifty +hp mosquito earrings from Cazic for 150pp.<br />
<br />
Pity I haven't seen any big deals like that =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>korinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">The funniest one I saw last night was someone selling a Golden Idol of Tunare for 20,000.

<br />
you can get the entire earing quest for 20,000 let alone one piece. and I think someone was trying to sell malo for 8000. <br />

Bazaar is fun but on Povar we have alot of people that sell all day and never level. So the market is tight and fierce.</div></div><hr />

Missed out on Plague of Insects. Stupid me thought of  LURE  of Insects. PoI was going for 50 pp too.<br />

I know there are others who watch the Bazaar as I do. Logged real fast to check on PoI and when I came back it was gone. Sort of wish that a Scroll would list the level even if you can't use it.</div></div><hr />

There's been others I just can't remember them right now.  Usually I set my computer up in trader and just leave it while I do housework or what TV etc.  I just pop on about once an hour and check for a deal then go back to doing whatever I was doing before.

Several other spells I got for cheap also, haven't paid more than 1k yet for a spell.

Plenty of good deals to be had if you take the time to sift thru all the junk.
