<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">heh well, I certainly won't be getting the expantion this week, or maybe not till 2 weeks have passed.  I live 90 minutes from the nearest big chain store that MAY have it, and 4 hours away from Minneapolis which I'm sure I could find it somewhere.  Looks like I'm just going to have to be all by myself in that old and tired continent of Vellious!</div></div><hr />
