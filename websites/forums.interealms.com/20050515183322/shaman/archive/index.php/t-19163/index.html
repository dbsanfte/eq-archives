<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I had a PM that the front page was getting overly cluttered with suggestion thread. The poster suggested that I prune some of the posts. I didn't agree 100%, I know that we're all excited about the idea of the new expansion and I want the Crucible to be a place where people like to run to in order to share new ideas.<br />
<br />
Since the request was made, I merged some threads and locked some threads. If you feel I was being overly heavy-handed, it's really easy to unlock the threads, just let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sumitso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">perhaps an expansion dicussion board might be useful, seeing how the changes good or bad are kind of specific and would keep the general board for it's primary use, that being for general topics, thus everything concerning the up and coming expansion or previous ones can be relegated to one location.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree about the &quot;suggestion thread clutter&quot;. If I wanted to read a million people's on the same issue I'd look at the nice long threads already here.<br />
<br />
A separate forum is a nice idea. It could be on expansion issues, or class balance like graffe's. People either have the choice of joining the main (probably stickied) thread on the topic, or if they must start a new one their thread gets banished over to the less-read other forum. Then you don't need to be heavy-handed with locking stuff, but we don't need to look at 27469587624 threads with every last player's thought on the same issue.<br />
<br />
But just locking the threads is fair, you already asked people to stay with the main one(s).</div></div><hr />
