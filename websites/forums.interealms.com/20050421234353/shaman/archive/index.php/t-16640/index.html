<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At the request of another thread I am posting a small guide on pulling as a shaman.<br />
<br />
  Please feel free to add in any tips or tricks you know, doubtful that I can recall them all, and quite likely that I may not know 1 or 2 ;)<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Q:  How can I tell where the mobs are in the next room?<br />
<br />
A:<br />
  Ideally, get some Holgresh Elder beads.  Barring that (cause they dont' drop anymore and are REAL hard to get), try and at least get some stalking probes.  In LDoN especially looking around corners is vital for knowing what you are pulling.<br />
<br />
  If you do not have access to Eye of Zomm items, then set up some F9 key views for looking.  By shifting the view out a long ways and rotating you can see around some corners.  But this does take time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q:  I know where the mobs are now, what good did that do me?<br />
<br />
A:<br />
   You have to pay close attention to pathing, many times you will see <br />
what seems to be an easy single on the side of a room, but rather than run straight at you, it will normally path out to the middle of the room, then take a straight line to the door.   In general, pulling mobs on the side of a room isn't safe until those in the center are moved.<br />
<br />
  Aggro ranges vary pretty heavily from zone to zone, and the mobs will assist from larger ranges than they will passively aggro from in general (ie, if you don't think you could stand where the mob you want to pull is without aggro from those near it.. then they will jump in on the pull).<br />
<br />
Q:  Ok, so I know that I will just get the one mob.  What should I pull with?<br />
<br />
A:<br />
  Well, if you KNOW that resists are pretty high in the zone on slow, pull it with malo(s) and back up to where the group is.  Send your pet in just before it gets to the group and it will easily outaggro you.  Now you have time to slow it, then you can heal the pet afterward.<br />
<br />
  If you generally land slows in the zone on your first attempt, just pull with a slow and head back to where the group is.  If they are still fighting a mob, try to root the pull by the tank so that it won't aggro onto the healer.<br />
<br />
Q:  Oh dear... I won't be getting a single... not a chance.<br />
<br />
A:<br />
  No real problem here.   Unless your group is doing some insane DPS you should pull by rooting one of the mobs.<br />
<br />
  Try for one on the side with very few near it.  If you are lucky, those near will aggro, but those they path through WON'T aggro (since you didn't directly affect the mobs passing them).  If you do get lucky like this, make CERTAIN that root doesn't break till you have all the mobs in camp under control, otherwise you'll get the rest of the room in your lap :\<br />
<br />
  If you rooted from what would have been a double pull, then slow the one that comes to camp, and when able to get the other back into Line of Sight, slow it as well.   Do not refresh the root though, it is best if it breaks and you can bring it into camp for killing.<br />
<br />
Q:  Well, I was unlucky and got 3+ mobs... Are we lost?<br />
<br />
A:<br />
  Not at all.  This is why you have your pet up :)   You hopefully have Focus on him for a small margin of error on the hp scale.  Root the mob you plan to root for pulling, then when you see more than 2 heading your way, retarget quickly (F8, or U key) and send that pet in :)<br />
<br />
  The pet will take the aggro of the entire pull onto itself, and you can slow the mobs to pull them off.   If your group is not capable of tanking or mezzing as many as you pulled, use this free time to start rooting a couple.   Make sure the group knows you will be rooting them there as CC so that they don't run to the pet and start tanking.<br />
<br />
  Once you get all of the pulls slowed, heal your pet if it survived, and go slow the one you rooted.   Remember to refresh the root too.<br />
<br />
  If the pet died, just summon up a new one during the fight and remember to give it focus in hopes that it lives next time :)<br />
<br />
Q:  Ok, so the group is fighting and I am freaking bored.. Shammies just aren't good at DPS, and our healer is doin fine on mana :(<br />
<br />
A:<br />
  Perfect scenario for a pulling shaman.  Position yourself behind the mob so that you are able to hit it and turn on auto-attack (may as well do SOME dps while you are busy.   Now cast your eye of zomm and use it to check the positioning of the next pulls.<br />
<br />
  When the last mob in camp is down to about 30 percent, do your next pull (this will not only get it into camp about when the other mob starts to run on snare, but will also keep the melee so busy they don't try to pull in addition to what you are doing).<br />
<br />
  The ideal situation is that mobs run and your group is snaring, so the DPS melee will stay on the OLD target while the MA comes over to the new pull and builds up the taunt he needs.   This will make for a seemless transition from mob to mob and thrill the group with rapid exp and a VERY fun exp session (no dowtime = no time to realize you are bored).<br />
<br />
<br />
Q:  Ok, I have this pulling thing going well now.  We are into the swing of things and the group likes that I am chain pulling.  My only problem is that I have TONS of spare mana!<br />
<br />
A:<br />
  A couple ways that this can go.   First off you can start pulling in a couple more at a time if your group has 2 tanks and a wizzie/mage.  The caster will do much better damage with his mana if he can use rain spells which are hitting 2 targets (or so they tell me).   By increasing the number in camp there will be a larger call for healing and you may have to back up the main healer with some patches.<br />
<br />
   Another way would be to load up a poison nuke and start helping to get the mob down that last bit before you pull (if it is at 50 and you plan to pull at 30, plenty of time for a nuke).   You can also use this nuke to break the roots that you are using while you pull.<br />
<br />
   And a final option (plenty more, but I will only go into these 3 common ones) is to load up a nice DoT (poison or magic resist) and start rotting the mobs that you root on pull (of course, this isn't very practical if they summon :P)  If you are really skillful at this, you can keep a mob rooted on the side which is ONLY for you to use DoTs on, then at random intervals your group gets exp messages without any idea you just solo'd a kill :P<br />
<br />
Q:  Are there any other pointers worth listing?<br />
<br />
A:<br />
  Tons.   Hopefully a few are listed in the replies below.   A couple that I remembered on my own are as follows.<br />
<br />
Quiessence  Cast it, love it, live it.   If you are pulling more than 2 make sure you put this up in advance.<br />
<br />
Virulent Paralysis  Another lovable.  If the mobs are close enough that they will assist each others, the VP knockback and help single them.   Face toward where you want to pull and VP the nearest mob.  It flies in the direction you are facing and WILL AGGRO OTHERS BASED ON WHERE IT LANDS, not based on where it was when VP hit it.   So it can split the unsplittable if you work it just right.<br />
<br />
Suspend Minion  Remember that dogdog is only there to die so you have time to slow.   Burn extra mana to store one of him for emergencies.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  forgot about VP, thought I covered it earlier :P  (wrote half of post, did Bert raid, wrote last of it... things got forgotten).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Uh.  I'll just copy what I posted in the other thread.<br />
<br />
Lots of us learned how to pull and handle CC work ages ago before Kunark was even out, and further honed skills in the dungeons of Kunark.<br />
<br />
Here's some tips:<br />
-Mem tirgir's insects and use it on pulls of 3+ mobs<br />
-Turgur has huge aggro. Make use of this knowledge. If you slow a mob, it'll do a b-line to get to you. Back off out of melee range of the group, and root the mob there. Repeat for each mob that's unslowed.<br />
-Pay attention to the names and graphical appearance of the mobs you are slowing. If you see 2 mobs of the same appearance and 1 of another, slow the 2 mobs first. That way when you change targets you won't have to think hard about which of the 2 twins you've just slowed<br />
-Pay attention to the health level of mobs and how fast they are swinging (ie how fast their flashing name bobs up and down when they attack) when you are figuring out which mobs have been slowed and which haven't. There's no need to slow mobs that are already slowed. It should take you about 5 seconds to figure out if a mob is slowed or not. Compare it's attack rate to other mobs standing around to see who's name tags are bobbing faster.<br />
-Turgur has a huge refresh time. Keep this in mind for the spells you are casting. If you bounce a turgur, only cast malos/malosinia afterwards while waiting for turgur to refresh. Cast other spells while you are waiting for the refresh time to expire. It might make your next slow land about 2-4 seconds later than it would have, but you end up casting a lot more spells this way, which IMO helps more than just standing around waiting doing nothing.<br />
-get Virulent Paralysis. It's very useful for CC work. You can push mobs out of melee range and root them at the same time.<br />
-leave lots of room between the place you are pulling from and the camp. Use this space to root a mob as the pull, and you still have time to slow one of the mobs incoming to camp.<br />
-scout out your pulls as best you can given the time you have. Some times you have more time to do this (like with Vision spell or stalking probes). Some times you can use f9 to move the camera around a bit to peek around a corner to see what kind of adds you'll get. Some times you can quickly step out from a corner and move back really quickly (like 0.5 seconds quickly) and mobs won't aggro you if you hide behind cover fast enough.<br />
-know how much aggro you have on mobs and how they'll react as you cast spells on them or on their buds. Heals pull aggro on everything if you heal enough. Low health pulls aggro. Turgur pulls aggro. Aggroing mobs next to other mobs pulls aggro. But each of these pulls aggro different. Keep in mind how much a mob is going to hate you BEFORE you even cast a spell. If you do this, you'll already know what your next action/spell is going to be because you know what the mob is going to do before it does it. Like, I know if I cast slow on the add without it being taunted, it'll run straight to me. Knowing this, I'm going to be pulling it off to the side and rootparking it off to the side. Knowing that mob is parked off to whatever side I just planted it, I don't want to park any other adds nearby so that when the main mob is dead, my group members won't be in melee range of the parked mobs when they go for next target, so I'll park the next add on the opposite side of the room. I've got this all planned out before Turgur is even done casting on the first mob. Think ahead...<br />
<br />
How to use this in practice? Here's an example: Suppose you have a 4 pull you know you are going to pull. Target one mob, then target another. Tell the group 4 mobs inc. Root one mob as your pull. Hit your alternate target key to target the other one as you are running back to camp. Slow the 2nd mob before it hits camp. If you run through your party, the slowed mob will continue running through them, but since you only have social aggro on the other 2, they will stop and hit the party and leave you along to deal with the lone slowed mob. Root the slowed mob out of melee range of anyone. Try to target the mob that's not the main target and VP his butt out of combat with knockback. Now it's rooted and out of melee range. Slow the main mob in camp. Slow the mob you VPed. Now run back and slow the mob that was rooted on the pull, assuming root hasn't dropped already. Dot with your single best dot the mob that's rooted since you have plenty of time for your dot to go full duration. Run back to the combat (assuming root didn't break yet). Target another mob that's not being meleed yet and dot him too. Now's your chance to start wincing back mana. As root spells start breaking, if you dotted and slowed the mob, it'll go straight for you, so you can root it where you want. If not, it's hard to tell if it'll go for you, or a healer, or a melee if one happened to try taunting it a bit. Also keep in mind that you ARE a healing class, so instead of dotting, you might need to help throw some Qs and heals around. Also keep in mind that melees can CC adds helping ease your CC worries, especially if you have something like 5+ mobs in camp. Stick a melee on each mob, root what you can out of melee range, and throw Qs around until you get the number of mobs in camp down to an easily managable level.<br />
<br />
Another tactic you can use to pull massive pulls is to pull with mass pets. The mobs will mostly or all aggro onto the doggies. You have pretty much a full minute of them CCing the mobs for you. Target individual mobs and slow them and thus peeling them off due to slow aggro and let the tanks CC them or you can root them in place somewhere. Pulling a 5 pull shouldn't be that rough doing this.<br />
<br />
This is basicly the same tactics I used back in Lower Guk at level 40-50, and used in Karnor's castle at levels 52-56, and used in Seb at level 57-60, and used in every other dungeon/outdoor zone since then.</div></div><hr />

Pull with a poison dot, and slow afterwards is an option.  You'll have massive aggro, but do much better damage than nuking.<br />
<br />
Another option is to mem a nuke and nuke when you can.  Ya, our nukes suck compared to other classes, but if you have too much mana, you gotta spend it on something.<br />
<br />
Another option is to do heals, and let the main healer do nukes.  Clerics have a 4:1 dmg:mana ratio undead nuke with a -100 resist mod.  Druids have a 3.97:1 dmg:mana ratio cold nuke and 3.94:1 ratio fire nuke.  Shaman can play main healer and slower with druid/cleric doing backup heals.  It's not conventional, but it's probably more efficient in terms of damage dealing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">UGH!   I can't believe I forgot to post in spiritcall pulling :(  My favorite trick for a large pull (or solo'ing a fast hitter).<br />
<br />
  Oh well, that's the problem with taking a 3 hour break mid write-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use Assiduous Vision when scouting in new areas.<br />
<br />
Assiduous Vision and F9 will let you know exactly what mobs are in the area, and can be chained to scout a long way ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've used AV a few times, but it does soak up a bit of time waiting for a refresh so that you can chain it onto the next mob. Handy for rooms with narrow entrances that you just can't see enough of with an F9 but overall: stalking probe &gt; both.<br />
<br />
Nice point on the VP btw, 'bouncing' a mob out of the way to split works quite well and if you do it right you can actually paralyse a centre mob, bounce him closer to another and agro that one into camp (proximity agro so train him onto the fighting tank to buy you the space to slow-agro and root-park), then go back and pick off the third mob which is now stood on it's own and either bring that in too or root it and start rotting the both of them ready for the group to move up when they're done with what they have.<br />
<br />
Pet pulling works a treat at splitting busy rooms and also buying time on adds for slows etc to land (SKs love that tactic for pulling with their otherwise horrid little pets).<br />
<br />
Nuking is a good option to soak up the spare mana. It's also handy for breaking root on parked mobs that you want in camp now, so having it up already saves time re-memming.<br />
<br />
Lots of good info in there Caanus. :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh yeah, just remembered another little trick to avoid getting beaten on if you get a multi pull. If you've left dogdog guarding by the group or better yet attacking the engaged mob, and you're pulling mobs in from a few rooms away (depends on dungeon type, some like Ruj don't have doors, others like Mir have loads of rooms), as you pull hit /pet back off and then /pet follow. By the time you get through the first door, dogdog should be well on his way to you and all the doors on the route to the group will be open. :) If you think you're gonna have problems once you get back to the group, that's also the time that you can suicide the puppy onto the mobs to get some of them under control early (as per the &quot;Well, I was unlucky and got 3+ mobs... Are we lost?&quot; section).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, Assiduous is a little slow at times, but it doesn't require you to go hunting in Wakening Lands =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No need to worry about hunting in WL, elder beads do not drop anymore.  You have to hunt the bazaar, and unless someone is retiring, you won't see any for sale.   They are a closely guarded treasure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Didn't realize that using VP would only aggro stuff from where it landed.  Will have to test this tonight because I don't believe it : )</div></div><hr />

<br />
My main is a monk and I pull evertime I group with him and will attest that all that pathing info is correct.<br />
<br />
Been having some bad pullers in my group with my shaman so I might suggest pulling with him from now on.  <br />
<br />
The only problem I can see with Root pulling to hold off an add is the very rare occurance of wanderers (they are there...just not very often).<br />
<br />
If you cast root while the mob is at its innitial bind spot then a wonderer could come by and agro the rest of the room, and the wanderer on you...Scouting should fix this problem though.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for the info.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think that's great Caanus and Juujuu. <br />
<br />
keep updating thoughts to it if they strike you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am relatively new to pulling a dungeon with a shaman, but not new at all to pulling in general.  My old main was a monk and I had also root parked (stun then root) when I would play my cleric as well.<br />
When Ldon came out I would generally have a guild cleric pull with pacify, even with a monk present, simply because in ldon, FD is way too slow a method.<br />
  <br />
Then came the times in which we had neither a monk nor a cleric with the 65 pacify and even times with a bard who could not pull very well, so I decided what the hell.  <br />
Some of the areas looked simple enough to pull via root or slow, so I started doing it for almost every group I made, unless I had a reliable bard (which I prefer).  <br />
I always have tigirs up for A)big add pulls and B) it pulls most of the mobs off the rest of the group so I can park them.<br />
And when I nuke, it is generally Saryrns Tears when a mob is at 50% and then I run off for more, while it rains down.  It really lets me do something active for the party and keeps the dps where it should be.<br />
<br />
Also thought it would be good to add that if you are having problems pulling mobs away from the party due to various reasons (people not assisting or healer agro), simply back away and sit down after slowing.  If the mob was not taunted or there was not some huge quick heal just performed, it should rush right for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meladrak Doushi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Actually monks can pull fairly well even in LDoN.  They just have to get used to the fact that they can't pull only singles.  a monk with good skill in pulling should have no problem pulling 2 at a time and offtanking one till it gets mezzed, slowed, or root parked behind the group.<br />
<br />
Pulling is a mentality, add in tools to that and you have the end product.   Monks have the ability to abort if an initial pull goes bad.  Shaman have the ability to park adds (very effective just got done trying it) and that Pac/Harmony classes have the ability to pick and choose who to pull (But generally takes about as much time as me pulling fom what I have seen and takes mana).<br />
<br />
The most effective way a monk can FD pull in LDoN is to manipulate the pathing, get very close to the direct melee area of one mob and that one mob will follow you in a straight line...however the other ones will not they will path...get the one you have directly pathing to the group and FD.  The others will usually be right outside of agro range if you do it right...takes skill but once you figure it out its easy.  This is very effective in Mistmoore.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't use Assiduous Vision if you have Vision.  Why?<br />
Look at what the 2 of them do:<br />
Vision (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=580&amp;source=Live) <br />
Assiduous Vision (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=384&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
Both spells do this:<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Bind Sight <br />
2:  Increase Magnification by 130% <br />
3:  Ultravision <br />
<br />
The differences between them:<br />
Vision costs 10 mana instead of 50.<br />
Vision has a 4 casting time instead of 6.<br />
Vision has a 10 casting time instead of 12.<br />
AVision has a 15 fizzle adjustment instead of 25 for Vision, whatever that's worth.<br />
<br />
AV lasts 1.95 hours at Level 39<br />
AV lasts 3.25 hours at Level 65<br />
Vision lasts 4.8 mins at Level 19<br />
Vision lasts 14.0 mins at Level 65<br />
<br />
Vision takes less time to cast, recast, and needs less mana.<br />
The only downside is its duration is crap compared to AV.<br />
But when you are pulling in a dungeon and a mob is dying every 60 seconds, who needs a 3 hour duration (even more with scrm + focus effects :)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Nice guide.  I cleaned up the OT posts here when I moved this thread to The Medicine Cabinet.<br />

<br />
A quick Shaman pulling tip.<br />
<br />
If you are pulling from one room to another, and you can see (I.E. target) the mob you want to pull near the other room's doorway but are barred from casting w/o entering the room proper due to Line of Sight issues (frequent occurrence in LDoN dungeon hallways/doorways), simply use /pet attack and then spam /pet back off.  <br />
<br />
This will have an unslowed mob on dogdog briefly, but it is much better than aggroing the whole room because you couldn't get LoS on a mob near the door and stuck your snout too far inside trying to cast Malos, Turgur's, or Root.<br />
<br />
Try it yourself next time you are Adventuring.  :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">No real problem here. Unless your group is doing some insane DPS you should pull by rooting one of the mobs.<br />
<br />
great piece of advice right there.<br />
<br />
very nice guide caanus   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have to agree with anyone using the pet pull technique... this is by far one of our best pulling techniques in higher level dungeons (such as LDON hard missions).  Since LDON came out I have pet as one of my perma memmed spells for the sole purpose of pulling.<br />
<br />
One problem with using Spirit Call to pull though is that it requires line of sight... if you have line of sight, use it, if you don't... well yer pup's rdy to die for you if he can't back off fast enough.<br />
<br />
Also one of my favorite items to use to break root parked mobs (that were rooted during a root split) is White Ceramic Band... it is usable from inventory and casts a 3 second Burst of Flame.  Beats the heck outa keeping a nuke loaded, waiting for root to break, or having to use a short duration root.<br />
<br />
Lately I've been using pet to pull so much it's almost making Suspended Minion sound good.<br />
<br />
Lets see... something that wasn't listed... a good spell line up for pullers (sorry I'm assuming lvl 65 on this).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Few points i didn't see in there on first quick read through.<br />
<br />
Remember that if you know you are gonna take a hit as (hopefully) one mob makes it into camp, try and run into a corner or against a wall so you aren't moved when the mob hits you (avoid interrupts).  A similar one that works well if you have successfully parked a few mobs and have one left but didn't have the time space to root/debuff the  last mob, is to run him over a non caster in middle of finishing off the previous mob.  Even a ranger can live through one round of hits in pop....just make sure if you do this method you slow before debuff so that you get aggro back right away and the mob doesn't clean house on the wimpy rangers or get assisted heal aggro onto your healer/cleric - then park if needed or offtank for 1-5 seconds as previous mob dies, OR, let him follow you around while you debuff/slow your parked adds until the melee are ready for him.  This last method is not the preferred way....and if you're grouped with pansies, you might get complaints, but a mob hitting them for one round so you can get postioned and get a solid slow cast off is, imho worth it, given no other options other than casting through yourself getting hit.<br />
<br />
To expand on the use aggro to your advantage trick....suppose you are pulling 2 (or more) unrootable/unsnareable, (unmezzable or mezzable but no mezzers in group), and perhaps even unslowable mobs.  Add to this possibly only one tank in group...or perhaps only one real tank in group.  Very few spells have more aggro than slow...kite one mob through, over, around, hell anywhere you want that doesn't aggro another add while the group finishes off the first one.  Make sure the druid/rangers know your plan and don't try and snare the mob you kiting and that your tank picks off (aggros) the non very aggro mob on you.  Tis pretty funny kiting said mobs in a very small confined area back and forth over and over your party members while they finish off another mob or two /wink.  FYI, assist heal aggro will (to my experience) never outaggro a resisted slow, however, low hp aggro can, so again, make your party aware of what's happening.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, just because it's so important for pulling...make sure you do a slight turn before your cast when running/casting/running on pulls to tell the server you've stopped and make sure your cast gets off.  (I often spin around as i use first person and the spin allows me to often do one full scan of the area while making sure the spell isn't interrupted from sliding to a stop).</div></div><hr />

For scouting, you might rember that illusions like bear form often allow you to look through walls. I find with my frog that sitting moves my Head forward enough to see into walls as well.</div></div><hr />

is White Ceramic Band... it is usable from inventory and casts a 3 second Burst of Flame.  <br />
That is a good tip.  Will have to pull that off of my mule for use. :cool: <br />
Saves dropping a DoT just to break a root.  I'm sure that will be useful for soloing during root/rot situations and you need to move a parked mob.<br />
EDIT:  This works great.  Thanks for the tip.  Used it in Tactics last night to great effect, and expect to be using it alot when I'm pulling in LDoN Adventures to unstick a mob without using mana.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Here's a couple more tips as well.<br />
<br />
*If you are in a big pull dungeon such as takish (average pull is 3 mobs), then go ahead and root one in a room and slow the adds. <br />
<br />
*In dungeons that dont have visibility challenges (such as the brown haze in tak) you can use your vision spells to scout pulls, approach angles for aggro pulling etc.<br />
<br />
*You can also pull from max distance through a open door, and root the mob before it gets to you with a fast casting root.<br />
<br />
*Although FD pulling can slow things down in LDoN tag FD pulling can work well. FD class pulls a room runs back to the group and FDs just outside aggro range, group then splits, roots, mezzes or start off-tanking.<br />
<br />
*make sure you have clip pane at 100% when you are pulling. (learned that the hard stupid way).</div></div><hr />

Do a slight turn right before? My version is Target, start turning and as i am turning to start running off to my group I am casting whatever spell I am pulling with.<br />

Great Guide,<br />
-I never really thought about the pet pull myself, tho I have seen my buddy (65 BST) do it with Pet Hold. Do we even get Pet Hold? I assume so.<br />
-If VP works by launching the Mob in the direction you are facing!?! WOW that rocks. I know what I am getting after Canni 5.<br />
-I wish I had your problem with all that extra mana and time. Between Malos, Turgur's, Cripple, and recasting buffs, I do not stop casting, ever.<br />
<br />
My tip to add to this guide- <br />
Always carry peridots and get Virtue on your pet. It saves you time and mana not having to remem, recast and rebuff. Also, dogdog works great as an offtank in a pinch.<br />

You mean it's more complex than run, spot mob, F8, cast, return to group??? =)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, there's always the alternative: run, hear KOS message 'Stinky shammies like you ruined my appetite' times X, return to group.<br />
<br />
Not that complificated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">After a pull that your pet manage's to survive but only due to him enraging.  Put your pet in his little pocket and then pull him right back out.  This will reset all his meele ability timers.<br />
<br />
The way mobs are facing also affects the distance they will assist as well.  If they have thier back to you they have much shorter agro range then one looking at you or the mob your pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">One method/trick i didnt see mentioned is to pull with a low aggro spell, like malo/malos. My main is a ranger and the ranger community commonly uses jolt pulls to split up mobs, the assist radius seems to be affected by the hate generated when spell pulling.  After a nasty set of wipes in ldon i took over pulls on my shaman, useing root pulls, proximity and malo i rarely got more than 1-2. Just something a few of you may want to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I don't really like using root to pull unless I have to, because it just isn't all that consistant. shaman roots don't have a great resist check, and they have a tendency to break very fast at the worst times even if they don't get resisted. If you're wanting to split 3 mobs and you open with a root, if that root gets resisted, you're suddenly looking at 3 unslowed, unaffected mobs in your face, in which case you might as well have just had a warrior do it.<br />
<br />
I think the key to pulling for a shaman (other than just letting someone else do it) is the same as playing a shaman in general, and that is not trying to be a cowboy. 3 or 4 normal level ldon type mobs are pretty easy to handle as long as you  have some seperation and take advantage of the 5 other people in your group instead of trying to impress them by doing it all yourself.<br />
<br />
When I pull, all i'm basically trying to do is to avoid the sudden impact of a bunch of stuff hitting the group all at once, because usually when groups get killed, its because they get destroyed in the first few seconds of a fight. After that, its usually pretty easy nomatter what the makeup of your group is.<br />
<br />
I think its probably best just to go with a sure thing as often as possible, as opposed to opening with roots, or even slows. If you have line of sight, the two sure things you have are malo and malicious decay. If you use malo, one of your mobs is almost guaranteed to be neutralized quickly as you come in, either via a root or a slow. If you use malicious decay, one is almost guaranteed to be neutralized quickly by virulent paralysis. If you do not have line of sight, using a pet is your only sure bet to neutrlize, but there's a few ways to improve on that method that haven't been mentioned.<br />
<br />
When I use a pet to pull, I do my best to ensure that it doesn't die in the few seconds its needed to create seperation. Some tools that help with this are sprit of the shrew, summoned girdle of magi koi, pet discipline, and quiessence. Shrew allows your pet to run back to you when you are ready without it being hit along the way. Girdles are easily picked up in the bazaar for a few platinum and add 500 hit points to your pet in addition to your buffs. Pet discipline allows you to  yo-yo mobs without stopping to gain agro over your pet first, and it also removes your pet from rooted mobs. Quiessence obviously helps in keep your pet alive, and since you are heading towards your group and have your own ways to neutralize mobs, it will need it more than you, not that you can't cast it on both of you if you're that paranoid.<br />
<br />
Basically there are really only a handful of scenarios, and these are my peronal preferences for each.<br />
<br />
#1. 2 mobs - Just pull them. Nobody likes super caution boys that hold up a group by insisting on striving toward some sort of idiotic crowd control gem for the ages.<br />
<br />
#2. 3 mobs with los -  Cast quiessence on your pet (which has shrew). Open with malo (range 4 helps), and immediately attack a seperate target with your pet AFTER. Head to your camp with 2 mobs, one of them malod. Call assist on the malod mob and use this sequence as they come into the camp. Malicioius decay on the unmalod mob, followed by virulent paralysis on the same mob, followed by turgur's on the malod mob, which your tank is on. Using that sequence, you will avoid waiting on any gem refreshes, and you're also very unlikely to get resisted. Then, use /pet hold, and an /assist jibekerorwhatever macro to get a targetting jump on the 3rd mob as it follows your pet back to the camp.<br />
<br />
#3. 3 mobs without los- Get a target with whatever your preferred vision method may be and send your pet with q and shrew at that target as you head back toward the camp. As soon as you see your pets life go down, hit /pet hold sending all the mobs back at your group. The only advantage you have is seperation, so you need to make the most of it. One way or another (depending on how dumb your group is) you need to make sure that your tank is on a different target than you are. As the mobs come in, you can use md/vp to neutralize the one you have targetted fast enough that it will most likely not even hit you. At that point, you'll have 2 unslowed, unaffected mobs in the camp, one on you and one on the tank, but the one on you only has assist agro, so it'll fly off towards the first thing that generates agro. If you hit /pet attack, it will go to the mob on you nomatter which you have targetted, and the mob will peel off onto your pet, buying you a few seconds. You'll want to get the off mob first, because if you get resisted casting slow on the main target, the off mob will agro the healer as soon as they heal the tank, which they will most likely have to do. The last thing you cast was vp though, so your gems are up and you should be fine. If your tank+healer cant handle one mob for a few seconds, you're going to die anyway, and if you can't neutralize one mob before it kills both your pet and yourself, you're gonna die anyway.<br />
<br />
#4. 4 or more mobs with los - Spirit Call/peel<br />
<br />
#5. 4 or more mobs without los - Let someone else pull. <br />
<br />
Just a couple of random notes here at the end.<br />
<br />
-md/vp combo is very good if your main objective is controlling mobs. md is fast and unresistable, and it usually makes vp last a very long time.<br />
<br />
-nomatter what your preferences are with regards to being cautious, its good to plan out spell sequences around your items and alt skills that can be used while spell gems are down. i already mentioned vp, but there are other things such as the immobilize ring from vt and other special items that allow you to roll off 3 effects instantly after each other, with the non-standard cast in the middle.<br />
<br />
-you're corpse is not very useful to a group. if you try to do everything yourself instead of letting other classes do their jobs, you're in for a lot of failure, and that pretty much applies to every class in every situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I just pulled Ruj a few times tonight. Ruj max mob scenario is like 3 IMO. So on those three id pull w/ slow, sic pet on add, vp other add and it was np. If the one add resisted VP i would slow it and offtank it. Never had to bust out the spirit call peel trick but it works wonders as described. I also have defensive AA's which help a lot. Get an extended range item. For me it is Clay Bracers of the Golem. This lets you MD/VP pull a lot safer. Another trick is if for somereason you have 3 unslowed mobs in camp Tigir's Insects is a good spell. It should be renamed Take One For The Team but if the group is good youll be healed and all will be well. Its not so much to slow 3 mobs at once, but to take aggro off the cleric. Also groups like chain pulling. I would pull a mob(with slow), sic pet, sinia it, Bane it and run off to grab another mob. Don't be oor when it dies or you wont get exp. Those are what I have learned so far, good luck!</div></div><hr />

Anathema is a GREAT investment for rooting and rotting.  Its a 278/tik curse DoT with NO DD.  i believe that it is 510 pts in Ruj LDoN....<br />
<br />
When you root/split mobs and intend to lend a DPS hand...DoTs with DDs on them are more likley to break root.  Epic-Ultor-Anathema-Blood of Saryn are the 4 best DoTs for root rotting CC'd mobs as they have NO DD on them. <br />
<br />
That is just based on my experience, dont mean for it to be about rooting and rotting, just mean that if you intend to root/split mobs and THEN DoT them, BECAREFUL, DD's on DoTs can break root and bring the mob running at you.<br />

Shrinking twice and sitting also allows you to see through walls (Iksar with luclin models,  I hear no luclin models is better for this though).<br />
<br />
Also, casting Assiduous Vision on yourself is a good way to see around corners if you arent using the see-through-walls trick.  It also adds ultravision if you are a blind race (for you barbs out there) and it lasts forever.</div></div><hr />

hehe, point well taken, alas...i dont have VP or Bane yet cause i have been working on other things.  and thank you for the correction on where Anathema comes from.  Off tanking is fun, but when pulling mobs that hit for 900+ its not always the easiest thing to do :( i know...i tried on accident a few times :) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">It flies in the direction you are facing and WILL AGGRO OTHERS BASED ON WHERE IT LANDS, not based on where it was when VP hit it.<br />
<br />
I feel like I have to add some information about VP.  In my experience a mob will aggro from where it was when you cast it, not from where it lands.  I have spent a lot of time in Droga, and with the tiny aggro range there, it should be trivial to split mobs if it worked the way described in the original post.<br />
<br />
Also, throughout this post I have seen many people misuse the term pet-pulling.  Pet pulling is not sending in your level 61 pet and dealing with the adds as they come chasing you out.  Pet pulling is sending in a lower level pet (spirit of the howler) into a room full of tightly packed mobs and only one comes out.  Your pet must survive initial aggro, or this will not work.  Once the pet dies aggro will work like it always does.<br />
<br />
I have used pet pulling successfully in Droga at any camp, for guarenteed singles.  I have also used it for pulling Drusella Sathirs room solo in HS.  This method will probably not work in high risk ldon, Gates of Discord, or in the elementals due to how hard mobs hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">When I am able to get in game again sometime I will test out VP and see if it has been changed around to aggro on initial location now.
