<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I picked this up in a trade last night.  Thought it might be a nice little 2hb to use for when I'm solo'ing.<br />
<br />
The guy told me the effect was a dd + dot.  Went to verify it at castersrealm, of course there wasn't one there.  Allakhazam's is a pay site now, so couldnt' check there.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what exactly the effect does?</div></div><hr />

If you go to Eq Atlas for that map the click on bestiary and then the chieftain can see the stats from Allakhzam's site. this is a way to work around the ay part of the site or you can go to equipment search and put in the name of weapon and will also let you see stats. The is a description fro Alla's site of the proc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm..sounds like it might be a nice 2hb to use.<br />
<br />
Am I wrong in my thinking?  Anyone else ever used one?<br />
<br />
Think the damage on it was 24 delay of 42.  Kinda slow so wasn't sure if it would be worth using.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Oh..and thanks for the info and links.  Bookmarked Lucy's page :)</div></div><hr />

It's not the worlds greatest 2hb but it isn't horrendous either :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This bugs me. Allakhazams is NOT a pay site. You can still look up anything that you could before. The premium membership, which is a portion of the sight you can pay for, which allows you to be lazy and just search for an item by name, is the only part you can choose to pay for. If you want to look up info on an item however, you just need to know what kind of item it is. If you wanted to look up this item, you would need to do the following after going to Allakhazams page. <br />
<br />
1. Click on the title of Equipment on the left side of the screen<br />
<br />
2. Select 2 Hand Blunt from the list of weapons<br />
<br />
3. Select the three filters if you choose, sorting them by dam, delay, ratio or whatever you choose, then sorting by any class or a specific class, and then if you want to sort by stats on the item or not. <br />
<br />
You can still find all the information that you ever could there, just to be able to do some of the lazy person stuff, those features are a paid service. Please know what you are talking about before talking bad about someone who has provided a site that has been so helpful to the entire community for so long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First thing you need to do is pull that stick out of your a**.<br />
<br />
I have been gone for 9months.  It's been  at least that long since I've been to Allakhazam's website.<br />
<br />
All I know is I go to the site, try to do some of the older functions that I used to could, but get denied saying that I can't because I need to pay.<br />
<br />
So sue me for not knowing.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;Allakhazam's is a pay site now, so couldnt' check there.&quot;<br />
<br />
And please tell me where you got I was talking bad about the site?<br />
<br />
<br />
crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">One other tip for using Alla - just type the item name into Google and add the word &quot;allakhazam&quot; and the first result will generall take you right where you want to go.<br />
<br />
For instance, in google, type:  &quot;staff of smothering sands allakhazam&quot;<br />
<br />
The first link is where you'll want to go.  :)<br />
<br />
Another benefit of this is that if Alla's site is running slow, you can always click on the &quot;Cached&quot; link from the Google page and get it from the Google servers instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Google is the best thing that ever happened to the internet.  I'm gonna name my firstborn 'Google' ...or maybe 'GoogleToolbar', haven't decided yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh I agree.  Google is awesome.<br />
<br />
I was having some problems the other day with my network.  When I would try to ping I kept getting this error 65.<br />
<br />
Looked for a while on the internet, but couldn't find anything.<br />
<br />
Fired up google, typed in the error message and found about 20 pages of the problem and how to solve it.<br />
<br />
Turned out to be zonealarm.  <br />
<br />
Definately a life saver..hehe!</div></div><hr />
