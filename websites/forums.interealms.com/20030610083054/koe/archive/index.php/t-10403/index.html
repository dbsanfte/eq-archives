<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cubman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">All I have to say is I enjoyed it!<br />
<br />
I about fell outta my chair when Aragorn tossed something...!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Moonshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LOL yeah &quot;Just don't tell the elf&quot;<br />
<br />
AWESOME MOVIE!!!!<br />
All 15 of us went at once last night to the 12:01 am showing was well worth the lack of sleep!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aranuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For me the movie didn't start until 12:45, because the theater I saw it at let us in late and wanted to make sure everyone had a fair shot to buy candy.  That was the first time in my life I've watched a movie until 4AM, but what a movie....<br />
<br />
I'm trying to be as general as possible for those that haven't yet seen this, so there shouldn't be any spoilers here.<br />
<br />
For the purists:<br />
They deviate. It's a movie. Deal. <br />
<br />
For Lucasfilm:<br />
You're special effects look like cartoony garbage compared to what the folks at WETA accomplished. The bar has been raised. The effects in this movie are so seemless, and so well done that it makes the much lauded Attack of the Clones effects look like a joke. Congratulations Lucasarts, you've been beaten at the game you invented by a group of students.<br />
<br />
For the rest of you:<br />
Breathtaking. Supremely well done. This movie is not to be missed. If you thought The Fellowship of the Ring was good/exciting/etc., prepare to have your mind blown. <br />
<br />
Though the story deviates from the book, it never loses the spirit in that was intended. This is definitely the best movie of the year 2002. Peter Jackson is a genius, the acting was superb, the cinematography was phenomenal, the special effects were the best I've ever seen, and the battle scenes... <br />
<br />
Everyone should go out and see this movie right away.<br />
<br />
PS Wood elves &gt; All!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The way everyone keeps talking...the golum thing actually has a lot to do with the story in this? I always figured he was a cast off cameo left over from The Hobbit, but I never read the books either...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aranuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gollum plays a major, major role in the LotR trilogy.<br />
<br />
Yes he was a character in The Hobbit, but The Hobbit is far more a story and far less an epic.  They don't really go into detail about how Gollum came to possess the ring, or who he is etc.  Along the same lines, In the hobbit, the ring is really just a magic ring that makes Bilbo invisible.  There's no mention that it's evil/powerful/dangerous.<br />
<br />
If you have other questions, PM me etc.  I'll try to answer them. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Acies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I read the LotR when I was very young, and still love to paruse over the books. I saw, like Aranuil, deviation. Big whoop, they covered it beautifully.<br />
The effects were nice and extremely detailed, but honestly, noone ever gives enough credit to the music score, which makes or breaks a scene. The score was unbeleivable.<br />
As too Gollum, major part. I loved how he was portrayed in this.<br />
But again, it is really all about Gimely.<br />
&quot;You could've picked a better spot&quot; was the quote of the night.<br />
And on another note, the preview for Terminatior 3, hehehe, badass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dexail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I agree Acies, I almost died laughing at that quote..<br />
<br />
The movie was incredible</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rycovias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To my friends at KoE, I also recommend EQUILIBRIUM.  It is the best movie of the year pre-LoTR -- too bad the no advertisement kinda killed the movie.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kluden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have seen TT twice now.  I will probably go two or three more times before it is out of the theatres.  I cannot stress enough about how these movies, much like the Star Wars, Star Treks, and other great special effects movies, are better on the &quot;big screen&quot;.<br />
<br />
I love seeing all the extra footage at home, and my home theatre system is very nice...but it is NOT the movie theatre.  And my TV is a 32&quot; screen, not 32 feet.<br />
<br />
Go see it, you'll love it.  To make it even crazier, watch the Fellowship before you goto the theatre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Hoarmurath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, I'm a huge Tolkien fan and nitpicker-of-details, but I also realize that this is a movie meant for entertainment and was never meant to be a direct adaptation of the books.  So there were more &quot;deviations&quot; in this movie than in FotR, but I don't feel like any of them detracted from the movie.<br />
<br />
Essentially, if you liked FotR, you will love TTT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Plopnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I havn't seen the movie yet but I plan to this weekend (multiple times)<br />
<br />
My thought is this though ....<br />
My friends and I used to have movie marathon days in college and we liked to do multiple movies ie. Star wars (4,5,6), Indiana Jones, Rocky etc.  Can you imagine sitting on your butt for 10+ hrs to watch these movies in a row?<br />
<br />
Well I guess us EQ ppl can imagine sitting that long, but I doubt the general public will posess the stamina we've developed.;) <br />
<br />
Plop<br />

&quot;My idea of a lazy day is a case of beer, a couple of football games and a pack of Depends.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
This reminds me of a game that I invented in college called &quot;The Star Wars Drinking Game&quot;. It involves malt liquor (usually Olde English, but preferably the big 64oz Haffenreffer Private Stock) and any of the Star Wars movies.<br />
<br />
The rules are as follows:<br />
<br />
Any time anyone says a line of dialogue along with the char, everyone else must drink. If more than one person says it at the same time, then it's a tie everyone drinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aneron Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Olde E is the debil!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tweedl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I too saw TT at midnight.  I have to say the variations from the book were non-distracting from the story, and Gollum was done AMAZINGLY.  The job they did to capture the Gollum/Smeagol dichotomy was great.  As a huge fan of the books and Middle-earth lore on a whole, I'd have to say Petey Jackson has captured that feel and look that I'd always imagined the LotR story as having.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Really cool movie.  I have reread the books here in the last few months.  And yes there were some deviations but if there weren't it would be a 5hr movie.  The part I liked that was left in from the books was the contest legolas and gimli had on how many orcs they killed.  The other funny part was &quot;All this stew needs is some Taters&quot;..&quot;Taters&quot; What is Taters Precious?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Remember, The Hobbit was written LAST, after the trilogy was completed.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are no cast-offs from The Hobbit in the trilogy.  The Hobbit only exists to give background.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still a heck of a story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Um, the Hobbit was written first. It was out about 10 years before LOTR. However, it was changed after LOTR in the areas pertaining to Gollum so that the value of the ring to Gollum was more pronounced.  At least that is how I remember it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Fedora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That is correct!<br />
<br />
for more information on timetables and general LotR in the context of Tolkien's life, I'd suggest this book:<br />
<br />
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0813190177/qid=1040341078/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-9123189-4360645?v=glance&amp;s=books<br />
<br />
I'm reading it now, and it is VERY good.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm a dork, but I'm cute too, honest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Arborealus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well actually I did find one deviation in storyline fairly significantly annoying..I still can see no reason for this particular modification...Perhaps a foreshadowing of the Last Alliance, but I just didn't see it as necessity...Then again I really cannot see this as if I were not steeped in the tales and mythology so perhaps those unfamiliar with the stories need this bit to carry them along...Seems to me like they were just padding the films elf/minute count (this should clarify what my issue was to those familiar with the story without constituting a spoiler)<br />
<br />
The movie as a whole was exceptional and held well to the spirit of the work...</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh, the explanationa bout female dwarfs sure made alot of sense hehehehe<br />
<br />
There was so much good stuff about the movie, all i can say is go watch it and enjoy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, this movie was indeed a treat. Limited release and no advertising.  Excellent special effects and fight sequences with little or no CGI.  They did a great job on it, set the mood very well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Bearan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well I just got home from the movie.  I wondered how they the Ents would turn out as I thought they would be hard to get right.  Well all I can say is from now on I will always see ents as they were shown in the movie.  They were just awesome.  The movie was great.  Well worth seeing and this is from a Lord of the Rings purist.  Yes the movie took some liberties with the book but as Willowwing siad they could not make it 5 hours. <br />
<br />
Bearan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Toddoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Finally got to see this movie the other day. I've been following it since the whole project was just a rumor.<br />
<br />
Of course, I thought it was great. However, the deviation that bugged me the most was taking Frodo to Osgiliath and all. I suppose it makes for better cinema, in that the whole chapter or two concerning Faramir was mostly a battle of dialogue. And,  Ogiliath was cool.<br />
<br />
I thought the battle of Helm's Deep was better in the movie than the book. In the book, the Ents sent their army of Hurons, or living trees, to gobble up the orcs in the night.<br />
<br />
For me, the most striking scene was the last one of the movie. With the camera panning up to view all of Mordor. A fantastic image of Tolkien's concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well, I guess I wil crayon through the foreword on my collectors edition then.  It says the Hobbit was done LAST, and was only written/dreamed up from J.R.R.'s childrens desire to know more about hobbits and their history.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arb, the scene you are referring to was only written in for one reason.  Modern audiences would never accept Aragorn having two loves and still being a noble person.  They had to write in the split to account for modern tastes.  I thought it was overdone and a waste of film time, but I see why they did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">On the spec edition dvd it says as well that he wrote Hobbit first...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Toddoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">That is odd about your collector's edition Fallanthas. Although, I had never heard that The Hobbit was rewritten. This link is a nice write up of Tolkien and his few publication. In that Tolkien invented his fantasy world over a lifetime. Hence, the depth and richness in The Lord of the Rings.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Harryfooty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">That was the coolest movie ever!<br />
Better than the first one. I like gimli and legolas :)<br />
<br />
Edit: When me and Bemidian went to see it the parking lot was totally full! People were parking up and down the roads and in the parking lots of stores and restraunts. We wanted to go home but we found 1 parking spot and we parked there. We thought the tickets would be sold out but we got 2 tickets and in the theatre found 2 seats by each other.<br />
Popcorn and milkduds are goood ;) <br />
<br />
Anyway, thats a very big parking lot. Lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Azero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The Movie was great, saw it whit my girlfriend. I noticed that Gimli the dwarf son of Gloin has an Axe that looks just like Windblade in Everquest!!</div></div><hr />
