<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, much to the surprise of my guildmates, I finally expressed interest in some loot and wound up with yelinak's head in my bag and about 60 congratulatory tells.  Hello Guantlets of Dragonslaying . . . eventually.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty much KoS to ALL the velious giant and dragon factions.  The d0rfs love me in Thurg.  I need to get Kromrif, Kromzek, and Tormax faction from the basement to the ceiling.<br />
<br />
Suggestions or walkthroughs?  Do I just have to go kill 2000 dwarves?  :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How many times have you killed Yeli?<br />
<br />
After 1 kill you should be apprehenive to T-max, after 2 indifferent to kindly. <br />
<br />
Kindly is all you need to have to turn in the head. Trick is finding him up, which is usually after a server comes up. If he speaks to you then you can do the quest.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about Rif faction unless you want to do quests and stuff from Kael. Rif= bearded giants, Zek = clean shave (as a rule of thumb), there are some storm giants that don't have beards.<br />
<br />
Well anyway killing dain and yeli is the fastest way to get T-max faction. The other way is to kill the coldain in the caves in GD get heads and turn in to Belvos in the kael bank. This however is slow slow slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It takes about 5-6 Dain hits to go from Max KOS to ALLY to Tormax, But you may still be KOS to Rif and Zek...<br />
<br />
Your best bet is this.....<br />
<br />
Whore yourself out to any Dain Raids you can to mooch Faction hits off of him, and XP in the Village Camp in Velks and make sure you ML so you can scoop as many Kobold Paws as possible...<br />
<br />
Kobold Paws give Rif and Zek faction (lots) and I think they *might* give Tormax. The dain hits may not be enough to get you unKOS to Rif and Zek, so you may need to hunt some Dorfs for that.  <br />
<br />
You hand the paws to Bvellos in the Kael Bank 4 at a time.  Now... Everything in the Bank is on Zek Faction... Zek is also the easier faction to fix of the two, the problem comes when the one wandering Rif faction mob near the bank Aggros you....  if you're not Ally to Zek, Bvellos will assist.. and you die kinda fast...<br />
<br />
If you're asking, Why do I care about getting Zek Faction, I just want Tormax faction... keep in mind there's see-invis Zek Guards all over Tormax's Throneroom area of Kael.<br />
<br />
It's all about the Dain hits.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">paws give tmax hits, but they are very very very weak.<br />
<br />
Killing wurms and wyvrns in skyshrine will give big +zek hits<br />
<br />
other than that, WW dragons when you are bored, and then 18 billion dwarves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh.  The irony is that we killed Dain right before we killed Yeli . . . and I /q'd out to avoid the faction hit.<br />
<br />
We've killed Yeli lots, but we also kill Tormax.  We do NToV frequently as well.  Suffice to say, I think, that every faction in Velious--except dwarf--is pretty much bottomed out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Decide you want to get your faction one way and do it.  With consistent effort, it doesn't take that long.<br />
<br />
When I joined CE, I was +dwarf +dragon.  After a couple months of just raids (no independent work on faction), I had it reversed completely.  Riff took the longest to fix, but once fixed it doesn't move too much, even though we do the occasional Vindi raid.  Zek would have taken alot less time, but I wasn't concentrating on fixing it, and I lost out on alot of zek hits in ToV.<br />
<br />
To fix Tmax, one or two dain raids, combined with maybe a couple hours of royal guards in Icewell, and you should turn it.<br />
<br />
As a sidebar, my warrior friend who was +kael reversed his faction enough in about 10 days to get a shroud of the dar brood.  Instead of hunting like he normally did, he concentrated on faction.  Didn't take much time at all.</div></div><hr />
