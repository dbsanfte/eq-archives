<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ladani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello!<br />
<br />
I've been an avid reader of TSC for a long time and thought I'd join up and post because I have a few questions.<br />
<br />
Some background:<br />
<br />
Started playing in 2001 after watching my husband play for a while.  After SoL came out, we left EQ because it tanked my system...and went to DAoC.  In November 2002 we came back to EQ....<br />
<br />
I did not start Ladani up immediately, as I just didn't think I was a good caster (discovered in DAoC I was a better melee type).  But...after watching my husband (again!) play with our old friends, I pulled Ladani out of retirement in January of this year.  She was level 42 and is now 7 blues from 50.<br />
<br />
I guess my main question is what should I be doing now?  We usually group together (he's a level 57 necro) or with our friends or guildmates.  I feel like I'm holding him back from getting his levels up because he's helping me get my levels up.<br />
<br />
I'm linking my Magelo profile for some advice on getting more WIS pieces (I will say that two pieces were given to me by a guildmate: the chest and head piece)  <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=586028<br />
<br />
My WIS with KEI and bearform is only 178!!!! ack!<br />
<br />
So, thanks for reading (if you got this far!) and have a great day!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">178 wis is fine. That's as much as I have at 60.<br />
As a shaman, especially at 50+, you want HP, regen, and AC more then wis. With the Cannibalize line of spells and regen, wis is hardly important.  At 60 with torpor I can go with 150 wis and never be OOM unless I am buffing several groups with focus or I get mana tapped.<br />
Trust me, it seems odd compared to what the stats do at first, but HP is a lot more handy :)<br />
Anyway, a couple suggestions to your magelo<br />
not sure what your budget is tho<br />
Velium Fire Wedding Rings<br />
Black Sapphire Electrum Earrings<br />
Crystal Spider Eyes<br />
Sarnak Battleshield<br />
Iksar Regen BP<br />
a lot of this might be out of your price range though /shrug<br />
my magelo has a lot of droppable stuff, I don't know what prices are like on your server but some of it might be good for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ladani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks!  I appreciate the comments!  I've got a little &quot;rainy day&quot; fund...so I think I'll look into what you've listed.<br />
<br />
Interesting though, I always thought WIS was the most important thing....I guess I was wrong! ;-)<br />
<br />
Oh and with Canni.....I have (several times) killed myself whilst doing that!  My other favorite screw up death is forgetting I didn't have DMF and falling over the cliff at Kael ....hehe<br />
<br />
I really need to do the Canni 2 quest......or at this point...just wait til I can scribe Canni 3!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">canni 2 helps a LOT<br />
but - if you're levelling fast enough, I wouldn't worry about it too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ladani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only time I level fast is if we're in guild group (they'd all be at least 59/60)...<br />
<br />
So how hard is it to do the Canni 2 quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If your husband helps you can blow through the canni 2 quest in a couple of hours.  The only thing in that quest that could slow down a 57 necro is the drop rate.:D<br />
<br />
At 49 you could solo it pretty easy but it would be slower than with help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ladani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Catty!  I think we'll look into the quest info later!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">These people are correct. hp &gt; AC &gt; mana/wis<br />

Unfortunately you have outgrown most of your mana. All your focus effects are focus II, and you are taking to big a penalty on the rather weak stats on this armor. Focus II only works on spell up to level 40, and you just will not be casting them very often any more. Here are a few suggestions to look out for:<br />
<br />
Ears (from cheapest to most expensive): Earring of Twisted Leves, Earring of purity, Earring of Cleansing, Silver Hammer Earring, Skull Charm, Earring of the Solstice<br />
Fingers: Velium Fire Wedding Ring, Circled Toe Bones, Shadel Bandit Ring, Valorium Ring of gallantry<br />
Neck: Ivory Imbied Collar, Spider Fur Collar<br />
Face: Crystal Spider Eyes, Death Mask of the Elysians, Golem Jawbone<br />
Wrists: Do the Coldain Military Wristguard quest. With your husband to help it will take about 2 hours. Jarsarth Bracer, Chains of the Accursed, Bracelet of Fortitude, Bracelet of Sense<br />
Arms Barbed Ringmail sleeves<br />
Back: Totemic Cloak, Wet Thorn Cloak, Cloak of Wisdom, Cloak of the Maelstrom<br />
Shoulders: Tattered Mantle, Elder Wolf Hide, Obulus Death Shroud, Imbued Granite Spaulders<br />
Waist Chitinous Belt<br />
Legs: Do the Kromriff Military leggings quest. Jarsarth leggings<br />
Feet: Tribal War Boots (remember you dont have to wear the fur boots to click the SoW effect)<br />
Primary: Thunder Runed War Spear, Howling Harpoon, Rune Etched Icewurm Fang<br />
[b]Secondary[b/]: Crystal Chitin Shield, Sarnak Battle Shield, Skull Marked Shield, Orb of the Infinite Void</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ladani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow thanks for the list Weyalan!  <br />
<br />
I will look into those items soon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The late 40's and early 50's can be frustrating levels for a non-twinky shaman. You get lots of nice new spells, spells that are really quite powerful and that really make a difference to what you can do. However, shaman are rather dependent on their armor, and like I said, unless you are very rich, your armor is probably pretty shabby (I know mine was). There are lots of nice items for sale in the bazaar, but my god, where do you find the thousands of plat that you require.<br />
<br />
I started farming the Ice Giants in Everfrost. If you are reasonably competent, you can solo them from about level 45 onwards, although it is slow and risky. From about level 49 onwards, it becomes a fairly safe easy proposition. By the time you get to level 53 you can probably handle 2 and by 56 you can take all 3 (with KEI)...anyway, they drop between 5 and 40 plat along with assorted gems, fine steel weapons and other stuff - I figure on average 30 to 40 plat worth of plat and loot per kill. At level 50, the exp will be very good too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dretch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Couple other options for you:<br />
<br />
Brown Chitin Leggings<br />
Arctic Wyvern Wristbands<br />
Large Smooth Metal Torque<br />
Dragonwing Mantle (any type)<br />
<br />
all are pretty cheap in bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ladani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Weyalan: <br />
<br />
If I hunt with hubby....we go to some interesting places that drop plat a lot! ;-)  I've got a nice chunck of change in the bank...and I built a comprehensive list of those items last night...and I know I can get a few pieces now with out bankrupting (can you no more alchemy) myself!<br />
<br />
Dretch: <br />
<br />
Thanks for your suggestions!  I'll look those up and see what the are!<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ladani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just wanted to say thanks for all the tips on upgrading my armor...I have managed to upgrade quite a bit!  Even managed to get the Coldain Military Wristguard.....which wasn't easy....hehe<br />
<br />
Hopefully my Magelo will come up! ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">There is a good neckpiece that I'm surprised wasn't mentioned above, the Amulet of Insight which has ok stats but has Extended Enhancement 3 on it (which is great for many many reasons).  <br />
<br />
Anyway it's not too hard to get if you can stomach losing faction with Dain Frostweaver (not the dorfs in Thurg mind you, just the Dain and his cohorts in Icewell Keep).  You should easily be able to do it with a few friends, it drops off Scribe Kaavin who is in the room next to the Dain (facing the Dain go into the room on the right).  Wait until after 7pm gametime for the king to retire to his chamber and kill away.  Took me about 7 kills to finally get one but your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ladani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Might have to look into that one! ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ladani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">We went to one of the new zones the other night (have no idea which one!!) and I managed to get the only awesome drop!!!<br />
<br />
Bracelet of the Spiritcharmer!!<br />
