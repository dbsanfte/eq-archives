<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As a chemically-enhanced teenager (early 80's) - we had a place called The Wallace-Lake Dam ... WAY out in BFE bout 10-20 miles with nothing near for MILES...   Lots of us hooligans used to go out there to destroy brain cells.<br />
<br />
Spray-painted in 3-foot high letters across the grafitti-covered dam was a quote I'll never forget:<br />
<br />
<br />
You can drink 'em pretty, but you can't drink 'em thin. <br />
<br />
On Hwy 171 south from Keithville, LA headed towards Many, La there's a large tank on the left side of the road that reads:<br />
<br />
<br />
Billy-Bob (heart)'s Charlene<br />
<br />
<br />
That's like your official notification that you're in RedNeck Territory.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you've EVER climbed to the top of a water tower with a bucket of paint to defend your sister's honor.... you MIGHT just be a RedNeck&quot; ... Jeff Foxworthy<br />

What grafitti have you folks seen that stuck with ya?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well as far as graffiti goes the most memorable is this tunnel by the high school in my neighborhood.  Pretty much if you didn't sign your name on it you were considered a wuss cause no one cared about the graffiti there, it was considered a tradition.  Well, the most memorable graffiti spread I've ever seen is when one of the seniors, a well known, well liked, and very popular guy, died from a heart attack while jogging.  There was so many lines of feeling poured out on those tunnel walls it would make you tear just seeing it, even if you didn't know the guy.  The most memorable one was the fathers.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Son, if you can see this as I know you can, know one thing.  You had the best gift of all, the gift of friendship. So many people in this place have been touched by you and will remember you always.  I'm proud of you son, and I'll see you soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;destructive&quot; taggin, the best thing I've seen is when we stole a truck crane and parked a beat up pinto on the roof of a gas station. lol, yes I did do this and got away with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Saw this one scrawled on a warehouse wall once.  I have NO clue how it got there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;When I was eighteen, I couldnt' believe how stupid my father was.  By the time I turned 21, I couldn't believe how much the old fart had learned in three years.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zaythar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The best graffiti I have ever seen was done by my own hand. I was about 5 years old and had just learned to write my name. Well, I found my mom's mascara and in big letters wrote my name on the freshly painted white wall and trim in our dining room. My parents had just finished repainting the week prior and apparently I felt it was the best canvas. Then I tried to wash it off but it didn't work so I went off to play, figuring that my parents wouldn't notice. Oh, and yes, when asked if I did it, I told them I had no idea how 12 inch tall letters, spelling Wendy, got there.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Fallanthas: Love It!<br />
<br />
Wendy: Last summer I wandered into the kitchen, in sock feet, and my socks stuck to the floor.  I started looking around and there was a red stain on EVERY counter-top in sight, even the island.  The wallpaper by the stove was stained, and it was smeared all over the floor. I pulled my sticky socks off and trotted to the laundry room to throw them in a clothes hamper there, and what do I see?  A small pair of red-stained socks and several kitchen towels soaked with red Kool-Aid.  As I returned to the kitchen, I noticed aside from the partially mopped up liquid, a red powder everywhere too.<br />
<br />
Now I and Weezee have 1 child, an 11yr old girl who was sitting in the living room watching cartoons.   Now when asked how Kool-Aid got ALL over the kitchen, her socks, and several dishtowels, she said &quot;I don't know!&quot;<br />
<br />
BRAIN DAMAGE! (as Mr. Cosby would say)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While going to college at the University of California, Santa Barbara, I rode my bike, as most of the students did. In one of the bike tunnels covered with graffiti was the one that has stuck in my mind all these years. In big black letters was the following:<br />
<br />
Dyslexics of the world untie!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaythar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ssauron, when I read that the first thing that came to mind was the Bill Cosby story about &quot;Chicken Heart&quot;, and started laughing. Then when you put that anecdote about Billy Cosby at the end, I laughed even harder.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I think the same person that wrote my name in mascara on my parents' wall was the same one who got Kool-Aid all over your kitchen.:D</div></div><hr />
