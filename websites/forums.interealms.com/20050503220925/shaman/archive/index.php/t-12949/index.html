<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day, I was in a pickup PoI group near the zone in with a monk, sk, rogue, and cleric.  Monk pulled one, and just as it was approaching us another model popped and just before i was able to slow it, it killed the cleric.  The rogue immediately took off to the zone out, and the sk and monk were like saying 'ZONE, ZONE NOW&quot;  I looked at them, and looked at the zone out, and said to myself screw it, im staying to help out.  I got both of them slowed, and root parked one of them, while keeping both of them alive with spot heals.  By the end of the fight I was at 30 manna and a bit beaten, but everything was dead and the sk and rogue were still alive.<br />
<br />
My rant is this, why is it that other classes keep underestimating us when it comes to groups.  Yes we are good at buffing, debuffing, and slowing.  But its when sh*t hits the fan that we really shine.  In fact thats the time i most enjoy playing a shaman, helping the group to survive when the cleric goes or enchanter goes oom, or when we get multiple pulls.  Hell, there is a ranger buddy who i group with all the time and he intentionally brings two or more mobs because he has faith in my ability to control mobs dps, and healing abilities.  One time we invited a druid to help us out and when we got a couple of adds, the druid started  to panic a bit but my ranger friend said not to worry, we are used to this :)<br />
<br />
Luckily though, people are starting to recognize me when I group with them again, and they know that while im not the worlds best shaman, groups im in stay alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It all started when one well equiped, talented shaman soloed a dragon.  Every Uber wanna-be rolled up a shaman with starry eyes and wild dreams.  They powerlevelled to 60 and never learned how to use the abilities of their class or what their limits are.  Too many perceptions of the shaman class were developed from grouping with these losers.<br />
<br />
We're still waiting for the next uber class to make all those shaman reroll.  Enchanters almost did it but got nerfed too fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was in an IC group in PoV once and we were doing pretty well when the cleric had to log. No other clerics LFG so group was going to break up. I kept telling them that I could heal them and they kept saying, no we need a cleric. Finally they found a druid in another zone that was LFG and they agreed that I might be able to keep them alive until the druid got there for a few pulls. So they pulled, and I slowed and I healed and even dotted and nuked a bit, everything was fine. The druid got agro on the way and ended up dying and couldn't find a rez so I contnued to slow and heal for the group. My mana was fine, no one came close to dying and we were pulling as fast as before. After about 45 minutes of this and still only 5 people in the group with no other healer besides me someone said.. &quot;hey we still looking for a cleric?&quot; Answer: &quot;nope we are fine with the shaman, get another damage dealer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course the end of the story ends up with the puller getting overconfident and pulling 5 at a time and we ended up wiping..  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, best group I ever had was in Pov Back caves, 3 rogues, 1 bard, 1 sk, and little ol me to heal/slow/buff/etc .. etc.... They kept me pretty damned busy, lom, and swearing the next AA I'd be shooting for is canni 5 but we were pulling all of back caves and front caves at one point... 64 - 65 in a day anyone ? <br />
<br />
Perception tends to swing pretty fast  :p . When we started I was the one with misgivings about not having a cleric or secondary healer along.<br />

I've learned my limits, and am amazed how much for versitle I've become with the shammy added in. Personally, it's one of the best decisions I've made imo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Evil as trials are, I'm hoping they force a lot of crappy shamans to do just what cattywumpus said - reroll something else, and drag THEIR class through the mud.  Happily, after a couple of amazing saves, you usually have 5 or so new people in your fan club.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Back before PoP made us all too uber, I did a one group Hate run with myself as only healer, without a rez class.  That was interesting.  <br />
A well-played shaman can really do well.  But when **** hits the fan you'll want another support class to help out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, when nixx first soloed the dragon, he had all his spells, but his equipment seriously wasn't anything out of line for a 60 shaman.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it is pretty funny.  I was in PoD a couple weeks ago doing the stairs, and the enchanter went LD just as we pulled a couple of the mage guys on one of the landings.  And lo, there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth, but I just said,<br />
<br />
'ok, tanking #2.'<br />
<br />
And at the end of the fight, it was heard<br />
<br />
'Uber shammy &gt;&gt; Enchanter'<br />
<br />
Heh.  Yes, though, even though I wouldn't say shamans are the HARDEST class to play well -- I give that to Bard or Enchanter -- there's still a significant difference between a good one and a bad or even mediocre one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I enjoy getting three mobs inc, as it gives me something to challenge me.  The Bear comes alive and mobs go a-flying! <br />

I don't spend a lot of time LFG, when I log in  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Unfortunately I am not very good at CC myself. Mostly because having my wife play a chanter I never got to practice it that often. This is something I really would like to get better at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When we have several mobs inc, I'll normally target and root one before it ever makes it to camp.  Then, I'll slow another one, run him from the camp and root him out of reach.  Then, I slow the third.  by this time, the root has probably broken on the first mob (if not, slow him) and I hit him with VP to push him back, root and slow him again.<br />
<br />
The rest of the group are all taking care of the first mob to make it to camp (I get VERY cranky if they multi, as it tends to get clerics killed as they get too much heal aggro).<br />
<br />
It's all about pace and keeping your head.  A good Shammy can handle two or three mobs till his group is ready for them, easily.  Get the aggro, park the mobs and ready them for the melees, that's our job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>toradorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was in Nadox with a 53 necro the other day, we were pulling the Sentinel room into the hidden hallway by the zoneline. Most of the time we could single pull, sometimes we got 2. Then our pets were tanking, I was in the corner doing something, and the necro decided to sit over at the other end of the hall. Oops. Two badguys run over and start beating on her, she yells ZONE and hightails it out of there. She is gone into Gunthak, and I'm there with Dogdog debating on my next action. That hallway isn't that big, but I root one, run to the other end, root the other, run next to dog, slow both the adds, drop an epic on each one, tell the necro to get back in here and drop a couple more dots. Dogdog finished off the original mob, the necro came back and made a new pet and we wiped the floor with those guys. <br />
<br />
 But the fact the she zoned and I stood my ground and rooted and slowed was pretty funny.</div></div><hr />

I try very hard to do a good job.  I&#8217;m constantly using cannibalize II to keep my manna up and I do my best to keep everyone buffed and everything slowed.  But I don&#8217;t think I could do the kinds of things I&#8217;ve read in this thread.  Is it a mater of level and equipment or is it just me?<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m a level 52 shaman with K-Mart quality gear, no JBB, no epic, no horse and only a couple of spells that I didn&#8217;t buy from an NPC vendor.  I haven&#8217;t even been able to do the quest in the new zone for our fun new healing spell.  I do have run two and I&#8217;m working on run three.  Then I plan to go back to regular XP until level 60.  <br />
<br />
My experience is that my roots rarely ever hold, my healing spells hardly make a dent in the tank&#8217;s hit points and though my defense is nearly maxed the mobs in PoD drop me in two or three hits if given the chance.  I don&#8217;t have much money to buy gear, though not from a lack of trying.  But I do a great job at buffing and slowing, so I&#8217;m not completely useless.  <br />
<br />
Still, there&#8217;s no way I could do the things I&#8217;ve read about here.  I really am trying to do the best job I can, but sometimes it seems like I&#8217;ll never be able to do more than I&#8217;m doing now.  And I find it very discouraging at times.  I&#8217;m starting to think I&#8217;d be better of just soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You are probably doing just fine. At level 52 I would not expect you to be able to survive being hit by any PoP mobs for very long, no matter what gear you had. At level 65 i have to keep myself torpored against PoD mobs or I wouldn't last long, so don't beat yourself up over not being able to do that at level 52.<br />
<br />
As far as healing power you won't have too much of it until you get kragg's mending at level 58 and Tnarg's mending at level 62.<br />
<br />
It would be very hard to CC mobs in PoP at level 52. Now if you went to say Velks or KC you would probably shine at root parking CC and patch healing help when needed. But for the PoP mobs that will be hard until you get some levels and the gear, spells to go with them.<br />
<br />
* I remember when I first started doing the first floor spiders in Velks around your level. OMG I was constantly canning down trying to get enough mana to keep those mobs slowed and the group buffed. However when the puller goofed and brought in adds and we had no CC thats where i shinned by slowing mob.. running it to corner and rooting it away from the group. Of course then the mob would break root 30 seconds later and i had to do again and needed med time when we were done but I still saved the day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Calabar, <br />
<br />
Shaman REALLY start to shine at 60+, hence why some of the stuff you read here may seem impossible at 52.  Just keep at the grind a lil longer and you'll make it to 60 before you know it then you'll get to thinking to yourself, damn this is fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was level 52 about a month ago so I remember it very well.. your power increases exponentially as you hit level 60.. I don't have torpor yet but I still don't go below 60m and I nuke on a regular basis.. so I can't imagine how good it will be once I hit 65 and get qui.. <br />
<br />
Also unless you fight in dungeons a lot I would ditch getting run 3 until you get regen 3.. and get your sow boots if you don't have them yet.. I still use the level 14 root and it hold REALLY well.. (I haven't used any other root most because I was misguided into thinking they wouldn't hold as well so if you haven't upgraded your root do that as well) =]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Level52, and stomping around in PoP, you will get hurt trying some of these stunts. To push yourself and get a taste of the insanity some of us have grown to love, try taking on 2-3 mobs in places like Sebilis or Howling Stone, or even Velks.<br />
<br />
Root will break, but keep your head about you. Learn to pull aggro with slow or cripple or your dots. Learn to time your root spell on the mob, as you drag him out of camp. It comes with practice and keeping cool under pressure.<br />
<br />
levels and gear help though :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Stormaye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Just recently got 58th myself, and it's been difficult describing to my groups exactly how much mana I can generate...<br />
<br />
Puller: &quot;Mana?&quot;<br />
Ench: &quot;20m&quot;<br />
Mage: &quot;30m&quot;<br />
Necro: &quot;50m&quot;<br />
Shaman: &quot;Umm...FM, I'll try to nuke more.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I would say 55th is a big turning point for shaman strength, every level after that your overall strength probably increases by at least a quarter.  My advice:  Get stoicism before you do anything else.  Save up for a horse.  Get at least your epic booties, if not your epic.</div></div><hr />

At 52nd lvl in PoP, odds are you're gonna get smooshed often, it's a level thing. Slow will get resisted a lot, root will break early, your heal is pitiful for the damage that the mobs do. It can be fun but you aren't gonna be pulling off any miracles. Your best friend in that kind of a situation is probably mal-x (or an enchanter that isn't scared to tash early). Once malo lands, slowing isn't a problem, root will last longer, you'll basically own the mob. If you have too much trouble with resists on that, odds are you couldn't have slowed it anyway and would just have caught agro and gotten eaten. In a really tough spot, you might even want to load your best 2 malo spells and alternate em till one sticks. Go after the mobs one at a time; malo, slow to pull it off to the side, root it, and start on the next one. Also, depending on gear, maybe see about swapping out some wisdom gear for ac/hitpoints. 900 buffed ac should probably be a minimum for Tier 1 planes. <br />
<br />
If you want to do some fun crowd control at that level, take a group to Sebilis, Chardok, or the Hole. It's a lot easier when mobs are hitting for 140 max instead of 300 :-). I remember Protectors of Zek in Kael Arena being my person nemesis around your level. 3 or 4 deaths per trip was normal back then, and I still enjoy heading back there for payback! Make a list and get revenge once you get to 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">haha storm I have the same problem. I actually am forming a bad habit of NOT cannibalizing because it almost generates TOO much mana. Everyone else is at 20m while I'm full... even when I'm on heal duty, slow duty, and CC duty. I feel kind of guilty for not spending all my mana while everyone else has such a problem with it. I think that's the reason why we're such good soloers really. I mean, when you think about it, we have a pretty terrible pet, and even with the best DoT's in the game our DPS isn't that great... but we can solo so well because hitpoints = more mana and mana = more hitpoints... we can fight for the long haul. While other classes are running out of mana we're at 75% mana because we have an endless supply of it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: and in my opinion, the turning point for shaman uberness is level 58... they recieve their gimp CH then as well as canni 4 which unlocks massive mana. And of course we get the biggest saver of sucky pulls, Tirgirs. Prior to 58 our only job is basically Turgurs and buffs.<br />
<br />
Of course there are several notable marks post 58...<br />
<br />
Torpor (duh)<br />
True Spirit<br />
Cloud of Grummus<br />
that 64 root that I forget the name of<br />

thats just a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aemon Talishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Root parking has been a pretty standard part of my routine since god knows when.  i used to do it in the mid-30s in Sol B, in the 20s in Cazic Thule, in the teens in Splitpaw... PoP mobs are an order of magnitude different than run-of-the-mill mobs, but there's no reason why you can't be well-versed in the ancient form of shamanistic crowd control by the time you level 20.<br />
<br />
I recently started back into EQ and got my shaman and monk (2-boxing) both to 52 and i only start getting worried when i've got 4 mobs parked plus the one my monk is tearing down.  My equipment is mediocre at best (click my sig to see my magelo profile and my totemic greaves  ;) )... my shaman's AC is under 800 but i really don't have much trouble keeping both of us alive for hours on end.<br />
<br />
Both at level 50, i was camping the frenzy in L Guk with my duo and at one point had 3 dars and 2 xols aggroed from an unfortunate back-spawn.  said screw it, pulled them back instead of FD and finished out with 40m and my monk at 65% health.<br />
<br />
shaman CC just takes practice (i use instill or immobilize, btw).  go group up with a monk somewhere and have them pull 2 or 3 so you can get the feel for it.<br />
<br />
- If you're in an open area with few roamers, root one, have monk back up, root the next, back up monk, slow mob still beating on monk.  slow other 2 and get back to medding.<br />
<br />
- in a dungeon, can do the same as above if there's room, otherwise monk should /disc stonestance, you aggro 1 with slow, pull it away, root it, slow the one the monk is fighting, aggro other with a sup heal (he'll probably need it by now), root then slow and get back to medding.  <br />
<br />
the number of mobs a shaman can CC is basically only limited by the amount of space you have and the duration of your roots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I know what you mean.  I used to hate when ppl would run when we got maybe 1 more mob in camp than I could probably solo.  I got rather forceful about it with folks, demanding they dont waste heals on me, dont pull aggro off me, and dont question whatever the hell my dog may be doing.  In the end though its earned me a good reputation for being great CCer.  My guild is properly trained now and know what to expect from me.  Makes it fun surprising guests on raids, looking around for a bard or chanter, and find out only battle bear and Instill can save them.  I've played 3rd tank for my guild in HoT before as well with chain Torpor, and clerics think its just med time.  I think it just depends if you are an active or passive shammy.  If you've only played in groups, you dont know what your capable of, If you only solo, you don't know how to maximize mana by only doing what you need to.  I like my shaman best when I'm saving a group or raid by playing like I'm solo.  Its hard to find friends that'll put up with that, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The first thing to keep in mind is, retreat is not an option.  If you die, you die in place, corpse steaming.  (nothing pisses me off more than an early evac, when I've got the situation handled)  Next, go through your proven methods of crowd control, with a careful eye on everyone's HP's.  Interrupt yourself whenever you see someone's HP;s dropping fast, no matter how high it is at the moment...<br />
<br />
Enchanters do crowd control wearing nothing but some silk.  Bards do it while singing the Mackerana and shaking their booties....   So Bears gotta suck it up and show them how it's REALLY done  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I remember one time, we were in KC with a full group and there were 2 other groups with us at entrance, one being made of uber guys (they were all around 54 when the members of my group and of the 2nd group were around 45). Their enchanter kept on tossing C2 on everybody and making CC while all 3 groups were pulling and sometime pulled several. Then the uber group decided to go deeper in KC. 5 mins later, I hear one of them shouting &quot;Train to zone&quot; then I see them arriving with something like 6 mobs chasing them and they zoned. Seeing that, my group zoned as did the other one. I told to myself &quot;No way an ogre flee in front of dog guys when I'm more than 50 mana and FL&quot; so here I start : root, root, root and root again till they are all rooted. Now I quickly mem instill then refresh root with it. Slow them all. I'm now at about 30 mana. My party tells me &quot;Hey Klat, you ok, you want a rez inside ? We can ask the cleric of the other groups if you want&quot; and I'm like &quot;Hey guy, where did you all go ? Everything is under control here, all mobs rooted and slowed. Come back and tell the 2 other groups to come back and help us wipe the floor with the badies.&quot; They all came back and we wiped the mobs. They were all like &quot;Hey, how did you did that&quot;. Only I could answer them was &quot;A good shaman is not affraid to be beaten on my several badies if he is confident in himself&quot;. Even the chanter didn't understood how I could do that when he ran himself to DL. Now I have to admit, shouldn't I have been near zoning, then I think would I have tried to get all aggro on me then gated once everyone would have make they way to the zone.<br />
Now this happened at level 45, I don't know if I could ahandle such things at later levels).<br />
I still have to find a way to CC when I have several casters as adds (one is ok, just offtank it).<br />
<br />
<br />
Darkpaw, here is my basic method for CC : root one adds before it reaches your camp if you can. Slow main target. Then cast fast spells with large aggro (like cripple line) so that the mobs will soon come after you, root it far from the fight. Once everymob is rooted, slow them and refresh roots as needed. Generally, if a root brakes, the mob will be after you, so just go away from the battle and reroot it there. I can manage to handle up to 3 or 4 adds, keep my tanks healed and mobs debuffed. In KC I was able to handle more as when I CC'd them, I was alone so I didn't have to heal anybody (they all zoned) and all was undercontrol when they came back (with the enchanter who promptly mezzed all rooted mobs when he zoned in). But I can tell you this fight in KC was one those rare fights when I asked for a pause after (a short pause mind you, in general, when I'm asked &quot;Klat, mana ?&quot; my answer is &quot;Enougth, still haven't pulled more ?&quot;).<br />
<br />
One thing where I do agree with is tha we really shine when sh]t hits the fan. Hope this helps.<br />

My pet peeve is tanks who, when they see me running away from the group with a mob on my tail, break off to come &quot;save me&quot; from the big bad mob.  I'm just running it off to park it, no big deal.  I have 40% health?  eh, I'll get a torpor off when I get there, go mind your business and I'll take care of mine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I know that I am a young'un compared to you long-tooths but I have to agree with the underestimation. I have found that if no one panics, getting wiped should rarely happen. Besides, I don't believe in running. (Zoning to get rid of annoying adds in TM is a different matter  ;) ) I have found that I like playing Shaman the most since I am the best a buffs good at almost everything else. I don't group very often because of how little other classes know about my capabilities.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I know that there is far more for me to learn about the class. Are there any really good RECENT guides out there? I would like to know more about Crowd Control tactics and root parking.</div></div><hr />

The advice to the level 52 shammie is almost a separate topic now.  To add to that - GO GET STOICISM.  It is an easy quest at level 52.  go see the thread on the Spells forum, if you are unsure of how to go about it.<br />
<br />
52 is about the worst stage of a shaman's career as a healer.  Stoicism has the disadvantages of snare/slow, but at least it heals casters and yourself, freeing up mana for the spot heals you do have.<br />
<br />
Root parking - learn it, do it, practice it.  It is the key to the &quot;miracle saves&quot; shaman achieve, as much as the Turgur's is.  root off those melee mobs, let the group beat down the casters... etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Nakukak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Just recently got 58th myself, and it's been difficult describing to my groups exactly how much mana I can generate...<br />
<br />
Puller: &quot;Mana?&quot;<br />
Ench: &quot;20m&quot;<br />
Mage: &quot;30m&quot;<br />
Necro: &quot;50m&quot;<br />
Shaman: &quot;Umm...FM, I'll try to nuke more.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have the exact opposite problem  :( <br />
Whenever people call mana checks I'm always at about 25m, but that's enough for me to do whatever I want, and canni5 is close to repopping usually, so I just lie and say 50m, and yell at them to pull.<br />
People just don't understand how amazing shamans are  :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">the number of mobs a shaman can CC is basically only limited by the amount of space you have and the duration of your roots.<br />
<br />
I like that quote. I have to add something though - <br />
the number of mobs a shaman can CC is basically only limited by the amount of space you have, the duration of your roots and the stupidity of your &quot;pet&quot;. <br />
<br />
You know - it can be hard work to move dogdog around, especially in limited space, but that's nothing compared to some Ogres I know =D<br />
<br />
Oh, and I guess something should be added about casting mob. Not much point rooting them unless you can get them far enough away or round a corner.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Also, for rooting summoning mobs.. don't let anyone actually do any damage to it. Just debuff, slow and root it but no damage, if it takes damage it starts summoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">WOW!  Thanks for all the awesome advice.  I soloed for my first 38 levels, but since then I’ve been grouping with a friend who duel boxes a 59 ranger and a 60 cleric.  He’s an amazing player and I think that’s part of my problem.  The ranger has been root parking adds since long before I joined his group, so I haven’t done so since I soloed.  To say I’m out of practice is an understatement.  I see I’ll have to start working on that ASAP.  <br />
<br />
I guess the main reason I’ve not gotten Stoicism yet is because I don’t know my way around that zone at all.  I’ve been to the lighthouse a few times and I even ran to one of the ships with a group once.  But I couldn’t retrace my steps to save my life.  I guess I should just head out there and start becoming familiar with it.  <br />
<br />
My ranger friend has also spoiled me when it comes to being jumped on after casting slow.  He always snares the mobs and that ticks them off so much they rarely ever come after me.  And after my death to our first pull in PoD, when I was grouped with different friends, the wizard stared casting snare.  As soon as he did, as he started running around in circles with the mob slowly chasing after him, I’d cast Malosi and then slow.  By that time the fighter had its attention again.  I didn’t get attacked again for the rest of the evening.  <br />
<br />
I’m going to save this post so I can refer back to it.  I don’t really know any other shaman, so advice like this is really appreciated.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

Oh, one more thing.  Is Immobilize the best root spell to be using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Surly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Going back to the topic of this post, I really love when peeps underestimate our abilities...<br />
<br />
Shamans are the most diverse and well rounded class in the game, capable of doing many things well. Period.<br />
<br />
Whether in grps or in raids, shamans clearly play a very important role. That role is not easy, but very important to the overall success. If mobs dont get slowed properly and adds are not handled, it could mean serious consequences....<br />
<br />
I have been playing a shaman for a long time, and I also greatly enjoy it. We are the players that have to step up and take control, and truly the ones that shine are the ones who take that responsibility head on =). <br />

<br />
I either use that or just plain old root, depending on how long I want the root to last v.s. mana savings<br />
<br />
Note: I bet you'll get comments from higher level shaman saying they use Greater Immobilize or Petrifying Earth, which have resist modifiers, (but you won't see for another 10 or 12 levels!)<br />
<br />
Have a look at this thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=12438&amp;highlight=immobilize) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Yeah when I was 52 i decided to check out PoD and see if i could solo.<br />
<br />
my advice.. go somewhere else.  It's very doable if you don't get adds, <br />
even if I got 2 sometimes i could do em both but it would take FOREVER.<br />
<br />
they have alot of hp and if they resist slow your in trouble.<br />
<br />
sides i was getting 1% a kill.  went to Chardoc and got 1% a kill but it was twice as fast.<br />
<br />
but when i was in pod - I was a total WIS shaman.. had 255 unbuffed.<br />
crappy ac/hp.  fully self buffed was around 1800hp i think... don't remember but I have epic and a lezard.  now i've ditched alot of my wis gear for HP/AC ( self buffed around 2100 and ac 801).  and waiting on a GM smith to make me Tae ew tunic / legs.<br />
<br />
i'm back in pod again solo/group at 55 and with the new pet it's much easier. adds are still annoying but rootpark makes them not too hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">even the difference between 52 and 54 is impressive. I started solo'ing in poj at 51 and if i got an add, it was zone time. at 52, well, it was doable, but, get comfy, it's gonna take a while. Now at 54 i can tank one while rotting the other and handle a 3rd on ice with an occasional dot with ease. 5 mins total killing time on all three if they aren't the damn healing prisoners. as for tanking mobs in pop levels has it more than gear. although, I didn't have any problems slowing in pod/poi/pon at 49-53.. 54 is when i started getting the common resists.. i think it's because sony cackles when they watch me get 3 resists in a row and then the bst in the group is like &quot;i got it&quot; and the chanter points at me and laughs :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Virulent paralysis is like the super duper CC spell. Fun to use to.. Ive accidentally hit myself with it and i flew forewards...  Anyways sure you can keep a POV group alive solo. But its extra work and you can still easily get killed if something goes wrong. Go the ez way keep the cleric or druid.</div></div><hr />
