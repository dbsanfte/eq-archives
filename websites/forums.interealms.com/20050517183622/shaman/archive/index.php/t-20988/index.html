<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do they even have accounts?  If so, I'd say ask someone over there.  In any case, this board has nothing to do with eqshaman.com.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did wonder that myself :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just delete the cookie for the site then never log back into it if you do ever visit. No sense in having to actually delete the account not like it contains some super secret squirrel decoder ring needed info. /shrug</div></div><hr />

I popped over since you mentioned it Samanna and I still find your page infinitely more useful. I was sadly disappointed with eqshaman again and didn't see anything that would ever want to make me go back. I dug down into a few articles and they were nothing more than links to Allakhazam's, eqatlas, etc. A few of the old Belgar guides brought back some fond memories but that was about it. They still haven't changed their forum's link to clarify that they are linking to these forums and not their own like they said they would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">True. But it's better than it was when first announced - there are some guides and gear lists, but thanks, I think my pages are overall more useful as well.<br />

Current project is a chart with whom to hail after how many LDoN wins were. Please post at http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16699 if you can fill in any blanks. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luxor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just wanted to use my real EQ Shaman name for these boards and not an alt. I really enjoyed these boards back in August, 2001, when I last played and was glad to see them still operating.<br />
<br />
Thanks again!</div></div><hr />
