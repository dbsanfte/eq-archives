<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Busstah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's my deal, I'm dual boxing with a Paladin and was wondering what your opinions are as to what I should go for equipment-wise.<br />
<br />
If you had a Paladin tank would you:<br />
<br />
A)  Go for AC and pure melee ability?  Keep in mind my weapon sucks (Spine Chill Spear)<br />
<br />
B)  Go for pure wis, sacrificing any ac necessary to get your wisdom up 200+ or so, and just sit back, doting, nuking, buffing, slowing, hasting, etc. and never, ever meleeing (of course, sending pet in).<br />
<br />
C)  Combo of both ac/wis, meleeing some whilst nuking and/or doting.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm leaning toward option B.  It's kind of a bit of trouble to get my shaman in melee range while at the same time keeping my paladin going with his spells and such.  It can be done, but what I want to know is, is it worth it.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your opinions!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Look at it this way, it's easy to put equipment on and get your wis to 200+.   It's hard to get your shaman's def maxxed out, learn how to handle slowing while getting beat on, all the other things that make our class stand out, etc.<br />
<br />
Invest the time to make your shaman into the battle-monster he can be.  What happens when you die down in some dungeon and your 200 wis, paper armor shaman has to go marching down to drag your butt out?  Each level, spend some time with AC gear on &amp; let him tank to get defense increases, then put on the wis gear &amp; just sit around.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd go AC.  When dualboxing it's more difficult to deal with adds and so forth, and if the pally needs your attention for a few seconds the shaman can just take the damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go with the ac or the very least a combo of some wis and at least some AC. Eq is a world full of adds. I 2box shammy/warrior and warrior and pet are tanking the first an add shows up i slow it and it comes to me and with ac i am able to let it beat on me while the warrior and pet finish the first one or root park it. Second slow is going to get resisted sometimes and an unslowed add will really tear up a wis shaman. That extra wis you had wont be much good if your shammy is low on health alot and you cant cann mana back. If your going to sacrifice anything would think the melee skill wouldnt be so bad to not have if your 2 boxing but dont give up your defensiving ability for some more wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iynna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am new to shaman class ... picked up a somewhat under equipped shaman when a guildie retired.  At level 52, Iyanna (barb shaman) had never trained channeling or dodge and none of the specialities were above 100. Yes, that's right.  At level 52 channeling was zero!!!!   Now at 54 her channeling and alteration speciality (did the specialization reset quest) are now near or above 200.<br />
<br />
I duo the shaman with a level 58 monk.  As with most situations, it's all about aggro management, even more so since my monk's taunt button is broken.  If the only one that gets beat on is main melee, then go with pure wis/mana to maximize the mana pool for slows and heals.  This was my initial approach.  But slow gets resisted, adds don't like the monk getting healed, roots break and Iyanna gets beat on.   If a shaman has thin skin, canni's down some and then gets beat on, they can easily get into low life aggro and only death or root will return agro to the melee.  Thus, some AC is appropriate.<br />
<br />
I carry a lot of bagged gear and switch it out based on the situation.  If i get C2 before heading into battle, I can put on all my wis(232)/mana gear as part of the buf cycle.  When monky starts pulling, I switch out to my AC breastplate and other AC gear(wis about 200) so that I can take a few hits while the monk tries to regain aggro.  <br />
<br />
I don't have a JBB, but have obulus death shroud and coldain military wristguard and an FT1 earring all which helps out on mana.  Monk's role is clean single pulls.  Shaman slows (it's mob specific, but in KC basement I never debuf).  Based on monk damage given/taken, shaman DoTs with plague or bolt or both.  If a wandering mob adds, or I have to pull two to get a named, then monks pulls aggro on mob to be rooted.  Shaman Dots target mob, then roots, then monk switches to primary target and moves outta range of rooted mob.  All pretty typical stuff.  Shaman melees some, but primarily is a caster.  For me, combo AC wis/mana seems to be best.<br />
<br />
I have only used the shaman pet a few times. (have a beastlord so somewhat familiar with pets). Being my primary concern is always controlling aggro and pets often get in the way, I'm more comfortable without a pet.  If I'm at a fixed location and there are no spawns at that location, then I'm more likely to have a pet active.<br />
<br />
BTW, Monk/shaman duo is killer.  Monk gets in trouble on pull and  FD's.  Shaman stands and heals.  Outta range, put on supple scale armband (extended rangeIII) and try again.  Shaman low on mana, monk bind wounds shaman while shaman cannies.  Monk has first aid3 and can bandage up to 100% health at nearly 90hp a bandaid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A mix. Always mix it up.<br />
<br />
I find when I'm dual boxing it's very easy to keep my mana high. Could probably get away without casting Canni, but sometimes your shaman is just going to get hit... and when he/she does it's better if they don't instantly die (AKA Druid styles).<br />
<br />
At the same time though, tanking an unslowed mob isn't a fun game... and you need mana to slow. After that 5th or 6th add rolls in and you get a resist, you'll be glad you could squeeze out that one last slow.<br />
<br />
While having a Shaman die while they still have mana is a bad thing, having a completely OOM Shaman with full hit points isn't all that useful either.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Paladins are cool. Stun = The Taunt(tm). Plus I love a melee that can root park his own adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Busstah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Your points are well expressed and I believe now I have seen the errors of my initial thoughts.  I shall endeavor to go with a good healthy mix of ac and wis.  I'm wearing lots o' ry'gorr right now, so that will help i'm sure.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help and input!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">what level is your pally? i have a 60 rogue that I 2 box, and I get xp in FG, which is totally braindead-safe and easy. i don't really need the ac/hp, but then again - i don't need a big manapool either. I rarely go less than half mana, it's all in the mana regen and hp regen (for canni'ing), not the pool. so you might as well do a mix because being able to tank and not die is great.<br />
<br />
if your pally is in the 30's you'll be doing OT and later DL i guess, which is also very safe and easy with very few adds. still, it's so easy you just don't need a large mana pool, you're gonna have to med at some point no matter what (or regen or whatever).<br />
<br />
btw don't forget HP, i personally focus on HP, AC and WIS/mana, in that order.</div></div><hr />
