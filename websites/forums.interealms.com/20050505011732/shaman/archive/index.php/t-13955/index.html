<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My personal favorite is the monk shackle quest. There is a section where you have to take on guildmaster glox (solo). You do the turn in, and immediately are ported to some room where he tries to take you down to see if you really are ready.<br />
<br />
Now there are ways to do this &quot;Grouped&quot;, however that defeats the purpose of a one on one, mono e mono test, which is what this is designed for --- To see if the player is ready themselves to continue alone.<br />
<br />
I wish they did more quests like that that challenge the player, rather than challenge the players ability to get a bunch of people together and nuke a mob dead.<br />
<br />
What's your favorite?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, because this is EQ, my favorite quests are the ones with good rewards.

<br />
Yeah, the world of EQ doesn't like change. Most of all, it doesn't like it when players try and make a difference.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I thought the shaman epic had a great story. It was a very very hard well thought out quest until someone figured it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Another thing that bothers me about EQ quests are that there are so many broken ones.  If they aren't broken, then some of them haven't been solved in 4 years, which is doubtful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One of my favorite quests was the quest for the Grobb Cleaver.  SK troll quest that starts at your guildmaster, and leads you through a love story involving exotic places like Neriak Foreign quarter, and Ocean of Tears :)<br />
<br />
Awesome quest way back when the reward was decent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i liked the chardok ones, killing dreusuall 20+ times and never reciving a urn made it that much more rewarding when it finally dropped. I guess it was the 5 other folks that came to help &quot;everytime&quot; that made it fun too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Coldain shawl quest is pretty cool, so are the ring ones.  Lot of iksar quests are good as well, the Cudgel being #1 in my book, but the monk shackles and necro skullcaps also are good.  The SK Khukri is also an awesome quest.  Warriors and bst's are left in the dust unfortunately, not much to do there, though there is some storyline with it.  Also the shaman epic revolves around some iksar storylines, which makes it all the better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The quested Snare Necklace in Neriak is actually a series of three linked quests. The first one is a simple &quot;Collect 4 items off newbie mobs&quot; kind of thing and the third one is a combination of Fedex and killing a triggered mob. But the second one in the series is a lot of fun - if you don't take any shortcuts you even get to be a Hafling Shaman for a little bit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Coldain Insignia Ring Quest has got to be my absolutely favorite.  When the 8th ring battle goes on and you have no griefers in sight and the script works 100%... nothing compares!<br />
<br />
When the pack of dwarves run down to attack the giants and orcs it's almost like a scene from Braveheart... you just can't help but want them to win!<br />
<br />
This quest is still my most favorite quest no matter how many times I do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh yeah, and one more. The whistling fist quest turn in.<br />
<br />
I have not done it yet but I will do it solo like so many others and be crapping my pants while trying it.<br />
<br />
You have to head into fear, make your way right up to cazic thule and do your turn in.<br />
<br />
For human monks, they have to sneak up on cazic for the turn in. Youch!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I love eq solo. It is so much harder, but so much more fun IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">8th ring fight is a blast -- it truly feels 'epic.'  I loved the ring series of quests (though I only did through 9) -- was sooo disappointed when they slopped together the later shawl quests. :(<br />
<br />
I know many will disagree with me, but I also enjoyed a couple of the new LOY quests -- particularly PureBlood (did it for my shaman and cleric, and now working on my druid).  The mobs are interesting to kill, there are lots of 'toys' that can drop while you're clearing the areas, and the reward is awesome:  great spell and incredible experience (full orange AA experience at 62).  The 'luggald rumours' quest is also a blast -- collecting the flesh does get a bit tedious in Nadox though.  However, the final fight has a 'fun' feel to it -- much like the SK 50th level spell quest in RM.<br />
<br />
But my favorite quest?  Back in the day, before it was ever spoiled on any website, I puzzled through the Avenger Axe quest in Kaladim.  Back when teleports were unheard of, and it took a good hour to get from Kaladim to Qeynos, I puzzled through this and got lucky in Crow's bar.  Ended up trading off the axe, but the quest was great -- today it would seem trivial, but back then it was truly epic...  (sits back in his rocking chair and remembers the good old days -- or were they truly that good?  heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My favorite all-time quest has to be the one I am doing now to help my warrior friend, the Spirit of Grazicore. Nothing beats the Velious Skyshrine quests for good ole RP authenticy. Walk with the librarian in Thurg while he tells you tales of fallen dragons and watch him look through the bookshelves to find the right one for you. Kill an insane ghost in Crystal Caverns, speak to the unre****l spirit of the great dragon himself in Dragon Necropolis... the items needed to be camped have been fun so far, all camps provided loot and experience at 60 and none took more then 3 of us and a few hours at most. Now I'm not the one who needs to get their smithing to GM status to finish it, but as the support crew here it's been absolutely some of the most immense experiences of my 2 years in EQ.<br />
<br />
My previous favorite was the whisperling quest in shadeweavers thicket. At 60 I still sleep with my whisperling shield at night and hope some day to find away to make her stronger (the quest has never been solved to completion). Not only is the storyline awesome, but it gives you a free shield and 3 of your level 1 spells. Considering how poor a fledgling shaman is, getting spells handed to you is wonderful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Go ahead and smack me for bumping this oldie' but you haven't lived until you did the temple of sol ro rogue quest for the 'burning rapier'. Back in the day it was alot time taking boat rides all over the place and farming for hours upon hours in blackburrow and other zones to fill a 10 slot quest container.<br />
<br />
And then at the end I forgot to combine the quest container before handing it in! Bout crapped a brick, but stuck it out and did it again. Good times :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Interrogator's Badge (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1273) is the funniest quest I've ever done...<br />
<br />
an interrogator smiles and says, 'Well, I'm getting tired. Why don't you hit him for a while. Maybe you will be more convincing then I have been.'<br />
<br />
Attack him one time without a weapon. After a short time, he'll respond.<br />
<br />
Theodore Exanthem says 'Sweet father of rot, alright already! Stop hitting me and tell me what you want me to do!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My favorite quest element? <br />
<br />
Undoubtedly the 10th Ring War. The entire coldain ring quest is excellent, but the 10th Ring War is the highlight, as it should be. It's the most exciting and entertaining quest element I've seen - and it's also one of the best raids in the game, all in one. <br />
<br />
I wish like hell they'd put more good EVENT raids like that into the game, instead of endless variations on &quot;go beat down ubermob_174 and his guards&quot; for all subsequent raid content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I really liked the shield of bane warding quest myself.

<br />
IMO the final type of fight for every expansion should've been this type of event. <br />
<br />
Have one of these large scale war events for the ubers to kill the final mob for the expansion (a la Aten Ha Ra or such. Hell, they already have one for Vulak, but from what I know about it there is no storyline and it's just waves of mobtype_002 and mobtype_003, etc.); while simultaneously having 1 or 2 really long quests that resulted in a type of &quot;war&quot; for those who aren't hardcore raiders or who love tradeskills/quests.<br />
<br />
For the ubers the ring-type event would take the place of clearing lame generic spawns to the main raid target, and the event could have 4 random spawn types and placements per wave so you were never sure which type of mob was going to pop, or where it was going to come from.<br />
<br />
I'm done babbling, move along now plzkkthx :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The Grimling War is fun to muck about with. If you do that &quot;quest&quot; right you spawn a mob that drops a nice item for a newb. . . like a FT1 item or a haste item.  Or like most ppl, just do it for the shadowscream armor pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Test of patience is fun, is cool how every person that shows up tries to lead you astray. Abe even gives you an item to make you follow him. Have you tried casting vision on him when he takes off ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">... speak to the unre****l spirit of the great dragon himself in Dragon Necropolis... <br />
<br />
I can't believe the board censored the word u n r e s t f u l, LOL.<br />
<br />
I vote for the prayer shawl quests as the best ones that I personally have done (well, almost done), although the shaman epic is a close second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">65 levels, 2+ years, quested or camped almost every piece of gear I have, and what do I remember the most fondly?<br />
<br />
Luring Trumpy Irontoe out behind the bar so we could tear off his head (tough fight, too), and bring it back to the dwarves he betrayed in Kaladim.  Being rewarded with my (magic!!) bloodforge hammer, which I could finally take to the fabled wisp isle to make my fortune from GLS's (don't kill those bats and bugs!).<br />
<br />
There was so much still to be discovered then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">One of the coolest little quests was the one for the initiates symbol (summons a hammer).  I thought that was the shiznit back when I was under ten.<br />
<br />
I also liked the Binden Concertia quest.  It took awhile to get all the parts (earth was the hardest by far) but what a great item to have!  Not that I ever use the gate component.  hehehe.  but I COULD.<br />
<br />
I thought the Crown of Deceit was pretty easy, it only took me 3 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I get a bit of a kick out of the eighth shawl walk.  Decent drops for my guild and a great sense of accomplishment knowing that another person has finished that little bit of hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The Coldain ring quests or the epic. The shawls had a pretty weak storyline to tie them together, imo. The ring quests were a real feeling of accomplishment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I really liked the shield of bane warding quest myself.

<br />
My favorite, as well.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the part where the 8 skeletons all spawn at once.  I thought for sure I was going to screw that part up, but it went flawlessly and there was just something about a ton of skeletons making that skeleton attack sound effect at once that I found fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Coldain shawls and rings are my favorite, although the epic and Qeynos badges (among others) deserve honorable mention.<br />
When the pack of dwarves run down to attack the giants and orcs it's almost like a scene from Braveheart... you just can't help but want them to win!<br />
Yep :)  Once the dwarves attack, you can leave the area/zone and forget about it; whoever wins, the mobs will despawn either way and not be a nuiscance to the zone and fort campers especially... at least, that's what I'm told.  Whenever I do the quest, usually helping someone else out, I always slow as many giants as I can to ensure the dwarven victory.  It's completely unnecessary, but I think it's a good example to set for whoever's around to watch or participate.  It's too bad EQ has become like an arcade game without new content along these lines; it's what drew me to the game in the first place :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I remember there was a quest I think for dark elf rogues where one needed to go assasinate the daughter of one of the merchants in Freeport. That was one of the most interesting quests Ive done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just for the time I spent doing them, I would have to say the Totemic quests back when I was a young shaman (and they were still worth doing). <br />
<br />
I spent ages in the caves under Everfrost looking for that bear and avoiding that mean necro that runs around down there (still gotta go and pay him back).  To this day I still have my Totemic helm in the bank, I just cannot bear to part with it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">heh, it censored the &quot;s t f u&quot; :P<br />
<br />
I liked doing totemic quests as well.  The monk sash / headband quests are pretty cool.  Soulfire is also a great quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I really enjoyed the totemic quests as well, nothing like completing a full suit (even thought I had to buy the bark from grizzleknot from someone else since I couldnt seem to get it after so many days of camping it).  The big bear in everfrost for the helm had to be the best part of the whole thing, man that was exciting solo at 6am before I went to work.</div></div><hr />
