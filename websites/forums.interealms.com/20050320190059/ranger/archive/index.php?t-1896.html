<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wanerile Shadow</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:confused: <br />
I have a couple of huge issues (to me) with the release with the Everquest 2. <br />
<br />
First of all I would like to state that I have a PC that can currently Run Everquest 2 so I will be trying it maybe a month or 2 after it has been released, Ill see after I have read enough reviews.<br />
<br />
I have been a casual player of Everquest for the past year and a half; I play maybe once or twice during the week for 2 or 3 hours after work. And maybe a marathon on a Sunday if the weather outside is crappy. Or if I just want to veg-out after a party weekend…. (You get the idea)<br />
 <br />
Anyway…..<br />
<br />
The points I am about to make have to do with the value of the Items in Everquest.<br />
<br />
First of all you will not be able to take anything with your current character, items nothing.<br />
<br />
What does that do to the value of the Items that are sold on the open market? <br />
<br />
Uber-Items for example, Ill pick one for instance Tolan Armor 30K. (Depending on server)<br />
Now, let’s say I’m level 1. <br />
I am going to try to save that much PP and/or gain the level required to convince my guild or a group of players to camp this mob to acquire this item? Which in over a year the re-sale value will be........What? <br />
<br />
You tell me…come to your own conclusion.<br />
<br />
Id rather buy it, and hunt whatever I want to, however……….30K?  Yea right, /choke.<br />
<br />
Another point: To spend your time and effort to try to acquire the pp for the outrageous cost of a horse. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I don’t think I could play enough over the next year to make enough coin to buy a horse and get any enjoyment from it. Considering that the software developer DID NOT inform the consumer of the ungodly cost for a SOCIAL STATUS item. <br />
Please..........<br />
It does not even give you and tactical advantage in combat…So...***?<br />
<br />
I don't know about everyone else, but I bought the program, flipped for the expense to upgrade my computer (admittedly, I needed it anyway for other programs) to see my ranger ride a horse. <br />
Low and behold the only way you could afford a horse is by NOT HAVING A LIFE, OR JOB and Play Everquest, nonstop for I don’t know how long, to acquire this.<br />
<br />
My computer desk chair is not that comfortable, and I do have a JOB, and a LIFE, thankyou very much.<br />
<br />
Now, I know that I am over simplifying the issue, or am I? <br />
<br />
However, I hope you understand my point. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durgen</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">his seems more about EQ 1 than 2.  But other than that fact....<br />
<br />
The value of items is completely based on supply and demand.  And hence the perception of value in a virtual economy is largely based on availablity.  Low end (read: common) items suffer from rampant deflation, and middle and upper range items hold their value so long as the perception of value is there.  <br />
<br />
There are numerous other factors that go into this of course.  But those are the larger scale ones.  <br />
<br />
Common items are cheap.  Rare items are expensive.  And really rare items are just exorbitant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When EQ and Asheron's Call came out, they did not impact the price of rares in UO. And, in fact even today, UO still has about the same pricing for rares and certain other items as it did 3 years ago.<br />
<br />
Basically, as long as there are people playing the game and there are more people wanting item X than there are item X to go around, then item X will be worth something. Whether it's worth a little or alot is entirely an exercise in pure supply and demand.<br />
<br />
When EQ2 comes out I fully expect a large number of players to remain in EQ. Many just won't want to move and will be comfortable where they are. Others will play both games. And still others will leave the original EQ behind and never play again. But guess what? In addition to all that, people will still be signing up for EQ. Even now, 5 years after UO was released, they still get a certain percentage of entirely new subscribers each month. It's small but it is there. EQ will be no different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wanerile Shadow</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was misunderstood, I hope this helps explain my point of view:<br />
<br />
This has everything to do directly with EQ2, <br />
I do understand economics, thanks for the refresher.<br />
<br />
As I understand it Verent has created EQ2 is to correct some in-game problems that could not be corrected in the original EQ. If Verent is like ever other Software Developer I have worked for, they will stop supporting the original version to cut development/support staff, not immediately mind you, but they will. <br />
Example: Windows 95, Microsoft couldn’t correct the mutable problems with the OS so the developed another from the ground up, then dumped the support of Win95 even though Win95 was still in wide use.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the re-post. but it was applicable<br />
<br />
If I appeard rude or condescending in this post I will apologize in advance that was not my intention. I wanted to see if others felt the same way I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durgen</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose that is a perception issue.  Did verant create EQ2 to correct problem or to expand the franchise?  More than likely both.  <br />
<br />
Will they stop supporting EQ1?  I doubt it.  As long as there are enough people playing it to make it viable I still see that game surviving.  <br />
<br />
Will EQ2 effect prices of items in EQ1?  Possible.  But its an availablity issue.  If players quit their accounts in droves to go play EQ2 (or any other game for that matters) then the number of any givin item in the game will change.  Changing the availability can chance item price.<br />
<br />
Now to be a little less objective.  I look forward to EQ2.  I want to see how Verant takes EQ history forward.  I look forward to the changes in gameplay and hope they are postive ones.  And I can only hope they avoid the mistakes of EQ1 and other similar games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackguard</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The short answer: Nobody outside of Verant/Sony (or maybe not even them) knows if they will continue support for EverQuest.<br />
<br />
I guarantee you though, that if the amount of players remain that I think will (I'm guessing about 60-75%) they'll continue support on the standard EverQuest.  Verant is already a fairly large company, with multiple branches in two states.  They will most likely keep people on the old EverQuest team or hire new ones to run it, because if they're making money... well, there ya go.<br />
<br />
And EQ2 is not solely created to correct some problems with EQ.  Fixing everything and upgrading/adding everything they want to would require a full rewrite of EQ1, and it will be more profitable for them to just create a new game.  Also, while I'm not the biggest fan of Verant, they are probably trying to correct in-game problems as you said.  This basically means that they'll make it so twinking (which they likely never intended to have) will not exist, money will probably be harder to get at higher levels, etc.<br />
<br />
Of course you won't be able to take your items or character to EverQuest 2.  It is an entirely new game.  It would be like Mythic saying that you could port your EverQuest characters to Dark Age of Camelot; it's just not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
Playing enough over the year to purchase and enjoy a horse is just reflected on your style of play.  Yes, they are status symbols.  Why?  Probably because they didn't want to have so many horses running around the world that they would have to increase the system requirements even more for Luclin.  If you don't play enough to make that kind of cash, it's not the fault of Verant.  You may not have the time to play enough for that kind of money or you just don't play hardcore.  Power gamers get the best stuff.  It will always be that way.  Will you be able to afford land with a house if you're just a casual gamer?  I highly doubt it.  Why?  There is only so much land-area that they can let people build housing on, so it will have to be outrageously expensive.  Get yourself a guild full of casual gamers and buy a shack together.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, the cheapest horse is 10k plat.  This is pretty easy to get if you play the market a little bit in  EC (on the Rathe that's the trade zone).  At level 10 with about 5 plat of startup (when I switched servers, so I already had a grasp of the market), I managed to make 10,000 plat.  It's not that hard, it just takes some effort and patience.  And this took me less than a week of playing about 4 hours a day.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I don't know how you are trying to associate the release of EverQuest 2 with the market/economy in EverQuest.  Did Dark Age of Camelot make the market crash when it came out?  No, and it sold more copies than any other MMORPG ever in its first month (as compared to any other game's first month).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sorronn</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's look at things here...<br />
<br />
EQ came out and rocketed to top spot in player subscriptions for online games. UO had around 120,000 subscribers at that time. UO still has around 120,000 subscribers last I checked.<br />
<br />
I really expect EQ to remain viable for a couple of reasons:<br />
1. It will play on lower end hardware than EQ2<br />
2. Some people won't want to do the leveling game again.<br />
3. Some people won't want to break friendships made in game and will thus continue to play.<br />
<br />
All of the above should ensure that EQ will remain a viable revenue stream for years to come. EQ2 is simply a different revenue stream and hopefully (Verant and Sony hope this, I am sure), a bigger revenue stream.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really hope that VI keeps these things in mind-- EQ has become a bit more than &quot;just a game&quot; and in fact has allowed people to forge significant friendships, causing some to accuse it of being a &quot;glorified chat room&quot;.  Regardless, I think there's a social decency issue involved.  I agree with you 100%.</div></div><hr />

I see farming and exp grinding reducing slightly, as well as the desire to buy gear reduce slightly, since you'll only have it for a set time. But when people quit, they aren't going to sell off all their gear for plat, nor spend all their plat on gear. I doubt most will give it away, because they don't know if they'll be coming back. All that happens is that a portion of the people, cash and gear leave the game. Same amount per capita as before.</div></div><hr />

As for the price of the horse, yousaid it yourself, it's a *social status*. The price of any social status is always high. Do you see any low priced Ferraris out there?</div></div><hr />

Eh, wouldn't the same situation be the same when they shut down EQ some day? I mean, you didn't expect EQ to last forever did you? EQ will decline, whether because of EQ2 or some other MMORPGs that comes out in the future.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing that I disagree with about your statement. <br />
It is about time and money spent thing to me.<br />
Also, I feel that I have been misled to by Veriant (about the horse thing). <br />
I'm not taking it personally, I think they misled all their clients. <br />
<br />
And in a fine American tradition I am stating my grievances in a public forum to see if there or others that feel the same way I do.<br />
<br />
Don’t get me wrong I still have fun role-playing my ranger. (she’s my girl) But this last product was a huge disappointment to me, as I’m sure you can well understand.<br />
<br />
My Point is this, and I believe this is one that Veriant would agree with me upon. <br />
This product should not be catered to a select few (the elitist snob type as it were). <br />
It should  appeal to everyone.<br />
You see, it means more PROFIT.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think that’s why many of the founders of this product left to work on other projects. <br />
It got all too corporate for them.  <br />

How did they mislead you about the horse? They said that horses are a status symbol and that they would cost a lot which are both true. What was misleading about that? Sorry, I still just don't see your point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wanerile Shadow</div><div class="date">05-01-2002, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I had read that also. <br />
<br />
The grievance is that the cost of the horse was not specified before the purchase of the product. <br />
Remember I shelled out the 30-35$ for the application. <br />
I shelled out, 3-400$ for the upgrade for my PC, just so I could enter Lucian. (well, not just for that)<br />
<br />
My assumption (and no, you don’t have to tell me the effects of assuming) “allot” would be 2-5k respectively. <br />
Nowhere was a starting and ending price for the cost of the horse listed before the release of the product.<br />
<br />
In the year and a half that I have been playing, I have never seen a non-magical item, sold by a vender,  that would lead me to believe that 100,000k would be the price tag for it <br />
<br />
(ok low-end 10k, but still).<br />
<br />
I paid my money in good faith for the product to see my ranger on a horse. I expected the Item to be “reasonably” costly.<br />
<br />
I pay the same amount as everyone else to access the servers, (well less than some suckers) because of that alone the casual player should not be singled out by making the cost of an item unreachable. Simply because she/he doesn’t play Everquest in all the spare time that they have.<br />
 <br />
Does that help?<br />
Please, say yes……… <br />
I don’t think I could make it any clearer.<br />

Right, so you assumed even though it was said that it would cost a lot of plats and not everyone will be able to afford it. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

And your point is? <br />
<br />
Since both of their claims are true, they are not misleading anyone. You assumed wrong even though they said otherwise. That's your own fault, not theirs. Nobody in their right mind would think status symbol + a lot money + meant to be money sink = a few thousand plats.<br />
<br />
Should I say Rolex are misleading people because their watches are status symbols and cost a lot of money and when I go to the store I see that the price of the watches are beyond my budget? Get real.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wanerile Shadow</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">However, with Rolex or any product you buy you can at least see the price of the purchase to determine if you can afford it. Or would you just hand over a blank check hoping you could cover it. <br />
I disagree, It was the fault of Veriant for not providing the exact cost of a horse, to their clientele before they purchased the software Shadows of Lucian.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheBigToe</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its Luclin not Lucian.. I only mention this becuase I like to make at least one hypocritical typo correction a week.<br />
<br />
Verant said, before the release of Shadows Of Luclin, tht horses would be expensive and mainly used as a status symbol... you figured a cuple thousand plats... which is what Centi Longswords, full suits ov Ivy Etched armour, and various other things cost that ARE NOT status symbols. Verant never mislead anyone about the cost of horses, you mislead yourself. Verant did mislead us, over the course of dishing out the the hype about SoL, on the following ;<br />
a) The Bazaar : On the back of the box<br />
b) New Interface : On the back of the box<br />
c) Epic Armour Quests (This was mentioned earlier on but was never officially mentioned as scraped. If no one else but me remembers this than ignore it)<br />
d) Visible Cloaks : Not officially anounced as cancelled untill AFTER the release of Luclin but repeatedly shown in screen shots before the release.<br />
e) That EQ2 would be an evolution of the current EQ into a new game without the need to purchase a new game. How? They said that Luclin basically makes EQ EQ1.5 thus giving the impression that they were not going to develope a seperate sequel project. (Once again, if no one else but me remembers this than ignore as I do not have a link to proove my case)<br />
<br />
You made an assumption based on a lack of information and a poor understanding of what status symbols cost. It happens, get over it. There was no misleading of anyone about the horses only The Bazaar and the new interface, those are things to be angry about, not the prices of horses. <br />
<br />
Why would horses be cheap anyways? New inventions are always expensive especially ones aimed at the social elite, nevermind the fact they are being manufactured on a stellar body by moon people. The cost of horses is probably to offset the costs of advertising them to a market demographic on another planet AND to help offest the costs of maintaning a free and publin transit system between moon and planet. Heck, research and devolpment costs on a horse alone must have been brutal, its a surprise that Shadowhaven did not bankrupt itself in the process:D <br />
<br />
As for the costs of items... it will depend on the demand like everyone else has said. Some items could actualy go up in price due to new found demand. i.e. PC crafted items could go up in pirce if a healthy subscription based remains due to the fact that so many items that are currently common will not be being farmed to death anymore. However, thats just my theory though<br />

<br />
SMED SPEAKS OUT ON EQ2, MAY 3, 2002<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of people have invested an incredible amount of time in EQ, and we understand and respect that. We're not going to reward that by turning off EQ in order to get everyone to play EQII&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, Ill keep my account.<br />

Finally someone has brought up some valid points to complain about. Horses in every article I read before release said they would be expensive and not everyone would afford them. Hell, they even said they really would add no real benefit to gameplay. They were mere status symbols. I just thought it would be nice to see them running around now and then. <br />
<br />
But to expand you some things Big Toe expressed, if you all remember, when Kunark was getting ready to come out, Verant at that time also said that we could expect horses to be added then. They also said before Velious that horses may be added at that time. Never happened.<br />
<br />
As for EQ 1 coming to an end at some point after EQ 2 is released, it's a certainty. Maybe not quickly, but i bet within 2 years it will be gone. First thing to go will be the number of servers. They will need them to help support EQ 2. So we will see characters from different servers be clumped together. Kinda the reverse of how they added new servers.<br />
<br />
Following that, we can expect to see any new content added to the game basically stop. What they leave as the downsizing starts will be a skeleton staff to handle EQ 1. Most of the people staffed for new content will be put on EQ 2. (Remember that when advertized, Verant said EQ 1 was a;ways changing and with stuff constantly added).<br />
<br />
I've seen it before with Kesmai and their game Air Warrior. They released AW 2, and AW 1 theatres were closed one after another until their was maybe 5 total out of a once 18 or so. Within a few months AW 1 was history. AW 3 went to beta and they were closing down AW 2 theatres before it ever got outta beta.<br />
<br />
Look at Ultima Online. When UO 2 was in development, the powers that be realized that they could not operate both UO1 and UO2 and be sucessful. It would stretch their resources. But most important, they realized that the 2 games would in essence be competing against each other. They decided that it would be better to just keep UO1, and to just improve it. That way they also would not risk loosing subscibers in the process. Thus they cancelled all work on UO2 and have just added new stuff to their primary game.<br />
<br />
Well Verant has never seemed to be concerned with what they do and how it may affect their subscibers. Look at Luclin and how they &quot;did not realize&quot; that Win95 users could not play the game any more because Win95 couldn't run the new DX-8. They simply feel that they need to stay on the forefront of the latest technology, regardless of how it affect their subscribers. The poor people that played EQ for over 2 years with Win95 and all Verant would say was &quot; Whoops...gee we didnt realize...I guess everything you worked for was for nothing. Oh but we will hold your characters for 3 months to give you time to upgrade.&quot; They knew and didnt care. Screw the subscribers in the name of their own progress. Its their vanity for feeling they must be on the cutting edge all the time. <br />

I thought I would never get through to anyone who thought the same way I did &lt;siff&gt;, ok I feel better. <br />
(All kidding aside)   <br />
The content of your statement is accurate to what I wanted to express. Thanks for taking the time to reply. It was a real compliment. This is an important issue that should not be dismissed.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else?</div></div><hr />

I left without any intention of returning.  But I did.  Both for the social aspect I was missing but also cause of the graphical make over.  Keeping the game as reasonably up to date as possible is a smart move on Verants part.  New players dont want to play a dated game.  Even some current players didnt want to (and hence have moved on to other games that are either out or comming out).  <br />
<br />
It would be nice if computer technology was just magically so advanced that what ever you have right now for a computer was all you would ever need.  But that just isnt the case.  And it wont be for quite some time I imagine.  The comptuer and software industry only continue on the concept of making something better and hoping that people will want the new and improved gear.  And most people do want the new and better computer.  Some are just resentful they cant afford it.</div></div><hr />

After I posted the above grievances, I have been riding the fence about playing this game, and the more I thinking about it, the more I have stayed away. <br />
I mostly play Everquest when I have completed all the games I wanted to try, and there is nothing better available. <br />
Simply because Everquest is not that great of a game, average in most respects. <br />
Somewhere along the line I think they lost sight of the original concept. <br />
They made it to too difficult to retire a character and move on. <br />
What would have been more interesting would have been something that TSR tried to do with D&amp;D and their 40+ characters, either retire them, or force them to ascend to a demigod status where platinum or “things” have no value. <br />
But that would require that the character would have to acquire some notoriety among his/her peers, like slaying the sleeper alone or something like that. <br />
I think what stops Everquest from being a great game is that your character has no chance of ever achieving the HERO status that every role-playing game provides for you. <br />
There is no real sense of accomplishment. <br />
Nothing changes due to your actions. <br />
The bad-guy doesn’t really die. <br />
You don’t save the world. <br />
You don’t become the hero. <br />
<br />
The following question is for the true Role-Players:<br />
Correctly me if I’m wrong, but aren’t those your real aspirations for role-playing? <br />
<br />
Instead your accomplishments are shown only in the things that you acquire. As a status symbol for instance…..Pathetic.<br />
<br />
The only reason that the horse that was made so expensive is so you have to spend your 13.50? A month for as long as it takes to acquire it. <br />
Now, they can’t tell you that it is because the want to keep their revenue up, oh no, nothing so honest, what they do instead it they give it bull**** label. And people fall for it. <br />
<br />
Sorry for being such a wet-blanket, but this is just what I think.<br />

Absolutely true.<br />
Thats just the reason i quit for a long while, and now eagerly looking forward for next weeks release of Neverwinter nights.<br />
<br />
You dont become a hero in a mmorpg where beasts respawn and 50% of your class/lvl carries the same type of equipment<br />

One of these situations is casters sitting to med. A caster sitting on the ground gains hate and agro. A caster sitting on a horse gets no more agro then they would standing. Just a thought...</div></div><hr />
