Talisman + Individual Buffs are now better than HoS.</div></div><hr />

/cry<br />
<br />
But but...I don't have clicky JB armor :( <br />
<br />
This sort of made buffing raids for the right-click challenged Iksar a bit of a pain ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Good question here,<br />
<br />
What is more effecient?<br />
<br />
HoS or Talisman Altune/str/dex for the 49-54 Shaman?<br />
<br />
HoS or Talisman of Kragg/Str/Dex for the 55-59 Shaman?<br />
<br />
Guess its time to check the spell list and run some numbers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If melee wants the best buffs, it's back to the way it was before Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">JB items were basically only for soloing and buffing my pet, I'll still be using HoS on raids and groups till I get focus.  With the long cast on JB items, I don't have time to buff a raid or a party this way.It sucks, but it was a long time coming IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Tarthug.<br />
<br />
The only JB item worth it, is of course the JBB, the rest of the effects on the gear I never really use because of the long casting delay and I like to use the best buffs available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bah, just hit um with Hos and forget about it.  I never stacked up HoS much anyhoo and when I did it was always a request for MD so someone could proc more.<br />
<br />
What I REALLY want to know is if PR+Shadoo+Epturation got caught.  Was nice getting PR well over 300 self buffed :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isnt Talisman of Epuration a DR buff?  I also didnt know you can stack Shadoo and PR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">PR/DR stacked with their group counterparts. I think you had to do the group one first then single target so it did seem like a bit of a stacking exploit. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised at all if it was changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Epturation is +55 to DR/PR if I remember right.  Think the whole stack gives ~+140 or so.  Oh yeah, DMF could be heaped on that as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Doh, my bad, Just saw that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm still waiting for the bard stacking exploit that stacks FoS and Khura's together.  It can affect others too, and not just the bard.<br />
But bards usually keep it between the shaman and him/her.  A bard is going die regardless of the extra hp if agroed bad enough.  As it's cool having the MT get some extra hp... it's flakey.  All it is, is more extra needless buffing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">You don't need a bard to stack Focus and Kragg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I love the sucky buffs from the JB armor.   When you have 4 groups and about 15 melee types and your the only shaman nothing beats mana free buffs.<br />
<br />
Who cares about the cast time.  Try HoS for 15 and then buffing them up and then see if you don't change your mind.<br />
<br />
Melees just like to see there spell slots full of buffs. They don't care if they the lvl 51 buff or the lvl 45 buff as long as there is a buff in the slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Focus and Kragg was fixed I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Agree with that, Wally<br />
As the third or fourth shaman on a raid, I make it a point to keep working my way through the melee's who are not buffed up to be main assist or second assist.  The rangers all love me!  <br />
Whenever we are not moving, I have the jb armor glowing.  <br />
<br />
This patch may change that, though - we will see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">kinda scary to consider buffing a raid party with JB armor. Just give them the group stat buffs and send them on their way. <br />
<br />
most melee can survive with just HoS.  If you have a particularly hard mob you might put the good stuff on the Main tank for that fight.  By the time you are hitting the really nasty stuff you will have some 60 shamans equipped with the focus line.  Depends how much work you really want to make for yourself though.  Some shaman enjoy keeping everyone buffed to the hilt. /shrug<br />
<br />
My take is to do whatever it takes to help make the raid work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Krytog - fair point, but the group stat buffs are what, level 57/58?<br />
<br />
JB armour works from level 45, and for us lower levels the mana saving is worth the extra time spent buffing. (No Torpor, no fungi)<br />
<br />
However, what would be really cool, is if the group stat buffs were reduced in level to the same level as the single target version. I don't see this being unbalancing, or upsetting higher level people the way Lesser Bear Form did, as it's really just a convenience issue.</div></div><hr />
