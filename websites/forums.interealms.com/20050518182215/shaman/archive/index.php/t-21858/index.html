<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now, I know my gear is considered &quot;above average&quot;, but for a shaman, on a raid, do you really need more than 15 buff slots?<br />
<br />
If so, what are taking up those slots?<br />
<br />
Typically, I get by with:<br />
<br />
1) Focus<br />
2) Kazad<br />
3) 9<br />
4) BSS<br />
5) VoQ<br />
6) SD<br />
7) Resist buff (whatever is needed for the event)<br />
8) Another resist buff (space holder... might need more than one)<br />
9) Maybe a regen, SOW, uhh... SoP if I'm meleeing?  VQ - same reason?<br />
<br />
Stamina is capped.  Agility is useless.  Dex/Str capped with Focus (no need for diaku... what a useless spell).  Regen doesn't mean poop when you get AEed for 2Ks or meleed for quad &gt;2Ks.  Bard songs typically go to short-buff window...<br />
<br />
So, STRETCHING it, I'm at 9, maybe 10 buffs.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something?  Might have overlooked a buff I commonly use... so let's go LIBERAL and say I use 12 buffs slots on a VERY bad day... <br />
<br />
13) I get hit with an AE dot/effect... <br />
14, 15) AE heals.<br />
<br />
Boom.  Done. 15 buff slots was ample.... am I the only person that will NOT be spending a single AA on MORE buff slots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As a Shaman I've found I rarely have more than 10-12 buff slots full on a raid. Some buffs just aren't needed by Shaman, but a tank class tends to use more buffs, so they are usually close to/are full buffed.<br />
<br />
I like to leave room for those AE's so they don't overwrite something I need. Tank classes probably have it much harder to not have an important buff overwritten. Like keeping 2-3 junk/less needed buffs in the first 3 slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For me, add Bramblecoat, SoW (if applicable), cleric spell haste, Pestilence Shock and human illusion!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only fight I seem to run out of buff slots on is Quarm because of the multiple resist buffs, MGB heals and stuff, but I usually just click off SoW and MGB haste and im fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Come to Uqua...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Jaeydee, the combination of your &quot;come to Uqua&quot; and your &quot;reachy&quot; sig pic is seriously wigging me out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't know from Quarm, but here's what I wear for a typical LDoN, with a Pally tanking and any four random DPSers. Normally, there will be a pocket Chanter and maybe a pocket Cleric. So normal starting buffs:<br />
<br />
&lt;TABLE BORDER=&quot;0&quot; WIDTH=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD WIDTH=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;http://morelight.org/samanna/ldonbuffs.jpg&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;<br />
Hand of Virtue, Focus of the Seventh<br />
<br />
Brell's Stalwart Sheild, Acumen of Dar Khura<br />
<br />
Koadic's Endless Intellect, Blessing of Replenishment<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Boar, Spirit of Bih'Li<br />
<br />
Guard of Druzzil, EDIT: Aura of Reverence [Thanks, Gloriana!]<br />
<br />
Group Primal Essence, Qiessence [okay, not always up, but I need the slot]<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Wrulan, [blank slot for Tash]<br />
<br />
BoVie&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;<br />
<br />
Note that I had to click off Bramblecoat (instead of Agility - oops) to have an empty slot for Tash, and I routinely click off Strength of the Daiku and Vallon's Quickening because they add no value. Nine over Virtue (especially with Kazad) is great for the MR, but with Virtue lasting for like four and a quarter hours (with a shawl)... gotta go with it. <br />
<br />
And I'm CONSTANLTY clicking off dog-head buffs from Rangers. SoT is okay for the buck-twenty-five HP when no Pally is around, otherwise it's a nuisance that blocks Brell's, or just takes a slot up.<br />
<br />
On a raid, there's all the resist buffs, too... Seasons or Tribunal and DMF. Sometimes we need Lev...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">1) Shield of the Eigth (or tallon's balance!)<br />
2) Clicky SoW boots (or planeshift!)<br />
3) Bramblecoat<br />
4) Pestillence Shock<br />
5) Koadic's Heightened Focus<br />
6) Focus<br />
7) Virtue<br />
8) VOQ<br />
9) SD<br />
10) Brells<br />
11) Seasons or Tribunal, depends on the mob<br />
12) Guard of Druzzil<br />
13) Breath of Trushar<br />
14) some AE<br />
15) Another AE, or Earth elemental illusion!<br />
<br />
16-20 would allow me to use crap like vie, keep haste and SoP for laying the own down with my sharkspine, and MGB heals of joy.<br />
<br />
a tank looks like the following:<br />
<br />
1) Clicky something. let's use coldain ring<br />
2) Another clicky. Jboots?<br />
3) Haste<br />
4) Virtue<br />
5) Brells<br />
6) Focus<br />
7) Divine Intervention<br />
8) unfailing Reverence! woot<br />
10) Bulwark of Vie<br />
11) Spirit of the Preadator<br />
12) Protection of Seasons/Tribunal<br />
13) Guard of Druzzil<br />
14) Ferine? I dunno. actually a HoT should probably go here<br />
15) Mage DS. crap where's the AE going? probably will overwrite virt :/<br />
<br />
that currently means a tank needs to probably click something off to have room for a heal over time. 9/kazad/wog leaves a tank pretty cramped for buffs. I could probably see 9/kazaad usage become more widespread if there's more buff slots.<br />
<br />
now regarding DEbuff slots, a mob's gonna look like this:<br />
<br />
1) Malos(inia)<br />
2) Tash<br />
3) Cripple<br />
4) HoS<br />
5) Slow of some sort (sometimes)<br />
6) Hand of Ro<br />
7) Eci<br />
8) uh... that other druid fire one<br />
9) Shinai proc<br />
10) Vazanir proc<br />
11) incite<br />
12) Some SK who thinks he's funny by casting ignite blood<br />
13) Cessation of Cor! you know you love it!<br />
14) Mark of Retribution<br />
15) Mark of Karn? I think people bother with it<br />
16-20) Ornate greatblade, Wicked Shank, Rotting Fist, and Obsidian Scimitar procs<br />
21-30) Spell slots actually available for the necros/shamans on the raid to use for DoT spells, but they end up getting used up by druids using epic/MM Sword/TT orb clickies.</div></div><hr />

How about giving us something useful....say two more SPELL GEMS!!!  Think about it...two of our spell gems are used basically for our active mana regeneration (Canni4 / Quies)  Throw shaman a bone since they are THE ONLY CLASS that requires ACTIVE mana regen...unlike the many other PASSIVE mana regen classes out there...</div></div><hr />

10) Cleric spell haste<br />
11) Regen<br />
12) Reserved for HoT's<br />
13 - 15) You'd be surprised how many spells mobs can cast<br />
<br />
However, my last raid was a Grummus hit while playing my Beastlord.<br />
<br />
1) Bih'Li<br />

15) Stinky DoT<br />
<br />
That's on a 55 beasty, nothing special.<br />
<br />
An extra five buff slots would only be useful to be filled up with mob spells. I mean, the only way to use up all your slots with helpful spells is to pop off single buffs.<br />
<br />
Edit: Jeesh, forgot about things like DS and Vie and all. Guess I've been out of the loop a little too long :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't dispute that melee could use more buff slots - I was thinking about shaman specifically.<br />
<br />
My point is that for the average shaman who would even consider investing AA in such an &quot;ability&quot; over putting it in the core AAs (MGB, Can5, etc) doesn't need the extra slots.  I.E., the shaman that have completed their core AAs and are now looking for &quot;what's next&quot; don't need the slots normally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't think extra 5 buff slots should cost ANY aa's at all.  Why make us pay for design mistakes even if they are rooted in designs from 5 years ago.<br />
<br />
I would be more willing to pay AA for extra spell gems, but it'd be better if SOE would look at how many spell gems WoW casters get... (hint: it's alot!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman don't need anymore, but I personally don't think this should be covered under AA's. With new spells coming out every Expansion, I do find myself having to click off buffs I don't need in order to recieve buffs I do need. Considering that everyone MGBs at the same time there is a possibility that you are gonna get things you don't want and miss out on things you do. For this reason if no other, I believe that buff slots should be raised. As for the AA part, fthat! the code already exists, just make it a patcha nd be done with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Folks adding in Regen, BoV, CoR, Sta, PE, etc - aren't really in the situation that I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
The Shaman that have capped Sta (no need for Boar or PE), know that the regen isn't going to help anything, wouldn't need CoR anyway, etc.... that was kinda the target for my question.<br />
<br />
But, I see where some of the lower level shaman still might find it useful to get more buff slots... so in a way I got two answers to my question.<br />
<br />
I hope they don't make it an AA then, for the sakes of those who will need or get use from it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not everything you don't like is a design flaw.  The number of available buff slots is a balancing issue.  More buffs = more powerful players, not matter how big the effect of the extra 5 buffs.  EQ has changed a lot in 5 years, and apparently they've decided that the extra slots wouldn't be overpowering.  I don't think having to work a little for that benefit is that outrageous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Yes, yes you need more buff slots.  Jaeydee is dead on.  Come to Uqua.<br />

7) SD<br />
8) Vie<br />
9-11) Resist buffs (GoD, ToT, Seasons--that's for all our lovely new resist checks for prismatic and chromatic)<br />
12) clickie buff (+5 mana regen for me)<br />
13) strength of the daiku (btw, uqua is -200 all stats--see #15 below)<br />
14) PE<br />
15) AE#1 (permanent in uqua until you turn it off or get a certain item.)<br />
16) AE #2 (some mobs have AE)<br />
17) MGB heal<br />
18) MGB paragon<br />
19) Regen<br />
20) WoG<br />
<br />
That's 20 right there.  I am assuming no melee stuff (no haste, FA, CoP, etc.).  That's a purely defensive set up with max mana regen and max ac.<br />

So....I'll be buying more buff slots.  I'm too stubborn about what I like to have up to click stuff off (unless it's for the ol three headed scaley), though I'd be happier if they were free.<br />

On some fights, such as TZ in time, you have to leave up to 4 slots open to take mob spell effects. If you dont, you might find some critical buff, such as virtue, being overwritten. I've been killed on more than one occasion by some well meaning buffer clogging up my buff slots with unwanted buffs during those sorts of fights.<br />
<br />
Critical must have buffs are:<br />
<br />
Virtue<br />
BSS<br />
Focus<br />
VQ<br />
DI<br />
CHA<br />
Form of endurance<br />
Voice<br />
<br />
After that situational buffs include:<br />
<br />
BoV<br />
SS<br />
PoC<br />
Resists (various)<br />
<br />
Stuff you want if possible:<br />
<br />
Damage shields (I use 2)<br />
<br />
Basically, after you are done with all that you have no space left. Ranger and BL buffs are deleted as soon as they land, as are things like FA, regen etc. Some fights have specialized requirements, TT in time for example makes STA and sometimes STR buffs usefull to have. Top that off with the need to have open slots to accept debuffs or HoTs, and you often have to start making hard choices about what you are going to drop.<br />
<br />
oh, and let us not forget gnome form  :p</div></div><hr />

The problem is when you have to leave empty slots for Qui, AE's with icons, and other debuffs.   Nothing is more aggrevating than having your Kazad or PotN killed by a simple Tash cast on you when you are out of buff slots.</div></div><hr />

They said they would never do that.  Only songs go in the song boxes.  It would open a big can of worms to start putting regular spells where bard songs go.  They also rejected the idea of having a set of debuff/dot slots separate from regular buffs.  Some AEs are supposed to overwrite particular spells, so they will always land in your buff slots.<br />
<br />
I usually have enough space for 2 slots to be open.  I dump Vallon's Quickening and ranger buffs if I have more than 10 buffs.</div></div><hr />

And obviously they are such crappy programmers than they couldn't write code to accomadate for this....  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Such a harsh crime hath been commited for one to willingly go to previously established zone whose name I shall not utter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Aye, just off the top of my head there is:<br />
<br />
1)Skelle<br />
2)Acumen<br />
3)Blessing of the Frostreaver<br />
4)Spirit of Wolf or Horse<br />
<br />
**Above are all instaclicks for dispells**<br />
<br />
5)Fo7<br />
6)Po9<br />
7)BSS<br />
8)Kaza<br />
9)VoQ<br />
10)MR/CR resists<br />
11)PR/DR resists<br />
12)MR resists<br />
13) Spell haste<br />
14) Open for HoT<br />
15) Open for Debuffs<br />
<br />
  After that it is all the spell effects tossed up because the bard or SK is in the group and won't cut back, or so that when you fail to notice an MGB haste you aren't blocked from the later MGB HoT spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
  I like to keep up all 4 instaclicks due to long cast times and frequent forgetting to check them.   With how I play you can actually place &quot;Rez Effects&quot; as the first on the list since on raids I generally keep that one really fresh.   I keep all 3 resistance spells up for the new chromatic and Prismatic resist AEs.<br />
<br />
  Personally, I like to have haste and FA up as well so I can get in some procs between canni's.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Forgot to mention that after keeping Rez Effects fresh for a couple of rounds clerics begin to allow me the grace of DI and BoV which sucks up even more.  Plus I have some enchie friends who on occasion toss me a Rune, and I've even seen a spellshield pop up from time to time when I was being REALLY careless during AE fights.</div></div><hr />
