<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erlanthir</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, seen bout 10 threads bout this in the last week, here are the basics:<br />
<br />
Paineel Guards, 20+ in town and each drop bout 7pp worth o stuff and respawn by the time you get to #15, faster you kill more plat you get<br />
<br />
Halfling guards near wall in Misty, see Paineel guard setup, now you got 5 guards worth 11pp each<br />
<br />
CC Geonids, though IMO they should be left to people who can XP off of them<br />
<br />
and of course, Group in Sebilis, Velks or any other zone with good loot, get 1 drop worth 1kpp+ in a 3-4 hour session and you got the guards beat<br />
<br />
our best guestimates:<br />
<br />
Paineel = 100ishpp per hour<br />
Halflings = 100ishpp per hour<br />
Geonids = 700-1kpp per hour<br />
Getting 1 ub3r drop worth 2kpp in a 4 hour session = avg. 500pp/hour, dunno bout drop rates though and what you get<br />
<br />
but the best of course is: raid whoever drops a Fungi (8 hours as my guestimate) sell for 80kpp, plat per hour: 10kpp, u now r the rulest d00d!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harijan</div><div class="date">10-10-2002, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">TOFS wedding yeilds between 100-200pp an hour with a possible rare drop that sells for 1500-2000pp (diamond wedding band)  clear the golems then pull the bride then groom, then priest, then wedding party.  <br />
<br />
Note the wedding party has a small enough aggro range that single pulls are very easy.  <br />
<br />
Golems drops weapons that sell for 6-8pp 1-5pp 1-20gp and velium ore that sells for 3-12pp to vendors and 30-40pp in bazaar<br />
<br />
wedding party drops 2-8pp 1-20gp weapons that sell for 5-20pp (ceremonial wedding sword sells 19+pp to vendors)  <br />
<br />
Wedding couple and priest are the same.<br />
<br />
wedding party goes green at 46, golums are lite or dark blues at 46 and bride groom and preist are always light blue at 46. <br />
<br />
All are melee except bride groom and preist<br />
bride is necro<br />
Groom is SK<br />
and Priest is probably a cleric, but cast like an SK. (does not heal himself in combat)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleria</div><div class="date">10-13-2002, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IIRC, halfling guards are on Stormreaper faction, which is needed for your epic quest.  Probably easily fixable, but something to make a note of.<br />
<br />
I seem to recall Crydee mentioning farming the DE guards INSIDE Neriak, before.  But I could be mistaken.  After I hit lvl 46 tonite and start my epic dialog with Telin (/crosses fingers) I may head over there and have a looksee.  I'll let you know what I find out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hints:<br />
<br />
1) Start at the bottom, work your way up. No pulling needed, just kill one and move up to the next (I think there are 8-9 or them) Plus, you have a Terror below the first Geo at the bottom. After you kill the last one, just go back to the bottom and wait for the respawns.<br />
<br />
2) Keep a watch for trains. There is a 'Zone-out only' shortly after the last Geo. Just look at the floor, if you see what looks like a 'step', you are at the top. Spider Tunnel and Terror Tunnel are not far from the Goenid Tunnel, trains are usually taken this way.<br />
<br />
3) Don't be surprised if they do NOT agro you. Geonids are the only thing, other than Dwarfs, that won't agro you right off. But, if you keep killing them long enough (this will take awhile) you will become KOS.<br />

Killed him the other day with my 56 pally friend and he was still light blue to the pally once</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archyr</div><div class="date">10-16-2002, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just got done farming Geos today, was partnered with a warrior and a shaman, both around my level....your right about them, they do drop phat lewt for the level, I made out with 1100plat in a 7 hr period, divided 3 ways...problem is your wrong about one thing, they do hit hard...not sure if they have toughened them up or if they have broke defense/mitigation when they played with the monkies this patchm but I was taking hit from the regular geos for upwards of 90 points, this was fully level 44 shaman buffed and a 925 ac. The named hit me for around 96 max...not quite what I expected so be careful till you experiment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grogz Swiftfoot</div><div class="date">10-17-2002, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i've tried the Mammies / the Halfling Guards / the HG's and the Geo's but by far the best was the Spiders in CC with each silk selling for 10-15pp very quickly in bazaar just get stacks and stacks of them and put them on a mule if you dual box or sit up there for about 1hr. Both times I did this I sold 8 stacks within an hour in one go! Up until now this is rarely camped... unlike the Geo's. I've never timed how long I was down there farming but it didnt seem very long I'd say average drop is 2 silks per spider.<br />
<br />
First time I did this I was 49 and had a free C3 from nexus - very smooth going. Second time 50 with a little better gear but no other buffs - not so smooth with heal / med at the end of every trip up or down the tunnel. Third time I was sponsored by a 55 druid I took pity on who was tradeskilling got about 6 stacks in 2 hours and let  her skill up on them - I just wanted to know if a Ranger could quad : ) <br />
<br />
PS Also got selected gems / junk which sold in town for 1-200 pp<br />
