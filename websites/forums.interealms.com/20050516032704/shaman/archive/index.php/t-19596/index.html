<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Awesome, it's about time they did this.  I've got a pretty solid machine, and EQ lags way worse than every other game I play, even though it has vastly inferior graphics.  If they can give EQ a modern engine that makes it look better and run with less lag, I'll be a happy guy.<br />
<br />
Also, check this out: http://www.evga.com/eq/ - People are getting discounts if they need to upgrade their graphics card to support the new engine.  How awesome is that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rumor has it that they are switching from vertex animation to skin-and-bone animation.<br />
<br />
Anybody taking bets on how long before the new engine is more &quot;stable&quot; than the old one?<br />
<br />
Although I do agree that the end result is going to be worth it.  This is a HUGE change, it should be a much bigger performance boost than the &quot;new engine&quot; we got with Luclin.</div></div><hr />

You can buy those cards cheaper retail even without the coupons, or even cheaper then that online. <br />
<br />
For example the FX5900 they want $279.99 - $75 &quot;coupon&quot; without shipping<br />
<br />
Fry's Electronics Sells for $199.99 without tax<br />
Cheapest price on Pricewatch $175.00 including shipping<br />
<br />
Not such a good deal huh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually the Luclin engine did make some significant changes to framerate for me (and all of you thought in a way you may not overly notice) . The most notable change was occlusion. What this means is that if there is geometry blocking your view, then nothing else behind it is rendered. So go into PoK and stand behind a tree and face the bank and strafe out and see your framerate drop. This occlusion is conditional, as some geometry doesn't block the view frustrum, but man, over all this made a big difference.<br />
Now a lot of people didn't really notice because they thought the engine upgrade would help raids etc, which it didn't because you still would have 60+ new world models on the screen, which brings even my machine to its knees. Hopefully this more recent engine upgrade will bring things up to speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What will be the effect of this new graphics <br />
engine on people who don't upgrade thier PCs?<br />
<br />
Laglin, er, Luclin almost made me quit. I had to <br />
downgrade all the graphics options, kill the sound,<br />
etc.  I don't care how many polygons it can render,<br />
if it causes more lag it's worse. I really wish we <br />
could just use the original engine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
they introduced it in GoD beta and test  so far they ironed out hte bugs i hope</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just hope its not improved like Luclin. Im hoping for a leaner and smoother engine. Either way, ill upgrade to a new card, i been meaning too anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, because we know that when SoE puts something in beta... or the test server... that it isn't going to be buggy when it goes live.  *snicker*<br />
<br />
Yes, the &quot;discounted&quot; cards advertised there are so overpriced it's amazing how many peoople will buy it because they have some kind of retarded coupon.<br />
<br />
They say this is going to make the game unplayable for 1% of their customers.  I guess that's acceptible from a business standpoint, but I do the majority of my EQ'ing on my work computer, and since that won't work anymore... I guess I'll save myself $25 a month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Luclin was a nightmare for many folks , remember the DX8 shift that left Win95 folks gameless, well a few years on its all forgotten and the game looks good now, i hope this upgrade improves over all performace, and just maybe we will get a bear form upgrade !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sony Online Entertainment is very concerned that even a small number of our players may have issues running EverQuest. [/url]<br />
<br />
LOL OMG you talk about balls the size of Alpha Centauri.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hopefully they will actually code it with some degree of skill.  FFxi runs smoother whilst throwing a significant amount of more detail around on screen =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Will it fix the fact that I'm still, still, still poking stuff with a hammer?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I hope they will not force us to use luclin skin....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I hope they will not force us to use luclin skin....<br />
<br />
<br />
Amen to that, is it just me or do the luclin models all look like they have down syndrome? I run old world models exlusively after a couple days of luclin, even my cat rogue makes me cry cause of the way he runs in scrolled out veiw. <br />
<br />
what ever they do I hope they at least get the animations right, luclin would be at least playable if everyone didnt look like they are running the Alpha test animations as opposed to the final product.</div></div><hr />
