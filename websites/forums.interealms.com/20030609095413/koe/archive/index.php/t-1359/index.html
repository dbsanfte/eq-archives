<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aziz Al'Qadir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is the story of Petunia Swampflower. Aziz Al'Qadir saw her on the battlefield one day and she told her story:<br />
<br />
(note: this story has been translated from Troll into Common)  :)<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
When I was a little girl in Grobb, I was taught that I was a female and that the men were the ones that went to war. The woman?s place was in the home. My mother taught me and my sister how to Bake and how to Fletch for my father - a great Warrior from Grobb.<br />
<br />
Every night around the dinner table and the fires at home, my father told of wonderous lands and incredible stories of bravery and battles fought for my people.<br />
<br />
During the days, my mind was filled with wonder and with awe at what I heard and I so wanted to be apart of that history ? a part of the stories of my family. I mean ? I could cook and fletch and do other work, but I would often dream of being somewhere far off in another land fighting along side my father.<br />
<br />
Don?t get me wrong, I love my family dearly, but I could not accept a life of staying home in Grobb tending to a family as a female. I mean ? there has to be more to life than that! How boring!<br />
<br />
So ? when I was in school, I studied as hard as I could and got good grades. After school before my evening chores was my time. <br />
<br />
I was sent into the swamp to gather food for cooking for my family. While I was in the swamp, I would always watch the younger boys practice their fighting skills in the training camps on the Frogloks in the area. While I gathered my items, I would notice how they would fight, what weapon they would use, and how they easily defeated their enemies.<br />
<br />
One day, I decided that if I was going to be a part of these stories, I would have to learn how to fight too! When they were not looking, I managed to sneak away one of their rusty one handed swords and hide it in a secret place when I gathered my food for my family.<br />
<br />
I easily figured out how to maximize my time gathering food, just so I could start practicing my new skill in secret.<br />
<br />
One day, as I was hurrying to gather food for my family, I started to practice my new skills of handling a sword. I got used to the feel of a sword, the weight, the ease at which you could handle it. It was definitely thrilling! Bah ? who wanted to gather food ? this was fun! I practiced fighting stances and pretended that a nearby tree was my enemy.<br />
<br />
Little did I notice, but on the other side of that tree was a Kobold hiding. With quite a shock, he jumped out and began to attack me. I did not know what to do! I was going to go and run towards the training camps and get help, but there was not enough time. I had to face this creature without any formal training!<br />
<br />
It is amazing how in a situation like this how all that you have seen comes back to you. The Kobold came at me ? I kicked him. He took a swipe at me and missed ? I return the swipe and hit him! I hit him! I was so shocked that I could do that! It seemed so easy? He tried to swipe at me again and I turned, dodged his arm and returned the swipe ? ANOTHER HIT! Wow ? this isn?t so hard!<br />
<br />
As the fight progressed, the Kobold was making a lot of noise every time I hit him. He hit me a few times as well, but it was not that hard. I would not let up on him. I was on the offense! I, Petunia Swampflower, was not going to let a little Kobold defeat me. I wanted to fight for my people and if this little Kobold could defeat me, then I would not be good in battle at all. I had to defeat him if my dreams of going to far off places would ever come true.<br />
<br />
When the battle was over, the Kobold lie dead at my feet. I took some damage, but not as much as I thought. Oh - I was so proud!<br />
<br />
After I breathed a sigh of relief, I suddenly noticed that the Training Master was standing in the bushes watching the entire fight! Oh my god! He saw me ? he saw me with a sword! My mind was racing? I mean ? female Trolls are not supposed to wield a weapon. My heart stopped. What would my family think?<br />
<br />
Just at that moment, the Training Master winked at me and began to clap. I did not know what to do? I bowed and dropped the sword and grabbed my basket of food and ran all the way home. I prayed to Innorruk that my family would not hear of what had happened that day.<br />
<br />
That evening, the Master Trainer stopped by my house and wanted to see me. I was so frightened. He was so kind? My parents let him in and they chit-chatted a while about me. He must have known how scared I was. He mentioned to my family that when I was gathering food, a Kobold attacked me. His class was dispatched and quickly defeated the Kobold and he just wanted to check and see if I was ok.<br />
<br />
I was floored ? he made no mention of what really happened! Wow! I was so relieved? He asked to see if I was okay.<br />
<br />
When we were alone, he said that I fought bravely, and that for a female, I fought extremely well. He also dared to say that with the right training, I would be better than any of the boys in his class!<br />
<br />
What? Me? Petunia Swampflower? Better than the boys in the class? I was not used to having boys around ? it was just me and my sister and my parents. My father was always saddened that he never had a son to carry on the family name. But ? hehehe ? imagine a male Warrior with the last name of Swampflower. /giggle Not very imtimidating? :P<br />
<br />
The Master Trainer secretly offered to help me with my skills after I had finished me chores. He said he would cut his classes early to help train me in the ways of a Warrior.<br />
<br />
Wow ? would I dare to question the Master Trainer? I asked him about that? Why ? a girl training to fight was not common in Grobb. He said &quot;yes? tis true, but with proper training?&quot; He must have seen the skill that I had in fighting.<br />
<br />
My thoughts went to my daydreams. Maybe I could make a difference. Maybe I should train. Maybe I could one day stand next to my father in battle and tell the stories of his bravery!<br />
<br />
Oh ? Innoruk ? is this the plan you have for me? I immediately said yes. The Master Trainer smiled and started making plans to begin my training. He must have seen that inside this girl beat the heart of a true Warrior.<br />
<br />
The days after our secret meeting went by quickly. As I did my chores, thoughts were on fighting and tactics and weapons. One-handed blunt versus one-handed slashing. Piercing. Two-handed Slashing? Duel wielding? Riposte... I had quite a bit to learn.<br />
<br />
A few days before my first training classes started, I was gathering food where I normally go. My sister and I gather food in different places ? me vegatables and fruits, and she usually gathers the fletching supplies.<br />
<br />
During my gathering ? a Froglok jumped out of the bushes and threw my basket of vegetables into the swamp. He began to lunge at me. I quickly dodged and he fell on the ground. My thoughts went to a weapon ? but I didn?t have one! I had to fight him hand to hand... We fought round and round. Some of his attacks would hit me, and some of mine would hit him. It was a close fight. I could not lose? I fought even harder ? maximizing my size and strength over the Froglok.<br />
<br />
Just about half way through the fight ? I heard a noise from behind me. It was my sister ? Buddercup!! She began mumbling something? I saw her body shaking. With a wave of her arms ? bright lights came forth from her fingertips and the Froglok became poisoned! My sister... she poisoned a Froglok! What? Only those trained in the mystical arts of the Shaman could do all that!<br />
<br />
With astonishment I continued fighting. The Froglok was trying to get to Buddercup, but I kept taunting him to fight me. My sister kept up her incantations and the Froglok was blinded ? swinging around aimlessly. I moved in quickly and got a few free hits as hard as I could.<br />
<br />
Within minutes the Froglok was on the ground dead. Both Buddercup and I stood in amazement in front of each other. Here in front of me was my sister. I never knew she could do things like that. I mean ? she would always like to read the books of old and study writings, but I never knew she could do all that!<br />
<br />
She in turn was standing in shock in front of me? I guess she also never thought that I could stand toe to toe with a creature and fight with a precision of a Warrior.<br />
<br />
We both confided in each other about what we did and promised not to tell our parents ? especially our father. Just like me ? she was aided by a Training Master, but from the Grobb Shaman guild. It looked like the two of us had definate skills in the art of battle ? just in different areas?<br />
<br />
We both vowed to make our father proud of us in that he did not have a son. The Swampflower sisters would make their mark upon the lands of Norrath soon...<br />
<br />
Thus began a closer friendship of the sisters of the Swampflower family? As they grew in age ? so did their skills in battle...<br />
