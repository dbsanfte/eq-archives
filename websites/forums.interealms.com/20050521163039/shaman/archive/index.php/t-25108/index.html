<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I’ll share what I usually do in a group, and see if anyone can learn from it, or has some techniques that work better for them.<br />
<br />
My group makeup is usually Shaman/Mage/Warrior/Predator/Shaman/Predator.<br />
<br />
On regular pulls (Blue or better mobs) I’ll slow if it’s a named, otherwise I start with a Spectral Ward on the MT before the pull. I get agro if I do it after the encounter has engaged.<br />
<br />
If anyone else (Including me) pulls agro after we engage I’ll fire off the group ward and assist the main tank and whack at the main mob with my hammer.<br />
<br />
If it’s a group of blue mobs I’ll toss some contagion on each mob and re-ward as needed for the main tank. I don’t know the ward has faded until I see the main tank take a hit or two, so after about 3 wards I toss in an Adept 1 Minor Heal and keep whacking.<br />
<br />
If the group takes damage beyond what my group ward can heal then I’ll toss another group ward followed by a group heal. (Which usually pulls the mobs off everyone and onto me) so I’ll toss a Spectral Ward on myself and allow the MT to get the agro back.<br />
<br />
By this time the first mob should be dead and the rest are at 1-2 bubbles from the AE’s.<br />
<br />
I’ve noticed that Minor Healing Adept 1 works better and faster than Minor Arch Healing Apprentice 3, so I rarely use that.<br />
<br />
When triggering HO’s I’ll use Contagion if the mob is above 60%, or Smite Adept 1 (Over the Winter nuke Apprentice 3) to trigger my part, unless it’s a heal that’s needed, in which case I toss a Minor Healing.<br />
<br />
For maintained buffs I keep up Courage, Spirit of the Bull, Auspice on the main tank and Spiritual Seal. (If the other Shaman is with us I’ll have her cover Courage and Spiritual Seal and Auspice myself since I tank inadvertently sometimes.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My group experience has been quite varied, so I'll start with the duo setup I can do in my sleep now. :)  I regularly duo with a Monk we fight all sorts of mob arrangements, so I'll go over each.<br />
<br />
Single mob, normal difficulty (whites, yellows, and oranges) - She engages mob, I jump behind the mob and start melee, Contagion, then Spectral Ward.  Once Spectral Ward hits she does a solo HO, then I do my solo HO.  By then Contagion is about to wear off so I refresh it and reapply ward if need be.  She does another solo HO and the mob is usually dead by then as the second Contagion is just wearing off.<br />
<br />
Single mob, ^^difficulty (greens and blues, whites can be a gamble) - Ward before inc, let that one tick go for power regen, then she engages and I jump behind to melee.  I immediately Wailing Haze, Contagion, Weakness, then check Ward.  If it's good, she solo HO's, then depending on how the fight is going I might do an HO, otherwise I just keep Contagion and Ward up as she gets as many HO's in as possible.  Some blue^^'s can take a lot of mana and the white^^'s certainly do, so I don't like to spend much of it on anything but Wards, cures, debuffs, and heals.<br />
<br />
2+ mobs, normal or ^ difficulty (have yet to take on 2+ of ^^) - Basically the same as one mob except I'll ward before the pull and instead of my HO I work in a Wailing Haze on the additional mob(s).<br />
<br />
Grouping though, is a whole different story.<br />
<br />
Single healer, Grouping, normal difficulty mobs - Basically the same as how I duo.  I tend to ward after the tank takes a little damage to use some of his hitpoints and mitigation to establish aggro.  I actually have yet to use either group spell as my group members just never take damage more than one person at a time.  I don't know if that's lucky or what. :)<br />
<br />
Single healer, Grouping, ^^ mobs (whites and yellows, I have only healed an orange^^ in an emergency situation and the downtime was terrible) - I will ward before pull then Wailing Haze and Weakness almost right after engagement.  By then the ward is probably gone so I'll reward, curing and healing as necessary but saving my power for debuffs, heals, cures, and wards.<br />
<br />
Duo healer, Grouping, ^^ mobs (whites, yellows, oranges) - I make sure to work together with the other healer.  If it's a Shaman one will ward and debuff while the other covers direct heals, or one will debuff and both just direct heal.  Orange^^ mobs 20+ are pretty nasty. :)  I haven't grouped with a druid yet, but when grouped with a cleric we decided that I would debuff, both direct heal, and he would reactive heal.<br />
<br />
My sustained buffs currently are bearform, seal, bull, courage, and badger.  I ditched Auspice when I got bearform since auspice really isn't very good for 2 concentration points, especially single target only!  I suggest getting app3 and adept versions of your buffs as they get really good. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've got App3 Courage ans Seal, and as of now all my wards are Adept 1 (Group) and Adept 3 (Single)<br />
<br />
I've really noticed a huge difference in the group ward at Adept 1. I can't wait to use Single Ward Adept 3.<br />
<br />
I don't have Badger yet. Is that a group buff? I agree that 2 slots for a SINGLE target Auspice sucks, but if there's 2 shammys in the group then if I can work it in on the MT I will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here is my usual group friends<br />
Pally <br />
Bard <br />
Swashbuckler <br />
Templar <br />
Mystic <br />
Ranger <br />
<br />
Ward before pull.  and keep ward up with a few seconds between each break to let the clerics reactive heal pick up some lost HP's..  I cast Haze with Delusion qued then contagion (if its orange ^^ I also cast weakness if the mobs not to powerfull it seems they stack).  I cure everyone and templar covers everyones health..  granted the templar always complains she is doing nothing and I am doing all the work..  and I think I am not doing enough lol...  <br />
<br />
We never fight anything lower than yellow group mobs...  Me and the templar work well together we understand each others class's strength and weakness..  We can go for hours with out any med time the only time we need to med is if we get 2 or more add's...<br />
<br />
My advice for a great group strategy for a duo healer group (which is all I do) is to talk to the other healer and figure out a strategy and stick to it..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here here!  One of my favorite aspects of the game: communication!  No more autoattack, start watching tv, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1,...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/cheer<br />
<br />
Lol I roleplay a lil bit in groups as well..  When I enter a group I inform them that I get mean when someone makes a mistake and I always point it out..  and to let them know I am the new leader of the group...  lol suprisingly everyone lets me be this way and after the fact we always leave debt free and they thank me for taking charge and making them stick to a plan..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Coren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally, I use Contagion almost every fight.  It's used in triggering our HO, and it's more effective (for me) in doing so because it's got a quicker casting time AND a lower mana cost.  It usually will outdamage Smite too, even if it doesn't get to completion.<br />
<br />
I always ward *before* the fight if I can train (heh heh) my pullers to wait for it =p  The ward aggro is just too crazy, and I'm pretty careful about managing it.  I find that it's also much more effective to pepper my wards with heals; using ward as the primary heal is just way too mana-intensive for me.   I also rarely use the group ward for that reason as well, unless the situation calls for it.  Same goes for group heal;  only when clearly needed.  That's just me though!<br />
<br />
I usually ward prior to the fight, slap a slow on when the mob is around 85% or so to keep aggro on the MT.  If it's a named or a tough orange/red^^, ward might be down pretty quick, even right after the slow.  I might slap another ward on the MT so I can re-slow if resisted, or follow up with delerium/weakness.  <br />
<br />
Depending on the difficulty of the fight I'll keep the mob dot'd whenever possible, while using Cont to trigger HOs.  Stack Cold Fire line if the damage is needed.  <br />
<br />
Fire off a ward + heal when needed and it's all good!<br />
<br />
I found the class to be an unbelievable powerhouse of versatility in beta, especially in the later levels when the class continues to flesh out even more.   Since some spell lines start as late as 29, there's a lot more to come.  Group slow, the Prophetic Guard/Shield line (another +1 conc group buff to fill that empty bubble, woo!), the pet at 45, Avatar at 47...  by the end of the line I had 3 hotbars of assorted offensive/utility spells, and 4 or 5 different mastery skills I could use to keep me busy during battle depending on what was needed.   Combat is *so* fun and engaging for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Keep in mind that someone *other* than us should be starting HO's.  Our HO starter doesn't really lead to anything super special.  Most of the good group HO chains are started by a Fighter or Scout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've started using the group ward as the prebuff before engage instead of the single. It soaks up a lot more damage--think its about 800hps vs 400hps for single at lvl 21. This is particularly needed at the start of a tough fight when the tank is dealing with several mobs + all their specials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You mean Ward of Spirit? That group ward? Or is there one at 21 that's better. (Not near my spellbook atm, so I can't remember)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, wards of spirit. I'm liking it more and more.</div></div><hr />
