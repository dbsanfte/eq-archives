<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shazzog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, so that is probably an odd question.<br />
<br />
But if you needed to get 3 or 4 mobs pounding on you and only you right now what would you do?<br />
<br />
I ask because every once in a while my little rag tag band of misfits may find itself in over our head, and someone is going to die. I want that someone to be me, while the group makes a hasty advance to the rear.<br />
<br />
I am dual boxing (usually) a Epic cleric, so I really don't care about the minor XP loss my shaman will take. As long as the Cleric survives, I know we will be okay. I'd much rather my shaman died than anyone else because I know that the shaman isn't going to mind, whereas groupmember_03 may stress. Also, my shaman is going to be back up and ready to fight far faster than anyone else with a mana bar.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, Shazzog is usually able to channel a Gate through damn near anything...so if the rest of the group can make it out of Seek range, Shazzog will try to step around the quantum corner and get free. (If he doesn't make it, Duhikae knows exactly where his corpse is, and getting a /consent is no trouble at all)<br />
<br />
The problem is, it always seems to be Duhikae that the mobs beeline for...if I see it coming, I can DB to get them off of him, but I need to make sure Shazzog has their full attention when it drops (all this assumes we don't decide to duke it out, of course. Half the battle is getting the Warrior and SK that are usually with us to back away and let me sort it out)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try Tigir's.  Not sure how it affects low-health aggro, though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Tigir's insects is usually pretty good for that...  Pretty small AE range on it though, so the mobs have to be all in a nice little group.<br />
<br />
It won't pull a mob off of someone who's already been beating on it usually, but if they haven't done too much to warrant serious aggro, Tigir's will suffice.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I'm not sure - maybe strip all your buffs and canni5 to get low hp aggro. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One spell that will always give you major aggro is kraggs mending.  Hands down the biggest aggro attention draw of any shaman spell.  Of course 10 seconds isn't really right now though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds like the Cleric is getting heal aggro which will always happen on multi mob pulls. Try quick healing with the Shaman instead and have him get the aggro or chain quick heal the cleric with the Shaman if Cleric gets aggro. That should help some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tigirs actually has a -hate modifier on it.  The cleric chealing the tank (or anyone healing anyone else in the area) will take any mobs with just tigirs hate right off me and onto them.<br />
<br />
I've actually run into some problems in the last few months getting and keeping agro in situations where I cannot damage.  Tigirs/Turgurs and even spamming a spell from the Cripple line, will not keep me on top of the hate list if there is a cleric healing anywhere near me.<br />
<br />
For example, if I am killing Anival the Blade with my group in tactics.  This mob splits into 2 at somewhere between 80% and 20%.  He is unmezzable, but rootable.  At split, one of the Anivals is my responsibility.  I cast turgurs immediately on split to get agro, then run like hell... turgurs is resisted and I run ahead and cast malos, then keep trying to turgurs and root as I run.  Hopefully this happens fast because I need to debuff the other Anival that is being tanked and the Anival chasing me will kick my ass.  No matter how many spells I cast on my Anival - cripple x 10, slow x 5 (with 4 resists) or whatever he runs straight for the cleric when root breaks. <br />
<br />
Heal agro is really big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Tirgir's and sit!!<br />
<br />
Chaining Infectious Cloud might be worth trying.  For pretty fast hate anywhere chaining Drowsy builds aggro that nobody can break. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Chaining the lowest level poison dot makes for near unbreakable taunt, uselful for duoing with rogues.  For an overpull situation, you are pretty much stuck with Tigirs and Blood of Saryn to try to get instant aggro.<br />
<br />
The cleric can probably get instant multimob taunt with that group CH spell that no one uses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Canni 5 to get low health aggro :P<br />
<br />
<br />
  I'd say on the multipulls you should try having shammie heal himself for a while and use the cleric to root a couple mobs.  THEN heal with cleric and start slowing stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Of course, that means you need enough hp on the shammie to tank em while the cleric gets around to rooting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I usually use Bane of Knife because of the DD of 150 that is absent with Saryn.  Tigirs I agree would be good to open with, then bane em asap.  One baned, I don't believe you will lose aggro.  At least I never have.<br />
<br />
And one other small suggestion, use the elixir line on your cleric rather than CH spells, much lower aggro overall and you can spam smaller heals knowing that they have a  massive regen running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Load the 39 slow and the 51 both, no recast time. Despite tigir's hate adjustment it still works for me when I use it for aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Slowing any mob not being currently tanked and sitting right after ussually works well to pull the heat off the main tank.  Cripple works well too.  I've found that if you dont land Tigs with in say 2-3 seconds of the main tank getting agro will cause the adds to not attack you and stay on the main tank.  So in order to get tigs to work for you it needs to be used before very much meele damage agro stacks up on the primary mob as it tigs agro with the hate modifiers is not near as deadly as it once was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">low level poison dot is pretty low agro, I remember duo with rogue and try save mana to hold agro by use low level dot/debuff, but it doesn't work well and require 3x more cast to hold same agro as 1 dot/cripple<br />
<br />
agro from Tigirs(AE slow) is pretty low since it have neg agro build in it, plus longer cast/recast time time<br />
<br />
blood/bane/cripple/slow is our best agro, but single target only and dot have long cast time<br />
<br />
lvl62 fast heal is best in this situation, it save cleric at same time while get agro from multi mob, plus you should mem it all time ready to use it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For grabbing a group of mobs ASAP off the cleric, nothing beats chain-healing with the shaman. If you've lost agro with the latter it will almost certainly be due to healing, so grab it back the same way by blasting out the fast heals on the cleric (thereby also keeping them alive). If it's looking bleak and the cleric's HP is falling faster than hyou can heal, sitting is always worth a go. It's like candy to a kid if you've got some heal agro of your own and you sit down near an annoyed mob. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Get hold of Time's Antithesis :)<br />
<br />
Virulent Paralysis works wonders on most ogres in tactics for rooting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Drachen183</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Insidious Decay works great, fast cast and nice aggro...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">cast tnargs on cleric once or twice and sit...you should pull aggro as long as cleric is over 20% hp when you sit..although you will probably lose the aggro when you stand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Tnargs on the person with aggro. No doubt, at all, slow is single target only, tigirs doesnt draw aggro and too long to cast. Used Tnargs on wizzy last night to make sure he could get evac off, worked like a charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Tainted Breath - lvl 9 poisen dot.  2.1 sec cast time 40 mana cost.  Chain it on multiple mobs for aggro.  I use BoN for aggro, but no way I'm chaining that.  In LDoN dungeons I keep the 51 and 39 lvl slows up, but a wipe happens in the first 6 seconds of a multi-pull (how you handle it, targeting, MA effectiveness, healer AFK ...) and although a shaman slow will SLOW TIME (KIDDING!) it's too slow to cast.  TB will secure some substantial aggro (similar to BoN) pretty fast.  If you're fighting summoning mobs TB likely won't do enough damage to secure a summons in case you want to train away from your party (please be courteous to others when employing this tactic as the whiner you kill might be me;)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Group of mobs beating on the cleric: Heal the cleric.<br />
<br />
Single mob you want glued on you (for whatever reason): Spam Disempower. All the aggro you could ever want (and sometimes more) fine-tuned and virtually free at high levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd blast heal whoever they're hitting, and sit, that should get them all assuming they don't have too much agro built up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">chain casting tnargs with spell haste = win</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tigirs &amp; then sit ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The cleric is getting the aggro from all the adds by healing. You pull it off him by healing him. Or, even better, throw that first quick heal on the puller or tank with the shaman, not the cleric. Then the mobs all beeline for the shaman in the first place, and not the cleric.  I would think a quick Tigir's on the initial pull, if the mobs are bunched, followed by spam healing either thank puller/tank/cleric (whoever is hurt) is the way to go. Healing is great for &quot;AE&quot; aggro'ing because you don't have to worry about the AE size, like on Tigir's. Any nearby mobs will be mad at you for healing... as you well know, having played a cleric.</div></div><hr />
