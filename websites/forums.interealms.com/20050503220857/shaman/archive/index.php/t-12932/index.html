<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm trying to get my guild into (and interested) in Lord Inquisitor Seru.  Also trying to get a key.  Anyway, i have some questions for you more experienced in this matter.<br />
<br />
1) Reports are obviously rare and the hold up on keys....how many clearings of the top floor should i expect to get one single report?  (i recently cleared hand 10 times in a row with no report)<br />
<br />
2) Are the reports all equally rare, or is one rarer than another?<br />
<br />
3) Can i use one charge of the key and drag corpses through the locked door assuming i ever get all 4 reports - and if so, if this necro summons or using group member to /as /corpse?<br />
<br />
4) Do reports drop more commonly inside the arx itself (someone told me this, just trying to find out if it's true)?<br />
<br />
5) Assuming both a minimally baned and largely baned melee force, how long will the fight most likely take?<br />
<br />
Getting a little discouraged over this, but i will and want to do it, as i don't like missing content due to lazyness (i've done VP, ST and guild is slowly, but consistently getting ready for emp/VT/IA......for completness i'd like to hit Seru at least once, and hey, the loot is still good loot).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any clarification on these questions, or any other suggestions to help get my guild in there and ready.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, reports are that rare, although they can be streaky.<br />
<br />
2) Are the reports all equally rare, or is one rarer than another?<br />
<br />
From my experience, reports from each house are equally rare.  <br />
<br />
3) Can i use one charge of the key and drag corpses through the locked door assuming i ever get all 4 reports - and if so, if this necro summons or using group member to /as /corpse?<br />
<br />
Arx key has unlimited charges.  You cannot drag corpses to the arx since the effect is a teleport of a single group into the arx.<br />
<br />
4) Do reports drop more commonly inside the arx itself (someone told me this, just trying to find out if it's true)?<br />
<br />
Mobs in the arx drop only shoulder reports, but drop them fairly often.<br />
<br />
5) Assuming both a minimally baned and largely baned melee force, how long will the fight most likely take?<br />
<br />
Never been with a minimally baned force.  Encounter with Seru lasts about 15 mins or so for our guild.<br />
<br />

Seru's loot is comparable to stuff that drops from Emperor and VT.  He also drops ancient spells.  However, clearing the houses to get reports is tedious, as is making bane weapons.  Doing minibosses to get shards can also be tedious, although they drop some decent stuff, including a silk bridle.  Our guild focussed on prepping for Seru for several months, and the payoff was worth it.  It tested our commitment to each other and our will to succeed.  Both the loot and experiences we had prepared us for greater things.  Personally, completing the seru earring quest was one of the highllights of my long eq career, second only to getting my epic.  It taught me what a great guild I was privledged to be a member of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gardeltron hit the nail on the head pretty much.<br />
<br />
One minor correction though, you CAN corpse through the wall and drag people into the arx, IF you leave your body in the correct spot outside and corpse from the right spot inside.<br />
<br />
It's far easier just to port 5 people in at a time, gate out, and port another 5 in at a time though. Since they made the key with unlimited charges facilitating this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or can use the Arx port and take a mage and call of the hero everyone else.<br />
<br />
As for seru, i think our first kill we had like 8-10 bane weapons it took a while :) but not super hard.  His DPS isnt giant so with a decent tank and a cheal chain can keep going indefently.  The limiting factor is healing the melees that get AEd, i guess thats one of the bonus of less baneweapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&gt; Or can use the Arx port and take a mage and call of the hero everyone else.<br />
<br />
I didn't think that worked?<br />
<br />
Anyway, on our first attempt we had around 10 banes and it was like a 30 minuite fight. It was pretty in control, with like 6-9 non baned outside dealing with adds/repops and the rest inside. I hate that AE stun thing those mobs do. That can cause more grief than seru.<br />
<br />
Loot is very worth it too. Much easier access than VT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't think you can CoH or Corpse Summon inside the arx, you couldn't before at least, always got some message like &quot;magic in this area prevents this spell&quot; or something.<br />
<br />
) Reports are obviously rare and the hold up on keys<br />
<br />
You don't need the reports to get a key.  Go reread the quest spoiler and you will see why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Or can use the Arx port and take a mage and call of the hero everyone else.<br />
<br />
I'm almost positive you can't do this, since you can't coth inside the arx.<br />
<br />
Didn't know about the /corpse trick.  Sounds like an exploit to me.<br />
<br />
And Jaradis is right, you don't need reports to get into the arx, just the shards from each house's miniboss.  The last thing I needed to get my earring was a report, even though I had the arx key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SO will getting my Arx key early make it harder to get the earring (ie, will I need the 4 shards AGAIN?) I am about to go re-read the walkthrough, have 1 report and 2 shards.<br />
<br />
<br />
  And just so that I add something useful to this post, at 60 I was able to solo any non-dual wield Report dropper (generally that limited me to 1 or 2 kills per patch outside of Hand, but I could do almost all of hand as shields are common there)<br />
<br />
  Now at 65, I can take out any and all report droppers, my favorite is heart atm.   I have hand from my earlier solo'ing, and if I can get the key then I plan to get Shoulder inside the arx, so that leaves Heart (currently working on) and Eye (which last shard put me to KOS with... so I gotta go faction a bit to solo there again).<br />
<br />
<br />
  BTW, exp here for me solo is fairly comperably to PoV/PoS, and less competition for the spawns, plus better stats on my charm :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">may be right about the COTH, i hate that zone with such a passion i dont totatly pay attetion till get to seru himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We did Seru with Zero Baneweps on our first attemp and it went well! Had a 60ish Raidforce if i remember and killed him with nukes/dots. MT had a BoC and some other kind of non aggro proc wep! Keep your Wizzies from overnuking or youre probably dead!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Seru's loot is comparable to stuff that drops from Emperor and VT<br />
- I disagree. Shawl of Awakenings and Koadic's Robe are by far better loot than anything Seru drops. Then there is Caen's Staff, Acryla sword, Envenomed Mocassins and of course rifts for VT. Those alone are far better than anything Seru drops.<br />
<br />
Seru has a nice FT5 ring, a nice 2H sword and that's about it. Veil is ok but Blood of Ssraeshza drops an almost identical one, and earring is a PITA to complete, not to mention once your melee are in VT it's going to get upgraded fast.<br />
<br />
Rest of his loot is nice (100 HP and stuff) but still lacks the effects on emperor loot (haste, Koadic's buff or lifetap on weapons). <br />
<br />
Since Seru loot lacks focus effects and Vengeance (other than plate BP), VT loot blows it away, no contest.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">100hps/100mana (cept BP is more) on every item, can't go wrong there.<br />
Now if only they made his Sword of Truth worth something.  :D<br />
<br />
You can't CoH or summon corpse spell inside, you can drag through a wall though if you want. You also can pull Seru to the zoneline, but it's all just a matter of what you feel like doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">SO will getting my Arx key early make it harder to get the earring (ie, will I need the 4 shards AGAIN?) <br />
<br />
No, when you turn in shards you get the key and an insignia.  You turn in the earring you get from reports plus the insignia to get the the next to last earring, then turn that earring in with Seru's head to get the final earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, read through the text on the quest and everything, then went and made my key tonight.   mapped out the 3rd floor maze as well.<br />
<br />
  Now my big question is, this key soulbound?   If it is, that rocks, I can port out of ANYWHERE even if on a CR then (and take my group).   If not, then I may want to avoid solo'ing in the arx :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks everyone for the replies.  I hit my head on my desk a few times when i re-read info on alla's and very clearly saw why i didn't need the reports for key /bonk Ogre.  Unfortunately in my report camping, the one report that has dropped that i looted was the shoulder one, heh.  Oh well, get the key and solo for components for bane weapons while i continue to work my tradeskills....shouldn't be that hard to get the guild to raid the zone once for the key and then again for seru himself, i hope :)</div></div><hr />
