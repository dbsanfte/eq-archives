<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Terar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 57 Shammy and I group with a 51 Bard and 51 Ranger.  Was wondering on the best dundeon for us to Xp in on Sullon Zek.  We are of Good Deity.  Any suggestions of indoor and outdoor dungeons for us to go will be grealty appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i like how you ask a community which has almost absolutely no experience on sullon.  the answers should be blatantly obvious.  old world dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Terar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well where else am I supposed to ask?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>winuvyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ter, you have every right to post your question because this IS a forum and, yes, Sullon Zek'ers do read it. Ignore Howler....he and all his bluebie counterparts would be OWNED on SZ. They just don't realize how much more advanced a player's gameskills become in PVP. I'm a 2-year bluebie who turned pvp and now have a 51 ranger and 30 druid (both good--GO-GO Good team). I've never had more fun and my game has never been better. PVP brings out aspects of the game that I never even considered on the blue servers.</div></div><hr />

hijacker! Back to the original question, I would check out Howling Stones (aka Charasis), Torigan mines, Acrylica, and Sebilis possibly. The first 3 are pretty empty zones for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">which is why i have a 58 ranger in bp...but that's besides the point.<br />
<br />
if i say it's obvious, it's because the old world is completely unused anymore by either neuts or evils (can you really see ToW going to seb for anything but bard epics...even that might be sketchy).  anybody who has played on sz into their 50's should be aware of that by now.<br />
<br />
pick any zone that has a zem and you're good to go.  seb, howling stones, hell, even the hole might be ok for you all.  most of these spots were forced on goodies before luclin, so i see no reason why you wouldn't just fall back on them now.<br />
<br />
winuvyen, your elitist comments about how i am a bluebi are the reason most people never choose to go red.  and quite frankly, if you only have a 51 ranger and a 30 druid on sullon, it means you've been there for all of what, a month and a half?  wow, lots of super pvp experience under your belt greifing the greenies.  way to go champ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>winuvyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Howler, sorry bout the bluebie comment..I have met you on Sullon and actually you are a decent fellow. I just get tired of all the anti-pvp comments I hear and it seemed you were taking a shot at him. <br />
As far as my time on SZ...well, let's just say I have been there much longer than a month and, no, I don't typically kill greenies.....unless of course they talk trash or get in my way. =P<br />

Pardon the Hijack.</div></div><hr />
