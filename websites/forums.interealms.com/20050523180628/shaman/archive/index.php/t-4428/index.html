<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taldaorfa Spiritcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First i would like to say hi,  I have been looking at board topics for a while but decided to join the community!  :) <br />
<br />
My question is, at the char creation I made what I feel to be a horrible mistake, and dumped a majority of my points into Stamina rather than wisdom.  Now I feel bound to some of my wis gear,  in which higher AC could go into those slots (I use a crystalline belt and a prayer cloth of tunare,  which make me feel very much so like a druid heh, as well as Gatorscale Legs).<br />
<br />
Should i recreate my shaman?  It seemed I was doing fine until I found myself running OOM often in fights with 3-4 Mobs in HHK, and using canni furiously when a caster was being beat on and I was OOM.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated :) :) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wish I had made that  mistake</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, ya didn't leave very much info about your setups and all of that, so it makes it hard to give you too much advice. However, i can tell you what my base stats were. I have a base wisdom of 86 and my other points went into dex and agi. I was created in March of 99. I am currently level 60 with 52AA points and doing quite well hehe. <br />
<br />
So, even if you are down at as low of a base wisdom as I am, you can still be a very funcional shaman. At least the points that you put into something else wound up in stamina, and ThAT is another very useful stat for shaman. Don't fret you will be ok :)  You are just in that stinky period of a shamans life between 24 and 34 where everything feels like you aren't adequate. Make sure you are using cannibalize to its full advantage as well. Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Brilliant idea Talda.  Don't worry about wis.  You will need all the hp you can get once you start cannibalizing.  Some of us put our extra points into str.  (/em whistles innocently)  In fact, for some of us, 86 innate wis would be amazing indeed.<br />
<br />
Now, if you were a druid, I'd say reroll!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When you are low level, wisdom will help you more than HP and stamina will.  Once you get out of your low levels (shouldn't take long nowadays) you'll be glad you have that extra STA, though.  Wisdom is very easy to come by as a high-level shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wish I'd dumped as many points as possible into Stamina, but it's a little late now :-(<br />
<br />
My guess is any difficulties you're having are due to your level (you say you're fighting in Highhold) and not your stats. Early levels stink for a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah Talda, the better your rolled stats are for the end game, such as having most points in stamina, the harder it is in the earlier levels.  Some folks on this board might have a shaman twink and not understand how hard it is early on with the gear you get by roughing it.  Having 10 extra hp at level 20 because you put twenty points into stamina won't help as much as 20 points in wisdom at 20.  HOLD OUT!  Wisdom goes hand in hand with most of our high end gear.  I know most high enders have to fight wisdom off with a stick.  In the end, people wish they had put points into stamina because it is a much harder stat to raise with gear as a shaman.<br />
<br />
As far as being bound to your wisdom gear... you are and don't worry about it.  We on the board don't make fun of up and comers wearing wisdom gear (well most of us don't), we tend to make fun of the level 50+ shaman that have as much AC as you do because they're wearing platinum armbands and veils still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I put a good chunk of my points into Sta. My wis is pretty low to start but with some unobtrusive gear (and some creative inventory management) I hover around 150 wis for my ogre shammy. Admittedly i need to work on my AC and HP quite a bit but I have several slots that have crap in em (lol I must be the only shammy on Sullon Zek using leather shoulder pads at 39 ;) I know I know I am just to lazy to get something new) so I can get some good ac/hp gear without sacrificing any wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just playing with Magelo, it took me about two days and finally giving up and putting 5 points into AAXP STA to get to 205 STA with what my guild is/will be capable of doing for my Shaman.<br />
<br />
I do have to admit, I'm starting to dig my Shaman a lot more than I do my Paladin. I might end up botting him and letting her do all the fun stuff ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I asked myself that questions for a year or so, having a barbarian with 90 base wis (but oh so charming, why did they highlight that green?). By now I'm a wisdom shaman (by board standards) and have trouble to find good shaman gear without more wis :).  After 50 you can correct any birth mistakes (but for being an ugly green troll).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have to admit, I was a wis shaman with a very low wis up until around level 40.  I had RL friends (2 of which played druids, none of which played shamans) tell me that wis was all I needed to worry about.  Fortunately, I had the foresight to do the totemic quests despite my friends' objections. :)<br />
I had a low AC and mid-range wis when I first found The Crucible.  Now, at 51, I've finally ditched the totemic for better stuff.  My wis runs at around 163, and until 54, it's gonna be a pain, but I'm sure Canni3 will make everything better.  Yeah, I was too lazy to quest Canni2.  The problem isn't as much running oom, it's just not getting enough mana back fast enough to be able to keep up!<br />
<br />
Of course, it'd be worse as a shaman with over 200 wis.  I was there once.  Don't wanna be back there again unless I've got 1k AC and 2k hp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I also feel that I am a WIS shaman.  Can Anyone give me advice on what to change out.  I am in the procedd of getting a jaded Vel ring and a 6 Ac 65 HP ring.  I am trying to get jarsath or jaundiced legs also.  Any help will be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just add a double quotation mark after the '310494' and it should work, Edarb :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Edarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks House</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Taldaorfa Spiritcaller</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow, I thought I did it wrong and I did it right :p<br />
<br />
thanks everyone so much for all your help :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I made the same mistake Talda, cept I put my points into dex i think and maybe agil, still not sure.  I was convinced at the time that shaman was a melee class with kewl nifty spells too!  Also I'd never played those pen and paper games that so many of these people have.  <br />
I had 90 base wis to start my shaman's life, and BOY was it ruff!!  We are talking days before kunark when wisdom gear cost a ton and was generally considered to be the best gear for a shaman at that time!  (Ok this was way back! haha)<br />
I loved tanking stuff tho, still do, and I refused to go all wis like my druid pal who started his druid and played with me.  I had a much smaller mana pool most of the time, and it was lvl 25 before I reached the 140 wis mark, due to creative questing.  Meanwhile I had kept defense maxed and my AC at a reasonable level using totemic armor (even had the bp and hat!).  <br />
<br />
I wore totemic and my wis fluxuated around 150ish to 160 until level 53 or so when upgrades started to happen.  I was pretty competent at this level however, and was wearing Jaundiced Bone from the new kunark expansion!  Ah, I still remember paying 6k for my JB arms and thinking it was a steal!  Nowadays you can't GIVE those away heehee.  I was especially pleased with the JBB i managed to buy for 12k of my hard won platinum.  <br />
<br />
Nowadays I could easily have 255 wis with the gear I have merely banked. . . but I hover around 200-220 mark depending on which gear I upgrade.  Aktunka also messed his stats and i DARE you to check out his magelo!  <br />
<br />
Point is, you'll be a good or lousy shaman depending on how you play, not what you picked at character selection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kraum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">heh back in 1999 when i didnt have a clue ( i dont think i was the only one either) I believe i put the majority of my points into CHA.. you can laugh now.. my base wis is 80 naked with gear on no bear form its 213 but its all moot cause there are so many items that have incredible wis and sta and ac out there now.  But yes hp &gt; all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&lt;--- very strong shaman<br />
<br />
7 wasted points into str!  That would be 21 hitpoints!  I wish they gave you a chance to redistribute your points as a one time only quest once you finally have a clue what the heck is going on with this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think that Gloriana spent too many points in cup size! =P</div></div><hr />
